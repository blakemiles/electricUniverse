welcome to space news from the electric universe brought to you by the thunderbolts project at Thunderbolts dot info according to a new report scientists are now on the verge of deciphering the mystery of dark matter researchers working with the data from the Planck satellite have detected an intense form of radiation called synchrotron radiation from the center of the Milky Way galaxy scientists at the Niels Bohr Institute have interpreted these radiation emissions as evidence of dark matter professor pavel new Celski says of the discovery we know from theoretical predictions that the concentration of dark matter particles around the center of galaxies is very high and we have a strong argument they can collide there and in the collision electrons and positrons are formed these electrons and positrons start to rotate around the magnetic field at the center of the galaxy and in doing so produced this very unusual synchrotron radiation but is this really a plausible explanation for synchrotron radiation in space astrophysicists are fun from observation that various results that they that they come up with demand that would be more matter in galaxies for example than they actually observe and so they postulate Dark Matter to allow their results to all be explained by gravitation alone in a sense you could say that before it was observed Uranus was dark matter because its position was postulated purely by gravitational theory and then they find it so before it was find it was in a sense dark matter but that they're taking this to ridiculous extremes now but it's the same sort of argument that they're using here we've got some results we need more actual matter to explain them so it it must be there it's just that we can't see it you can't see dark matter dark matter is invisible and it's invented to save theory so wherever they see something that doesn't fit the theory they can always put some dark matter there and then they'll make the theory fit what they see so dark matter is kind of a blank check that they can write for it whenever the theory fails they can write a check for dark matter and then they'll say oh this this proves that there is there's a circularity to it that we prove the existence of dark matter because we assumed it was where it'd be emissions of synchrotron radiation have long posed an unsolved mystery for mainstream astrophysicists the mystery resides in the spectacular acceleration of charged particles beyond anything astronomers had anticipated in space synchrotron radiation is basically radiation that's given off by charged particles that are spiraling in a magnetic field and technically it refers to x-rays from products that are moving near the speed of light but if you have particles that are moving much less than the speed of light they still give off radiation it's just a de loarre energy level so it's radio instead of sree the problem astrophysicists have is that they have this to do against electricity and space and so in order to get the charged particles to spiral in the magnetic fields they have to do it with some mechanical means which is usually collisions so they metaphorically they bang rocks together to get electricity if if it were up to them I guess they would light streetlights with by falling rocks astrophysicists mostly just ignore the synchrotron radiation once in a while they'll admit it like this time when oh there's synchrotron radiation at the core of the Milky Way wonder how many rocks reacted banging together the discovery of synchrotron radiation fulfilled the prediction of plasma physicist Hannes Alfven as early as 1950 Alphen claimed that electric currents moving inward along the arms of the Milky Way would generate stupendous electric discharge and synchrotron radiation would be its defining signature alvin's first insight back and I guess in the 20s was that plasma responds to magnetic fields and he had this idea that if you have a perfect conductor the magnetic field will become frozen into it and so astronomers assumed that any plasma in space will be a perfect conductor and the magnetic field is frozen in and any charge separation will be immediately canceled when the charges come back together so you can't have sustained electric fields in space well al faying repudiated that is further experiments showed that plasma isn't a perfect conductor and it has a small resistance and it does sustain electric fields the experiments since then and in space have shown that plasma is extensively electrically active if especially if you have two clouds of plasma moving relative to each other they will induce electric fields and the electric currents in each other so then you get all the Effects of electrified plasma berkland

brought to the forefront in the researches of all astrophysicists they've got to be alongside gravitation if you like they've got to realized that yes gravitation that counts for a lot and tells us a lot but what about these electromagnetic forces these ideas have been around we've got the work of berkland followed up by our plane and then again in more modern times by Antony perhaps where they've got all this theory they've got all these experiments to back it up not mathematical theory just they've got experience to back it up this stuff has to come through I'm not saying gravitation doesn't have a role to play but they're not going to explain things if they don't bring in the electromagnetic force for continuous updates on space news from the electric universe stay tuned to Thunderbolts

Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info In recent years, one of the great shocks in space science has been the discovery of just how incredible the electromagnetic energies are at the gas giant Jupiter. Astronomers had long known that Jupiter possesses an extensive and powerful magnetic field, as well as tremendous X-ray aurorae, super-fast winds, and a mysterious, enduring anticyclonic storm in the region called the Great Red Spot. However, NASA's Juno mission has shattered all conventional ideas about the mechanisms behind these phenomena. NASA scientists have acknowledged that the accepted model of a dynamo deep within the planet, producing its magnetic field, cannot explain what they've actually discovered. Likewise, according to the Juno papers, the data on Juno's atmosphere, ionosphere, and interior has provided nothing but surprises. Today, in part two of his 10-part series Eye of the Storm, author Andrew Hall explores the question, what does the electrical Jovian environment tell us about the atmospheric and weather phenomena throughout the solar system, including on Earth? Jupiter is our largest neighbor and generates the biggest electromagnetic field in the solar system except for the Sun. It has a thick, turbulent atmosphere with swirling storms producing winds of supersonic speed, and lightning arcs that dwarf the puny sparks we have on Earth. So right off the bat, we see attributes of electrical processes like the processes we are exploring in Earth's primordial past. Nothing exemplifies the electrical nature of Jupiter more than its bands of counter-flowing winds and the giant swirl known as The Great Red Spot. Electric winds occur when an electric field potential exists that motivates ionic species in the air to move. Positive ionic species are drawn in one direction, and negative ions and free electrons are drawn in the opposite direction, as dictated by the polarity of the electric field. The ions may be only a small percentage of the bulk mass of air, but electrically they form a current ― moving charge that will drag neutral molecules with it. The result of these opposing motions are unipolar winds. A positive wind from one direction and a negative wind from the other attracted to or pushed away from the "electrodes" in the circuit. If the wind occurs in the atmosphere surrounding a planet, the winds will circumnavigate the globe in alternating bands in a direction transverse to the magnetic polarity of the planet. This is the effect on display in Jupiter's atmosphere as well as other planets in our solar system with strong electric fields. The "electrodes" are nodal regions where current flows through the planet's atmospheric sheath and crust. That's why they appear at certain latitudes. As these electrodes' unipolar winds mix in whirlwinds, the mixing of ions results in a plasma, where, with much condensation, violent arcing, and swirling, they electrically adhere to form molecular bonds and precipitate. This is what we know as a storm. The primary electrodes in a planetary circuit are around the magnetic poles, and the evidence of the electric field strength is in the glow-mode currents called aurora. Another type of "electrode" is an accumulation of charge density from volcanic eruption, where discharges internal to the crust expel huge volumes of charged pyroclastic dust into the atmosphere and spread hot magma across the land. Another "electrode" is where the planet's electromagnetic field produces regions of high flux from cosmic rays, driven by stellar winds or perhaps some other motivating force. Charged particles spiral down magnetic lines of flux and charge the crustal surface creating electrode spots. In every case, discharge follows the geometry of a plasmoid Earth, for the "Blue Marble" we live on is just a bubble, or drop of matter encapsulated in an electric circuit. The plasmoid circuit is what matters ― it's what controls everything ― and it flows through the atmosphere and crust to create the capacitance that motivates weather, earthquakes, and volcanoes. Uni-polar winds are drawn to the electrode spots like water flows to an open drain. Only a solid crustal surface provides no hole to sink into. The winds are constrained by the vacuum of space above and the solid crust (or ocean) below. They circulate in induced vortex currents to mix in a plasma storm, recombining charged species into neutral matter that rains to the surface. Storms are evidence of currents induced by capacitance in the layers of atmosphere and crust of the planet. It doesn't matter if it's Earth, Jupiter, or an exoplanet yet to be discovered. A planet with an active electromagnetic field will form a spherical layer of capacitance in its atmosphere and crust through which loops of magnetic flux will induce ring currents to flow transversely through those layers. A ring current is the simplest form of circuit. In Nature, where there are no insulating layers to guide current flow, ring currents form naturally. Unlike a Birkeland current in space, where current flows from one body to another along the electric field between them, a ring current simply circulates on itself. Ring currents rule the universe, not gravity. It's because magnetic fields are closed fields ― they form closed loops between poles, and the magnetic flux induces current to flow along these loops. The induced current follows to form ring currents. Nature can't stop itself forming ring currents. They exist at the atomic level, the molecular level, the planetary level, the stellar level, and the Galactic level of our cosmos. Because Earth's ring currents have no end, they are infinitely long conductors that induce current from the solar wind. Because they are infinitely long, there is no limit to the current they can induce. The currents form a winding that, like a transformer inside the Earth, raises potential in the circuit. The result is an internal electric field that's in opposition to the ambient electric field of the solar system. Earth's crust and atmosphere is the 'almost' neutral boundary ― the dielectric plates between the internal and external fields that seek a charge balance. Any change in the external field causes a response internally, because the internal electric field acts like a mirror, reflecting a feedback response. The mirroring effect is caused by capacitance because if charge builds on one plate of a capacitor, the other plate responds by building an equal and opposite charge. So change takes place both internally and externally, and the neutral balance between ― where we live ― is disrupted, until the internal and external fields come back to equilibrium. Of course, there's never an equilibrium. Because Earth is a sphere, each capacitor plate of the sphere has a bigger area, as a function of radius, so there can never be two layers with equal charge density across equal areas. Layers of Earth and atmosphere are always building charge and discharging. It's physically impossible not to. This is the wisdom of the ancients, which today we confuse with mysticism: "As above, so below" has a simple, classical scientific meaning. It refers to the capacitance in Earth's circuit and the feedback (or reflection) inside the Earth caused by whatever is going on in the solar system. To see this in action, one need only look at the extremely intense current loops that form on the Sun. These are called coronal loops and are produced by the same kind of capacitance in the circuitry that causes weather on Jupiter and Earth. The difference isn't in the circuitry, the difference is in the plasma state the atmospheres are in. The Sun is almost completely ionized, whereas Earth and Jupiter have partial plasma atmospheres. The ionized atmosphere of the Sun produces ray-gun like currents, whereas partial plasma atmospheres like Earth and Jupiter produce more diffuse hydrodynamic currents we see as wind and clouds. The ring currents are currents of excess charge the solar circuit is shedding. As in the Sun, the interior Earth layers have less area, so as charge accumulates by induction, it develops greater charge density in the ground and must shed current outward through the atmosphere. In a storm on Earth, the ambient electric field reverses, from a 200 kilovolt "clear weather" current flowing outward, to a 500 Megavolt current aimed at the ground. The Earth beneath a storm becomes positive to a negative sky,  as accumulated charge finds a path to discharge. Ring currents also produce a magnetic field inside them that is stronger than the magnetic field outside. Basically, it's because the geometry of a ring causes magnetic flux to disperse in a greater area outside the ring than inside. Therefore, there is such stronger magnetic flux inside the loop that induces a secondary current flow, perpendicular to the coronal loop. Current flows through the atmosphere and crust both in the vertical columns of the loops and horizontally in current induced by the loops. These currents travel through layers of atmosphere and Earth's crust. Another property of ring currents is very strange and counter-intuitive. When we look at a ring current generated in a looped wire with a battery ― generating, say, one amp, any two points in the loop will measure a current of 1 amp. But if we generate the same amount of current in the wire by induction, by passing a magnet through the ring, the current at any two points may be different, even though the sum of all current in the wire still adds to one amp. The induced current may be different where the wire's contact with magnetic field is weaker, but elsewhere in the ring the magnetic field would be diametrically stronger and generate current that makes up the difference. The result is that current density may form in one part of the ring and not in another, or in one part of the ring it may even flow backwards ― a current of opposite polarity. Coronal loops on the Sun display this. NASA imagery shows plasma bolides shooting through rings at varying speeds and sometimes even reversing direction. On Earth, current rings formed by the geomagnetic field also display this inductive behavior, developing a severe storm at one leg while doing nothing at the other. It also allows direct current inputs from induction to become alternating currents, as currents in a ring will oscillate as charge stores and discharges in the capacitance of the system. Weather forms where currents pass through the atmosphere and crust. A whirlpool of mixing plasma forms storms where current draws up channels of air and positively charged ions. Coronal loops generate winds as ionic matter follows electric fields, dragging bulk air mass with it. Ultimately, the winds form jet streams and must thread in three dimensions through the inflow and outflow, updraft and downdraft regions formed by coronal loops, like rope wound into a knot. If you look at the last image of an electromagnetic wave in a double layer, you can see, first how a double layer of charge ― a capacitor ― will produce waves of electromagnetic peak and trough, like rogue waves on the ocean. If one also includes spherical geometry, as in the capacitance of planetary circuits, then it becomes simple deduction that the geometry results in higher charge concentration inside Earth than outside and will produce these kinds of waves. It cannot "physics-wise" be otherwise. So waves like this form naturally, consistently, and unavoidably. And that results in ring currents ― coronal loops, magnetic field lines inducing current ―  call it what you like. It's electric. In part three we'll see how ring currents produce storms on Jupiter and Earth and how they progress in fractal elements from a common thunderstorm to a storm like the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. Thank you! Stay tuned for part 3 
Welcome to the Electricity of Life brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info. As bees drink sugary nectar and collect pollen for its nutrients and fat, these interactions between pollinator and plant include evolutionary adaptations to electrical science. A high school student from the future would surely mention at least two electrical interactions when describing how bees interact with flowers. As a bee flies it sheds electrons, accumulating a positive charge or electron receiving state. A voltage gradient in the air of about 100 volts for every meter up causes the petals of many flowers to accumulate a negative charge in relation to the air around them. In a manner familiar to any human who has felt static electricity on their hair, the tiny hairs on a bees' body bend slightly towards the flower. These body hairs on bees are connected to neurons especially sensitive to this interaction. When bees land, this static effect from their hairs also attracts pollen like a swiffer pad. The bee will comb her body to store this pollen more securely on regions of the back legs called the corbicula or pollen basket. The flower will still have a lower charge of electrons after this visit, for about 100 seconds for example. This decreased charge may serve as another indicator that bees use to determine which flowers have just been visited. On a different note, these tiny creatures see our shared world painted with a slightly different range of colors than we do. The vibration we perceive as red is simply too slow and wide of a waveform for their eyes to perceive. Meanwhile, they can see much faster and tighter wavelengths of vibration than most humans, which we call ultraviolet. Consider this when you see flowers that appear to our eyes to look rather simple. They may have additional features that our eyes simply do not see. Some flowers are more predominantly red because evolutionary relationships have led them to become more adapted to attracting hummingbirds or butterflies for instance. Bees are likely just one of many insects which use electrically sensitive hairs for different purposes. We simply may not allocate money and time towards the scientific study of such things. Thanks for watching. And next time you see bees in your garden or among wild flowers, consider how these creatures see the world and how they feel the electricity of life. 
This “Playing with thinking” story arc about playing with larger and faster thinking, was prompted by the realization that a Universe  of electricity and plasma is more energetic and powerful than one of gravity and gas. I’ll continue with a further insight, a Universe  composed of plasma is also more intricate. By that, I refer to theories of complexity that have been developed in recent decades. Complex evokes connotations of being complicated, of parts so interrelated as to be difficult to understand. Plasma  phenomena go a step beyond complicated. The parts are so interlaced as to be impossible to understand separately. Intricate evokes that connotation, so I’ll use that term. In this episode, we'll be playing with intricacy thinking. Plasma systems, in the sense of plasma physics, are not the only intricate systems. Biological systems are also intricate. The similarities are why Irving Langmuir, an early investigator of what had been called radiant matter, changed the name to plasma. So it shouldn't be a surprise that a changing worldview in physics would be accompanied by a changing worldview in biology. One arena of this change is the theories of evolution. The evidence gathered for Darwinian evolution has never fit well with that theory. Gradual emergence of species by way of natural selection of random mutations of genes. The fossil record, which is built uneasily on the world view of uniformitarianism, is nonetheless one of species emerging suddenly, being abundant over their existence without much variation, and suddenly becoming extinct. There are no intermediate species as uniformitarian metaphysics expects. Until complexity theory appeared, there were  few terms to describe this at a theoretical level. Now, in reflection of plasma phenomena, we  can talk of discontinuities, attractor states, emergent orders, and irreversibility. We  know much more about systems that are open and far from equilibrium. They are driven, as distinguished from inertial, and subject to threshold discontinuities. For example, the state of a plasma discharge will jump from dark mode to glow mode, to arc mode as voltage and current density increase. As those values decrease, the jumps may occur at lower values, introducing hysteresis into the equation of state. The instabilities that Tony Peratt, who is a plasma physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, has described in pulse power experiments, undergo sequences of quasi-stable steps. They evolve by suddenly changing their morphology, often from simpler forms to more complex forms with greater order. The sequences are irreversible, like frying an egg - the egg can't be unfried. That describes not only the fossil record,  but recent observations that have been ignored for lack of a theoretical framework. Here are a few examples. In the early 1700s, William Sharon, the British consul to Turkey, brought some ragwort plants from Mount Aetna back to the Oxford biological  garden. The seeds escaped and the plant, now called Oxford ragwort, spread throughout  the city. The railroad came to Oxford in 1844 and provided a bed of Mount Aetna-like gravel that ran throughout Britain. Trains provided an efficient suction mechanism to carry the seeds. The plants spread. In some cities the ragwort crossed with the  local groundsel species, despite having only 20 chromosomes to the groundsel's 40. Hybrids bred true, but were often sterile with respect to the parents, the definition of a species. Voila, instantaneous widespread speciation. In York, the Oxford ragwort hooked up with local groundsel species and produced Yorkwort. In North Wales, the meetup produced Welsh grounsell with 60 chromosomes. A species appeared in Edinburgh for a while, but died out. There are many similar stories with other plant species, which are known to be rather promiscuous, but also with animal species. Chris Thomas, a Professor of Conservation Biology at the University of York, UK, has  documented many instances of modern speciation in his book, “Inheritors of the Earth.” He claims that the rate of speciation may be keeping pace with that of extinction. Much of the increase in both seems to be adaptations to the increased mobility of  humans. As in the case of the Oxford ragwort, that mobility both deliberate and inadvertent, is introducing species to other species and habitats that they would otherwise not encounter. The interactions between species and habitats lead to jumps in preferred states, or resonances in their relationships produ- cing sudden and adaptive rearrangements of genes. The evidence to support any theory of speciation, the fossil record, is that of stepwise appearance with subsequent  fixity. This doesn't fit well with uniformitarian assumptions. In 1940  Goldschmidt, the fruit fly guy, after years of mutating the flies and getting no new species, said it out loud. He was, in today's lingo, ”cancelled”.  In 1950 Schindewolf, a respected paleontologist, said it, he was cancelled. In 1972, Gould and Eldridge said it, called it “punctuated equilibrium”,  and insisted it was still Darwinian, because “microevolution”. They  barely escaped being cancelled. The evolution wars are not really about biology. They're about faith, and fervency, and fire for heretics. From the beginning Darwin's supporters had misgivings about his theory. Thomas Huxley, called “Darwin's Bulldog” for his passionate defense of the theory, deplored the many faults with it. He  nevertheless defended it as the only scientific or naturalist proposal. Religious passions immediately dominated the controversy and alternative ideas  were sidelined. But there were alternative ideas that better fit the evidence. In 1879 Samuel Butler proposed that species undergo a self- directed development. In 1887 E.D. Cope  proposed that species design themselves. This idea was dismissed as ridiculous, apparently because it was assumed to require conscious choice. Imagine  bacteria voting to rearrange their DNA. But now we've become aware that complex systems reflexively organize in series of discontinuous forms. The evolution of plasma discharge instabilities for example. It's called emergent order, an intrinsic property of complex systems distinct from ideas of extrinsic, or imposed order such as creationism or intelligent design. The order emerges from the interaction of relationships that have preferred states, similar to the emergence of nodes in systems of interacting waves, or flower blossoms from tiny seeds. No god or intelligent designer or reified natural law for that matter, which mistakes an abstraction for a physical entity, imposes it from out- side the system of relationships. An ensemble of bodies will exhibit properties that aren't present in the individual body and that can't be reduced to simpler conditions. This  has been called “irreducible complexity”. Intrinsic attractor states and resonances will appear in the interaction of the relationships as islands of organization. In biological words,  species. In retrospect, the systems will appear to have been designed with purpose, but  in prospect they will not be predictable. A theoretical example of this is the NK model of fitness landscapes, developed by Stuart A. Kaufman and described in ”The Origins of Order”. Instead of thinking of genes as static building blocks of species, intricacy thinking will think of them dynamically in relation to other factors, epigenetic relationships and habitat interactions, for example. These relationships are far from equilibrium and are driven from one quasi-stable state to another. In view of the behavior of intricate plasma systems, we should expect attractor states in the relationships and threshold events. In biological words, stepwise adaptive speciation, where it appears that species design themselves. At the genetic level, the distinctions between species become ambiguous. In more cases than in the outright appearance of new species, hybridization results in gene mixing. The hybrid will have some characteristics of both species and it may still be fertile, or have reduced fertility with the parents. It will be classified as the variety instead of a new  species. Still, the characteristics exhibited will be specific, not intermediate or random. The critical difference lies in the difference of thinking between gene mixing and relationship interactions. Nor is stepwise speciation itself a uniform process. There apparently have been several episodes of mass extinction followed by mass speciation. Although here, one must keep in mind  the likely scrambling of the conventional fossil record, once global electrical disruptions are introduced. Species that live side by side and died en masse in a global tsunami, could be sorted in flowing sediment into separate strata, along with radiometric-altered minerals, and after deposition uniformitarian presumptions would place them millions of years apart. A more detailed description of such a process was covered in the previous episode  of this story arc, “Playing with Power Thinking”. The actual sequence of events could be quite  different. Possibly all conforming geological strata were deposited in a short  time during one global cataclysm. An unconformity would mark the beginning of the next cataclysm. Instead of millions of years of gradual horizontal accumulation of strata, followed by millions of years of tectonic distortion, geological formations could represent sudden transient disruptions between longer periods of relative tranquility that would leave few traces. Uniformitarian presumptions may be interpreting the geological and fossil record exactly in the opposite way it formed. This kind of wholesale replacement of fundamental assumptions when a worldview changes, is characteristic. Remember  how the conceptual landscape was overturned when Newtonian  dynamics replaced Ptolemaic kinematics. Previously accepted knowledge is discarded and no longer considered to be knowledge. Intricacy thinking is not just added on to previous thinking, it replaces much of it. Just as the Electric Universe model of cosmology replaces the standard model, larger, faster and more intricate thinking will replace the standard thinking in other scientific disciplines. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info What lies at the center of our galaxy? For many decades, astrophysicists have told us that at the core of the Milky Way and 98% of all galaxies is a supermassive black hole, a hypothetical "region of space-time" whose gravitational effects are so colossal that nothing, not even light can escape. Scientists believe that supermassive black holes explain the stupendous energies and mass measured at galactic cores and many fantastic electromagnetic phenomena including powerful galactic jets and X-ray emissions are attributed to black holes' influences. In fact, for many years scientific and educational literature have presented the existence of black holes as a matter of settled science and science media routinely report truly amazing claims about black holes with no skepticism. Of course, a recent example in 2016, was the media firestorm resulting from the pronounced detection of gravitational waves which was supposedly produced by two colliding black holes a billion years ago. Subsequent, such claims have been met with an equal absence of media scrutiny. However, we note that a recent scientific paper entitled "On the Signal Processing Operations in LIGO signals" should raise serious questions about the validity of the gravitational waves claims. The abstract of the paper authored by UC Berkeley's Akhila Raman states that the first five reported gravitational waves events are, "...very weak signals whose amplitude does not rise significantly during the gravitational waves event, and they are indistinguishable from non-stationary detector noise." A link to the article may be found in the description box of this video. Unfortunately, this paper has not received a fraction of the media attention that the claimed gravitational waves discoveries have garnered. Paradoxically, these same media also routinely report discoveries that would challenge the very existence of black holes, if astronomers and astrophysicists were willing to entertain such a possibility. But rather than forcing any reassessment of foundational theory, the discoveries are simply presented as exciting puzzles for working scientists. A good example is found in a recent paper on scientists' observation of star formation that is occurring impossibly close to the Milky Way's hypothetical black hole. A phys.org report introduces the conundrum as follows, "At the center of our galaxy, in the immediate vicinity of its supermassive black hole, is a region wracked by powerful tidal forces and bathed in intense ultraviolet light and X-ray radiation. These harsh conditions, astronomers surmise, do not favor star formation, especially low-mass stars like our Sun. Surprisingly, new observations... suggest otherwise." Scientists using the ALMA telescope discovered evidence of a total of 11 low-mass stars forming within just three light years to the hypothetical black hole. As the phys.org report notes, "At this distance, tidal forces driven by the supermassive black hole should be energetic enough to rip apart clouds of dust and gas before they can form stars." The lead author of the new paper says, "Despite all odds, we see the best evidence yet that low-mass stars are forming startlingly close to the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way. This is a genuinely surprising result and one that demonstrates just how robust star formation can be, even in the most unlikely of places." But of course, this is not the first time that our galaxy's hypothetical black hole has mystified astronomers with its behavior. For several years, scientists around the world eagerly awaited the approach of the gas cloud G2 to the supposed black hole. The standard expectation was that the cloud would undoubtedly be, "devoured" as it entered the black hole's domain. Apparently, the black hole was not feeling hungry as the gas cloud was left intact to the amazement of astronomers around the world. Hopelessly problematic black hole behavior has been observed at all scales throughout the cosmos. In 2012, we reported on scientists' observations of two bright radio spots in the globular cluster M22, which they interpret as two small black holes. But Standard Theory dictates that only one black hole at most, can exist in the cluster of tightly packed stars. The National Radio Astronomy Observatory reported of the findings, "Simulations have indicated that these black holes would fall toward the center of the cluster, then begin a violent gravitational dance with each other, in which all of them or perhaps all but a single one would be thrown completely out of the cluster." The author of a paper on the findings stated, "We didn't find what we were looking for, but instead found something very surprising -- two smaller black holes. That's surprising because most theorists said there should be at most one black hole in the cluster." At a much vaster scale at the farthest reaches of the observable universe, we see in ever greater detail, stupendous electromagnetic phenomena that are not predicted nor explained by black hole theory. As we've reported several times, in 2016 a Royal Astronomical Society press release reported the discovery that, "...supermassive black holes in a region of the distant universe are all spinning out radio jets in the same direction..." A lead investigator, professor Romeel Dave said of the findings, "This is not obviously expected based on our current understanding of cosmology. It's a bizarre finding." As noted by Professor Andrew Russ Taylor, "...these black holes don't know about each other, or have any way of exchanging information or influencing each other directly over such vast scales..." In the Electric Universe, such cosmic alignments, completely unexpected by standard cosmology, are both predicted and required if the dominant organizational force is electromagnetism. The Electric Universe theory proposes that space across cosmic distances has a substructure of twisted-pair current filaments with stars and galaxies forming along them like pearls on a string, and having their spin axes aligned along their filaments. Space discovery continues to confirm this prediction including the Herschel Space Observatory's imaging of vast networks of star-forming filaments. In fact, the phenomenon of spectacular cosmic jets, sometimes hundreds of thousands of light years long, dramatically reveals the tunnel vision of gravito-centric cosmology. Radio astronomers who have measured the electric current in an extra galactic jet, have proposed that the black hole creates a powerful magnetic field which then produces the jet's electric current. But mysterious magnetism will never explain the tremendous electromagnetic emissions that are now routinely detected throughout the cosmos. As we've outlined in dozens of episodes, the concepts of Plasma Cosmology and the Electric Universe offer very different predictions and explanations for the phenomena astronomers attribute to black holes. At the center of galaxies is not a black hole but an ultra-high density energy storage phenomenon called a plasmoid, a kind of load in the galactic electrical circuit. In a galactic circuit, electrical power flows inward along the spiral arms lighting the stars as it goes and is concentrated and stored in the central plasmoid. When the plasmoid reaches a threshold density it discharges, usually along the galaxy's spin axis. The Electric Universe proposes this is in fact the source of the stupendous cosmic jets. Indeed, a recent scientific paper reveals that nature is confounding all of cosmologists' predictions about black holes' magnetic properties. A phys.org report on the finding states, "Black holes are famous for their muscle: an intense gravitational pull known to gobble up entire stars and launch streams of matter into space at almost the speed of light. It turns out the reality may not live up to the hype... University of Florida scientists have discovered these tears in the fabric of the universe have significantly weaker magnetic fields than previously thought." The unsolved mystery that the report acknowledges is, "...how 'jets' of particles traveling at nearly the speed of light shoot out of black holes' magnetic field." The study co-author states, "The question is, how do you do that? Our surprisingly low measurements will force new constraints on theoretical models that previously focused on strong magnetic fields accelerating and directing the jet flows. We weren't expecting this, so it changes much of what we thought we knew." As noted in a public comment by Thunderbolts colleague Chris Reeve, "The picture which is emerging is of the black hole as non-falsifiable. It really does not seem to matter how many null results accumulate; since theorists need them to be there, they will continue to insist that they ARE there." In fact, we have noted a fundamental challenge to the very question of whether Einstein's mathematics predict black holes. As explained by physicist Wal Thornhill in his Space News interview on gravitational waves, "It's a self-serving myth that Einstein's mathematics predicts black holes. The originators of black hole theory in 1965, including Thorne, chose not to mention that Einstein's October 1939 paper which they refer to, concludes with, "The 'Schwarzschild singularity'", the term black hole had not been introduced then, "does not appear for the reason that matter cannot be concentrated arbitrarily and this is due to the fact that otherwise the constituting particles would reach the velocity of light." Einstein showed mathematically that black holes cannot form gravitationally for the same reason that stars and planets cannot. Because the infalling matter begins to circle the center of mass until the centrifugal force balances the gravitational force. The observational evidence now shows that stars and planets are formed by the powerful electromagnetic force produced in electromagnetic pinches along cosmic lightning filaments in molecular clouds. Gravitational collapse theory is now discredited by direct observation. For continuous updates on Space News from the Electric Universe, stay tuned to Thunderbolts.info 
Wow! Does a year pass by quickly. Last time I stood up here we were showing you pre-models, computer-aided design models of SAFIRE, where we thought we were going to go. And tonight, we're going to show you where we've come and how we got there. So, I'm not sure how fast I'll go through the presentation; I think I have what 600 slides. No, not that many, but there's lots of colorful ones. We're going to get into some of the hard core engineering that goes into designing a machine of this nature and some of the questions that the team had to address for us to get where we are. So SAFIRE: Stellar Atmospheric Function in Regulation Experiment. It's a test of the Electric Sun Model and this model, we see here are we going... OK, this is the overview... Here we go. The Electric Sun Model. I was asked back in 2011 [I'm just going to give you a really quick overview for some of you that are new] by the EU and by individuals to examine this model. And what I did is I compared it to the contemporary model and I discovered that there is a lot of disparities with the contemporary model and came to the conclusion that, at least at this time here, it's not testable. But during this, I used a statistical evaluation tool called Design of Experiments, which you can apply to filter through hypotheses or different models to determine whether they can be tested or not. So that's really the first couple of years, and I came to the conclusion that I think that the Electric Universe Model is based on the principle of charged plasma affecting matter of a different electrical potential. And I came to that conclusion finally after Scott Mainwaring had given me a book, written by Crookes, where he had a cathode at one end of a small jar and an anode at the other end and had rubies in the center. And when he lit it up, the ruby started to fluoresce and radiate, is what he called it, what we call plasma discharge. But the rubies themselves were not part of the circuit they were just in the plasma and what it indicates is that there's certain elements that we know now do not want to climb or fall to the electric potential of its environment, when that happens that's when you end up with a plasma discharge. And it was based on that that I came to conclusion that we may be able to test this. So Phase 1 was a proof of concept, and it was really just to see if we could shake it out and see if it worked. Can we go in and recreate these things and can we introduce some instrumentation to do some measurements? Because the data and instrumentation to measure what's going on in plasmas is extremely weak. There's not much information about it, and we're going to get into that. And we did test it. And we discovered that it would work. (video Clip Narrator) * We adjust pressure, voltage, but I'm gonna introduce some more helium right now first, just a little bit more, * current, and time. * Time is also a key element. * When the proper combination of these factors is arrived at, the plasma spontaneously ignites. * A glow discharge forms in the chamber Look, look! Look at the emissions coming off. Look how bright it becomes. * We adjust the various parameters to obtain a variety of plasma regimes. Look, Look, Look, Look, Look, Look, Look * What we are observing has no clear precedent. * We are seeing things we did not expect. Look at the pressure changes! Nice, nice. Look at the spin! And that was just the initial... Afterwards, we were able to control the plasma, and these are some of the plasma phenomena that we observed, and we were starting to measure. And these double layers, we ended up finding that we had 2, 3, 4, 20... These aren't disks. These are spherical discharges. Plasma has a unique characteristic where it is translucent as you look through the center of it. And it looks like it's a disk, but in fact it's not. What you're looking at actually are spheres. And then we end up looking at things that had certain types of perturbations, but what we thought and looked at the geometry here was quite remarkable with the hexagonal-type formation, and this is all moving. This is not static. Further to this, as some of you know, we saw a dark or an extremely intense ion cloud build up around the core, this is very common for what we see happening in SAFIRE. And when it did, it would blow off into the chamber. And when that happened, it would often release power surges of over 10 million watts. Now what we did is we limited the power to 1800 watts, and we don't understand this, but these are the things that we are going to now investigate in Phase 2, and... this is what you're going to be introduced to tonight. This is kind of a panoramic shot of the lab. What you're looking at in the center there is the chamber, which can, uh, it's about 3 cubic meters. It's about 7 feet long, and it's about 4 feet in diameter. And we're going to go and explore the engineering that went behind this. But what's behind this? This is SAFCON. Everybody in the team, we have to come up with a name, let's call it the control room, and nobody liked that. So we said okay, well let's really... they came up with the name SAFCON. So, this is SAFCON. And this is kind of a again a panoramic view here; it's not complete in this picture of where the main control for gas, vacuum, data acquisition, and in real time we get to monitor what's going on with all the systems in the chamber. Now there are two things that we're going to talk about tonight. One of them is systems, which is the chamber itself to maintain its stability so that it's a stable experimental environment. And the other is the data that we get back from the instruments like the Langmuir probe, optical spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy, and other things. So, you're not looking at the Sun. This is the result of the first discharge from SAFIRE PHASE 2. And this is what happened. And so, we believe now that it is scalable. Well, we know it's scalable. So the SAFIRE environment: we know that the plasma itself is extremely intense. We know that it's extremely hot. And one of the things that happen in a plasma discharge, one of the characteristics of a plasma is what we call radiation emissions. And radiation emissions is the thing that you feel when you walk outside, and you feel the hot Phoenix sun after if you've been in the shade. And those emissions in SAFIRE, they travel at the speed of light, and they impinge on the surface of the chamber. Now, I didn't think that this would be a big deal when we first started out because it's such a big chamber; it weighs almost 2,000 pounds; it's stainless steel; and I found out that was actually was not the case. This is just a small graph to show you the different types of radiation. The complete spectrum, you go right from what they call non-thermal, thermal, optical, broken bands, gamma rays, x-rays, and ultraviolet. The stuff that we feel predominately are within the kind of the infrared to ultraviolet range when we walk out in the Sun. But SAFIRE'S going to experience many of these because it's an ionizing plasma. And this is what happens to the chamber. So when this radiation hits the surface of the chamber, some of it is reflected back. But in our case, because we have a certain type of finish, a lot of this energy is absorbed into that material, and there's transmitted radiation that comes off the outside. So, if you think about your engine, it's got gas burning on the inside, and you feel the heat migrating through the engine; it gets extremely hot. And so you have this thermal conductance within the material itself. So in engineering: we had to take a look at what we call potential failure modes-- the melting of o-rings (is it going to get too hot?), thermal stresses on viewports, thermal expansion of materials causing stress, thermal effect on cameras, electrical discharge, erosion of materials, deposition of materials. When you have a plasma, an ionizing plasma, we watch things get vaporized. And when we say vaporized, these are like happening in seconds. So, you can have something that's metal, and it's no longer there. So you've got to be careful about how much energy is in this chamber, and you've got to have, you know, good control over it. So potential failure modes: what temperatures are we dealing with; how long will it take to reach these temperatures; how do we limit thermal heating in the chamber; what are the thermal limitations of the gaskets; how do we limit the thermal heating of the viewports; what are the effects of thermal expansion... Potential failure modes, and it goes on. And the list becomes endless because once you have this radiation in here it's like putting a very hot, let's say, tungsten light bulb inside a shoe box, and that heat and that energy's got nowhere to go, and it will cause a fire. Molecular solubility: well, we're using hydrogen. What about the polymer hoses that we're using? Well, they're designed to handle the hydrogen. Well, what happens if the polymer hose starts to heat up? Well,, it opens up the molecular structure of the polymer holes, the hydrogen starts to migrate through, and maybe you get hydrogen embrittlement, and then you, you break a hose. It doesn't sound like a big deal, but if you've got pressurized hydrogen moving into the chamber, and you've got a very hot anode, it might cause some consternation amongst the team. Lowell said, ah, I said "Can  we expect an explosion?" And he said, "Well, if we do, it won't be very big." Now you have to understand with Lowell, what his background is, because he used to work at Los Alamos and  Lawrence Livermore Labs, and nuclear weapons, So... So I asked him, I said, "Are we talking about one megaton or 70 megatons? You know, or are we just gonna become like cosmic dust?" So, we have what we call a system, it's called Open Issues and Project Tracking. And that means that every single person on the team has a responsibility to, if you think that it's a problem, it's a problem unless we know that it isn't. It's broken unless we know that it's fixed. It's not gonna work unless we know that it does. It's kind of a, you might consider it a negative approach, but in the automotive industry we would do the same thing with your braking system on your car. As an engineer, we would say, would you be happy if your brakes worked most of the time? Or do you, because I got accused of being a perfectionist one time, and that's the way I answered them back. And I said well, you know, if I'm designing your braking system, do you want them to work most of the time, 90% of the time, 99% of the time? And what I I discovered is that people want their brakes to work even if the pads are gone. So, we look at where a system is going to fail, and if we can eliminate the failure modes, then we have a reasonable confidence that it's going to work. So, there are thousands of issues. And each person on the team is assigned, they're a champion. We identify what the task or the issue is. The team discusses it amongst ourselves. We come up with recommendations. The person can pursue it and then come back maybe a day or two later a week or a month and say OK, this is what I found, and maybe they are stuck on it. But, the approach is that if any member of the team has an issue, the whole team has an issue because if they're stuck, we're all stuck. So, we tracked through every single issue that we can think of. And that brings us to Computational Fluid Dynamics. And it's a big word, and it's a science and engineering that is used from designs of kettles, to rockets, fighter aircraft. And it covers a wide range of things in thermodynamics, and it includes radiation emissions, that's light emissions. It means fluids as well as gases. So, gases fall under the same kinds of laws and principles in our calculations as what liquids do. So, CFD is a software solid modeler. It uses proven applied mathematical equations, algorithms to evaluate the effects of various interacting and non-interacting factors affecting fluids, gases, and materials. So think about when they designed the radiator of your car, they know that, as a radiator heats up, it's going to expand. And if it didn't let it expand, it's gonna break; it's gonna leak. So, you want to understand the materials and the effects of the heat on these kinds of materials. And the same thing happens in SAFIRE. And you can do all these calculations at once with some of the most advanced solid modelers. So as I said before, at the beginning, I didn't think that thermal radiation was going to be too much of an effect, cause the thing weighs about 2,000 pounds. It's a lot of steel there, and I thought okay we can fire it up, and that's not going to be like a small bell jar. We can run it for maybe, you know, a number of hours. But what I discovered in my initial calculations is that, even at 30 kilowatts, because you need more power it's a bigger chamber, we would get maybe half an hour out of the chamber before things started to melt. And if we allow the chamber and the energy to go beyond that, maybe up to 80 kilowatts, or even 165 kilowatts, which it has the capability of doing because it's a big chamber, we might get half an hour before it heats up to 500 degrees Celsius. And when you see something that's red hot, that would be in the range of around 5-600 degrees Celsius, and that's where things start to melt. And that's a big problem. We can't run, you can't run an experiment. So what you're looking at here is a calculation is called "total heat flux," and you're going to kind of get a kind of a basic 101 engineering thing on, on this. And I discovered something that EU might find very useful on the heating of the cores of planets and moons, but this here is showing you the anode in the center of the chamber, and as time goes on, how radiation emissions impinge on the surfaces of the materials and the chamber itself. Now, the core plasma, remember the core plasma we figure is around 3,000 degrees, but the radiation is leaving at the speed of light and is traveling through the atmosphere in the chamber because it's in a vacuum even faster than it travels through our atmosphere on earth. So there's nothing to slow it down; there's nothing to stop it. So, the static results, that was Dr. Lowell Morgan's calculations. So he came out and he said, "Well, it looks like it's going to heat up to about 521 degrees Celsius," and I was coming up with numbers of around 535 degrees Celsius, then I contacted some friends that we're doing some work with NASA and some aerospace down in the Carolinas and they were saying maybe 550 degrees Celsius. So we have a problem. So what this is is some of the calculations. This is just really a return graph, I'm going to show you some other more graphical representations of the results that the calculations came out with, but it meant we have a big problem. And it meant that I had to make a telephone call to Scott and say that if we ran the chamber, we could run it for about 10 minutes before you see kind of a melting thing on the floor, and that's the end of SAFIRE. What this is here, you have static results, which means this is going to be the maximum temperature the chamber will come to, and it will stabilize. The next as you see right here it's kind of migrating along, you see the graph drops down, it comes back up, that's giving us the time domain and how long it will take the chamber to heat. And we came up with approximately the same number, about 30 minutes. So then I thought, okay well, I don't want to call Scott yet and say "It's over!" So, I thought, well, maybe we can cool it. So, we'll wrap some water around it, OK, some hoses or whatever we need to do so we can cool the chamber. But as you can see here the analysis is showing us that well where the hoses are it's nice and cool, but right where the center of the chamber is, which is where the most of the heat is, it's going to be too complicated for us to get anything effective in there. And what you're looking at from the green to the red is what we call a thermal gradient, and it's too steep. You just don't do that to materials without causing a lot of stress and problems. So I'm thinking, "Well, how do we cool engines? What if we blew some air on it?" So, I started to do some analysis, and I thought, "Well, what if we put a fan on it, and we suck the air down through a shroud along the surface, and we got some sort of laminar flow?" And laminar flow falls under Computational Fluid Dynamics, and this is the kind of math that they use to do wing design on aircraft. You know, how much laminar flow, how well will the air actually stick to the surface to lift the aircraft up. And air's a very effective way to get rid of heat; you use it in your radiators in your car. So, it looked promising. And I thought okay, what we could also work out here is the flow of air over the surfaces. So, we can effectively predict how the winds or the air is going to flow over the surfaces to be more effective in cooling it -- more effective, more efficient. And this is some of the thermal distribution, and it's a lot more even. So, we're not getting 500 degrees now. Now, if I can get a fan to pull air over the surface, we can bring the chamber into stability of around 100 degrees Celsius. Now that's something we can work with. It's still going to boil water, but the worst case scenario is about 100 degrees Celsius. Its not going to melt gaskets; yes, you could fry eggs on it, but it's workable. So then I thought, "Well, I need a fan." And that big blue thing is the fan that we came up with. I told Scott that, yes we have a solution, but what I didn't tell him at the time is just how big a fan we needed. And so he thought okay, this is good, so we're going to keep moving ahead. And the fan actually will suck about 14,000 cubic feet per minute at a pressure of about 2 inches of 2 atmospheres, oh uh, not 2 atmospheres, but 2 inches of water, which basically would suck the air out of this room, all the air out of this room here, oh, I would say approximately 30 seconds. So keep your hands and feet in at all times. I mean that's me standing there, I don't what I'm doing, I'm looking at something, I guess. So then we looked at the outside, that looked good, so let's take a look at the inside, because that's where the real nasty environment is. And what we can model now, very accurately, is what these conditions are. And the conditions is showing you with the little arrows, it's showing you, those arrows are showing the effects of buoyancy so as hot air heats it rises. And so effectively what those arrow are showing you that it's going to rise, and it's giving you a velocity of how fast is the gas rising. And so this is gas, this is not radiation emissions. The radiation emissions are passing through the gas at the speed of light, but then there's the gas in the chamber, and how fast is it moving? OK, do we have any kind of convection motion happening in here? And it's actually quite stable, if you look at it. The velocity is actually not that high.   So what we're looking at here, I took a cross-section, and we're just kind of moving down through the chamber to the core, which is where the anode is. And it looks like a heck of a fire that's in there, and it is, but the velocity is very, very low. We're talking .0005 meters per second. So, it means the gas is not moving very quickly, which is good for us, because it means that, you know, gravity is going to have a limited effect on the plasma discharge, if that makes any sense. OK, the gas is very stable inside. And this is just actually looking down into the core. So, this here is the effect of what's called "total heat flux." It's how you can heat up a body using electricity. So, I'm just going to digress here from SAFIRE just to talk about a possibility that the EU might want to consider, because in the course of doing this analysis, it occurred to me that we use this tool all the time, and it means that the center of the anode might be around, let's say, 2500 degrees Celsius, but the surface temperature of the anode was almost one order of magnitude cooler. I thought, "Well now what is going on? Like, you know, I'm going to heat it up, it should be just kind of uniform heat." But in the analysis what it showed is that the radiation emissions leaving the surface of the anode are leaving at the speed of light, but it takes a lot more time for the heat to migrate from the core through that very dense material that we call the anode. So if you think about it, you don't need gravity to heat the core of a planet or a moon, and this is very effective mechanism to do this. And it does answer for why you can have hot cores in planets or moons, that really by now, in my opinion, if the result is as they say they are, should be frozen rocks, and they're not. And even with bodies that are even smaller than our own moon might have hot cores and volcanic activity. Just a consideration for the EU, but it's something that appears to me that might have some legs. So, it's just another kind of a 3-D view of the core. It's fun doing this work because its really pretty. This is stuff you could put on t-shirts, you know. So this again, what we're looking at is the radiation and the effects of the radiation on components like the cathodes, because we're like we have large cathods, and you'll see them tonight. They are 3 feet in diameter. They're very thick copper, and what we have to identify now is whether or not they're going to melt, or they're going to expand, and what kind of changes can we see occur in the chamber without it going into a failure mode. And this is really what it's showing you. The green means that its cool, the red mean it's hot, and the little arrows show you the direction that the air is moving or the gas moving in the chamber. This here is the results. So the maximum temperature that we got from radiation is about 600° Celsius for the copper, and that's well within copper's ability to handle. It's going to get hot, but it's not going to melt. But when things heat up they expand. And if you're holding something too rigid, and it's wanting to expand, well, that's when you start to break things. So, we can take the information that we've got, and the results that we got from the Computational Fluid Dynamics, and read that directly into what's called Finite Element Analysis. And that really deals with the structure, of the strength of materials. It's used in building buildings and cars and virtually every kind of thing you can think of that undergoes any kind of stress. So, if you take your hand on your desk tonight, and you just put your fingers on the edge, and you push your hand down, you're going to get what's called "displacement." If you feel your muscles stretching, this is what we would call "stress." So things can displace like the wings on an aircraft, but the stresses are within its limits so they don't break off. And this is basically what FEA does. And you can apply thermal forces. And what this is showing us is the effects of the radiation emissions on the SAFIRE viewports. OK now, if I was paying for this, where, these are SAFIRE viewports. Now if anyone knows anything about vacuum chambers, these are really are not cheap viewports, OK. And you don't wanna be blowing them out of your chamber because you've subjecting them to extremely high stresses. And what this is saying in effect as long as we've got air moving over top of the surface, we can keep it cool down to a point where we can effectively use them without blowing the the viewports out of the chamber. But what about the cathode? Well, you come up with some ideas. You want a nice flat disk. The team we all agreed that a nice flat disk could be the most effective way to do this, but you gotta hold that disk up somehow. And this was the first concept. And this here what you're looking at is kind of a pie shape section out of that round, that cathode that you'll see very soon. And what it's showing you is the stresses due to thermal forces. And you can see...   OK, you see right in this area here, the stresses are 370, 372.9 megapascals. Now that may not mean much to most of you, but what it does say is that it's about 400% beyond what copper can handle. It means that the copper is going to, because the expansion due to the deformation that we see here, that cathode under these temperatures is going to grow about half an inch. So how do we how do we let it grow half an inch without, you know, the support structure breaking, because it can't hold it anymore?       OK, so what we say, well look, let's, let's think of some concepts that come out of aircraft. Well if there, if the, if the wings on an aircraft are stiff, actually they break off. And when you take off in a big airliner nowadays you can see the wings moving up. If they didn't, all those stresses would be so severe, they would actually crack and fracture, and break off, and that's not a good thing. So, what we're going to do with SAFIRE, or what we did, is we want to let it grow. Let it grow. So, in this case here, you know, we just put a small joint in here. I don't know how well you can see it on the big screen, but there's a joint in here, and it's gonna let the cathode grow. And it's not going to put stresses on the structure in here, but the stresses that you can see here were actually supporting the cathode are 77 megapascals, which is about 300% below what copper can handle. So, we're in good shape. And I have enough experience with this to know that it's going to work. OK.     OK. So Systems. Systems Design and Engineering. If you have a computer, you have a computer system. You have chips, and you have wires, you have fans, and you have cooling systems within that computer. And that system itself is hooked into a network called the Internet, and we have systems. And with this particular machine, we have to start breaking those systems out into something that's actually going to work for us in a laboratory. So the main control panel, data feedback and capture, this is in SAFCON, video feedback. OK, we need to see what's going on in the chamber. We have a couple, you know, we have one wide angle camera; we've got a high-resolution video camera that you're going to see some of the results from tonight. A main data vacuum, and controls raceway, so we got to bring all the controls and other things across from the chamber into the control room, and the main power supply. And we have deionized water cooling system; the reason why we use deionized water is due to its resistivity, and we'll talk about that a little bit. And then of course you have the main chamber. This is just a quick kind of overview of what SAFIRE was modeled an engineered to be, and the pictures you're going to see is really a replica of what has been modeled here over the course of the year. So, we have the gimbal. You saw that last year in the model; you're going to see the real thing tonight. The chamber door, mass spectrometer, and remote data data acquisition junction, that's kind of uh, you'll see some interesting things there. Anode isolation chamber. Actually, that was Scott Mainwaring's idea. He says, "Monty, so what if we just-- 'cause that chamber's so big it's going to take you days to suck it down and get the vacuum that you want-- if we want to change the anode out, we're going to lose three days every time we do that." And so we designed an isolation chamber where we could pull the anode back, close the gate valve, save the chamber, and switch out the anode. And this happened, I don't know how long it took us, because we did this, maybe 20 minutes, and put a new one in and brought it back into the chamber. Recirculation Recirculation pumps, air cooling, cryogenic vacuum, and a lot of other systems. What you're looking at here is the main gas and vacuum control systems. And the point of the presentation tonight is not just to show you SAFIRE and some of the results but the effort and the amount of work involved with the whole SAFIRE team to get to what you're going to see tonight. And what you're looking at here is really the mains gas and vacuum schematic. And everybody on the team contributes to this. The questions: well, where's it going to fail? What kind of gas we're using? What direction is the gas going through the valve? Is the valve designed to go one way? Is it more effective if it goes the other way? What about an emergency stop? What if Lowell's right, you know, and we need the big red button? What happens? How do we deal with that? Do we need to have nitrogen flood into the chamber to assure that in fact we've got a safe and secure shut down? We would like to be on the evening news, but not for, because we've all become cosmic dust. So, we start to model these things up. So, we take the schematic and we say, okay what's it gotta to look like in real life? And we have new members on our team this year, Jason Lickver, and he was my engineering manager with another company that I had. And so we start to design these systems. We take the schematic, which is really the engineering, and that's going to translate into drawings and parts and bills of materials, and with SAFIRE we figure there's at least over 40,000 components, give or take. That doesn't even include the parts inside the computers. So this is a model, these are 3-D models. And we're not at the Iron Man stage where we're talking to the computer, but it's really getting quite advanced. We can take materials like this here; we can know what the stresses are, read that data into an analysis software and determine whether or not it's strong enough, its properties. So, what you're looking at is a 3-D model, but it understands all the mass properties of every single component that are in this model. This isn't just a rendering. This is where engineering is today. So now, we're going to create drawings. Things that people could actually use to buy materials and start to build, and this is, uh, just a drawing of the control panel itself, the typical balloons. And then, we get into things like bills of materials, and all the parts and components, and fittings and ferrules, and nuts and bolts. And each part has to be ordered. And you have to identify a vendor. And you have to identify the lead time so we get the parts on the floor in time so we can build it. So, what you're looking at here is purchasing. And I asked Jano last year if he'd be interested in helping out in the purchasing side of things, and he's never done it before. I have a lot of experience in this with my other companies, and he thought well maybe, maybe it's calling the company up saying. "I'd like to buy this part." What he discovered was, what I didn't tell him is, there's this many pieces, and you're going to have to identify who the vendor is, lead times, pricing, you gotta to get quotes, and just follow up at when are the parts going to hit the floor, and you really kind of have to have the view that the vendor's not really going to tell you the truth about the price or delivery, and they're not gonna deliver on time, and when they do, it may not even be the right part. So, this is the Jano's creation. And he had worked on MRP systems, but we all agreed that that probably wasn't necessary for SAFIRE, little did I say anything, we have a very limited budget, but it really did deserve a full-blown, you know, materials purchasing system. There's a lot of components. So, there were times that when, Jano, I'd call him up and I could see his eyes were like two little black dots, but he hadn't run out the door yet, so I knew there was still hope, and he survived.   So there he is, Jano's our control, science, data acquisition guy. He's the guy that is going to be responsible and is responsible for collecting all the data from all the different instruments and bringing them in and coalescing, you might say, and synchronizing the data from all the instruments. And so here we are at a lab, and he's probably looking at... So, we have to wire it up. And we have to do checks, and vacuum checks, and leak tests. And then, we have fabrication. Now, some say, well you know the panel had to be fabricated, and I didn't know how to split the presentation up into different, into the different aspects, so, you know, the panel did have to be fabricated, but when we think of a fabrication, we're thinking more on the lines of, you know, machining and building and welding. That's really cool to see how things are made. So, when we go to fabricate things, ultimately you have to get the raw materials, and you have to get the parts, and they have to be machined, and they go on big boring mills, and they go, you have to drill holes in them, and you have to prepare the holes for the feed through and the flanges and the glass and all the different parts, and this is what it takes to, just in the fabrication level. And there's a lot of parts. And they all have to fit together, the first time. So, what we're doing here right now, we're welding the flanges into the chamber, and we're checking the welds. I'll just like the audio carry out here for a second.   If you have one pin hole, you no longer have a stable vacuum in your chamber. And normally when you build a machine this complex, you're going to have vacuum leaks. And we do, at this stage. We've got some work to do. We may have to go and discover, we may discover that there's a pin hole someplace in one of these welds. And we'll have to come back and we'll have to plug that weld. And then we take delivery. It's welded up. And this is at Venture Machine and DMI Precision. We have moved SAFIRE from a laboratory in Mississauga to another lab in Mississauga, because basically we ran out of room. And this is the power supply. It's a big boy, but it's DC, we have extremely low for the electrical people, we have extremely low ripple, which means that the DC power is very clean, which is a requirement of the Electric Universe Model, because nature expresses electricity in DC form not AC, although it may be that there's responses. I'm digressing here, but we take delivery, and we're making preparations. And part of the preparations of course is, well, if we've got a scratch on the surface that's got a gasket, it's got to be polished out. And the surface, well, this is Scott, and he offered his assistance, free of charge. And he asked me,  "Do you got a job for me?" And I just had the job, and I said, "Here's a stone; it's a very fine stone. You see this big lip across the chamber here? Well, if you see any imperfections, see if you can you can pull those out, because every imperfection means that's where we're going to have a gas leak." I just let you know Scott, we don't have any leaks in the chamber door. And this is Leighton MacMillan. He's on the team as well. He's not with us, but everything has to be cleaned with alcohol and prepared before you start putting the gaskets and the copper rings together. This here is the new anode base. What you're looking at is the bulkhead, services through the anode, because at this time around we want to be able to bring other, we want to cool the anode, ok, we want to be able to make sure that we didn't see some of the failures that we saw in Phase 1. So, what you're seeing here is a heat exchanger, and we have water coming up, and we actually can, using a particular taper, we can take a new anode and shove it in there like you do in a drill press, and with a small screw retain the anode. We know from the Computational Fluid Dynamics, the thermodynamics, that the temperatures are going to reach about 1,600 degrees Celsius. So, you've got composites that are in there, those plastics are going to melt. So, we have to get that heat away. So, we're starting to assemble the anode. Actually the anode base, the receiving base. And this is the anode isolation chamber with it pulled back where we can actually put the anode in. And what you're looking at here, actually, is this good? Yeah. This is the big gate valve. So right now, the chamber can be in vacuum, we close this gate valve, and well we close it first, we pull the anode first, we better pull the anode out first. OK, then we close the gate valve, and then we open up the isolation chamber here, so that we can get to the anode and replace it, or do whatever kind of work that we want. Then we close it back up, open up the gate valve, and we can bring the anode back into the chamber. And it works pretty slick. This is a cathode. This is one cathode. There's a coffee cup, but kinda give you some scale. I didn't mean to leave the coffee cup there, but I see that it's there, and it's 3 feet in diameter, and the copper's about 3/8 of an inch thick. And the rings on the back are for support, because you get that kind of heat as you know, with metals it'll start to warp. So, we have to have structural integrity as well. And this is the inside of SAFIRE. We have a cathodes, the anode, instrumentation ports, and we're going to be looking at some other things, and just take you for a tour. So Systems. We're going to go back to systems here. And systems is how you get everything to talk and work together. Electrical, vacuum, water cooling systems, there are a lot of systems. There are primary vacuum systems; there are secondary vacuum systems; there's low vacuum and high vacuum; there is high voltage systems, medium voltage systems, and low voltage systems used for controls. There are data acquisition systems, computer numerically controlled-servo systems, air cooling systems.   Yes! And there are primary pneumatic systems, secondary pneumatic systems, gate valves switches, normally open, normally closed, indicators lights, red lights, green lights, pumps, valves, sensors, burst systems, exhaust systems, compressors, gas systems, diffusing systems, gas analyzing system, and an emergency stop big red button in case one of the systems fails. And I think that's it. So it's complex. This is the main vacuum pump, and it sucks, big time. It will It will take the chamber down to 10 minus 3 or 2...3, 10 minus 2 in about 15 minutes. OK, if anybody knows about, anything about vacuum pumps, this is from Oerlikon; it's a particular pump. The nice thing about this pump is that all you have to cool is water, because you got your water cooling system, but you've got nitrogen cooling and diffusion line, what's that all about? Well, what that's about, is if you take a look at the middle, it says nitrogen cooling and diffusion line, it allows us to run hydrogen in the chamber, evacuate the hydrogen out, and it allows us to introduce nitrogen into the exhaust so that it's not dangerous. You see? So part of that, is part of the mass spectrometers measuring what the hydrogen content is in the exhaust, so we don't end up with dangerous fumes coming out the exhaust system of the chamber. Nice pump, expensive pump, it's a really good pump. It's a dry pump by the way. Now, that's important because we don't want any hydrocarbons in the chamber other than what we want to put in there. We don't want oil bleeding back through the pump into the chamber, which we think we may have had a problem Phase 1. So, we're not gonna look at the cryogenic pump. We hear the word "cryogenic" and really what it means is you bring things down to a very cold temperature, just a few degrees above absolute zero, and it condenses the gas, and by doing that we can bring the chamber pressure down even lower. Down, theoretically we should be able to get down to 10 minus 7, but I think operationally in order for us to evacuate all the impurities that are in the chamber, because we need to do that if we're going to do good mass and optical and spectral analysis, we need to make sure the chamber's clean. And there's really not many things in the way of moving parts, it basically uses helium to bring the the the cryo-pump down. I mean the temperature of the pump down to a place where it condenses the gas. We have, if you can see here, part of what's going on here, we also need to measure... In the system, when we talk about systems we have one, what we call a thermal vac pressure sensor, because we need to monitor the pressure of this system before we actually turn it on. So, this is the feedback that goes back to SAFCON. This is just one. We got the cooling system, of course, and we have to make sure that the water that's going into the center of SAFIRE is deionized water. It doesn't have any minerals in it because the plasma, the anode is charged at 5,000 volts. So, we can use water as long as it......um..... So, we have to deionize the water. And the temperatures, we need to keep them low; so, we use a re-circulation system, because we can't afford to just bring fresh water in and deionize it. Deionized water will not conduct electricity. So, you can use water to cool things down as long as it doesn't have any mineral content in it. And so, we have a high pressure pump and manifold system to distribute the cooled water out to the various characteristics, or you might say parts of the chamber, to keep them cool. And we have a deionizer that actually monitors the resistivity of the water as well. This will give you an indication of the complexities of SAFIRE, to make something like this work. Primary Plasma Measurement Instruments Well, we've covered this before. This is showing the equipment that we have either on the floor or it's on route. So Langmuir probe. It took us about eight months to work out with a Langmuir probe manufacturer to get the right kind of probe manufactured for SAFIRE. These probes are approximately 6 feet tall, and they're very, very sensitive. The section here is made of alumina, which is like a very fragile material, but it's extremely good when it comes to extremely nasty, hot environments. And of course in the past, you've seen the optical spectrometer that we've been using to get some of the signatures that we got, and of course the mass spectrometer itself. Now, the mass spec is probably one of the more important pieces of equipment in SAFIRE because it tells us what we've got as a constituent gas inside the chamber. And it'll measure all the elements, every 500 milliseconds, and return that information back to us. So, we know that when the chamber has got hydrogen in it, or if it's got argon, or some other gas, or if we end up with some strange species, as some, we indicated at last year's conference. But what we did this time is we said look, you know, we want to measure in different regions in the chamber; we want to measure right down near the anode; we want to measure the exhaust gas; and so we have a system by which with just a flip of a switch we can sample any area of SAFIRE at any time. And this is what goes on in SAFCON. This is what goes on in the control room. Data Acquisition and Systems Control.   And no scientific experiment would really be complete unless you had a rats nest of wires, and communication, and pressure systems, and pressure and data acquisition, I mean. So, this is Leighton, and he is building, the, I guess really might say, the nervous system of SAFIRE. And diagnostics, we have to troubleshoot. And all this information comes back to SAFCON. So, we know if there's something getting in trouble; we know if we got a pressure leak, over pressure. So, the main power supply, as I said before, it has a capability of delivering 200 kilowatts now, DC, clean. We can control the voltage, and we can control the current. And you'll see what happens when we didn't control the current.   I think this is Joel giving me a lecture; Jano's listening intently. And this is just before we start to do the fire up of SAFIRE, which you are going to see in just a few minutes here. Now for the EU, Don Scott and I've talked back and forth a little bit about the low energy discharges. We can go from 0 up to 5,000 volts, and we can go from 0 up to 35 amps or better actually, but we have some work to do to get it refined. We have a lot of work to do. We just fired up SAFIRE for the first time last week. The Gimbal, As some of you know, it's a primary instrument to use to move a variety of instruments freely through the SAFIRE chamber. It's CNC computer numerically controlled; we have position accuracy to almost a thousandth of an inch, which means we can move the Langmuir probe through some of the double layers that we've seen, and start to examine possibly Birkeland Currents, and diagnose what's actually going on there. Maybe we get some answers as to why there is charge separation. Optical spectroscopy, Langmuir probe measurements, and other instruments can be added and put into the gimbal. And here it is here. So, last year was a model, and now you see the real thing. And this will give an indication here, I think it should start the movie, yes, how smoothly the gimbal works. So, it's like a long needle and we can bring the needle down into the plasma; we can move it anywhere we want. And we can use it using a joystick, or we can pre-program different types of motions that are in there, or different motions that we can move. If we wanted to move a comet around, let's say the anode itself, we wanted to move out towards the cathode and measure at the anode at the same time. There are two gimbals on SAFIRE, and the patent was just filed on Friday, yesterday actually. So, that's pretty cool. And this is all within the year. So, we've been busy. It's pretty tall. The gimbal standing would be right now, I guess from where it's mounted, it'd probably be close to 7 feet. And now we're going to start up. Ben [Ged Low] was kind enough to edit this next video we're going to see because there are certain things that occurred, and this is the startup of SAFIRE Phase 2. Take the voltage down! Kill it! Kill it! OK, so that was the first day. And what I had forgot was a little thing that Don Scott and a couple of us had talked about. Instead of limiting the current on the first discharge, I was limiting the voltage. So, I was thinking, "OK, well, we just want to get enough voltage to get it ignited." But I should have actually limited the current. Now, what's missing out of this film here, well actually, what I should say is what you actually saw at the very end was what we call a "plasma flow discharge" and it resembles something like the Death Star out of Star Wars. OK, and what it does is an extremely intense ion discharge to wherever it's going and its focus. Well, what you don't know, what you didn't hear, was actually the power supply was maxing out of 200 kilowatts and the amount of energy was impinging on a, I thought the chamber of the time, but it was a screw this big. And what happened was I started, you didn't see it in the video, but I started to see all the stuff flying off, OK. And it was actually vaporizing the screw. I thought it was drilling a hole in the side of the chamber. So, Ben was kind enough to remove some of the colloquialisms I was using prior to him saying "shut it off" because it was about 30 seconds in there that Joel because we didn't actually have you know the main control actually hooked up inside SAFCON at the time. It was Joel sitting out and standing out by the power supply listening to us to please turn it up or down, and we're all screaming inside because we're freaking out because we thought we were just going to smoke a new hole in SAFIRE, and we haven't even got it started yet. So, Day 2, we learned a few things. We're going to see if we can control the current this time and not let it eat as much power as it would like. And so what you're going to see next was Day 2. And that was Day 2. So, we thought that was pretty cool too. We thought okay we've got some good news. And  now we can go to the conference and tell everyone actually it works, which is great. Capabilities Should we stop to talk now? Should we talk about capabilities? I'm going to fily through these quickly because I'm getting that OK I've been up here long enough and I might be boring you guys. You're good? OK, OK. Well, because now that we've got SAFIRE fired up, the real work, hard work, science work, elucidating cause and effect, starts. That's when the Design of Experiments starts. And we can start to ask some of the questions that we have been longing to get some answers to for a very long time. So the capabilities. So it has the ability to form a variety of spherical plasma discharges. And what I will say now I can't get into some of the details but we do have full control over all aspects of the plasma discharge according to Paschen's Law. If you look into that, we can control everything now as a variable for us. Now, that's never been done before, ever. It can move instruments freely through the plasma atmosphere. It can do synchronous and simultaneous measurements. We're down to picoseconds, by the way. So, we can synchronize all the measurements that we're taking into picoseconds. That should be really important for us because, as we move forward, there are certain events that happen very quickly, and we can capture those events. And we can synchronize all the rest of the instruments and do graphical overlay, and we can see the history or what what was occurring in the chamber before it actually led up to that event. This is very important for us to do the kind of diagnostics that we need to. High-resolution video, materials testing, material deposition, erosion test, Langmuir probe analysis, optical spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy, near-ultraviolet light measurements, infrared measurements, polarimetry, Design of Experiments methodology. And Questions, questions that we have: Why do ions and electrons not recombine in a double layer? Why does ionized hydrogen not go back to a stable hydrogen atom when it's in a double layer? What is the mechanism, what's the process, why is it staying like this? Why are double layers in SAFIRE quasi-stable? So, why do we form these spheres, and they're quite stable? We don't know. We don't know why they form; we have some ideas but we don't know the mechanisms and processes. We can recreate them because we understand what leads up to them but we don't understand the physics. Why do we get the huge energy surges over 10 megawatts? Maybe it has to do with the paper that Lowell... my name is on the paper too, I edited some of the things but Lowell really is the master of that paper on ion-electron trapping in these double layers. And this may be an answer to why the Sun's photosphere is so intense; maybe why, that's why, there appears to be fusion occurring in the Sun's photosphere. Are we getting transformation of elements? Good question. Are we getting more energy out than in? We could ask that question all the time. We think now we may be able to answer some of these things. What does the voltage gradient look like before SAFIRE fires? We can confirm right now that there is a voltage gradient in SAFIRE in Phase 2 before it actually ignites. But we can now go and measure that gradient. We may even be able to, we may even be able to measure the voltage gradient before it actually does an intense stream plasma discharge to a particular point. This is the thing that leads up to lightning bolts. What's actually the environment around there, that lightning bolt, before you actually see a lightning bolt or plasma discharge. So, is the voltage gradient, as an example, it is uniform throughout the chamber? We can measure these things now: x-rays, neutrons, gamma rays, and much more. And that's really it for this presentation. So, we will leave you with this. What I'm going to do right now is invite some of the like, really the people that have been involved in SAFIRE. People that you don't really hear about up to the stage, introduce you to them, and then I guess we're going to do a question-and-answer with just the core team. So, thank you! It's been a privilege. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by the Thunderbolts Project™at Thunderbolts. info Hi, this is Andy Hall with Space News. I am presenting Part 9 of my series Eye of the Storm, where we look at electrical scarring on the Colorado Plateau. The Caribbean sea floor displays deep trenches aligned with island arcs, which run parallel to each other - even around  bends. Volcanic island chains and oceanic trenches are magnetic expressions of a subsurface current. Volcanic islands appear to one side of the current, and deep trenches appear on the other. The subsurface current does not produce trench and volcano chains directly. They are formed by eddy currents in the solenoid-like, coaxial magnetic fields surrounding the current. Think of a subsurface Birkeland current, with the added effect of iron in the ground magnifying the magnetic field and its eddy currents. The effect is described by Lenz' Law, which is a special case of Faraday's Law of Induction. To induce eddy currents, according to Lenz’ Law the conductor itself had to be in motion across Earth's magnetic field, generating helical eddy currents in the coaxial magnetic field around the moving conductor. Eddy currents generate heat due to resistance in the material where the currents form. Eddy currents form around the moving conductor, melting the surrounding rock and creating magma chambers. Lorentz Force, or the drag effect of a moving conductor through a magnetic field, which is a magnetic reaction in the opposing direction, pushes volcanoes up on one side and depresses the crust into the molten chamber on the other, creating a trench at the trailing edge of the moving conductor. There is no  actual conductor, like a copper wire, but it's the movement of a filament current, which is moving in reaction to electromagnetic forces, that burns and melts its way through the  crust. Given that islands are to the inside of the trench, the right hand rule indicates  the Caribbean loop current ran counterclockwise during formation of the Caribbean plate. The movement of the current also dredges seafloor, piling into non-volcanic islands along its path, aided by incomprehensible tsunamis. The violence of this event cannot be overstated. Similar current loops can be found at the horn of South America and the Indonesian archipelago. Evidence the current moved is also displayed in the sinuous curves of the trench and island chains. Note the image, where the filament dragged south, its momentum amplified the eddy currents, heating the crust to build the Cuban island chain along an ”S”-shaped curve, before locking its position in a straight line at Jamaica. One of the likely reasons current loops make these lateral moves is because the  sides of the loop flow in opposite directions, and the magnetic polarity of the coaxial eddy currents are opposite and attract, narrowing the loop like a hangman's noose. The magnetic field attraction eventually meets electric field repulsion from the opposing current vectors, which snaps the current into balance in parallel lines. The  tip of the loop accumulates the highest charge density, so even though it's the region that moves the least, its high potential burns neat little arcs of volcanoes. The sinuous pattern shows how charge density spread in longitudinal waves through the moving filament as it met resistance. It's similar to how tension and compression travels in waves through a sealed spring. It forms a sine curve, with the greatest demand of volcanism, trenching and dredging at the inflections, where momentum changed greatest, amplifying the magnetic induction of eddy currents. The  deepest trenches show where the current came to rest, and  momentum suddenly decelerated to zero, as an electromagnetic balance was achieved across the loop structure. Lateral current movements of this type can be found all over the world. The momentum change in the current produces distinctive arcs of deep depressions and volcanic island chains in the oceans. On land, telltale lakes, mountain chains, rivers, volcanoes and maar craters align themselves in the same patterns. Where the Caribbean Loop joins the Ring of Fire, the juncture is called a “triple junction.” Triple junctions occur at the plate boundaries. For instance, the Rivera Triple Junction is where the Rivera Plate meets the Eastern Pacific Rise. Triple junctions are known hot spots for volcanic and seismic activity and magnetic anomalies. Since there are triple junctions along the North American plate, it begs the question: are there current loops connected to these junctions beneath the continental plate? Let's examine North America. The Ring of Fire is the obvious path of a subsurface current because it forms a lineament of volcanoes from Alaska to Central America. There are three other major  lineaments in North America's interior. Yellowstone super-volcano is one end of a curving lineament of volcanoes in a trend that forms a part of the Snake River valley across southern Idaho. To the south is a string of volcanic fields called the Jemez lineament. The Jemez lineament extends diagonally from the Pinacate Volcanic field in Sonora, Mexico, northeast across Arizona, to the border between Colorado and New Mexico. It's bisected by a northwest-to- southwest lineament of volcanoes that include the San Francisco peaks and the Uinkaret volcanoes on the North Rim of Grand Canyon. With all of these plotted together on one map, a pattern begins to emerge that implies there's a current loop beneath North America. Plotted, the Jemez and San Francisco peak volcanic lineaments produce an almost perpendicular cross pattern, juxtaposed symmetrically across the Colorado Plateau from the volcanoes of the Yellowstone complex and aligned with the Ring of Fire. The Jemez  lineament aims directly to the Guadalupe Micro-plate to the southwest and to the arc of the Great Lakes to the Northeast. The loop appears to circle the Great Lakes and points back to the Black Hills in South Dakota, which appears to be an inflection point. From there it points to the Juan de Fuca plate in a direct line through Yellowstone. It has a similar shape and size to the Caribbean current loop, with the  base of the loop wider than the tip. Similar to the Caribbean Loop, there is a significant depression at the tip. In this case it's the Great Lakes, but they  reside on the inside of the loop, whereas ocean trenches are outside of the Caribbean  Loop. And where the Caribbean Loop has volcanic islands inside the curve of the loop, the North American Loop has maar craters, which is a type of volcanic action forming a series of circular lakes outside the arc of the Great Lakes. Maars are volcanoes created by steam and other gases exploding instead of spewing ash and lava. Smaller such expressions are known as karsts and breccia pipes. They are all forms of diatremes and are often mined for uranium and precious metals, which the eruption leaves behind in the throat of the tube. The surface result is a crater instead of a cinder cone and is typically filled with  water. The implication is that the loop current lies below aquifers that erupted in steam, creating the maars. And that the volcanic expression is to the outside of the loop, depressions to the inside, so current circulates north to south in this loop, opposite to the Caribbean Loop. The shape of the Great Lakes, especially Lake Superior, shows the sinuous shape of ground current movement. It appears the loop narrowed or swung to the south until the southern leg aligned to the Jemez Lineament. The Yellowstone volcano lineament is a half-circle and also appears to be from ground current  movement. In this case, the movement appears to be north from the Monterey Micro-plate to the Juan de Fuca triple junction. If so, this widened the base of the loop, with the pivot point of the shift at the Black Hills of South Dakota. Now, if I'm  not telling you anything new here, try this! The electrical structure of these small loop currents and the junctions with large polar loops like the Ring of Fire, forms a circuit called an Operational Amplifier, commonly called an Op-Amp. An  Op-Amp is a type of current loop. But there is one key ingredient to an Op-Amp that makes it special: and that's a direct current or DC connection to the loop, which  amplifies the gain of output to input current by as much as one hundred  thousand. It can then be manipulated with additional circuitry - resistance, inductance and capacitance in various configurations - to perform all kinds of tricks. They can be made to oscillate, amplify, or invert. Op-Amps are at the heart of circuitry such as the old Hewlett Packard calculator I used in college to perform complex math. Op-Amps did the adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing of my inputs to give me outputs I needed to get a grade. So, how does Nature insert this DC current into the loop? With lightning. Lightning strikes DC pulses into the ground, and  in the environment we're exploring lightning struck continuously. Long  enough and powerful enough to draw supersonic winds and matter to build mountains, like the Black Hills of South Dakota which is an inflection point in this  loop. From that inflection point, the Yellowstone volcano aligns with lightning-generated mountains as Sacajawea Peak and the Black Hills along this sub-surface current path. If the Op-Amp needs a shot of DC current, Nature organizes itself to provide by stirring a storm that spits lightning in the appropriate place, thereby fulfilling its fractal pattern requirements. It's Escher's hands. I won't go into detail about how Op-Amps work. There are plenty of books about them. But one attribute certain Op-Amps have I want to point out. Properly configured, the bridge between triple junctions experiences a low, almost zero current relative to the current outside the junctions and in the loop. This corresponds to the “bridge” region of the Ring of Fire between the Mendocino Triple Junction and the Guadalupe Micro-plate, where there  is but a few sparsely spread volcanoes. Compared to the Cascades and Olympics, or the profusion of large volcanoes in Mexico, only Mt. Shasta, Lassen, Mammoth and a few  anemic lava flows fill out this bridge section. The relatively low density and magnitude of volcanoes is evidence that current was restricted along this bridge, just like in an Op-Amp. But the bigger take on all this is that the Earth is a damn computer. There's no other conclusion to draw when there are Op-Amps all over the circuit, clicking and switching currents around. The Earth works as a coherent circuit. It is a circuit within a bigger circuit centered on the Sun. And it has circuits within it, shaping the continents and weather. There is no ”butterfly effect”. A butterfly does not stir 300 mph tornadoes. It is one of the fallacies of modern science that leads to accepting abstract and frivolous ideas. There are fluctuations in signal strength Earth receives from the solar system. Earth is a ball of energy and matter and when it gets extra energy, it stores some in the matter. As Earth's balance with the solar system oscillates, as it must, skin effects take place as Earth's matter absorbs and releases energy. Those skin effects are geology and weather, and they are driven by capacitance as energy flows between Earth's layers of matter. Ionization and induced currents are the natural result. We've been looking at the physical evidence. There is nothing described in these chapters that is implausible or unscientific. In fact, it is what's expected to see on a planet. It's what physics predicts if the inquiry  begins with the proper framework. The next chapter will be the final one for the Eye of the Storm project. We'll summarize then and draw some final conclusions. Thank you. [Music] 
You've just entered the theater of an alien sky. If the words and images seem strange to you, there's a reason for this. Our world was once a vastly different place. To experience this won't hurt you and there is nothing to fear. Rituals of Remembering and Forgetting In these Discourses we propose that our Earth was formerly joined in a close congregation of planets, unlike anything observed today. Based on converging evidence globally, we can name the gathered bodies and identify an extraordinary correspondence between celestial events as seen from Earth and a massive outpouring of myths and symbols, all inseparably linked to the rapid rise of the ancient civilizations. In the final analysis, the only reason to accept or even to consider the reconstruction presented here is predictive ability. If the claimed events occurred, would we reasonably expect the unique narratives and sacred forms coming down to us as worldwide or archetypal content. Our overriding advantage in this respect is specificity. It's none of the concrete patterns revealed to us are predictable under today's common assumptions, not a single one. And yet all are concretely and specifically predictable in the light of the reconstructed polar configuration. With this episode we will begin enumerating the polar configuration's predictive ability in broader terms to lay the groundwork for the episodes to follow. The history of recorded human thought began with the myth-making epoch. Enigmatic symbols and magical practices told a story of creation, catastrophe and regeneration of the world. Of course the greatest mystery of all is the very existence of the mythic archetypes or common themes. We can count them by the hundreds. Why did every ancient culture declare that the sky changed or that towering gods once ruled the world, then went away? Such mysteries invariably direct our attention to deeper and progressively more specific questions; Why did the world's first astronomers so consistently name the great gods as planets? What was the meaning of the so-called great conjunction or perfect conjunction of planets, said to have marked the beginning of time? And not only that, the planet Saturn as a primeval Sun? How did the planet Venus earn its worldwide identity as the mother goddess? Or the planet Mars its global reputation as a great warrior? And what was the nature of the world altering catastrophe, said to have ended this celebrated epoch? Like hundreds of other mythic archetypes, such themes never make sense when referred to our present sky. Always they speak for things not seen in our own time. How did this disconnection occur? We can follow the archetypes across all of human history as associated art and mythic imagery, sacred narratives and countless magical practices take us back to a lost age of gods and wonders. What was the human experience that provoked this ground floor human memory? Reconstructing the ancient experience requires systematic cross-cultural comparison. That is how we come to recognize different myths and symbols pointing back to the same events, all occurring in the earliest remembered time. Within this framework it's only to be expected that an urgent collective memory would grow fragmented and confused across the centuries. Towering forms in the sky progressively lost their cosmic dimensions to become legendary ancestors of those telling the stories. Even the most powerful memories slowly gave way to localization, every tribal community on earth declaring its possession of the original story. In this way each regional culture could cling to a proclaimed lineage of divinely ordained kings, of world-conquering warriors and radiant mother figures. Competitive claims of this sort lie at the heart of all localized mythic rhetoric, one effect amongst many was the incessant drive towards regional expansion through wars of conquest, always the so-called "holy war" was animated by a perceived divine mission descending from the gods themselves. This universal fact will become a key in our analysis of the warrior hero theme. But there's more to this historic pattern. All of the broadly distributed archetypes bear identifiable relationships to remembered cosmic events. To appreciate the impact on humanity, the events themselves must be brought fully into the light of day. In our own time, historians and comparative students of religion can only explain world mythology as a carnival of pre-scientific ignorance. The specialists just assume that they understand what our early ancestors did not understand. But that explanation ignores hundreds of global patterns that would not even be possible in the absence of extraordinary natural events. The truth is that expertise will lead nowhere in the absence of understanding. The great myths arose in an age of planetary instability and cosmic violence, including close approaches of planets and earth-shaking electrical exchanges between planets. The conclusion in these Discourses is that our world, our sky, has not always been the stable referent we experience today. The events that inspired a transformation of human consciousness were cosmic. These events are not occurring now. Hence it is futile to look for answers in the appearance of the sky today. The present is not the key to the past. Allow for another vantage point and everything will make sense. But of course, a new vantage point requires that common assumptions be suspended to allow the test of predictability. Of the hundreds of archetypes we've previously named, how many would be expected under today's assumptions? Not a single one! Would you expect the ancient stories of a former central luminary or primeval sun different from the body we call sun today? Would you expect the preposterous location of that body at the celestial pole or expect the ludicrous identity of that very luminary with the remote planet Saturn? Our advantage is that every tenet in this reconstruction carries explicit testable and inescapable implications. Once named, the archetypes leap out at us and as the archetypes are named so are the implied relationships to other named archetypes. This fundamental unity, the ground floor of the human experience, is for us the acid test, drawing us into a critical examination of the causative events without which no archetypes could even exist. The goal is to identify the unified substructure of human memory. The process starts by naming the cross-cultural themes and allowing the implications to shine through. If indeed a common memory lurks within the historical record, the historical detective must first distinguish between the archetype and its localized expressions. Always keep in mind that the ancient tools of remembering invariably became agents of forgetfulness as well. That's because no local symbol, no mythic fragment, no magical reenactment, could even begin to capture the full integrity of the original experience. No particular myth could possibly lead to any reliable conclusions as to things actually seen in the sky. The truth is that regional storytelling always fostered more forgetfulness than remembering. And yet, through systematic cross-cultural comparison, something deeper will reveal itself, a dependable integrity hidden in the underlying points of agreement for an astonishing archetypal accord begins to shine through. In fact, every logical conclusion to be discussed in these Discourses will follow simply and directly from three indisputable facts: Firstly, no archetype follows logically from any natural events observed today. Secondly, all archetypes are provably connected to each other, no isolated archetypes exist. And thirdly, a unified explanation is available to us if we allow the archetypes to speak for natural events not occurring today. We have named the celestial provocation as the polar configuration. By giving attention to the impact of these gathered planets on human imagination, all of the recurrent themes become witnesses to a story told around the world and that means hundreds of archetypes hiding in plain sight. Always look for the underlying form! 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info 42 years ago, on separate dates more than two weeks apart, two spacecraft were launched at Cape Canaveral, Florida with the potential to rewrite our understanding of the solar system and the interstellar environment. In the 1970s, the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft were designed with the intention of studying the environments of Jupiter and Saturn, as well as the gas giants' respective moons. In 2012, scientists announced that Voyager 1 had apparently become the first man-made object ever to reach interstellar space. But what the spacecraft told us, about the behaviors of the solar wind and the conditions at the interstellar boundary, did not match space scientists' theoretical predictions. In 2013, the lead author of a paper in the journal Science told wired.com of the Voyager 1 data, "The models that have been thought to predict what should happen are all incorrect....We essentially have absolutely no reliable roadmap of what to expect at this point." And today, scientists have reported that Voyager 2 has now also recently crossed the boundary into interstellar space and again, the theoretical predictions based on standard solar physics do not match discovery. Don Gurnett, the corresponding author of a study published in the journal Nature Astronomy, said to phys.org, "In a historical sense, the old idea that the solar wind will just be gradually whittled away as you go further into interstellar space is simply not true. We show with Voyager 2--and previously with Voyager 1--that there's a distinct boundary out there. It's just astonishing how fluids, including plasmas, form boundaries." Of course, the predictions of the Electric Universe theory about the interstellar environment and behavior of the solar wind, differ dramatically from convention. The Electric Universe has always proposed that a vast Birkeland current enters our solar system and, in fact, powers the Sun. We asked retired professor of electrical engineering, Dr. Donald Scott to offer his overview of the Voyager 2 findings to date. Well, a few days ago, researchers at the University of Iowa announced that space probe Voyager 2 left the Sun's heliosphere in late 2018 and entered what they think is the interstellar medium. Its sister probe, Voyager 1 did that earlier, that was back in 2012, and they announced that this latest transition was signaled definitely by a, and they emphasized, the strong increase in the plasma density measured by the probe. In other words, that probe essentially went through what they refer to as "a wall", a boundary there between the heliosphere and the interstellar medium. Well, these guys, astrophysics in general is still in the mindset of fluid dynamics and gravity only, so continuously hear words like winds and shocks and bow waves and in fact, one typical astronomer commented on this latest release. He said, "In a historic sense, the old idea that the solar wind will just be gradually whittled away as you go further into the interstellar space is simply not true. No kidding. We show with Voyager 2--and previously with Voyager 1--that there is a distinct boundary out there. It's just astonishing how fluids, including plasmas, form boundaries." Well yes, in a sense, plasmas are fluid but fluids are not plasmas, so... And do they form boundaries, yes, you betcha. Again, they seem to be surprised when they shouldn't be surprised. We, in the Electric Universe, realize that the discovery of an increase in the plasma density is completely consistent with the electric Bessel function model of a Birkeland current. So we're not surprised at all, the Electric Universe model of  star formation, that is how the Sun formed, is that it results from a z-pinch in a Birkeland current filament inside our galaxy, and in our model, in the EU model, matter: that's to say ions, electrons, neutral atoms, molecules, etc, form in concentric cylinders. So it's quite probable that the outer cylindrical layer of the Birkeland current is a region of increased density and so, that's what the EU would have expected in that, we don't look at it as a surprise or a discovery and it would be something we would be looking for. It's also true in the classical plasma lab experiment; Alfven did them, Langmuir did them; there is often a double layer of charge just outside the cathode, just above the cathode. It's called a cathode drop and in the case of the heliosphere, the heliosphere in the Electric Universe model is the outer layer of the heliopause, serves as a virtual cathode. And so, thinking of it that way, we would expect to see an increased density of matter just at the cathode, and, in our model, the heliopause is the cathode, so that again is what we would expect to see. Z-pinches have been long observed in plasma labs throughout the world, and there's nothing exciting to us about them, but it's very nice to see our ideas born true and see that, that's what they're seeing. At the risk of boring people, I think, I'll point out yet again that when both mechanical and fluid processes occur in a region where there's also electrical forces involved, those electrical forces are 10 to the 36th power times stronger than anything gravity by itself can produce, so electricity is very important and these folks have got to learn that. There's a slide there that says The Sun's Environment, and on the left of the image there is a sketch showing how the twisting current density and magnetic field tend to flatten out into a disc, as you get closer and closer to the actual location of the z-pinch. We're looking sideways at what the Electric Universe thinks is the Birkeland current that serves the Sun, and that oval there in the middle is the, what we would say would be the heliosphere. There in the center of that diagram, you see sort of an X-Ray photograph of that Birkeland current and the heliosphere, the outer edges, is defined by the words edge of the z-pinch, a filament cylinder on both sides there, and so that's, that sort of yellow cloudiness is those increased ions and electrons and that sort of thing that demark the extent of the Birkeland current, and in the center is the heliosphere, the Sun, a very tiny dot right in the middle of that. That is a reasonable, sort of a schematic of what the Electric Universe thinks is the heliosphere and the way the Sun is situated. But actually a better image, the hourglass shaped nebula M-29 and it's, I think it's perhaps the canonical example of a cosmic z-pinch. You can see many of the aspects of what I just said in that image, and you can see there's at least two visible layers outward along the Birkeland current, and the locations of two possible double layers easily seen there... The M-29 is a visible plasma entity and such it has to be, of course, in plasma that's in arc mode or at least glow mode, in order for us to see it. If you look at the top of that image and the very bottom, you can see that the plasma is beginning to disappear, it's beginning to turn into dark mode, because the electrical current density is lower, the farther you get away from the z-pinch. Clearly, our Birkeland current is in dark mode, because otherwise you would see it. Well, if you take a closer look, again a schematic of, looks like there's some black lines that show the shape of the Birkeland current on either side of the z-pinch, you notice that where those lines form together, that I'm suggesting that it looks as though the heliosphere itself is more of a sort of a, I hate to use the word flying saucer, but that's what it looks like, it's like, it's a sort of a squished sphere and point a is inside of it, and if those two probes followed the path a to b or a to c, they would have left the heliosphere but, however, not left the Birkeland current. Had the Voyagers gone from a to d, that is straight out, they would have left both the heliosphere and the Birkeland current and gone out into the truly interstellar space. And you notice on there, there's a notation about the electrons combined here with solar ions to form ENAs. The IBEX mission and the satellite on which the mission depended was a product of the Lockheed Martin corporation, and the division of that Lockheed Martin was headed up by the late Dr. Jim Ryder. He's a valued Electric Universe scientist engineer, and I will say, a good friend to many of us. We miss him. A report of the mission's initial results by the mainstream said, "...the interstellar environment has far more influence on structuring the heliosphere than anyone previously believed... No one knows what is creating the ENA (the energetic neutral atoms) ribbon..." Now, this is what IBEX discovered, that there were these energetic and neutral atoms that they hadn't expected to find, just outside the heliosphere. Well, see a picture there of what a classic plasma experiment would look like in the laboratory, with the anode on the left and the cathode on the right, and of course you put a higher voltage on the anode and ground the cathode and what happens? Well, if you do it right, in the middle of the tube there are, round somewhere where it says positive column, neutral atoms are ionized by like electrons coming from the cathode and so you get an ion. Ions are produced in there, and the positive ion, that is to say, what's left of the atom minus the electron that's popped off of it, it starts to move toward the right, where it'll be attracted, its positive charge attracted by the cathode and repulsed by the anode. So eventually we get the stream of positive ions heading toward the right, heading toward the cathode and flooding out from the cathode are a stream of electrons and what happens? Well, they recombine, there's no such thing as a positive ion traveling in the wire that goes out of the cathode, you can't do that. So, where the positive ions end up are being neutralized by those electrons coming out of the cathode and what's the result? An electrically neutral atom, again, and so that's, there's nothing magic about these electrically neutral atoms, these ENAs are formed simply by recombination, and I interject my friends, it's an electrical process of the recombination of the negatively charged electron with positively charged ion and that's how you get the electrically neutral atom out there at point d. One of the most, I think, most interesting things to come out of this experience is that on October 29th, in 2015, the NASA, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory issued another press release and they said, Voyager 1 has now helped to solve the interstellar medium mystery. I'm not sure what they were referring to by the interstellar medium mystery but anyway, the quote from the release that I find extremely interesting is, "Now researchers have found that the direction of the magnetic field has been slowly turning ever since the spacecraft crossed into interstellar space." OK, let's say that again, they have discovered that the direction of the magnetic field, that the spacecraft observes, has been slowly turning, rotating ever since the spacecraft crossed into interstellar space. They should have said it is ever since the spacecraft left the heliosphere but because, as we saw in that previous diagram with the three way pass; a to b, a to c, and a to d, they left the heliosphere but stayed inside the Birkeland current. That's exactly what they would have observed because, as you travel through a Birkeland current, the magnetic field slowly rotates and slowly changes its direction as you proceed farther and farther away from the central axis of the current. One of the most important properties of the Bessel function model of the Birkeland current is that inside the current structure, the direction of the magnetic field continually increases. Therefore, this announcement is a supremely importantly in agreement with this inherent property of the EU, and my conclusion is that the two spacecraft, or at least any one that measures that continually rotating magnetic field, followed a path like a to b and a to c. That means they have not really entered the interstellar space, they're still inside the Birkeland current, they've left the heliosphere, that's true, but until that magnetic field stops rotating the farther out they get, they're still inside the Birkeland current. There's several different points of confirmation of our model and not theirs. These astrophysicists have got to stop talking about fluid flows, shocks, and bow waves, and they have to learn that real entities such as Birkeland currents and double layers are important, and until they do, their research will stagnate, just as their fruitless search for dark matter has. These people have to begin to learn about electricity in the cosmos. 
the comet 67p churyumov-gerasimenko perhaps the strangest solar system object ever observed up close in the course of the Space Age it was the target of the Rosetta probe whose ten-year journey began in march two thousand four under the sponsorship of the european space agency the probe is now orbiting the nucleus of 67p and investigators hoped to confirm the Comets link to the very origins of our solar system it has long been claimed that comet secreted from a primordial disk of ice and dust out of which the Sun and planets evolved billions of years ago 67p is a short-period comet which means a comet taking less than 20 years to complete an orbit of the Sun the orbit is apparently changed recently due to interactions with Jupiter its current orbital period is just under six and a half years the Rosetta mission was designed to answer critical questions what is the material composition of the nucleus what forces have acted on the nucleus to produce its unique shape how have its surface features evolved and what is its dynamic relationship to the Sun and the solar wind a particular interest will be the analysis of readily vaporized materials volatile such as water ice or carbon dioxide ice the popular model of comets today requires detectable volatile zeeeee because it assumes that comets become active due to warming by the Sun absence of such volatile either on the surface or exploding from beneath the surface would bring an end to a theory that has dominated comet science for more than 60 years thought to resemble a dirty snowball but does this theoretical assumption actually hold what would it mean for example if the Rosetta mission brought comet theorists face to face with a dry rock in space for decades comet investigation has been punctuated largely by surprises but there is a well-supported alternative it does not forbid water ice on comets but doesn't require ice either it is the electric comet hypothesis and it anticipates some profound surprises in the appearance and the behavior of comet 67p it predicts that we will see electrical activity and that this activity will amount to an electro chemical factory creating chemical byproducts that are not native to the nucleus including water as the probe drew close to the nucleus of 67p the shock to mission scientists could not be contained to roughly hewn lobes joined by a thin neck cavernous depressions sharp peaks inspires projecting into space sandy dunes and other bizarre configurations of sand and dust all in the absence of an atmosphere to create them and across the entire surface a field of sharp edged rock like rubble in the vacuum and deep freeze of remote space how could a dirty snowball or an icy dirt ball have slowly accreted into such a profoundly irregular object all from a primitive cloud of ice particles and dust 67p looks like a jumble of fused rock but comet theorists say that appearances could be deceiving us as the Rosetta probe accompanies 67p over the next year it will likely answer that question and a lot more the space sciences as a whole and comet theory in particular are inseparably entwined is it possible that our understanding of comets is mistaken at the theoretical ground floor if so the effects will reach far beyond our ideas about comets and that's a very good reason to follow the evidence wherever it leads you 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info It's an iconic image symbolizing the sum of Mankind's deepest fears, the specter of an enormous rocky  body impacting our planet. In popular fiction, including best-selling books and blockbuster movies, the notion of a planet-destroying asteroid on a trajectory to Earth's orbit is routinely presented as not just possible, but ultimately inevitable. Planetary scientists have told us for many decades that a giant meteoritic impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs and should be regarded, along with anthropogenic global warming, as the greatest threat to the futurity of our planet and species. In fact, in recent months, numerous science headlines have emphasized the urgency with which many scientists perceive this threat. June 30th of this year marked the annual celebration of Asteroid Day, and science websites marked the occasion by arguing the need for greater funding for planetary defense. It appears that this posture has greatly impacted public opinion. According to a recent poll by The Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, Americans now say that the number one priority for the U.S. space program should be defense against asteroids, comets, and meteors. However, behind the perceived threat that asteroids and other cosmic intruders pose, are numerous beliefs that have remained unchallenged, since even prior to the Space Age, the notion of an enormous Rock slamming into our planet is indeed very frightening. After all, the surfaces of rocky planets and moons in our solar system are absolutely riddled with craters, which, according to mainstream science are the result of countless kinetic impacts over eons of time. However, as we will see, for decades science discovery has demanded an entirely new way of seeing so-called 'impact craters' as well as the origin and nature of comets, asteroids, and meteoroids, and the history and future of our own planet. Let us consider first what we should actually expect if an object such as an asteroid or comet closely encounters a planet. On only two occasions in modern times, scientists have had the opportunity to anticipate such an event. In 1994, when the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 approached the planet Jupiter, and again in 2014, when the comet Siding Spring approached Mars. In both instances, the actual observed interactions between the comet and planet were so unexpected, they should have forced a reassessment of the very foundations of Comet theory. Prior to Shoemaker-Levy 9's encounter with Jupiter, some astronomers predicted that the fragments of the comet were too small to have any significant effect when they hit the gas giant planet. The Comet's co-discoverer, the late Eugene Shoemaker stated, "There's a chance we will see very little." Likewise, the renowned astronomer Brian Marsden stated, "It's going to be tough to see much. I don't think there's going to be a very large explosion." But as we have repeatedly  outlined on this series, the comet's apparent electromagnetic influence on the Jovian environment was vastly more dramatic than Standard Theory can ever explain. The anomalies included unusual and energetic auroral activity, immediately after the "impact of the largest comet fragment" as well as the disruption and amazing brightening of radiation belts and unexpected X-ray emissions. As Michael Klein of JPL stated in an analysis of the event, "Never in  23 years of Jupiter observations have we seen such a rapid and intense increase in radio emission... Extra electrons were supplied by a source which is a mystery." In contrast, what planetary scientists had actually expected was that dust debris from the comet would cause the radiation belts to dim. Satellites tracking the comet fragments unveiled yet another mystery. Some so-called collisions that  were projected to occur just beyond Jupiter's limb, which should have been invisible to all but the Galileo spacecraft, were seen by telescopes on our own planet. As NASA's Dr. Andrew Ingersoll stated at the time, "In effect we are apparently seeing something we didn't think we had any right to see." In other words, the electric comet theory would predict dramatic discharge activity high in Jupiter's ionosphere prior to the comet fragments striking the  upper atmosphere. And this is exactly  what was observed. The electrical nature of the event was confirmed by the 3,000 kilometer high vertical jets seen above Jupiter's clouds, which then fell back to the planet to form these mysterious crescent-shaped dark features. Simply put, the error is  to view both the planet Jupiter and approaching  comet fragments as electrically inert. The electrical nature of the event is at least partly affirmed by the data from NASA's Juno mission to the gas giant, including the discovery of electrical potentials in the millions of electron volts which drive Jupiter's aurorae, and a vastly more powerful magnetosphere than standard theory had ever imagined. The Electric Universe theory has always stated that most comet activity comes from the comet which acquires a "negative charge with respect to its environment in its outer reaches of the solar system, discharging electrically as it enters a more positively charged domain." In the case of Shoemaker-Levy 9, when it encountered the incredible magnetosphere of the planet Jupiter, the discharges were unusually catastrophic. Similar lessons can be gleaned from comet Siding Spring's encounter with Mars. NASA's MAVEN spacecraft measured the effects of the comet on the Martian atmosphere. According to a NASA report, "Debris from the comet added a temporary and very strong layer of ions to the ionosphere, the electrically charged layer high above Mars." MAVEN team member Jared Espley  said of the comet's stunning influence, "We think the encounter blew away part of Mars's upper atmosphere, much like a strong solar storm would... The main action took place during the comet's closest approach, but the planet's magnetosphere began to feel some effects as soon as it entered the outer edge of the comet's coma." In fact, the Electric Universe prediction of a negatively charged comet dust tail was recently confirmed. In late 2018, scientists studying the "weird striations" in the dust tail of comet Mcnaught, were amazed to conclude that the dust is "electrically charged," and its motion is dramatically  affected by the solar wind. Of course, even though some asteroids have occasionally, and to the complete surprise of space scientists, produced cometary displays including collimated jets, they are not typically nearly as electrically dynamic as comets, nor does our own planet have nearly the electromagnetic energies seen at a gas giant such as Jupiter. Yet in our electric universe, any intruding body that enters our planet's atmosphere from far away will be differently charged and can thus discharge electrically. Testimony to this fact can be seen in the  dramatic flaring and explosion of a meteor. In fact, in recent years mainstream science has begun to recognize the electromagnetic phenomena intrinsic to meteoritic displays. This includes the unusual radiophonic noise that eye witnesses have reported for many centuries in association  with meteor sightings. While mainstream science still imagines that a meteor's bright glare, flaring, and disintegration is the result of chemical ablation and atmospheric pressure and heating, abundant evidence suggests these phenomena also involve electrical discharge activity. As argued in a 2005 Thunderbolts article by Michael Armstrong and Jim Payette, on the famous Peekskill meteor, "One proposed explanation, with which the Electric Universe would agree, is that meteors trigger the formation of instabilities in plasma layers. The energy of the flickering and flaring, as well as of the low-frequency radiation, comes more from the ionospheric plasma than from the meteoroid. The meteors  that we've come to think of as 'burning up  in the atmosphere' may instead be the targets of mini- thunderbolts from the ionosphere." In fact, this viewpoint finds support in the most renowned meteor explosion in modern times. In 1908, in a remote region of Central Siberia, a blue-white fireball, which some described as brighter than the Sun, exploded with the force of a 10 to 15 Megaton hydrogen bomb. The explosion felled some 60 million trees across an area of 2,000 square kilometers; yet some trees  near the blast center were not burnt and a ring of burnt trees circling the epicenter was left standing. The thunderous sounds were accompanied by a shock wave to knock people off their feet and broke windows hundreds of kilometers away. The explosion registered on seismic stations across Europe and Asia, and as far away as Britain meteorologists registered fluctuations in atmospheric pressure. The resulting pulse of air pressure circled the Earth twice, and astronomers observed for several nights afterwards a glowing red haze in the upper atmosphere, but they were not aware of the cause at the time. Curiously, as noted in the Australian Journal of Astronomy in 1993, the Sir Douglas Mawson expedition in Antarctica reported an extensive auroral display a few hours before the Tunguska event. Many historical accounts also exist of strange weather including lightning and thunder and even seismic activity well before the devastating explosion. Despite occasional claims to the contrary, no impact crater for the intruding body has ever been found nor the remains of an impactor, though some have occasionally claimed to have discovered  Tunguska meteorite fragments. Nevertheless, Tunguska remains officially classified as the largest impact event  ever recorded on Earth. In our Electric Universe, the energy released from an intruding comet, asteroid or meteor, is not limited by its mass and kinetic energy but also the electrical energy due to its charge differential with Earth. This viewpoint also finds support in the largest meteor explosion to have happened on Earth since Tunguska. In 2013, in Russia, initial  estimates coming from the Russian Academy of Sciences stated that the space rock weighed only about 10 tons. However, based on infrasound data from as far away as Greenland and Africa, the rock's estimated size  increased by about 1000 times. In other words, the actual  energies produced in the event were exponentially higher than the visual evidence would have suggested. Although the explosion shattered windows and produced other structural damage, and many hundreds of human beings were injured, not a single person was killed in the event. From the Electric Universe perspective, intruding comets and asteroids do indeed pose  a threat to human life, but the havoc these bodies might wreak will likely be limited to localized disasters, perhaps a series of Tunguska- like events producing regional devastation with falls of sand and dust. Perhaps electrical craters, fires, and earthquakes, but not necessarily any single impact crater at all. Indeed, we cannot overemphasize the need  for planetary scientists to completely reassess the theory of planetary cratering. The craters we see on planetary surfaces routinely defy impact theory. Instead, we see unique forms that have been reproduced in decades of laboratory experiments with electrical discharge; including crater chains, weird hexagonal craters, craters with concentric circles, impossibly huge craters, aligned craters, and  so-called bull's-eye craters. The massively cratered surfaces we see on rocky bodies like the Moon, Mercury, and the dwarf planet Ceres, were not the result of periodic impacts over eons of time. We have proposed they were the result of interplanetary electrical discharges in a relatively recent epoch of planetary instability. Ironically, it was these catastrophic events recorded in prehistory which embedded in human consciousness the fear of Doomsday's inevitable reoccurrence. But in our Electric Universe, the utterly hopeless projections of Standard Cosmology, from our Sun's nuclear fuel extinguishing and the Sun collapsing, to the ultimate fate of the Universe, ending in a big freeze or heat death, to a giant space rock smashing into our planet and obliterating human life; are not only not inevitable, they have little to no scientific foundation at all. In our Electric Universe, doomsday is a traumatic memory in need of healing, and the future of Mankind, planet Earth, and indeed the entire Universe, remains unwritten. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info Today, we continue our exploration of the early scientific data from NASA's historic Parker Solar Probe mission to the Sun. In part one, Dr. Donald Scott began his analysis of some of the most intriguing early findings, including the probe's "unexpected" detection of magnetic reversals as it moved in the plasma solar environment. As one new report describes, "Unexpectedly, the probe also detected a series of flips in the Sun's magnetic fields -- dubbed "switchbacks" -- as streaming winds of plasma flowed past the spacecraft. During these periods, the magnetic field suddenly reversed itself by 180 degrees and then, seconds to hours later, flipped back." As Dr. Scott continues, he explains why the so-called "switchbacks" could be the telltale signs of the Birkeland currents hypothesized by the Electric Sun model. In describing the switchbacks, or magnetic reversals the Parker Probe has seen, press release stated, "These reversals happen at a high rate of occurrence. That high rate is surprising. In fact the nature of these structures remains unknown. Well, we can help them with that, I think, but anyway, we know that the Parker Probe is traveling at a speed of approximately 430 thousand miles an hour. That's fast, it's in fact, it's a hundred ninety kilometers per second. And so, in a couple of minutes, the probe travels about 15,000 kilometers, so that distance could very well be the thickness of one of the layers in the Birkeland current which would be the cause of those magnetic reversals, as it goes through the Birkeland current. The press release also announced that, close to the Sun the solar wind seems to get sped up by powerful "rogue waves" that move through the magnetic field. The quote from the press release states, "We'd suddenly see a spike in the flow, where in just a couple of seconds the solar wind would start flowing at 300,000 miles an hour faster." That's about a hundred and thirty-four kilometers per second increase in the speed of the solar wind that they're observing, and if the velocity of the wind is about 400 kilometers a second, the press release said they were doubling the speed, it's not quite doubling, also they quote, they said there are jets of plasma in these streamers. Well, I maintain, the increases in the solar wind speed may indeed be caused by double layers. Now, in the past, our viewers have seen this image that I've included here, of what a double layer looks like. So just to refresh the viewer, there are three plots there. The top graph is the voltage that we would measure as a function of radius distance out from the Sun, so you can see that the voltage is dropping rather precipitously from point c to d to e, and that results in the middle plot which is the electric field that is produced by that sharp drop in voltage. Now, there's nothing mysterious about that electric field. It's just the force on a positive ion and if the electric field is positive, as you see it, there it is, that means that the force on that positive ion is outward, in the positive direction. Outward from the Sun, is the positive direction. So, the bottom plot there is the plot of the charge distribution that would be there to cause what those other two plots look like. That's from Maxwell's equations, but if we look at the charge distribution there, you can see that there are two spherical shells, one of positive ions and then right on top of that, a shell of negative charges, mostly probably electrons. And that's why it's called a double layer, the plus and the minus layer are right there together. And there are two different spherical shells in that double layer, the inner half, the inner one is positive, and the outer half is negative. And in between, in the center of that, that the layer is at, is an extremely strong electric field. Now, that electric field, if it's strong enough, can actually rip apart any charged intruder into the double layer. So the SAFIRE experiment, that everybody has been hearing about, it has worked out so well for us, that experiment produced an image of a whole series of these double layers surrounding the anode, the Sun, and the most powerful one is right there above the, or actually on the surface of the anode, and that's completely consistent with Juergens' Electric Sun model, because that's the photosphere, that's where the sunspots all happen and in that double layer there, all sorts of things occur. And then, as you go out from that layer outward from the Sun, the double layers get dimmer and weaker, you can see them finally disappear off in the distance. And we don't see any of those double layers around the Sun with our eyes or with telescopes now, simply because they're, if they're there, they're in the dark mode of plasma operation, they're in the same mode of plasma operation that surrounds the North Pole of the Earth and it's dark mode, we don't see that either. Unless, of course, there's an Aurora at which time the plasma jumps into the glow mode, and as it did in that photograph that Monty so kindly sent us. But normally, it's not visible, it's a dark mode plasma and so are those double layers around the Sun. Also, and things are happening very quickly these days, in a new paper entitled "Probing the energetic particle environment near the Sun," the authors seem to acknowledge that magnetic reconnection can't actually explain some of the effects they're observing. I was waiting, predicting that we would hear about magnetic reconnection but I'm very pleased that they have essentially written that off, at least in this paper. And they said instead, "We find a variety of energetic particle events accelerated both locally and remotely including by co-rotating interaction regions, and impulsive events driven by acceleration near the Sun, and an event related to a coronal mass ejection." But so, they used the word co-rotating and I wonder if, by using the word co-rotating, did they actually mean counter-rotating? Nothing more was said and so, we'll have to wait to see what they have discovered, but they've discovered, everything that they have discovered is certainly explainable by Birkeland currents. Also, incidentally, regarding the question of how all those other elements get onto the face of the Sun, that we discussed earlier, one of the most important results of the SAFIRE team was their discovery that in their electrical plasma discharge, and we remember that was in a hydrogen atmosphere, just like the Sun, it's hydrogen. The transmutation of elements occurs, that's the kind of process that the old prehistoric alchemists were looking, they wanted to change lead into gold or something like that. They've actually, SAFIRE has done it in microscopic amounts, but they've done it. So that in a plasma discharge, hydrogen apparently can give birth to a long list of other elements, not just water, that were not there before the discharge started. So that may well be how those other elements got onto the Sun and get onto the Sun as we speak. And the point is, fairy dust has nothing to do with it. 
We begin with a brief history of geometry. Why is it that within every great philosopher astronomer, or scientist, there lies a great  geometer? It seems that the geometer turns astronomer, or astronomer turns geometer, and  vice versa. The classic definition of geometer is a mathematician whose area of study is geometry. Now think about it. You have Plato and the Platonic solids; the sound of the spheres or Musica Universalis; and the theory of first-principle-geometry being taught that all atoms and material is formed out of nested Platonic solids spinning. You have Archimedes and Archimedean solids as well as the Archimedean  spirals. There are others, such as the pre-Socratic philosopher Anaxagoras from around 467 BCE who theorized his vortex motion of the Universe in his book, “The Nature of Things”. Johannes Kepler was a strong believer in geometry and tried to prove the five platonic solids must be related to the structure of the Universe. This idea was announced in his cosmographic mystery published in 1596. The mathematical study of vortices continues with James Clark Maxwell's vortex analogy of the electromagnetic field and Lord Calvin’s theory that atoms were vortex rings in an all-pervading ether. There are so many more examples like Pythagoras, Euclid and the father  of geometry, Apollonius of Perga. It seems that the spiral shape is at the core of the structure of the Universe. The whirlpool or the water spiral is a part of worldwide folklore and it is a magical and religious symbol for the origins of life and energy. Whirlpools are considered gates to the netherworlds. Ancient lore has it that whirlwinds provide circuitry for gods, demons and witches. In the old testament, whirlwinds are described as a direct connection to us, mere mortals. For example, ”Then the Lord  answered Job out of the whirlwind.” And “Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.” In 1835, here we have Eugenio Beltrami and the Beltrami vortex. This is the geometry of what we in the Electric Universe refer to as Birkeland Currents. Also what Don Scott did the math of a force-free field-aligned current and the same exact behavior as Marklund convection, as well as the German concept of the ether ”zitterbewegung”. In physics the zitterbewegung, jittery motion in German, is the predicted rapid oscillatory motion of elementary particles. Speaking of electromagnetism being the primal organizer of elements along cylindrical coaxial filaments, will hop directly into artist Dr. Walter Russell’s work. You can see the same, or similar things, as Birkeland Currents, and the multiple vortex of tornadic winds that Andy Hall describes in his “Eye of the Storm” series. We also have Viktor Schauberger's work, here showing longitudinal vortexes. What's more is it's showing the double spiral longitudinal vortexes here. Now observe the similarities of the Doherty set, even down to the toroidal construction of the double helical minimal energy filament itself. So, what exactly is the Doherty set? The Doherty set is an emergent, first principle, magnetohydrodynamic geometry. Magnetohydrodynamics is the study of the magnetic properties and behavior of electrically conducting fluids. Examples  of such magnetofluids include plasmas, liquid metals, salt water and electrolytes. How can we validate what the Doherty set is? Easy, by using the inverse square law. The inverse square law shows that light, electromagnetic radiation, gravity, and  electricity, all obey the same scaling rule. The Doherty set is, among other things, a  series of cascading spherical pressure gradients. The projective super geometry is a simplex. But it is nonetheless doing only one thing, which is repeating the initial Bessel function, iteratively, over and over again, like a beating drum, recursively building up progressive geometry, along an interconnected chain-like so-called space- time or more accurately, a plasma fractal. Yes, Birkeland Currents are fractal. A fractal is a curve or geometric figure, each part of which has the same statistical character as the whole. Fractals are useful in modeling structures, such as eroded coastlines, or  snowflakes in which similar patterns recur at progressively smaller scales, and in describing partly random, or chaotic phenomena, such as crystal growth, fluid turbulence, and galaxy formation. The Doherty set can be thought of like the Mandelbrot set, but instead of exploring the complex and imaginary fields and fractions, this scalable geometry exposes plasma, or ether, or what mainstream cosmologists refer to as the just mentioned space time, to be fractal. Speaking of fractals, let's look at the Mueller set. The Mueller fractal is the basis of global scaling developed by Hartmut Mueller. We can  observe the similarities here and how octaves as well as harmonies of sound also abide by similar scaling laws. So one might intuitively assume that fundamentally, on every scale there must exist this wave-nested-within-wave behavior and  indeed, that is exactly what the Doherty set is. Is it possible, that in a Universe of electromagnetic induction, the Doherty set is the master key of electromagnetism itself? And in the big picture, perhaps the geometry of the Electric Universe model? I met professor Donald E. Scott at the Thunderbolts EU 2017 conference, for the sole purpose of showing him my cartographs and geometry. Don was baffled and exclaimed that I discovered it before him, which we will find out. Many people were on to this idea before us, so I then gave my whole body of work to Don Scott for a review and he said quote, ”Buddy, I have examined (I believe all) the links and YouTube videos you sent me. They are quite impressive because you are clearly able to include the wild complexity of what the interior structure of a Birkeland (force-free, field-aligned current) would look like, if we were able to get inside one.” ”Nice work. I see that you are aware of the complex structure that my model says is inside a Birkeland Current. But, in another sense the overall property is quite simple: it is a set of concentric spirals whose pitch angle increases smoothly and continuously with radial distance.” It is important to understand that the words ‘helix’ and ‘vortex’ are not the same. They are not synonymous. A helix is a twisting spiral path, wrapped around a cylinder. Example. A rope wound around an infinitely long pipe. That is the shape of a Birkeland Current. On the other hand, a vortex is also a twisting spiral path, but it is like a rope wound around a cone. It is a finite length, not infinitely long. All vortices come to a point. They are not like a Birkeland Current, many of which are light years in length. Marklund convection is a physical process that goes on in a certain class of Birkeland Current. It depends on there being actual charged particles and electric fields present to interact with each other. A process is very different from a shape, but a shape can also be many processes. Now, let's compare all of this to the spiral Periodic Table of Elements. Here's  Walter Russell's Periodic Table of Elements. And here is the Doherty Periodic Table of Elements. Have a look-see at the meandering of the wave crest and wave trough. ”We are all electric creatures floating in the electric sea of this electric  universe. In more simple words, we might say everything in the Universe is trying to become every other thing; and every condition of everything is trying to become every other condition.” The Universe indeed seems to be mimicry on all scales, everything becoming everything else. Lest we forget James Clark Maxwell himself was a great geometer. Just look at the skills of this cartographer. He is a map maker and an excellent one at that. We are all mapping it out in one way or another. Ah yes, hopf fibrations, spinors, and twistor theory which fundamentally use Maxwell's equations. Look at the similarities there. We have to do a brief on British physicist Tony Skyrme, or at least his work on skyrmions which are theorized to be the structure of ball lightning. ”These objects are quite intricate from a geometric point of view,” said Dr. Sugic. "They resemble a complex system of interlocking  rings, with the hole forming a particle-like structure. What’s particularly interesting is  the skyrmion's topological properties - they can be distorted, stretched or squeezed, but will not come apart. This robustness is one of the properties that scientists are most interested in exploiting.” If this is true, and these structures are inherent in the Doherty set, this gives more credence to the predictive power of the set to show off the inner and outer interactions of skyrmion behavior, and a seemingly infinite amount of applied combinatorics. What these examples show, is magnetic and electromagnetic behavior exhibiting precise geometries. We can even think of it as a  toroidal node, a filamental Universe. It is all double helical, but it is helical because of its toroidal construction, and this idea is true on all scales. ”Most  of the so-called laws of nature are habits.” Idea and memory is constructed within the self-descriptive circuit, along with being and form. The field creates the form. Higher order magnitudes of this integrated information system build up cascading morphic resonance, or morphogenetic  fields. These are quaternion, just like the construction of baryonic matter and cell  growth, as well as multiplicity in living systems. In mathematics, the Cayley-Dickson construction named after Arthur Cayley and Leonard Dixon, produces a sequence of algebras over  a field of real numbers, each with twice the dimension of the previous one. The number of filaments, nested inside of filaments, nested inside of filaments, is a Cayley-Dickson construction. This nesting behavior is indicative of coaxial cables and filaments as well. Getting back into it, we have Benoit Mandelbrot and the fractal revolution which directly led to the telecommunication and computing age with the introduction of fractal antennas. Nature is fractal, communication is fractal, electricity is fractal. Think fractals, filaments, frequencies – f f f. In music, three f’s is a fortissimo, meaning very, very  loud. I find it very pertinent, because this is indeed a very loud message to the world. There is a fractality to everything. We are the break in the symmetry. Iterative, constructive and destructive feedback loops integrate coherent harmonic circuitry. Worded differently, coherence or consciousness in the ether is geometric and is composed of a series of fractal feedback loops. As self-organizing systems, our integrated  information circuitry is inter-scalar. This is a gestalt-type of thinking - the parts are related to the whole and the whole is related to the parts type of ideation. Geometry, and especially the Doherty set play an interdisciplinary role in our lives, everyday phenomena, and the progression of human knowledge. It is self-evident that geometry is a critical component of the Electric Universe model of cosmology. 
welcome to space news from the electric universe brought to you by the thunderbolts project at Thunderbolts dot info a new scientific paper describes an ongoing mystery astronomers are facing in the atmosphere of Venus in 2006 the European Space Agency's satellite Venus Express arrived at Venus and recorded the astonishing images of a twin cyclone above the planets South Pole for reasons that mainstream astronomers have yet to explain the structure of the so-called super storm constantly evolves and the vortex itself is thought to be a permanent feature however this puzzle may not be the greatest challenge the extraordinary Venusian atmosphere poses to planetary scientists scientists have found from spacecraft orbiting Venus for the last six years that there is an unexplained twin cyclone at the planet South Pole and various headlines are given to this Venus cyclone constantly changes in planets bizarre atmosphere scientists find Venus vortices go for chaotic multi-story strolls around the poles says another and a third says whirl winds wander around Venus's South Pole now there's a mystery that's been known for many years now about Venus's atmosphere and that is that it rotates 60 times faster than the planet and there is no known driving mechanism that can perform this amazing feat now in the electric universe model of the solar system there is an input to all of the planets which it goes unrecognized by atmospheric scientists and that is the electrical input from the sun's circuit and when you have electricity being fed into a circuit it can drive motors and it can cause rotation now in the case of Venus it's obvious that something is driving that atmosphere 60 times faster than the planet and it's not coming from inside the planet even though it is super hot and it's not coming from the Sun because if you look at the outermost planets of the solar system you will find that the fastest winds in the solar system are on the outermost planet Neptune where winds have been clocked at a thousand kilometres an hour so there's obviously a driving mechanism that just doesn't feature in any theory or model of how planets atmospheres work and this has significance also for the earth and the discussions about climate change there's an energy input which isn't being factored in to the climate change argument the report states the vortex is never destroyed but it evolves continuously between morphologies or shapes the cause for the constant evolution remains a puzzle that the team still hopes to solve well the thing is that the fact that the morphology changes but the basic vortex is never destroyed is primary evidence for the fact that it is a twin filament electric current that is impinging on the Polar's of Venus the same type of phenomenon seen at Venus's South Pole is found elsewhere in the solar system and is a predictable feature of the electric universe in 2005 when scientists using the Keck Observatory discovered a warm vortex at the South Pole of Saturn Thornhill made a prediction that could only seemed preposterous from a conventional viewpoint he wrote the electric universe predicts experiment and Cruces that both poles should be hot not one hot and the other cold in 2008 NASA's Cassini scientists were astonished to discover a mysterious hotspot at Saturn's North Pole this was astonishing because the freezing North Pole had been deprived of sunlight for over 12 years the interesting thing about the form of the tornadoes at both poles because earlier such a twin tornado was discovered at the north pole of Venus in 2005 I wrote about Saturn saying that the hot South Pole would be found to be mirrored by the northern pole which had been in darkness for 14 years and that that would be a crucial test of the electrical power input model you see the power or the electrical connection of the Sun to the planets occurs generally at the poles in the Earth's case we see that in the form of Aurora's and when the Sun is particularly active you will see powerful Aurora's which extend down to lower latitudes also you will notice in Aurora's that the movement is remarkably changeable and sudden now this is the one of the features of the twinging cyclones at the poles of Venus now the other thing I pointed out in the earlier article was that when the twin vortex was discovered at the North Pole of Venus it had the same shape as would be expected from an electrical current connection to the pole of Venus now the reason I say that is that plasma cosmologists and plasma scientists know that electric currents flow in a plasma that is the thin conducting medium that occupies the entire solar system and the entire universe for that matter it is the conducting medium when an electric current flows through that medium you will get filaments formed and you've all seen that kind of thing in the novelty plasma balls and one of the things you notice about the plasma balls is that the current inside those spheres flows in filaments and that those filaments if you look closely at the ends of them appear to be twisting not only that they move about as if they're almost alive and this is one of the features mentioned in the report about the south polar vortexes on Venus because with six years of looking at the south polar vortex it's been shown that the movement is always of two centers two cyclones moving around and often connected by some kind of filament between the two and that that motion is chaotic so it has all the features of that you'd expect from the kinds of filaments you see in a globally plasma ball for continuous updates on space news from the electric universe stay tuned to Thunderbolts dot info 
You just entered the theater of an alien sky. If the words and images seem strange to you, there's a reason for this, our world was once a vastly different place. To experience this, won't hurt you, and there is nothing to fear. The Lovely and Terrible Goddess In all of the discourses in this series, one question has dominated. The question concerns the monumental civilizations that emerged so suddenly and unpredictably, just a few thousand years ago. As scientists and historians delve into the early cultures from ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, to China and the Americas, the greatest challenge is almost never addressed, how do we explain the mythic archetypes, the global patterns? As we've noted repeatedly in this series, not one of the early civilizations was free from this remarkable sub structure of human thought. A profound sense of connection to the earliest remembered time, called the first time. A time of celestial splendor when visible gods ruled the heavens. A lost paradise or golden age on Earth. A towering temple or city or kingdom in the sky. A celestial Heliopolis, Sumer, or Jerusalem. A model in heaven to inspire construction of sacred dwellings on Earth. A cosmic mountain rising along the world axis as if to support the luminous dwelling of the Gods. A primeval Sun God at the summit, not the body we call Sun today, but a power claimed to have ruled the sky in a former age of gods and wonders. Why did Greek chroniclers so consistently identify the celestial founder of the golden age as Kronos, the Latin planet god Saturn? And for what unearthly reason would Greek astronomers have also named this very power as Helios, the Sun? It is all preposterous, and yet the collective memories still tug at us, calling us to remember, pointing to patterns of historical fact that challenge every common opinion today about the past. The archetypes are the permanent backdrop to every civilization on Earth. We know that all of the early cultures obsessively feared a fiery serpent, or dragon whose attack on the World brought humanity to the edge of extinction. And how strange that story tellers everywhere knew also the story of a cosmic warrior rising to subdue that very monster. These are not just loosely defined expressions of human anxiety. As we've seen: the details are concrete and the parallels are worldwide. The pervasive theme of the attacking serpent or dragon must have an explanation. Mere accident of human thought could never have achieved the global influence of this human memory. No intellectual mistake could be greater than ignoring this convergence of human memories. The remembered events are not occurring in our own time. Today's world, today’s sky, could not have provoked a single mythic or symbolic archetype. And that's the heart of a profound mystery. The archetypal sub structure exists and has been documented across hundreds of global themes. This can only mean that something fundamental and indispensable to scientific understanding, has been overlooked. To follow this question into the heart of the ancient world, it's well worth considering one archetype in particular, taking us back to the first stirrings of the great civilizations. I'm referring here to the aged mother goddess. In particular the polar opposites expressed in the goddess's underlying identity. How did a mythic archetype, a goddess revered as the source of life and light and feminine charm, come to display a darker aspect as a world threatening monster, the prototype of the wicked queen? A goddess originally celebrated as the exemplary star, the beautiful Queen of Heaven? What could account for the transformation of that very goddess into a shrieking witch or hag, whose wildly disordered streaming hair stretched across the sky? Cross-cultural comparison has answered the question. The paradoxical opposites take us back to one and the same power in the heavens. The Love Goddess and the Terrible Goddess turn out to be not just one and the same mythic figure, but one and the same planet, the planet Venus. In fact, the only planet among five visible planets to be given a feminine identity. Don't believe in accidents; that paradox has never been resolved and will not go away. It requires something yet to be recognized in standard treatments of the mother goddess. Just consider, the horrifying Medusa figure was a classic symbol of terror, but Greek historians and poets knew that Medusa was originally a form of stunning beauty. That's the paradox in a nutshell, and it traces to the very beginnings of civilization, where in ancient Mesopotamia, we observed the transformation of the Sumerian love goddess Inanna into a shrieking dragon attacking the world. The same transformation occurs in ancient Egypt in the story titled "The Destruction of Mankind." Here we see the beautiful goddess Sekhmet transformed into the fiery world-threatening Uraeus serpent. How are we to explain this ancient paradox? Such unsolved mysteries invite us to question our assumptions. And one assumption in particular has held students of planetary history in its grip for well over a hundred years. That assumption began as a guess, and it remains just a guess across the 20th century and into the 21st century. The theoretical assumption proclaims: “As today, so before.The present is the key to the past.” Call it the Uniformity Principle: nothing to see here. It just assumes that the positions and relative motions of the planets have remained constant for millions of years, even billions of years some would say. Today, this uniformity principle is the greatest obstacle to discovery. It systematically precludes any understanding of our more ancient past. Even in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, the Uniformity Principle deflects our attention away from the collective memories that drove the emergence of the early civilizations. No mistake could be more costly than to ignore the global consensus, the archetypal substructure beneath the surface details and contradictions of the archaic cultures. This substructure is a bedrock of cross-cultural agreement, and it requires us to consider events that are not occurring today. The Uniformity Principle cannot be valid in approaches to ancient history. Our purpose in this series is to show that every known mythic archetype finds its place in the emergence and catastrophic evolution of a gathering of planets close to the Earth. No selective perception required. We've called this ancient planetary assembly the Polar Configuration. This gathering of planets was the centerpiece of the anciently remembered Age of Gods and Wonders. Within this framework, the global imagery of the mother goddess connects us directly to the origins, the dynamic activity, and the ultimate fate of the Venus goddess. One planet alone meets the acid test, drawing our attention to the electrically discharging sphere seen visually in front of and close to the center of a much larger sphere, named in the astronomical traditions as the planet Saturn. And within the very same context the Venus goddess stood in a profound alignment with the smaller, darker and reddish sphere, named globally as the planet Mars, the prototype of the warrior hero. That's the mother goddess paradox that we will explore in the two episodes to follow. Always look for the underlying form! 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info Scientists today are expressing their surprise over the detection of water deposits on an asteroid that is thought to be pure metal. The asteroid is called 16 Psyche, and it's described as a largest metallic asteroid in the solar system. The co-author of a new paper on the asteroid says of the discovery: "We did not expect a metallic asteroid like Psyche to be covered by water and/or hydroxyl. Metal-rich asteroids like Psyche are thought to have formed under dry conditions without the presence of water or hydroxyl, so we were puzzled by our observations at first." The authors of the paper have suggested that the water was delivered by impacts from other asteroids in 16 Psyche's past. However, they have also considered the possibility that the water was formed by solar wind interactions with silicates on the asteroid's surface. In previous Space News episodes, Dr. Franklin Anariba, a specialist in electrochemistry, has proposed that a similar mechanism may be responsible for the detection of water molecules at Comet 67P. Today, we asked Dr. Anariba for his analysis of this new discovery. [Dr. Franklin Anariba] Observations indicate that comets and even asteroids appear to us to behave unexpectedly. This is partly due to the lack of complete understanding of cometary phenomena due to its complexity. I've previously proposed the presence of 3 competing mechanisms in action in cometary bodies for the identification of water and other organic volatiles. These are: 1. Sublimation of volatiles from the nucleus due to solar radiation. This option applies once their presence on the surface of the nucleus has been confirmed. 2. Water formation on the surface of refractory materials, such as silicates, due to proton implantation through the solar wind. 3. Water and organic material formation driven electrochemically. This is realistic since charge separation, voltage differentials, the presence of electric fields, and ion re-concentration due to the electric fields, have been reported, which allows for a serious consideration of the mechanism. Recently, it was published that asteroid 16 Psyche, which consists of mostly Fe-Ni metal and is thought to be the largest metallic asteroid in the solar system, may have traces of water molecules on its surface. The authors find that near infrared absorption features in the proximity of 3,000 nanometers, can be attributed to the presence of water or hydroxyl ion. This is particularly relevant because a similar phenomenon was reported to be present on the surface of the Moon: "The Deep Impact observations of the Moon not only unequivocally confirm the presence of OH or H2O on the lunar surface, but also reveal that the entire lunar surface is hydrated during at least some portions of the lunar day." Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that this phenomenon is also hydrating asteroid 16 Psyche. Within the framework of a neutral medium, the corresponding reactions can be thought of as gas/gas reactions if they occur above the surface and gas/solid interface reactions if they occur on the surface, which is nominally called proton implantation. Collision theory can explain both reactions, mostly driven by kinetic energy gained by the particles from the solar wind or solar radiation. The authors state: "... the detection of a three-micrometer absorption band suggests that Psyche may not be metallic core, or it could be metallic core that has been impacted by carbonaceous material over the past 4.5 billion years." The infrared data is not clear-cut in term of the definite presence of impacts over such a long period of time, but it's likely that such a statement is a reflection of the current dominant paradigm. In a non-neutral medium, one where there is the existence of a dynamic voltage differential giving rise to non-zero electric fields, charged particles such as hydroxyl (OH-) and proton (H+) can gain kinetic energy from electric fields, resulting in the re-concentration of ions along the electric fields. Due to opposite polarities, these charged particles will be attracted to one another, and if their guiding electric fields cross paths, one can imagine a rapid and turbulent gas/gas reaction taking place, which could lead to large quantities of instantaneous water formation. In the absence of solar radiation or heat, these water molecules can migrate, redistribute and condensate on surfaces. Nonetheless, of particular importance is that the surface of comet 67P contains both the presence of small amount of water on its surface and carbonaceus materials. These are facts. And perhaps the same mechanism is at action on both bodies; asteroid 16 Psyche and Comet 67P. For continuous updates on Space News from the Electric Universe stay tuned to Thunderbolts.info 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info For the last 5 years on this series we have presented a vast library of evidence for the role of electromagnetism throughout the cosmos. Though institutional science still insists that gravity is king, gravity-centric cosmology has faced an ever-growing crisis in light of countless baffling discoveries. With no explanation for the origins of cosmic magnetic fields, cosmologists have little left but to resort to random collisions, explosions and gravitational collapse. But if gravity is not king, what is the best evidence for the dominant role of electromagnetism in the astrophysical phenomena? In commemoration of the 5 year anniversary of this series, we begin our summation of arguably the top 10 points of evidence which most clearly point to an electric universe. Cosmic magnetic fields It's a fact known to every high school physics student, electric currents produce magnetic fields. But this law of physics is almost nowhere evident in the standard Astrophysical literature. In fact with ever finer technological data the influence of pervasive powerful magnetic fields at all scales throughout the cosmos has been one of the great surprises of the Space Age. Although astronomers have had no choice but to acknowledge the existence of magnetic fields in space, it's important to keep an historical context and remember the predictions of the standard gravity centric cosmology. Consider the following excerpt from the early online NASA feature Dr. Magneto's questions and answers, archived in the official NASA website. On the question, do magnetic fields exist throughout space, the answer reads as follows: "On the cosmological scale, there is no data to suggest that magnetic fields are present. They certainly are not important in the dynamics of the universe for any reasonable range of field strengths consistent with present observational constraints." But fast-forward to 2011 and the undeniable conundrum is acknowledged in the Universe Today article. It states, "The mention of cosmic-scale magnetic fields is still likely to be met with an uncomfortable silence in some astronomical circles -- and after a bit of foot- shuffling and throat clearing, the discussion will be moved on to safer topics. But look, they're out there. They probably do play a role in galaxy evolution, if not galaxy formation -- and are certainly a feature of the interstellar medium and the intergalactic medium." But what causes these magnetic fields which astronomers and astrophysicists had long believed to be "not important"? To answer this question, let us consider some of the scientific discoveries which clearly affirm the electrical interpretation of cosmic scale magnetic fields. A great shock for scientists came in 2008 with the detection of an astonishingly powerful magnetic field in a so-called young galaxy. A Phys.org report on the discovery reads, "Astronomers have made the first direct measurement of the magnetic field in a young distant galaxy, and the result is a big surprise. Looking at a faraway proto galaxy seen as it was 6.5 billion years ago, the scientists measured a magnetic field at least 10 times stronger than that of our own Milky Way. They had expected just the opposite." And of course, ever finer data across the entire electromagnetic spectrum only deepens the so-called mysteries. In 2014, a comprehensive study was published on the, so called, supermassive black holes that are believed to exist at the centers of galaxies. Scientists made the unexpected discovery that powerful magnetic fields play a significant role in the dynamics of the systems. A Phys.org report on the study states, "The magnetic field strength was confirmed by evidence from jets of gas that shoot away from supermassive black holes. Formed by magnetic fields, these jets produce a radio emission... the new results mean theorists must re-evaluate their understanding of black hole behavior." A contributor to the research stated, "The magnetic fields are strong enough to dramatically alter how gas falls into black holes and how gas produces outflows that we do observe, much stronger than what has usually been assumed... We need to go back and look at our models once again." However, as we will explain as we continue with this list, the standard assumptions about the sources of cosmic jets are also severely challenged by science discovery. The real problem astronomers and astrophysicists face is succinctly summarized in a Scholarpedia page on the origins of galactic magnetic fields. It states, "The origin of the first magnetic fields of the Universe is still a mystery... It calls for a mechanism to sustain and organize the magnetic field." At a smaller scale in our own celestial neighborhood, scientists call on mysterious internal dynamos to explain the magnetic fields of planets and the Sun. Dynamos are also now proposed inside of galaxies to explain the galactic magnetic fields. But plasma cosmologists have shown theoretically and experimentally that the magnetic fields in galaxies are due to electric currents flowing into the centers along the spiral arms of the galaxies. It's proposed that, when the current reaches the center of the galaxy, it's twisted into an object called a plasmoid where all of the electromagnetic energy is stored until the plasmoid becomes unstable and ejects matter in jets along the galaxy axis as observed in deep space. Many of these concepts were published in understandable terms in the book, The Big Bang Never Happened. In plasma physics, the plasmoid is the most concentrated form of electromagnetic energy known. As proven experimentally, a plasmoid can store the energy of a room full of capacitors, in its tiny doughnut shaped form only a few millimeters across. To contain that energy, that plasmoid has an intense magnetic field, self generated by electric currents twisting themselves together. In our own solar system the electric universe predicts and explains many of the ongoing surprises for scientists investigating planetary magnetic fields. In the last year, scientists reporting the findings of two major NASA missions to the gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn respectively, have shattered all assumptions about the powerful magnetic fields and those planets' highly electrified environments. The predictions of the theory that an internal dynamo deep inside of Jupiter produces the planet's magnetic field, have been falsified by NASA's Juno mission. Instead, the magnetic field is both much more powerful and "irregular than scientists had ever imagined." If such an invisible dynamo does exist then, as Juno scientists admit, it would have to be much closer to the planet's surface than theory can explain. As Juno principal investigator Scott Bolton stated, "I didn't expect all the theories to be wrong, but there's motion going on in the planet we did not anticipate." Saturn's magnetic field has proved equally perplexing to scientists on the Cassini mission. A major shock was the discovery that the planet's magnetic field appears to have no discernable tilt. As reported by Imperial College London, "Based on data collected by Cassini's magnetometer instrument, Saturn's magnetic field appears to be surprisingly well aligned with the planet's rotation axis. Previously, mission scientists thought that 0.06 degrees would be the lower limit of tilt that could generate the observed magnetic field. However, the results show the tilt may be much less than this. Scientists currently think that planetary magnetic fields require some degree of tilt in order to sustain currents flowing through the liquid metal deep inside the planets. With no tilt, the currents would eventually subside and the field would disappear." The leader of Cassini's magnetometer, professor Michele Dougherty, said of the discovery, "The tilt seems to be much smaller than we had previously estimated and quite challenging to explain." So if, like Jupiter, Saturn's magnetic field is not generated by an internal dynamo, what causes and maintains the magnetic fields? In the Electric Universe, both gas giants are electrically charged bodies that are part of the larger electrical circuits connecting them to the Sun. In fact, in 2016, scientists reported their first observation of so-called magnetic ropes traversing the vast distance between the Sun and Saturn and connecting the two bodies. The lead author of a paper in the Geophysical Research Letters says of the finding, "Contrary to previous ideas about Saturn's magnetosphere being unlike its terrestrial counterpart, these findings reveal that Saturn at times behaves and interacts with the Sun in much the same way as Earth." But how can the fluid dynamics the NASA envisions explain, "rope-like structures that twist and change dynamically" and extend to nearly 900 million miles from the Sun to Saturn? The phrase "magnetic ropes" is used to describe twisted filamentary pathways traversed by charged particles. But, to electrical engineers, such terminology reveals the inappropriateness of concepts that came to dominate astronomy and astrophysics in the 20th century. As Professor Donald Scott, author of the Electric Sky, states; "Ropes, of course, have beginnings and ends. Magnetic fields do not... (T)his use of language from NASA fails to explain anything, and is conceptually wrong as well as misleading." The "ropes" to which the investigators refer are commonly described in plasma science as electrical Birkeland Currents. The rope-like structure is not merely a curiosity. It's the structure, taken by current flow, due to the long-range attraction and short-range repulsion between current filaments. The "twisted magnetic fields" are simply the signature of the electric current flow. In plasma cosmology these entwined plasma filaments act as transmission lines carrying "field aligned currents" across interplanetary and interstellar space. In recent years, professor Donald Scott has published his own mathematical modeling of the structure of a Birkeland Current which can be visually identified as counter rotating cylinders. Critically, this counter rotation is clearly seen at the north poles of both Saturn and Jupiter. In our next episode, the question of the true source of cosmic magnetic fields will be further explored as we investigate the pervasiveness of filamentary structures throughout the universe: the second of our ten reasons why the universe is electric.

Welcome to the Electricity of Life, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info Here is some footage of a tadpole embryo from Tufts University's Levin Lab for regenerative medicine. Electrical gradients have been made visible and we can see that they precede the development features of the tadpole's face and body. The relevance of electric frontiers in biology is no small matter. Planaria regenerate their tail end into a second head. Tadpole is bioelectrically modified to grow additional eyes, genetically altered, so that a particular frequency of blue light would stimulate ion regulators in their cell walls. This allowed electric gradients in their body to be precisely changed to match the electrical characteristics that cue the body to grow all the tissues required for an eye. This is the leading edge of knowledge in the science of how life forms on Earth. Use electricity to shape or instruct the tissues of their body. The significance of these bioelectric principles can be understood from fellow scientists who have been amazed by their implications. Some animals are known for the regeneration of whole appendages. The scientists who come to take part in explorations at the Levin Lab, use experiments and computer modeling to learn what conditions are needed for natural regeneration. Their experiments touch on several paths for future medicine all informed by how a body's infrastructure of bioelectricity makes executive decisions. Change the voltage exerted upon cell membranes and you can modify genetic expression in the cell so that a group of cells carry out a very different plan of growth. Electrical managing forces inform cell development and response to injury as a holistic system of physiological decision-making integrated with the body's biochemical and genetic instructions. A couple of years ago the Levin Lab showed the tumor type abnormal growth, administered to developing tadpoles, could be remissed with a 30% success rate by way of changing cellular electrical behavior. Back then, this was once again entailed by genetically altering the organisms to have light-controllable cell membrane potential. In the beginning of their abstract they noted, "It has long been known that the resting potential of tumor cells is depolarized relative to their normal counterparts." Later on, the authors put forth that this bioelectric signature could be used to locate tumorous cells and it appears to be functionally required for tumors to form, according to these experiments. This year, dr. Michael Levin and his colleagues have discovered a practical new means of readjusting electric gradients that might soon become medicine. Prozac, which is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or SSRI, was recently used to reform the electrical behavior of laboratory cancer cells specifically administered to change voltage gradients. The authors declared this work a successful proof-of-concept. They said that existing and novel drugs could be used as an alternative to highly toxic chemotherapy. The authors of this study redefined cancer as a network disorder affecting the ability of cells to properly interact with a morphodynamic field of instructive signals that keeps proliferation and migration orchestrated towards the anatomical needs of the host organism. In other words, a failure to communicate or regulate. Thanks for watching this episode of the Electricity of Life.

Electric Universe, 2013 Conference THE TIPPING POINT Rupert Sheldrake Science Set Free Part 1 I'm talking about "Science Set Free". And what science is being set free from, is the science delusion. The science delusion is the belief that science has already understood, the nature of reality in principle leaving only the details to be filled in. This is very widely believed in our society it is one of the reasons for the dogmatism that all of us encounter which is so annoying, but it's because people think they already know the truth. They sincerely believe that and this is probably one of the most widespread delusions. In our society we have now exported it to the rest of the world. There is a conflict in the heart of Science between science as a method of inquiry, about the testing of hypotheses, looking at the evidence, finding out what's really going on, open-minded subject to correction and so forth. The ideal of science which many people think of is, what science is. As what science ought to be and I agree with that ideal. The reality, as many of us have encountered through bitter experience, is rather different. For many people science has become a belief system, a worldview. This is sometimes called scientism where people take the dogmas of science to be a kind of religious belief system or quasi religious belief system. And it's this dogmatic belief system which I think is now constricting and holding science back in a very serious way. In almost every branch of science we see the lore of diminishing returns, more expensive research yields fewer and fewer really new results. And the reason for all that is this dogmatic belief system. If science could be set free from it, new experiments and new possibilities open up in every area. What I do in my book 'Science Set Free' is take the 10 dogmas of institutional sciences which are part of the scientific worldview and turn these dogmas into questions. Treat them not as beliefs or truths, but as hypotheses that can be tested against the evidence. I then look at them scientifically to see how well they stack up when you take into account the evidence, none of them do. And in every case new possibilities open up, science would become regenerated when we undergo this process. I don't have time to discuss all 10 dogmas today, but what I do first is just say what they are. And first and foremost dogma: 1) Is the belief that nature is mechanical or machine like. This has been the foundational principle of science since at the beginning of modern science in the 17th century. Mechanistic science is based on machine metaphor, nature is a machine, stars are machines, animals and plants are machines that is why you can have industrial agriculture, genetic engineering, factory farming and so on. They are just machines. And we are machines too, lumbering robots in Richard Dawkins favorite phrase, with brains that are genetically programmed computers. The second dogma is the total amount of matter and energy is always the same, except at the moment of the Big Bang when it all appeared from nowhere. That is so, then the third dogma is similar to that, the laws of nature are fixed. The laws and constants of the world are same today as they were at the moment of the Big Bang, when they all suddenly appeared like a kind of cosmic Napoleonic code. As Terence McKenna used to say, modern science is based on the principle, give us one free miracle and we'll explain the rest. And the one free miracle is the appearance of all the matter and energy in the universe and all the laws that govern it from nothing in a single instant. The fourth dogma is that matter is unconscious, the universe is made up of totally unconscious matter. Fifth, nature is purposeless, there are no purposes in nature and the evolutionary process has no purpose or direction. Sixth, biological inheritance is material, it's genetic in the genetic material, DNA or possibly in epigenetic modifications of the DNA, which are also chemical, or in cytoplasmic inheritance, but at any rate it is all material. Seven, memories are stored as material traces inside the brain, everything you remember is somewhere inside your head, as a stored memory either in phosphorylate proteins modified synapses or some material form which has not yet been fully identified. As they say, the details are very vague, attempts to find these traces have failed over and over again, but nevertheless it is universally believed within neuroscience that they're all inside the brain. Dogma 8, the mind is inside the head, mental activity is brain activity, your mind is nothing but what goes on in your brain. Dogma 9, follows from dogma 8, psychic phenomena are illusory. Things like telepathy can not really happen because they would imply the mind can work to distance from the body and it can't do that because it's all inside the head. And dogma 10, mechanistic medicine is the only kind really works, alternative and complementary therapies may appear to work, but that is only because people would have got better anyway or it's all the placebo effect. But the real kind, the only kind that really works is mechanistic medicine which is why at most parts of the world it is the only kind taught in medical schools, is the only kind funded by government funding agencies, and so on. Well these are the 10 beliefs which are more or less the default belief system of most scientists and most educated people today. Wherever they are in the world in India or China or wherever this is the belief system which is predominant. Now, within science itself of course, people at the leading edge of research in many ways have moved beyond this belief system. Research scientists are not necessarily committed to this in every detail, but they are usually only at the frontier of one region. A physicist might be at the frontiers of cosmology and have gone beyond some of these dogmas of physics, but they wouldn't question the dogmas of psychology or biology, those would remain more or less intact. So, there are various people who question bits of it, but there is very little that has been done to question the whole thing. This is essentially the materialist worldview, and it became the dominant view of science in the 19th century. Science was as it were hijacked by materialist philosophy and since then has been wholly owned subsidiary of materialism. There is no reason why science has to be materialistic, it wasn't materialistic before the 19th century it was dualistic as I'll say soon. And I think we can go beyond that to a new, more inclusive, more organic, organismic paradigm for science. What I'm going to do first is look at the dogma that the total amount of matter and energy is always the same. This got built into the foundations of Science in the 17th century, it was not brought about by incredibly detailed observations using nanogram balances and so forth, it came about for purely philosophical or rather theological reasons. The founding fathers of modern science were all Christians who believed that the world was a machine, that God was a machine maker, an engineering mathematically minded, god who created the world machine, and he'd started off the world machine in the first place by creating the matter that's in it. Which he created in the form of atoms, taking the idea from Greek atomism, and these atoms by definition couldn't be destroyed, they couldn't be broken up. So, once god had created it, the total amount of atoms or matter must automatically remain the same forever. And god also endowed the universe with a certain quantum of movement or force which started it in motion and thereafter because this god-given force couldn't be changed by anything else, the amount remained the same. So the principles of conservation of matter and energy were built into science from the outset, not on the basis of detailed measurements. They've served as useful accountancy principles ever since, but they were formulated more rigorously in the mid-nineteenth century in the law of conservation of matter and energy and in the first law of thermodynamics. So it was assumed that that was the end of the matter and that they were fixed forever and most people take that for granted today they've learned it in high school and they never see any reason to question it. This was the dogma of science which I myself didn't question until quite recently. I questioned all the others, but it was only when I was writing this book that I thought I should look at this one and I actually rather wanted it to turn out to be true because I thought if I said that all 10 dogmas of science were false it might sound a bit biased. So I thought it would be quite nice if one of them held up and I thought this was the best candidate. But when I thought about it turned out to be a shambles. First of all well, physicists are above the law and they found themselves quite free to invent or to hypothesize forms of matter and energy that we shouldn't ever have thought of before. One of them is of course dark matter, observations of galaxies and the way that stars moved within them and also the ways that galaxies interact with each other suggested that the galaxies, if they were to be explained in terms of gravitation, simply wouldn't work! The, the whole thing simply didn't work. So, in order to make it work they hypothesized there was extra matter, which you can see, hence the name dark matter, that accounted for all the phenomena of galaxies and their interactions. Well how much dark matter was there? Well, simple, just invent the exact amount you need to explain the observed phenomena. You can tight rate the amount of dark matter at will to explain the phenomena you're trying to explain, if you find new phenomena peculiar bulges in galaxies or something that a one-size-fits-all dark matter weren't to explain, then you add a bit more where it's needed. The system works perfectly and you can explain everything with complete accuracy, because you can change the amount at will. The only trouble is, no one knows what it is and there is no independent evidence for it, people've been speculating about its nature ever since it was first postulated. Having created all this extra matter in the universe then this meant there should be more gravitation, and physicists expected in the nineteen nineties that the universal expansion, from the Big Bang, would slow down, the Universe would stop expanding, then begin to contract under the influence of all this gravitational matter until it ended in tears and the reverse of the Big Bang known in the trade is the Big Crunch. So, when in the late nineteen nineties people observed that the universe appeared to be accelerating because of redshifts in distant quasars and so on in galaxies. Then, there was a problem how do you explain this acceleration. Well, the answer was ready to hand, a new form of energy not known about before which cause the universe to expand. How much is that? well, just the right amount to explain the facts. So, we now have dark matter and dark energy as huge amount to the universe, they currently make up about 96% of reality. Physicists invented something like 20 times more energy and mass than anyone could ever heard of until the 1980s, and no one has said, no you can't do that, it's defying the law of conservation of matter and energy. And if you ask, is all this matter and energy conserved? Is the total amount always the same? Well, for dark matter nobody knows, for dark energy the most usual theory is that actually the amounts're increasing as the universe expands there's more dark energy. The universe is now a perpetual motion machine. So, the idea it's all rigorously conserved, doesn't really make much sense in those terms. There's also within the quantum physics a zero point energy, a form of energy which is supposed to be there underlying the world we live in which is like waves on an ocean of energy. And there is huge amounts of it, the amount in a teaspoon would be enough to power the United States for years. Not surprisingly some people claim that they can tap this energy and have devices which tap unconventional, unknown forms of energy including zero point energy. If you go online, you will find there are many people who claim to have above unity devices, machines that produce more energy than you put into them. Well these were immediately banned from regular science because they violate the first of sciences taboos established by Galileo in the early 17th century, the taboo against perpetual motion machines. This taboo long predated the laws of thermodynamics, and it's one of the most deep-seated taboos in science. So things like Cold Fusion or above unity devices or free energy devices, whether they're based on zero point energy or peculiar electromagnetic effects or parametric resonance or various other theories that we use to explain them, are totally beyond the pale. Nevertheless people claim they've got them and they exist. If they do exist, of course, it would totally transform the world economy and the world energy situation. So do they really work? Well right now it's very very hard to find out because these claims that may or may not be substantiated, there's a universal rejection within orthodox science with this. A few people within the Department of Defense, a few people who are kind of maverick investors are interested in this. The Japanese government's interested but basically they're not part of the normal discourse of sciences. I myself think the best way forward here would be to have a prize, say a million dollar prize for the best above unity device, and those who came to have them could then have them tested. This is not an attempt to debunk them, it's an attempt to see what really works. They'd be tested under fair agreed conditions and if any of them do indeed produce more energy than it's put into them which can't be explained in terms of any known energy source, they'd win the prize. If the several do then the best one'd win the prize. I think this would be the best way of bringing this whole thing out into the open and finding out what's really going on. And I think that commercial betting companies could open a book on this as well and people could bet on whether the prize will be awarded. Then all the skeptics who say it's impossible could put their money where their mouth is and bet a million dollars that no one would win the prize. How much would they actually be prepared to bet, that would be a very interesting question. I'd be prepared to bet at least a thousand dollars that someone would win it. So I think this would put this thing totally into the public domain, the media would love it, everyone would be discussing it and if someone won it I think it would completely change the climate. I think investors would get interested, governments, how it works and the situation could move on. Right now we've been at a stalemate for years with these things. It turns out that in biology the whole question of energy conservation is much much more questionable than most people assume. We all assume that the total amount of energy that we produce can be explained by the food we take in. And this was assumed in the 1850s by Hermann Von Helmholtz who was eager to prove that living organisms were nothing but machines. He didn't prove it, he assumed it, and since then it's been a basic dogma in biology. It wasn't tested in humans until 1899 by two American researchers, called Atwater and Benedict, and they were determined to prove that we're nothing but machines, they were mechanists and they started from the assumption this was true and they did the experiments not to find out if it's true or not but as they put it, to demonstrate it. In order to further the cause of science. They had people in calorimeters and measured all the heat produced, the carbon dioxide, the oxygen taken in, feces, urine, food consumed and so on. Did a complete energy balance sheet. When they did it the results came out wrong, so they changed the correction factors for the value of food until they got the expected result. And this then became built into the foundations of biology as a certain fact. It wasn't reexamined till a independent-minded American nutritionist Paul Webb redid their experiments in the nineteen seventies, he found huge discrepancies. People who were overweight, overreaching in doing very little exercise, seem to have 25% or so of the energy just vanish. People who are not eating and doing exercise gained about 25%, too much energy. Where was it coming from? Nobody knows, he called it X, the unexplained amount of energy that could either be disappear or appear. He then reexamined Atwater and Benedict's results and found that they got similar discrepancies, but they'd made sure to adjust as many people who had too much and too little so that when they averaged them it canceled out to give the expected result. There are people who claim there are other forms of energy, 'Chi', Prana, vital energies and so on. And this is usually treated as metaphoric, but they may be much more literal than we usually think and this is a huge unexplored area. It's not as if nutrition science is the most successful branch of modern biology And I think that this is something which bears reexamination, in my book I suggest several quite radical experiments that could be done quite simply and cheaply to look at this. Well, now let me turn briefly to the idea that the laws and constants of nature are fixed. The idea that laws are fixed is a hangover from Greek philosophy, Plato and Pythagoras thought that the world was governed by mathematical principles beyond space and time, eternal ideas. In the 17th century people thought these were ideas in the mind of a mathematical god and that God had these mathematical ideas and that scientists were actually finding out about the mind of god by finding out maths of nature. People thought Newton's laws of gravitation we're not just human hypotheses, mere guesses or mere working principles, they thought this was a direct insight into the Divine Mind, superior to that of religion, much more precise, much less disputable. And this was really the basis for a enlightenment ideology of science and reason they though science and reason transcended religion in giving a direct insight into the divine nature. Now you don't hear much about that today, but there's still this strong enlightement tradition and the idea the laws of nature are fixed is a hangover from that point of view. But in a radically evolutionary universe, which the Big Bang postulates, why shouldn't the laws of nature themselves evolve? In fact, why should it be laws at all? Law is a very human metaphor, only humans have laws and only civilized societies. Why should we project this anthropocentric metaphor onto the whole of nature? I myself think that the idea of habits of nature makes much better sense. This is the basis of my own idea of morphic resonance which is a memory principal in nature, but I'm not the first to propose habits. The American philosopher C.S. Peirce, at the beginning of the 20th century, suggested that in an evolutionary universe the irregularities could be thought of as evolving habits. I think it's a much better way to think of it, and it's a testable hypothesis. The theory of morphic resonance predicts, for example, that if you crystallize a new chemical compound for the first time it may be very difficult to crystallize because it hasn't yet got a habit to crystallize in, with a particular lattice structure. But if you crystallize it again somewhere else, there'll be a resonance from the first crystals across space and time, morphic resonance, that will make it easier to crystallize and the third time, it'll be easier still because of the resonance from the first and the second crystals, it'll get easier and easier to crystallize around the world. There's a lot of evidence that that really happens. Chemists explain it by saying there must have been, fragments of previous crystals must've been buffeted around the world as dust particles. But I'm predicting the same will happen even if you filter dust particles out of the air. The theory also predicts that if you train animals, say rats, to learn a new trick. If you train rats in Albuquerque to learn the new trick then all over the world, rats in New York and London and Tokyo should learn the same trick quicker, just because rats learned it here. Surprisingly there's already evidence from experiments with a long series of experiments with rats done at Harvard, the University of Edinburgh, University of Melbourne, Australia, that this actually happens. The same applies to people, it should be getting easier to learn things that others have already learned. Well I'm not going to go into detail on this because this is the theme of my own theory of morphic resonance and my purpose in this lecture and in my book is not really so much to push my own ideas as to show how questionable the standard ones are and how much we can, the field is open for different answers. But I'll turn just briefly to the constants of nature because this affects the Electric Universe, or any model of the universe. It's assumed that the constants of nature are constant, the fundamental constants like Newton's gravitational constant, big G, or the speed of light, c. Well, I began to wonder whether they really were constant when I got into the habit view of nature and so I tried to find what their actual values were. I started off by getting handbooks of physical constants, and looking at old editions, most people only look at the latest edition and they usually throw the old ones away but I, in the patent office library in London, I found they kept them all, and so I got them all out of the reserve stock, at 10-year intervals, they wheeled in a trolley handbooks of physical constants, dusting them off, and I looked through these things to see how they've changed. To my amazement I found that the speed of light dropped by 20 km/s between 1928 and 1945. I then looked up the data in more detail and found that all over the world people have been getting this much lower figure, with very small error bars, the original figure is up there with little error bars and it goes down much lower, little error bars it wasn't that the error bars were 20 km/s, no, they were point decimal places of km/s. And I checked in the primary literature and found this indeed seemed to be the case and then they went up again after 1945. I couldn't understand what was going on, so I asked the head of the Metrology Department, metrologist are people who measure constants, at the British National Physical Laboratory if I could go and see him and I went to visit him. He was very friendly, and I said to him: Dr. Petley I'd like to know how you explain this drop in the speed of light between 1928 in 1945? He said: "Oh, dear", I said: "What?!", he said: "you've uncovered one of the most embarrassing incidents in the history of our subject." So I said, well could it mean that the speed of light really did drop at least as measured on earth during that period, he said: "Of course not!" I said: "Why not?", he said: "Because, it's a constant!" So, I said well then, I can't see any other explanation than that people around the world they're sort of fudging their results. To get what they thought everyone else would expect them to get and then discarding outliers and stuff and coming up with these very narrow error bars that agreed with everyone else. And so, it then must have been produced by some kind of fudging process. He said: "We don't like to use the word fudge." OK, so I said: "What do you prefer?" Yep, he said: "We prefer to call it, 'intellectual phase locking'." So, I said to him: "It was happening then, how do we know it's not happening now?" He said: "We know it's not happening now.", and I said: "Why?" He said: "Because we fixed the speed of light by definition in 1972." - "So, said I it might still vary?" and he leaned back looking very smug and said: "But if it did, no one would ever find out, because we've defined the meter in terms of the speed of light. So the units would vary with it." I said: "Ok, you fix that one, but what about the gravitational constant, I saw that's been very widely, and even actually in the last 3 or 4 years it has varied by more than 1.3% as measured in different laboratories?" The usual assumption is, this is just error and it's experimental error, it's hard to measure, it's error. So, labs all over the world get quite different results and the International Committee on metrology fixes the results every few years by averaging ones from different labs, weighting ones they think a more reliable, discarding ones they think are not. Indeed, when I left Dr Petley, thanking him for his time he reached down to a cardboard box beside his desk full of pamphlets and said: "By the way, these have just come from the printers, you might like one." He handed me this pamphlet 'The latest values of the physical constants' I looked to these data from different labs on 'G', big 'G' and in 1 or 2, the question that I was wondering is, there's always big errors, could it be that they're actually changing together in different labs as the earth rotates around the Sun, as it rotates during the day and as the whole solar system moves through different astronomical environments. To find that out, one would look at the day by day measurements from different labs and see if the errors or so called errors are correlated. I spent more than 10 years trying to persuade metrologists to do this and they simply will not, because they say it's a constant so there's no point of looking for variations. And I say, you got these huge differences, they say they're just errors, it's hard to measure, but they simply won't do it. An exercise in open science would be if they put their raw data with the dates online and then anyone could try and look for patterns and they could be a website where they're discussed, I think it would cost nothing and we might find something out. We'll find out nothing by pretending it's fixed! There are in fact already papers that suggest diurnal variations in accordance with the sidereal day. A group at MIT recently found a daily variation and there's some evidence of annual variations, but there may be other wider fluctuations that happen in concert. I myself think the so-called physical constants may vary from time to time and possibly even chaotically within certain limits. But I think the day may come when in scientific periodicals like Nature there will be a page, a bit like the stock market reports you know. This week's value of the constants, you know. This week the 'G' went slightly up the charge on the electron held steady there was a drop in the fine structure constant. And if that were the case then they would give varying qualities of time when different things could happen. The idea they're all rigidly fixed is a hangover from old Platonic point of, way of thinking. So there, right in the heart of Physics is, I think, a really open and interesting question. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project at Thunderbolts.info. A groundbreaking new scientific report provides dramatic confirmation of our planet's dynamic electrical environment and the Earth-Sun connection. Phys.org recently reported that the European Space Agency SWARM mission has discovered, "Supersonic plasma jets high up in our atmosphere" that can push temperatures up to almost 10,000 degrees Celsius. Attempting to provide historical context for the discovery, the report states, "The theory that there are huge electric currents, powered by solar wind and guided through the ionosphere by Earth's magnetic field, was postulated more than a century ago by Norwegian scientist Kristian Birkeland. While much is known about these current systems, recent observations... have revealed that they are associated with large electrical fields." In fact, in recent years the term "Birkeland current" has appeared with increasing regularity in mainstream scientific literature. Today, professor Donald Scott discusses his own original modeling of a Birkeland current structure and he explores the significance of this new discovery from the Electric Universe perspective. SWARM is a constellation of three satellites designed to look at the geomagnetic field of Earth. They wanted to put some decent sensors, better sensors than had ever been flown before, I guess, up, and to investigate what exactly the properties of the of the Earth's geomagnetic field were. It's encouraging that this recent article about SWARM not only mentions the phrase Birkeland current several times but it also talks about electric fields. Well that's a word that almost never gets mentioned in the establishment literature but it's getting to be fairly well-known that electrical energy does indeed come from the sun to Earth in large tube-like conduits that have, over the years, become known as Birkeland currents. The establishment usually only talks about magnetic and gravitational fields but the all-important term "Electric Current" usually has been missing. This latest SWARM article makes it appear that the establishment may have been quietly listening to our ideas. Now of course, they're never going to give us credit for it, they will now claim that they discovered everything and they will try to ignore the existence of our prior claims but I think it's our duty, to ourselves and that actually to posterity, to stake out those claims and say exactly what we have said, in the past, about things like Birkeland currents. I will say that my model, which I hasten to say, is an extension of the work of some other folks such as Hannes Alfven, who won the Nobel Prize in physics, and Anthony Peratt and a fellow with a name Stig Lundquist, who actually started the work on this model back in 1950. That model predicts most, if not all, of what the SWARM release refers to as their discoveries. It makes me a little bit worried about whether they have ever heard of some of the people. Certainly they had never heard of me but, you think, they might have heard of Hannes Alfven and Tony Peratt and of course Kristian Birkeland. But anyway, in 2015, the scientific journal "Progress In Physics" published an article of mine in which I included the quantitative derivation of this model. I finished it off, where Lundquist started it, and then I ended up developing the equations that describe the physical structure of the Birkeland Current. Those equations must be interpreted to follow, they follow up on what those equations predict about what the model must look like. Lundquist, in spite of my giving him credit for coming up with some of those equations; he never, like I guess most mathematicians don't, interpreted what those equations predicted for what the Birkeland current would look like and how it would act. But the model, as I developed it, shows the presence of electrical currents that flow in spiral paths in opposite directions, those things were in that SWARM article. Oppositely directed currents, yes, and the Birkeland current itself is made up of a set of and this is, I think, the important point. The Birkeland Current is a set of concentric counter- rotating cylinders of electrical current and magnetic fields. And the currents and the fields are at all points in those Birkeland currents parallel, they're aligned. When you align the currents with the magnetic fields, the internal stresses on the Birkeland current relax and go to zero and that's what, that's the single property that makes those Birkeland currents able to go over tremendous distances, mean, we know they go from the Sun to the Earth, and that's 93 million miles. Well that's, that's nothing, that's a, that's a child's foot- step for, compared to the astronomical distances in light years. Some of these, so-called, jets from galaxies and they extend over and those currents don't come apart, they don't spread out like that, like a garden hose will end up in a bunch of droplets sprinkling over your lawn. They hang right together in collinear alignment and that's, that's the reason they do. The formal name for a Birkeland Current, really, is a field-aligned current. It's a force free current because the fields are aligned. Anyhow, the SWARM article says, "Each satellite has an (electrical) electric field instrument positioned at the front to measure plasma density, drift and velocity." Well if that's indeed the truth, then I would think they should have measured some kind of concentric counter- rotation because the counter rotation is the prime property, as far as I'm concerned, on the Birkeland current. But either they haven't observed it or, if they did observe it, they neglected to mention it. Maybe because they don't know why it occurs. It's well known that the Earth has a geomagnetic field. It's less well known, but it's equally true, that the Earth and many of the planets also have their own electric field and the electric field that emanates either to or from Earth is a very powerful electric field. The Earth is, and most of the planets I think are, also electrically charged. If you sit down and analyze what that phrase means, supersonic plasma jets, plasma is a word that defines a cloud-like collection of charges, you know, plus ions, negative electrons, all going along and they're traveling along in a cloud-like formation and a jet is a moving stream. It's a flow. So a flow of charge. Well that's the definition of an electric current but we already knew this. That's, that's what Birkeland himself, back in the early nineteen hundreds, said was going on. That's what they laughed at him for saying.

[Music] [Music] he titled why so surprising is basically an answer to the previous presentation I gave about surprising solar system it had had that described a number of things that were found immediately after the Space Age started that were all announced by surprise or unexpected or some types of words of astonishment and this is tour sort of to explain why that is and it turns out that a lot of times people have a paradigm and they only see what fits that paradigm they don't look at other things their paradigm was based on the quorum consensus that basically we know everything nothing ever happened and a lot of times the quorums are quite fine but as they pointed out here sometimes it means you get the answer spectacularly wrong and in 1950 that's exactly what happened and here they say they didn't look at things in a different way she tried to get the astronomers to look at things differently and this is wave after 1950 after all of the surprises and she pointed out it didn't work they didn't want to do that and the problem was in 1950 these things were assumed and widely believed basically myth was pure fiction no global catastrophe has ever occurred electromagnetic fields don't have anything to do with a solar system or the universe and as dr. Scott pointed out earlier a lot of people still say okay so they're out there but they don't do anything and he said that the solar system was formed in its current configuration billions of years ago and nothing ever changed well somebody you wasn't in the club came along and wrote a book and said all of those things are not true so immediately the accepted theory people started jumping on him because if those assumptions were true then obviously they had a point he didn't know what he was talking about but the old saying is if you start with a bad assumption you can prove anything you want and they started with a bad assumption but years of data indicated that it was a bad assumption so we'll go through those four things the first one was that people have found out that myths do contain data in fact Massey is a archaeologists basically with the National Lab in Los Alamos and he said that there's basically largely untapped data set in the mythology that's untapped as their phrase for ignored previously but now they have found out that the myths do contain data and they're going to start looking at it they've also found out that our basically knew for years like Lange in the 1880s said that myths are the same worldwide and then Grant pointed out that you'd be amazed even staggered at how all of the myths pretty much say the same thing some are just now catching on in Australia somebody did some analysis recently and said that the myths there coincide quite closely with a number of the Greek myths the second thing was supposedly no global catastrophes but it was around 1980 when the Alvarez's alvarez and his son and alvarez later got a nobel prize for a lot of this work and they determined that the a global catastrophe wiped out the dinosaurs now there weren't any people around then so they didn't make myths about that catastrophe but it opened the door for people to say well maybe that we did have a cold but catastrophes not happening billions of years ago the this one was 56 million 65 million years ago but then they found another one of 56 million years ago that he said okay hey there's getting closer and closer to the current time then they found out hey not only to have a global catastrophes but we had some recent ones the Pleistocene which was around 11,000 years ago supposedly changed in 40 years from basically the Ice Age to no Ice Age and these stories about that are pretty much Universal again all over the globe so Firestone and all said something happened we may not have the exact model as to what but apparently something did happen not only that we had recent global catastrophes with geological data in the 50s basically and before that even if you had a catastrophe such as the Barringer crater which was supposedly about fifty thousand years ago at that time before the 50s they tried to say well it was real of volcano but all the evidence of the volcano has disappeared but it couldn't have been a meteorite because we don't allow that but then now there have a peer-reviewed collection of papers where they say oh yeah we had recent geological information available from myths in 1955 when Velikovsky wrote earthing of evil there was such a reaction to his book worlds and collision that talked about mythology that he wrote earth and upheaval which was only geological information and in it he said that it was apparent that dinosaurs are a lot of the bones of the time period of the dinosaurs they died in a traumatic event and at the time the theory was that well they died in bed of old age and their bones washed into the river and got all jumbled up and but they found out even in 2007 that something happened while they were dying not after they are before they died Derek ager ER was head of the British Geological Society for a while and he said he wrote the new catastrophism and in it he said there were great geological events not recorded in our histories they were recorded but to Hager and other people of the time they were myths and didn't really mean anything but they found out since then he they did mean something and people for years have recognized that something happened in the past and it's possibly explainable Weston in 1696 talked about a big comet impacted the earth and that a lot of the biblical stories could be explained naturally from that event and the church kind of ignored that but then he said some other things they didn't like so they arrested him and hauled him off and but he at the time had the same chair that Newton had previously had and the one that Hawking has now so it was you know fairly influential but the fact that he got arrested kind of discouraged thinking along those lines for a while until Donnelly came along in the 1880 and he said that there was a big comet impacted the earth and that the fear of comets today was a result of that impact and let's face it he was a lawyer in a congressman so you can understand why people might ignore that but then Velikovsky came along in 1950 and basically said the same thing hey myths contain data you can explain a lot of things through that and but he was an outsider with a respect to geology or no astronomy the main sciences at the time and he was a MD psychiatrist and historian so they ignored him too and later of course Dave Talbot and warder Cardona came up with a lot of information about recognizing that the recorded data is real and useful information and it's obviously no longer 1950 because you can at least talk about it but again agar that we talked about before said that for a century and a half the geological world one might even say brainwashed with uniformitarianism and that the dangerous doctrine inu uniformity was oh thank you but nearly 40 years before a Gurr Velikovsky said the real enemy of the theory of evolution is teaching uniformity are the non occurrence of any extraordinary events in the past so Hager agreed with Velikovsky although he probably didn't know it and wouldn't have liked the fact that he agreed with Velikovsky there was also guilt by association there was such a reaction to Velikovsky that any time anybody said something that might sound like Velikovsky said it they would wouldn't want to do it that's why in 72 Gould used the term punctuated and equilibrium because Velikovsky had started the term catastrophic evolution and so they couldn't say that but now everybody pretty much agrees but that's right and that the punctuation came from something outside and they said hey it's pretty much an observation as opposed to just a flat-out Theory type thing but the way Clube and others have applied punctuated equilibrium it fits quite well and say they say that the ice age was caused even from something else which was around 11,500 years ago another major catastrophe in fact they said a mars-sized object well that's a pretty big object to have been impacting the earth and causing a change from the Ice Age but luckily science changes and pretty much science now goes along with what Velikovsky said in earthing uphill but of course you can't mention them still the third item was electromagnetic fields and Velikovsky suggested to the people that were planning the geophysical year when they were going to send probes up and stuff and he said hey why don't you see about the magnetic field of the earth how far up it goes and if it goes beyond the moon and they said it decreases in altitude so you wouldn't expect anything like that and that he invented electromagnetic fields to explain all that stuff that he had written before and he suggested through has who was the head of the Princeton Geological the geology department at the time that they measure the orientation of the rocks that they were going to get on their first lunar trip and they said yeah why bother there's no magnetic field up there and then that was one of the surprises he we sweet a major of the magnetics of the direction of the orientation of the rocks and Velikovsky also asked him saying do you really think that you could have this electromagnetic field which they had found by the end and that goes beyond the moon and not affect the moon and of course no they thought of it as a rhetorical question but then it found out that hey the every time the moon encounters of the Earth's magnetosphere you have activity going on up there so they determined that magnetic fields are important and pointed out that alpha and others said that years ago but they were basically ignored another one that surprises is there's another magnetic moon that they really hadn't expected because still the idea of well yeah you've got a electromagnetic field that happens to interact with our moon but nothing else could have one and moon certainly wouldn't have one but they said either something wrong with our theory or our understanding of Kenny Meads their history and I suggest maybe it's both I said that the electric activity on Io may be a result of a large electric currents so we've gone from no electromagnetic fields to ok magnetic fields when we need them and now even some electric currents and more oddities the fields don't even line up right so the thing on this is of course create a concern among planetary scientists about how plan planetary magnetic fields are generated that's one of the things that wall and Don talk about considerably another thing is x-rays you've got a lot of x-rays appearing at places that they didn't expect and you've got to have three things to get the x-rays you've got to have a source of charged particles something to speed them up and something for them to impact and they say hey we've got all of these x-rays that we don't understand and puzzling because they shouldn't be there in no model fits them and again there's a gap in our knowledge or something basic is missing basic and missing in this case is the assumptions for the theory even x-rays from Pluto well you know it's bad enough this went from I not even being a planet in out Scott x-rays that just shouldn't have and again the constant speed from the Sun can create creative extra but not to the extent that they found that the will in the ones that are on Pluto in the lightning spokes the Saturn's rings you know supposedly known for years that they were just debris from collisions and nothing electrical and now that they found that they've got these lightning strokes that go through them and the interesting thing here is ten thousand times more energetic and on the earth at least they admit electrically charged dust in 1950 the theory was that comets are dirty snowballs and they came from this comet field way out at the edge of space and wander in and when they get close to the Sun and get close to the sudden they heat up and create the comet tails but even in 1964 some people said hey comments are plasmas and of course that was ignored and so al fain pointed out that sometimes you even sweep under the rug observations that don't fit the current view and that applies to the theory of comets even in nineteen eighty eighty five still Sagan was saying comets only an iceberg also the wind creates mountains our dues that go the wrong direction with respect to what you would expect from the wind and they say that at least admit in this case they may be an electoral process electrostatic process is it affecting this and they're saying that hey there was probably a freighter link between comets and asteroids than we previously thought and that 67p in particular violates conventional wisdom of comets resembling smooth dirty snowballs and the lock the 2015 comment it's time to stop thinking of comets as dirty snowballs another the fourth item that they used as to why belikov Z's got to be wrong is that these solar system's been in its current configuration for billions of years and they even have a law that demonstrates that was called Bo's law at the time but then they finally realized well bodes tolet if from Tisha's so with the old you know and it wasn't a bad fit really the actual stuff and what the boat law says so it kind of falls apart when you get past Jupiter but it's not really that bad and even as late as 72 they assumed that the equation reflected the early solar system which was a way of saying hey Velikovsky's you out to be wrong cause Bowdoin will roll well worked forward so we'll but as I mentioned oh it stole it from dishes and so they started calling it the dishes food rule sort of like the old Soviet thing of you steal something when you get caught you give half back well it turns out that in the Tisha's bold rule if you change the 0.3 to 0.6 everything remains exactly the same except there's no orbit for Venus so you could say if you thought it meant anything which it doesn't you could say it showed Venus it was the last one in but it's basically what is called a curve fit you take a bunch of data and you write a formula to fit the data and so you shouldn't be surprised that it fits the data well that's what they did with the Tisha's mode rule they just curve fit the planet orbits and then said that proved they'd been there forever it's really not proof of anything [Music] and astronomers would still use it until you bring up the point three two point six part and then there admit that it doesn't really mean anything oh also when it is stress I'm not saying this supports anything about a Venus model at all because it's a curve hit so by 1960 the original solar system wasn't really considered secret anymore but it was still used as to why Velikovsky must be wrong but even these people who were well known in their fields were saying hey here's change that probably took place in the solar system and they were saying this at the same time that other astronomers were saying no it never could have happened well they were weren't saying it couldn't have happened they were just saying Velikovsky's about it got to be wrong and this is one of the reasons but nice thing about science is they eventually changed with the data and so they pretty much now say hey plan has changed and they've even say Venus collided with a similar body jupiter and saturn have close encounters with neptune these people have a huge amount of simulations of various types where planets change orbits and in case go through the references too fast the book that have mentioned that may come out on Kindle Monday is titled Aurora petroglyphs and pagans and it's got all this information in the previous information about surprising solar system and a lot of the information about the plasmas oh I liked this quotation be forgiven for thinking the eight planets drift in from different parts of the cosmos and current theories can't account for all of it so obviously what they thought in 1950 no longer applies they say hey it's not really that stable in this one eventually a close encounter as sender innermost planet can rename or careening wildly and this goes along with the agree that it's completely different thinking now but now they're even comfortable with all of these things bouncing around and they said that Jupiter and Saturn formed differently another one there's supposedly two body at 18 au Uranus is now around 19 au but it it was twice the mass of the Earth and collided with either Neptune or Uranus so obviously some kind of odd carrying on now they assume all of these things happened billions of years ago but every now and then they'll throw in a thing that well this happened within the last 10 million years so in fact they have somewhere moons of one planet collided they say within the last and million years and it will happen again in another ten million years well how many times has it happened you know they assumed ten million years just because it's got to be a long time but maybe it wasn't that long and they say free-floating planets may have been captured in fact Planet 9 may have been a rogue planet now a lot of this may bring to mind work fugly toward in Cortona and he's got a lot of information about that and I think Dave Talbot and others probably have similar things that go along with what door do was saying not only is there just one out there there's lots of objects out there so billions of stars have captured rogue planets so it's not just a one-off thing that might have been weird for our particular history but seems to happen all the time and how these rogue planets formed defy current popular theories of now solar systems formed you can have a lot of details wrong and the more details you have the more likely you're going to have details wrong in fact there's a saying in computer programming where if you find a bug in a computer program there's 99% chance they're going to find another bug so in the larger the program the more likely you're going to find these well that's the same thing the more detailed you have in a theory the more likely one of the details is going to be wrong but lots of people have had details wrong the Copernicus didn't have all the details right but he's still highly thought of Velikovsky had a few details wrong but that doesn't mean that his four main big picture items that we discussed were wrong in fact those major components of his theory were correct and agreed to by all now and sometimes you can have a big picture wrong Newton's sign square law which was wrong and some say that it held back development of flight for years because of the calculations that you did with it and history's filled with great scientists you even had unscientific ideas and some of the people mentioned us on our Raleigh and JJ Thompson and a lot of very famous people so being wrong every now and then shouldn't run your reputation either belikov see stuff described something that was all natural and a lot of times he was associated with the space aliens did at all people and that was another way of ignoring what he said if he can lump him in with somebody that you're pretty sure is a little odd on some of the things that they're postulating then it's easier to just dump them all in the same category but he said that they were all natural clauses basically and the plasma science helps even support more so that they were natural causes and the work of Broughton Scott go along those lines so 21st century thinking is completely opposite of nineteen fifty mythology does contain and data clova catastrophes did occur electro many fields do play an important part and the solar system was not formed in its current configuration Experion years ago used X because in 1950 DX kept changing further and further back it's complicated and here's the important part more often than we might expect conclusions that contradict initial intuition the initial intuition in 1950 was that let's assume nothing ever happened and try to explain everything we can from that standpoint there was a nice initial thought but the data didn't support it but people weren't willing to look at the contradictions so disclaimer which is usually in very small print but I'm not trying to support anybody's particular model I'm just saying that the data is there showing the four major things that Velikovsky said in 1950 that they're all worth pursuing and that there's enough data in those four areas for somebody to come up with a model and the more people trying to do that probably the better and a lot of interesting models these are in alphabetical order but you probably recognize most of these people but maybe Firestone might be and Napier might be a little different Duncan Steele wrote a book he concentrated on the model explaining why calendars were invented but he goes through a lot of data that needs to be explained in somebody's model there was a book built to last and they talked about the Tyrian a carry any of the are that you're quite often forced to pick this or that you know format arianism are catastrophes in 1950 you had to pick one you weren't allowed to consider the possibility that uniformitarianism is valid between catastrophes thank you [Applause] [Music] 
[Music] A new scientific paper attempts to shed light on a mystery at Jupiter that continues to baffle space scientists. Among the countless surprises the NASA Juno space probe has revealed since it entered Jupiter's orbit in 2016, perhaps none has proved more puzzling than the discovery of multiple cyclones which appear fixed and unmoving at each of Jupiter's poles. Nothing in the standard theoretical toolkits of atmospheric and planetary science predicted, nor can explain, the  phenomena. As described in a recent phys.org report, ”Photos of the planet's north pole show that there are eight cyclones surrounding the central cyclone directly over the pole. All eight are in close proximity and all are nearly equidistant from the central cyclone, and are arranged in an octagonal pattern. At this time it is not clear if the cyclones rotate around the center. There is a similar arrangement at the southern pole, only there are just five cyclones, shaped as a pentagon.” The report acknowledges, ”Such behavior is of course unheard of here on Earth. Cyclones take shape, travel around for a while and then dissipate. Such behavior has left researchers scrambling to come up with a reasonable explanation for what they have observed. In a new paper published in the journal Nature Astronomy, a team of scientists has used data and images from the Juno probe to determine the winds and direction of the cyclones. As noted in the phys.org report, the team has proposed that there is quote “...an anticyclonic ring of winds that move in the opposite direction of the cyclones, which is what keeps them in place. And while that may hold true, the team was unable to find signatures of convection, which would have helped to explain how heat was being used to fuel the cyclones. They acknowledge that much more work will need to be done to fully explain the behavior of Jupiter’s cyclones.” The irony of this hypothesis is evident to those familiar with the groundbreaking work of Thunderbolts colleague Dr. Donald Scott. It was a few years ago that Dr. Scott first published his mathematical modeling of the structure of a Birkeland Current, which could be visualized as counter-rotating cylindrical shells. In past interviews, Dr. Scott noted that counter-rotational patterns can be seen in the vortices at the poles of the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. Indeed counter-rotational wind movements associated with Jupiter’s cyclones would not be surprising, if incoming Birkeland currents are contributing to the phenomena. In more recent years, Dr. Scott has closely followed Earth's wind patterns. And as he described in his April 2nd 2022 Thunderbolts video, he has found clear visual evidence that our planet's polar wind patterns are driven from the outside, and not by any surface- or internal earthbound processes or dynamos. This evidence suggests that the main outside source of these polar winds is the varying strength and direction of the Birkeland current stream of electrically charged particles. However, the aforementioned Nature Astronomy paper looks to, quote “shallow water models,” rather than plasma physics, to explain the Jovian cyclones. Nor is this the first time that space scientists have looked to fluid dynamics to resolve the anomalous appearance of fixed, geometric patterns in the upper atmosphere of a gas giant planet. For decades, the hexagon at Saturn’s south pole has puzzled planetary scientists. Several years ago, researchers succeeded at producing similar forms through simple fluidic experiments, providing an explanation that many astronomers have favored. However, more recent scientific discoveries have definitively pointed away from the mechanical, fluidic explanation. In 2018, scientists using images obtained by NASA's Cassini spacecraft observed an unexpected, towering vortex far above the  famous hexagon. A Science Alert report on the observation stated, “There's something strange over Saturn's north pole. A tremendous structure towering high above the clouds indicates that the planet's peculiar hexagonal formation is much, much bigger than was initially apparent.” One of the investigators said of the discovery, “As the polar vortex became more and more visible, we noticed it had hexagonal edges, and realized that we were seeing the pre-existing hexagon at much higher altitudes than previously thought.” The problematic nature of this discovery is noted in the article which states, ”...since wind conditions change dramatically with altitude, the fact that the hexagon shape persists so much higher than the cloud tops is a baffling conundrum.” In other words, the persistence of the hexagonal feature hundreds of kilometers above the clouds is a clear indication it is being driven by energy from above and cannot be explained by simple fluid dynamics. Is it a coincidence then that hexagons and other polygonal or octagonal forms are produced in plasma discharge? Consider the side-by-side images on your  screen. On the left are vortices of an electron beam, etched onto a carbon witness plate. On the right are vortices of an electron beam photographed in a fluorescent screen. The hexagonal form is a distinct feature of a well-documented plasma phenomenon called the diocotron instability. And the phenomenon observed in the laboratory is remarkably scalable. As explained by Dr. Anthony Peratt in Physics of the Plasma Universe, ”The vortices of the diocotron instability are found to occur over 12 orders of magnitude in beam current. This mechanism was first introduced to explain auroral curtains by Hannes Alfven.” As we've noted many times, the chief proponent of the Electric Universe, physicist and Thunderbolt science advisor Wal Thornhill made an outrageous prediction with respect to the Saturnian hexagon. In 2005 Thornhill analyzed the mysterious hot spot in the vortex at Saturn’s south pole. The Hot Spot puzzled planetary scientists because, as described by the Keck Observatory, “...both the distinct boundary of a warm polar vortex some 30 degrees latitude from the southern pole and a very hot ‘tip’ right at the pole were completely unexpected.” Thornhill wrote of this feature, “Its compactness is due to the electromagnetic pinch effect where it enters Saturn's atmosphere.” He then stated the Electric Universe also predicts, experimentum crucis, that BOTH poles should be hot, not one hot and the other cold.” In 2008 the Cassini spacecraft confirmed the astonishing prediction. Astonishing, because the freezing cold north pole had been deprived of sunlight for more than 12 years. Thornhill explained, “The polar hot spot and long-lived hexagonal feature result from a continuous electric current flowing from the Sun into the pole of Saturn.” Indeed, in stark contrast to the conventional view of the Sun as an isolated body powered by internal thermonuclear reactions, the Electric Universe proposes that the Sun is primarily an electrical phenomenon at the focus of a galactic glow discharge. In this view, electric currents flowing from the Sun to planets has implications for many atmospheric phenomena including the tremendous winds, stupendous magnetic fields, and X-ray and temperature anomalies of the gas giants, as well as jet streams and weather patterns on Earth. For decades, Thornhill has argued that weather systems on Earth are primarily electrical phenomena, and both on our planet and elsewhere in the solar system, the evidence of the Sun's connection to weather and atmospheric phenomena continues to grow. As we reported in 2014, scientists in the UK discovered the completely unexpected ability of solar storms to trigger dramatic lightning on Earth. And in fact, at Jupiter scientists recently discovered a surprising influence of the Sun on tremendous heating and temperature anomalies. As noted in the October 1st 2022 Science Alert article, a planet-sized heat wave has been found in Jupiter's atmosphere. ”A heat wave the size of 10 Earths has been discovered rippling through Jupiter's atmosphere. It was 130,000 kilometers across, and a scorching 700 degrees Celsius, traveling at speeds up to 2,400 meters per second, away from the Jovian north pole. And this, scientists say, could resolve one of the more perplexing mysteries about our Solar System's biggest planet - why it's so much hotter than models predict.” As the article explains, planetary scientists have long attempted to attribute this anomalous heating to Jupiter's auroras, although the spectacular X-ray auroras themselves are not well explained in Standard Astronomy. However, a team of researchers discovered that when Jupiter was hit by a large solar storm, they noted a synchronous enhancement of so-called ”auroral heating”. The Science Alert report acknowledges, “Jupiter is not the only planet in the Solar System that is hotter than it should be. Saturn, Neptune, and Uranus are all hundreds of degrees hotter than solar heating can account for.” While planetary scientists increasingly have no choice but to recognize the role of electric currents in planetary systems, as they have for many years at both Jupiter and Saturn, they still view the electric currents as byproducts of localized phenomena in closed systems. However, just as Thornhill successfully predicted, the hallmarks of electric currents flowing into the poles of Saturn, we predict that no hypothesis based on simple fluidic dynamics will explain the fixed cyclones on Jupiter. Rather, these dramatic phenomena are testimony to the electrical circuitry that pervades our solar system and indeed our entire Electric Universe. [Music] 
[Music] In part one, I predicted the discoveries to be made by the James Webb telescope about the creation myth of the Big Bang and the failed gravitational model of galaxies. In this second part, I'll talk about the gulf between thermonuclear and electric star models and expected discoveries from the James Webb telescope. First, I want to pay special tribute to an unsung pioneer of the Electric Universe, Dr. Charles Bruce who lived from 1902 until 1979, an  Englishman who was uniquely qualified to recognize the electrical nature of the universe, as both a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and an authority on terrestrial lightning. Dr. Bruce graduated in 1924 with First Class Honours in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy. In 1952 he was awarded a Doctor of Science, both from Edinburgh University. In 1942 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, in 1964 a Fellow of the Institute of Physics and in 1965 a Fellow of the Institution of Electrical Engineers. He joined the Electrical Research Association from 1924 until his retirement in 1967. The  event which led him to the study of the significance of electric discharges in astronomy was his attendance at a lecture on the Sun and the Ionosphere, given by Professor Sydney Chapman, the leading British mathematician and geophysicist. When he noted that the velocity of a solar prominence, which reached  the height of 1 million miles in an hour, was very close to that of the leader  stroke of a terrestrial lightning discharge. In December 1960, he wrote an article in Electrical Review titled An All-Electric Universe. It outlines his theory published much earlier in 1944, which and I quote ”...endeavors to show that electrical discharges have gradually condensed matter from the primordial gas and dust of a general universal atmosphere, first into galaxies, then from the condensed matter of the galaxies into stars. Discharges in the extended atmospheres of stars further condense the matter, ultimately to allow the formation of planets and satellites.” End quote. Key to this discussion is two of Bruce's major concepts. He was the first to propose the birth of stars and planets in high-compression magnetic pinches along current channels in molecular clouds, rather like cloud-to-cloud lightning. He was also the first to propose that secondary bodies, or satellites, may be ejected from a star by a phenomenon observed in arc welding where the arc pinches down on the electrodes causing a high pressure jet and the ejection of metal in the arc welding process. Such an ejection of matter is observed to be independent of gravity. Bruce's detailed electrical explanation for phenomena seen on the Sun, relied  upon comparisons with atmospheric lightning. Understandably he accepted the thermonuclear source of the Sun's energy. Bruce's struggle with astronomers was in trying to convince them of global lightning in stellar atmospheres. The famous British astronomer Arthur Eddington had noticed evidence for stellar lightning when he wrote his book ”The internal constitution of the stars”, published in 1926, that established the standard model of thermonuclear stars, and I quote, ”If there is no other way out we may have to suppose that bright line spectra in the stars are produced by electric discharges similar to those producing bright line spectra in a vacuum tube... We conclude provisionally that bright lines in the spectrum of a static star indicate that either (a) the star is greatly disturbed by ‘thunderstorms,’ or (b) it is a nebulous star.” But the million degree corona and excited atoms producing the bright line spectra outside the Sun, clearly show the energy is coming externally from the galaxy. Clearly he didn't have the mathematics to deal with that. On page one of the book he states, and I quote, ”...an understanding of the mechanism of the interior throws light on the external manifestation of the star and the whole theory is ultimately brought into contact with observation.”  End quote. He has fooled all the experts since. The next unsung engineering hero of the Electric Universe was Ralph Juergens who lived from 1924 until 1979. In the  1970s, Juergens referred to Bruce's work and solved the energy problem by introducing the physics of a low pressure gas discharge which requires a galactic circuit to power it. His revolutionary insight was to recognize the Sun presents all the detailed features of an electrically stressed anode in a coronal discharge. He even foreshadowed my input to his model when he wrote in 1976 and I quote, ”Could it be that the search for thermonuclear energy is a false trail that has been followed all these years with no real hope of success? If the  Sun and the stars indeed succeed in fusing lighter elements to form heavier ones, are the relevant activities carried out more or less in plain sight- in their atmospheres?” End quote. We can generally trust engineers. They've got to make things work. The Electric Sun model was finally tested experimentally by the SAFIRE project, with funding from the International Science Foundation. Following confirmation of nuclear processes by other laboratories, success was announced at the annual Electric Universe conference in 2019 at the University of Bath in England. Just to add icing to the cake, last  month a paper was published in the Astrophysical Journal titled, ”The Sunward Electron Deficit: A Telltale sign of the Sun's Electric Potential. Although the real significance of the discovery is lost on the authors who insist that the heat of the Sun is causing the charge separation, what  they measured was the drift current of electrons toward the Sun which is characteristic of electron drift toward the anode in a discharge tube. The SAFIRE project showed nuclear transmutation production of heavy elements that are found in the solar spectrum. It shows all main sequence stars produce some radiant energy by the electric discharge, but most importantly it catalyzes nuclear transmutations in their photospheres. To produce the star's radiant energy and heavy elements, together with neutrinos. Clearly, sunspots are dark simply because there is no radiation coming from within. So, the complicated ad hoc life stories for different classes of stars is unnecessary, as is the evolutionary classification  of stars into populations I and II. Shortly, I will show that the electric model fits all stars. The James Webb telescope, when successfully deployed, will allow us to see finer and fainter detail in the starburst regions of dense molecular clouds where stars and gas giant planets are born. The twisting and turning glowing red filaments of constant width are like those in a novelty plasma ball. They are rotating Birkeland currents threading the gestating stars in those clouds. The stars grow in mass until they are born by a slingshot effect as the filament twists away. The enigma of the upper limit of star mass is simply answered. The James Webb telescope should put this explanation beyond any doubt, because gravity alone cannot produce such twisting and turning filamentary structures. It is hard to overstate the importance of evidence of helically twisted filament pairs and braids. The Electric Universe position has always been that the universe is one giant web of rotating electric currents that flow as filaments of helically twisted pairs and braids and manifesting that morphology at all scales. That stars are born in an intense magnetic pinching of a galactic Birkeland  current. That every star is connected to the galactic circuit by a coaxial Birkeland current. That every galaxy is connected to a larger intergalactic circuit by coaxial intergalactic Birkeland currents. It is often very difficult to remotely observe an electric current in plasma dark mode, passing through the diffuse interplanetary, interstellar or intergalactic medium. For example, the discovery of interplanetary electric currents has only occurred when space probes have made unexpected in-situ measurements. Nevertheless, it is often possible to remotely observe such electric currents because, for example, dust is aggregated to the current via Markelund convection. Or, because the density of neutral atoms in the local plasma and the  current density is sufficiently high for the generation of electromagnetic radiation in different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. As I have often noted, radio astronomy is of particular importance because Birkeland currents typically emit synchrotron radiation in the radio spectrum. Of course, many observational challenges  remain. Not least because looking out into the universe from our place in the galaxy, is like looking through a tangle of spaghetti, producing the cosmic microwave foreground. The observational evidence has already been accumulating for the existence of helically twisted filament pairs and braids at all scales. In solar flares. In star-forming molecular clouds. In supernova remnants, planetary nebulae and other diffuse nebulae. Within galaxies. Connecting galaxies. And even galaxy clusters. Indeed, in June this year (2021), phys.org reported on a finding by an international team of astronomers and I quote, ”...mapping the motion of galaxies in huge filaments that connect the cosmic web... that these long tendrils of galaxies spin on the scale of hundreds of millions of light years” and that ”rotation on such enormous scale has never been seen before. The results published in Nature Astronomy signify that angular momentum can be generated on unprecedented scales.” End quote. The phys.org report states ”Noam Libeskind, initiator of the project at the AIP, says, and I quote, ”Despite being thin cylinders - similar in dimensions to pencils - hundreds of millions of light years long, but just a few million light years in diameter, these fantastic tendrils of matter rotate.’” On these scales the galaxies within them are themselves just specks of dust. They  move on helixes, or corkscrew-like orbits, circling around the middle of the filament while traveling along it. Such a spin has never been seen before on such enormous scales, and the implication is that there must be an as yet unknown physical mechanism responsible for torquing these objects.’” Of course standard model astrophysics has no explanation for the observed helical and rotational motion. The phys.org report reveals, ”How the angular momentum responsible for the rotation in a cosmological context is one of the key unsolved problems of cosmology.” Of course, the problem remains unsolved because there is no tool, or combination of tools in the Standard Model tool kit that can produce helically twisted filament pairs and braids, other than by development of the physics of magnetic flux tubes which are, after all, merely an effect of electric currents. The Electric Universe provides the answer. Rotating electric currents impart spin to galaxies, stars and planets as first proposed by Dr. Bruce almost 80 years ago. It provides a simple explanation for Eddington's admission, and I quote, “...the fact is that rotation of celestial objects is altogether mysterious...” End quote. They are responsible for the remarkable alignment of galactic spins over cosmological distances and, as Alfven noted, they are responsible for transferring energy and momentum over large and very large distances. I predict that the James Webb Space Telescope with its vast improvement in sensitivity and resolution, will  reveal the existence of the connecting network of helically twisted filamentary pairs and braids even more clearly. We will discover helically twisted filament pairs and braids everywhere we look. I make the same prediction for the square kilometer array and the extremely large telescope and indeed every new telescope that significantly extends observational sensitivity and resolution. Returning to stars,  two properties of stars we can measure from their light are luminosity and color or surface temperature. They are presented as a scatter plot in a Hertzsprung Russell diagram which, from an electrical engineer's point of view, is strangely mirror reversed, with stars getting  cooler as you go from left to right. There is, as Professor Don Scott writes in his excellent book The Electric Sky, an elegant correspondence between the electric star plot and the electric Sun model. The luminosity and color of a star is due  to plasma discharge phenomena in the ionosphere of a dense planetary type body. All bright main sequence stars exhibit a phenomenon seen in the laboratory on the anode of a low-pressure gas discharge, where increasing current density causes bright secondary plasma tufts to progressively crowd the photosphere to give the appearance of granulation, eventually forcing the photosphere to expand  and the spectrum to move from yellow towards blue and increasing the luminosity. Periodic behavior observed in photospheres, like sunspots and helioseismic oscillations, are driven by resonant behavior in the interstellar and interplanetary circuits. You may notice gas giant planets in the lower left-hand corner of the plot, together with the red dwarfs. That's  deliberate. There are no failed electric stars. In that region the bright photospheric plasma tufting reduces and disappears and we see only the red anode glow of the red and brown dwarf stars enveloping their gas giant nucleus. Our  Sun's more compact red anode glow is seen briefly as the chromosphere during total solar eclipses. The red anode sheath effectively increases the anode surface area of a star to collect sufficient electrons to stabilize it in the galactic circuit. Red giant stars have a gigantic glowing anode sheath. Their powerful stellar winds are caused by positive ions, stripped from the atmosphere and body inside, and accelerated away from the star by an electric field that strengthens as the anode sheath expands. The density of the ions passing through that anode glow contributes to their brightness. Variations in the plasma environment cause the observed changes in size and brightness of red giants and can produce dramatic flaring from electric arc ejection of matter from the star. The red giant Betelgeuse has recently demonstrated many of these phenomena. I predicted in 2008 that dense red stars will appear as giants. The  other outliers in the Hertzsprung- Russell plot are the white dwarfs. Eddington wrote about white dwarfs when first discovered, quote, “Strange objects, which persist in showing a type of spectrum entirely out of keeping with their luminosity, may  ultimately teach us more than a host which radiates according to rule.”  End quote. He got that right, ultimately. Here's the lesson: The luminosity in the Hertzsprung Russell diagram has a mathematical relationship to the mass of the star, however  the luminosity of a white dwarf frequently differs by a factor of 100 from that of another with almost the same mass and apparent chemical composition. The first problem is that mass is undefined in physics. The second  problem is that the universal gravitational constant, or big G, has  a mathematical dimension of mass and mass according to m=E/c2 is an energetic variable. So, the luminosity of a star can't tell us how much matter is in that star. The calculations that require white dwarfs composed of dense matter are worthless. White dwarf stars are a simple coronal  discharge. It's like the faint white light we see around the Sun in a total eclipse, which  demonstrates the low luminosity of such a discharge. White dwarfs have no bright photosphere or chromosphere. The galactic electric field reaches down to the  star and is strong enough to smear out the hydrogen spectrum and excite the spectra of heavier elements sputtered from the planetary body of the star. A plasma discharge can switch discontinuously between dark, glow and arc mode, as we see in the abrupt brilliant flaring and X-rays of faintly glowing brown dwarf stars, nova outbursts and the sudden searchlight brilliance of a supernova.  These outbursts are caused by exploding plasma double layers where a cosmic circuit is suddenly opened and the store of electromagnetic energy in that circuit arcs across the switch. For a nova and supernova, the power stored in an interstellar circuit is unleashed on the hapless star and heavy elements from its planetary core jetted into space, as Dr. Charles Bruce hypothesized. The structure of the interstellar circuit in that event can often be seen lit up around the remnant. In no circumstance does anything going on inside the star cause it to explode. Last we come to the family of brown dwarf  stars. These stars are arguably the most important target for the infrared James Webb telescope because they are the most numerous and some of the closest stars to us. The telescope should confirm that all brown dwarfs are gas giant-sized bodies, enclosed in a huge red anode glow. To give some idea, if Jupiter’s present invisible plasma sheath were lit up, it would appear in the sky at opposition the size of the Sun. Brown dwarfs are simply small red giants. All red stars lack the transistor action of a bright main sequence photosphere which steadies a star's radiance as their electrical input varies. So, the phenomenal shrinkage in size of Betelgeuse over many years with steady luminosity, followed by its recent polar ejection of matter and dimming, is easy to understand. Like their giant brothers, brown dwarfs can be expected to show the same behaviors and like red giants, have an unexpectedly strong stellar wind for such a cool star. A lower-mass brown dwarf in a binary system has already been found hotter than its higher mass companion. Such a reversal of temperatures with mass is not predicted by any theoretical model for brown dwarfs. So, I expect new discoveries to confirm important parts of this narrative and not require any ad hoc additions to the Electric Universe explanation. In part three I will talk about what the James Webb telescope may tell us about the newborn planets and the subsequent formation of planetary systems and it includes the formation of the solar system and the recent history of the earth. It's a cosmology that involves us. [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info It's one of the great enduring mysteries of solar physics -- why is the Sun's lower corona hundreds of times hotter than the Sun's photosphere? For many decades, scientists on Earth have sought an answer to the puzzle, doing so exclusively within the confines of the standard model of the Sun. Recently, a team of scientists reported observational evidence that the mysterious rise in temperature could be driven by so-called “magnetic plasma pulses." As reported by Phys.org, an international team of scientists, led by the University of Sheffield, have discovered previously undetected observational evidence of frequent energetic wave pulses the size of the UK, transporting energy from the solar surface to the higher solar atmosphere. Of course, like all scientific data, both what the scientists are looking for and how they interpret what they see, is governed by their theoretical premises. In this episode, we asked Dr. Donald Scott for a comprehensive overview of the Electric Sun model’s explanation for the mystery of coronal heating. For many years, the mainstream astrophysical community has been seeking an explanation for the tremendously hot temperatures of the Sun's lower corona. It's a classic problem, they've been doing it for decades, they've been worried about it for decades, but that Sun's lower corona is more than 300 times hotter than the 6,000 Kelvin photosphere, which is below it, if you can imagine 300 x 6,000, it's in the millions of Kelvin. And so, it's outrageous that the Sun's outer layer should be hotter than its inner layer, close to where they presume the source of the heat is. This search has been punctuated by a  series of press releases, especially in Phys.org which is the source of all these press releases, NASA press releases and stories about these sorts of things. So for example, I'll just go  through a bunch of them. In December 2007, one of these things came out and said what they included in their words were, "Powerful magnetic Alfvén waves in the electrically charged gas near the Sun have always been a leading candidate for why this happens. Alfvén waves are created by convective motions, get this, when convective motions and sound waves push magnetic fields around." I didn't know you could move magnetic fields by playing rock music and push them around. But that's the kind of level of under- standing or misunderstanding that these things are full of, they always refer to magnetic reconnection which Hannes Alfvén essentially demolished as a non-process, but they always prefer the magnetic reconnection. Also, like in June 2012, there was an article 'Space tornadoes power the atmosphere of the Sun', where they make a great emphasis on "Applied mathematicians from the University of Sheffield...say that the solar tornadoes carry the energy from below the Sun's surface up to the lower corona” and they are of course in the form of magnetic waves. These are applied mathematicians who never got close to an observatory, but they're explaining how all of this stuff works, supposedly. In July of 2018, there was  one press release that I will spend some time talking about, if you don't mind. The story is this, it says, "...coronal heating problem begins with a green spectral line observed during an 1869 total eclipse. Because different elements emit light at characteristic wavelengths, scientists can use spectrometers to analyze light from the Sun and identify its composition," that's quite right. "But the green line observed in 1869 didn't correspond to any known elements on Earth. So scientists thought perhaps they'd discovered a new element that didn't exist on Earth and they called it coronium." Because it was observed in the corona. Anyway, that was one of  the first fictions that these people have invented along with black holes and neutron stars and... Anyway, "Not until 70 years later, a Swedish physicist discovered that the element responsible for the emission is of all things, iron, superheated to the point that it's ionized 13 times, that is to say it is so hot that it has released 13 of its outer electrons, leaving it with just about half the electrons of a normal atom of iron. And therein lies the problem: Scientists have calculated that such high levels of ionization would require coronal temperatures of around 2 million Kelvin, actually. So anyway, that's where the whole problem was discovered. But, these press releases continue, year after year, and they talk about heating of different elements  that are heated at different rates, they're right at the doorstep, it seems to me, of when they start talking about ionization, of recognizing what the source of the whole phenomenon is, that it is electrical. Those ions are ripped out of there by electric fields. But anyway, those ions that do escape the Sun, are those ions form what's called the solar wind. All of these press releases in my mind tend to use what I call ‘purple prose.’ A perfect example of this is on August 2018, it says, "For the first time, a NASA spacecraft will swoop in and touch the Sun." ’Purple prose’ is text that's so extravagant or ornate, or flowery as to break the flow of a person's text and draw excessive attention to itself; I am reading from the dictionary, that's what purple prose is defined as being. Well if that isn't the purple prose, "It's going to swoop in and touch  the surface of the Sun." The Sun doesn't have any surface, first part, but anyway, that's the level, I'm trying to get across to you, that of the PR, of  purpleness of the prose, based on a really fundamental misunderstanding of what is actually going on up there. The last press release: so let me  talk a little bit about my reaction to it. It does mention the four suites of scientific instruments that are on the Parker Solar Probe. First of all, that Parker Solar Probe is an absolutely astounding marvel of engineering. To get that probe as close to the Sun as they’re going to get it (and it has actually made one close approach already), is just marvelous. And the instrumentation that's on board is apparently exactly what they need. Here are some important numbers that I get from that release, in fact, they emphasize that. The Parker Solar Probe's closest approach to the Sun is going to be around 4 million miles, that's six million four hundred thousand kilometers. Now, the Sun's radius is about 695,000 kilometers and therefore the Parker Solar Probe's closest approach to the Sun is going to be 9.25 solar radii. That's the closest that the probe is going to get to. In 2016, I gave a talk, at the EU Conference, that extends the Juergens model and I mean the motive for talking to you this morning is that I'd like people to be familiar with what Juergens, and to what extent I've been able to extend his model, explain the very things that  these folks are looking for, except I submit, we've got the real reason that these phenomena occur, and it isn't going to be discovered or harvested by fancy mathematical analysis or computer simulations, especially when you don't understand at the beginning, what is going on. So anyway, in that talk, if you take a look at slide five just for example, shows the three major layers of the Sun's outer edge, the Sun is positively charged and it's full of positive ions that are ready to escape, and the photosphere, that you see here, consists of charges, clumped into anode tufts. These serve as  a barrier to other positive charges within the Sun. It's like a dam at the end of a reservoir. That's really the Juergens model of the Sun. And this is really the basis for everything that the Electric Universe thinks about the Sun. Anyway, slide twelve shows the 3 plots there, which I've shown many times. The top curve is a plot of the voltage, with points on the line. It starts at the surface of the Sun on the left, and goes out through the top of one of those tufts, those photospheric tufts, out toward the corona. It's like the cross section of a dam, at the end of the reservoir, we'll come back to that in a minute. The middle plot is a plot of the electric field, and the electric field is simply a force, a force directed toward the right on any positive ion in that area and while the chromosphere, that is from points B to D, while in there, the flow is laminar. That is to say that's a ski-jump that goes down there and any flow, whether it's electrons, or protons, in an electric field, that laminar flow is a  dethermalized flow. Laminar flow is the opposite  of turbulent, it's slick. Turbulence is measured, at least  in a plasma, by its temperature, so when you say a plasma is hot, it means the elements in that plasma are really in random, violent random motion. But anyway, the bottom plot there, it shows that the ions are moving, it's just a plot of the velocity. They're moving very fast after point D and they become turbulent, and so that red region at the bottom there shows high temperature. This is the reason for the Sun's hot chromosphere; those ions are coming out of there and colliding in the lower corona with other neutral atoms and other ions that are there to start with and they go out toward the right hand side and after they get past that area, there are no collisions. So anyway, slide 16, to jump ahead. These are the properties of the fast solar wind. Essentially, what is a fancy name for the flow of those ions that we’ve just seen coming over the tops of those tufts in the photosphere. Then it emanates from regions of the Sun's surface where there are no sunspots. A sunspot is a place where there are no photospheric tufts and that's why it looks black and when you look at the regular surface of the Sun through a telescope, hopefully it's a solar telescope for otherwise you'll go blind instantly, but you can see these photospheric tufts, so they move around and they disappear. That solar wind approaches  800 km/s, at approximately 9 solar radii away from the Sun, remember that. The Parker Probe is going to go in  there, get in there, to about 9 solar radii. So at that point, this fast solar wind is going about 800 km/s. So, they should be able to measure  a very intense solar wind flow of ions, at that closest approach. Go to slide 17 and you'll see that only a few ions are energetic enough to get over the top of the dam. You can see in purple there, they  constitute a, this is important, they constitute a low density -- high velocity flow. That is to say, they're falling from a great height, a great voltage, which is the same thing, and therefore they get very, very fast at the bottom. But not too many of them make it  over the top of the dam, so it's a low density, it's not very much water in that flow, not very many ions. Slide 18 shows a hydraulic analogy of the fast solar wind and it shows what that water would look like when  coming over that sluice gate. Slide 19 talks about the slow solar wind. Now, that's a different animal. The slow solar wind emanates from the equatorial region of the Sun, mainly from sunspots, and its maximum velocity is only about half the fast solar wind velocity, but its ion density is more than 3 times denser than the fast solar wind. But it's much slower than the fast solar wind. Now why, what happens? Well, in a sunspot, there are no photospheric tufts, the dam has been broken or removed and so it's the, water it’s just, or in this case the ions, they're just free to flow outward. And slide 24 shows a low velocity -- high density flow. The difference between the two water levels in that picture is not very much. The river is only a few feet higher than the level of the land onto which the water is flowing. But, it's a lot of water, therefore it's a high density flow. The next slide, slide 25, just shows the bottom of a sluice and both the fast and the slow solar winds; where the fast wind comes out of the tops of the tufts, and the slow solar wind comes out of a sunspot. Both of them can create very strong turbulence when they collide with ions farther out, at the bottom of the corona, just like the water here at the bottom of the sluice gate. It is just colliding with the motionless water and perhaps some rocks at the bottom on this slide and it becomes quite turbulent, and as I said before, temperature is a measure of this turbulence. So that's the explanation for this hot, solar temperature at the bottom of the corona. The next slide, slide 27 is a statement made by a well-known helio- astronomer, Dr. Grail. He said, "Our results indicate that the acceleration of the solar wind is almost complete by 10 Solar Radii, much closer to the Sun than had been expected. This is about where the Parker Probe is going to get to and the acceleration is almost complete at that point. He said, this is important, "this suggests that the acceleration of the solar wind and the heating of the solar corona occur in essentially the same region, and thus that the underlying mechanisms may be strongly linked. And I remember to this day, when I presented that I said, strongly linked, you got to be kidding, they're the same mechanism! They are the electric mechanism described by Juergens' model and it's obvious what's going on if you just realize what the cause is, it's really pretty simple. And anyway, therefore, given the fact that the Parker Probe isn't going to approach the Sun closely enough to even get into the corona, even the outer edges of the corona, they only extend out about four, or maybe at most five solar radii. Now, the corona itself exists way out but it becomes dark mode plasma, you can't see it. I think what does happen is that the corona forms in its outer regions these, what are called coronal caps. And those coronal caps are the basis for Birkeland currents that go out farther, but it's a filamentary kind of a flow out farther. We'll see, perhaps they can measure, if they're out that far, how these Birkeland currents do flow farther than coronal caps, we'll see. Anyway, slide 31 just lays it out, it says that Juergens' model explains why the plasma corona exists in the first place and it explains the inverted temperature profile and it explains how the strong electric field above the photospheric tufts accelarates the ions of the fast solar wind. Slide 32 is my contribution to this. I submit that that extension of Juergens' work, explains that the solar photospheric tufts are variable electrical barriers for the positive ions attempting to escape from the Sun. They're also traps for incoming electrons, we haven't mentioned that this morning, but they are. Why there are two very different solar winds, one fast, one slow? Because they come from two different places and are formed by two different electrical, I emphasize that, electrical mechanisms. Why the fast wind is faster than the slow wind, why it has a lower density? That's because of where it comes from. Why the electron temperature is the same in both winds -- that's simply because the electrons don't go through the same mix master that the ions do. Why do the tufts go away and collapse in a short time -- yeah because those photospheric tufts fill up with electrons and they neutralize and they disappear, relegated out of existence by recombination between electrons and ions. And last but not least, why is the fast solar wind why does it come out of the coronal holes? Well, a coronal hole is simply a place where there are no sunspots, so they come out of the typical photospheric tufts. Here's the important point -- none of these mechanisms occur at locations accessible to the Parker Probe. None of them. All of these mechanisms occur way down at the base of the corona in or just above the photosphere and the chromosphere, and so the Parker Probe hasn't got a ghost of a chance of getting into where these mechanisms occur. And it will be impossible for the probe to prove anything about magnetic Alfvén waves, I'm sure that they're dying to do that, but it will be impossible, because the probe can't possibly get in close enough, that is to say below the corona and observe what's really happening. No matter how complicated the mathematical analysis or advanced computer  simulations are, it's not going to be of any help if you don't understand the electrical nature of what's going on in the first place. Stay tuned for Don Scott's and Wal Thornhill's analysis of SAFIRE Project's latest update. 
presents Exposing the Myths of "Settled Science" at the Natural Philosophy Alliance 20th Annual Conference College Park Maryland Exposing the Myths of Settled Science subtitled - A Guide for the Perplexed - And I do understand that the NPA members are not perplexed, but I ask people here today. How many believe that the foundational assumptions of the theoretical sciences deserve to be called settled science? That they are fully secure? How did I know that? Not even close I heard. Just a few observations, 'The myths of settled science rely upon public confusion'. I think everyone here understands that that's true to one degree or another. In every field people are confused because they don't know what or whom to believe. They think the issues are too deep to be grasped by outsiders or by us plebeians. Imagination is trapped in the myths of settled science... without realizing how these myths arose. It's incredible to discover how a couple of core assumptions, foundational assumptions filtered into the entire domain, the entire edifice of theoretical science. The two assumptions are: ● Gravity alone rules the cosmos. ● Gravity's behavior must be interpreted through the lens of relativity theory. And I'm just going to concentrate on the first one because I do understand that the second one gets a lot of attention by members of the NPA. Just a quick outline here of the innumerable domains of specialized investigation that depend ultimately upon the foundational idea that gravity is king. There is no other force doing real work across cosmic distances. I presume everybody can see the type, I tried to make the type deliberately large here. And yet, a new vantage point is emerging today, and that vantage point is highlighting the newly discovered roles of electricity across the cosmos. Now, there's no sound playing, obviously, there is on my system and that's not gonna mean a lot, but... We always thought that the earth was the unique location of electrical activity at energies of this sort. And yet, now we know that the electric force is active from microcosm to macrocosm. And how many people here would want to defend the idea that spectacular structures in space of this sort can be reconstructed through Newton's gravitational equation? We honors pioneers such as Kristian Birkeland and Hannes Alfvén experimental pioneers in the role of electricity in space, and dozens of others could be mentioned. The key components of an Electric Universe paradigm are first, electric current across cosmic distances, that's across interstellar and intergalactic distances; electric galaxy formation; electric star formation; electric sun and electrified heliosphere; electrical scarring of planets and moons; electric comets, that's comets plunging through the electric field of the Sun to discharge electrically; electricity of life, a huge new domain of investigation within the Electric Universe community today; the quantum role of the electric force. I know many people in the NPA are exploring this and the connection to the underpinnings of gravity itself; and the electrified ancient sky, that's my own field of concentrated study for decades and I'm really not going to even touch that field here today, other than to say it does bring the Electric Universe with it. Now, I formulated what I call a core prediction of the Electric Universe based simply on observation of what's in the science news these days. When we examine energetic events in space, we will always find electromagnetic intensities far beyond the ability of prior theory to explain them. And this has been born out to the most extraordinary degree and this incidentally is why we called our conference earlier this year 'The Tipping Point'. It's not a reference to a psychological / cultural phenomenon this phenomenon hasn't entered into popular consciousness at all yet. It hasn't found its way even any clear and meaningful way into the scientific media, but the facts as we say, 'discovery by discovery one surprise at a time', taking the entire field of inquiry into the Electric Universe unannounced. And the admonition is question all theoretical assumptions when they stopped working. The big picture of space we say is broken, broken in more ways than one, it's not working and it's broken in the sense that the picture of the cosmos is one of isolated islands. An isolated island means that to discover what's going on dynamically you can only find the answer by looking inside the island, the larger context of surrounding space has nothing to contribute by way of an answer. Thanks to the explosion of technology in recent decades we have the opportunity to see objects in space across the entire electromagnetic spectrum Well, this is the ideal for anyone pursuing the Electric Universe paradigm. Here was galaxy M87, just before the space-age. Now, M87 courtesy of Hubble Telescope and a structure spreading thousands of light years across the deep vacuum of space. X-ray emissions concentrated along this jet, remembering that this jet is across a vacuum greater than we can produce and any laboratory. It is entirely enigmatic in an electrically neutral Cosmos. At the core of M87 we see emissions in radio and X-ray wavelengths, but actually across the entire spectrum and that's the signature of synchrotron radiation, the highest magnitude radiation known to science today. And synchrotron radiation was first predicted by Nobel Laureate, father of modern plasma science, Hannes Alfvén. But what does standard theory see? Standard theory sees this speck that is identified, theoretically, as the irresistible attractor. But what is it doing? It is shooting charged particles away from the black hole at the center of M87. It's important for everyone considering an Electric Universe paradigm to wrap their minds as best they can around the distance involved in this stupendous jets. How far does light travel in a second? 186,000 miles How far does it travel in a year? It's something like 5.88 trillion miles and that is a light year of course. These distances are typically counted in parsecs. A parsec is 3.26 light-years. This jet is 50,000 parsecs, and now it's measured electrically. Measurement of the Electric Current in a Kpc-Scale Jet. "We obtained for the first time a direct determination of a galactic-scale electric current (~3 x 10^18 A)." It's just unfathomable what is occurring across this unimaginable distance of vacuum in space, "Our analysis strongly supports a model where the jet energy flow is mainly electromagnetic." There are no islands in space. Just imagine having to defend the idea that infinitesimal speck inside that glow to the lower left is producing all of this. The truth is that if you had an electron microscope to look at this image at this scale, you would not see the black hole. And if the image that you did see was brought up and you had another electron microscope to look, you still wouldn't see the black hole. How did it happen that we became so confined theoretically that we are required to look inside that galactic core and ignore the charged particles that constitute a sea of plasma feeling this unbelievable volume of space and it really is impossible to wrap our minds around that. Galaxies are immersed in the surrounding electromagnetic emissions. There's the galaxy. And again, why would we ignore the power of charged particles in that immense volume of space that constitutes the context of this galaxies appearance? And now we know that magnetic fields pervade the universe, and we see this as science coming to the Electric Universe through the back door. It is not possible in the vacuum of space to create a magnetic field or to sustain a magnetic field in the absence of electric currents. We're talking about converging evidence, and we can bring the focus down to our own cosmic neighborhood and explore the sun and ask ourselves now the question that has never been ask in 70 years of solar physics. Is the Sun truly an island in space with no electrical connection to billions of stars in the sea of plasma that constitute the Milky Way? Interestingly, we now see, courtesy of the new technologies, the new telescopes and so on, we see star formation along concentrated plasma filaments or current filaments and the expression 'Beads on a String' is coming into the popular scientific lexicon. "Beads on a String" Well, that's the very phrasing used by Hannes Alfvén and such plasma scientists as Anthony Peratt who we got to know quite well. "Beads on a String" Now, does gravity create filamentation? Can gravity act on a filamentation to create a concentration of matter in a sphere? That concentration into a star forming region and the birth of a sun or star is the language of the plasma cosmologist. And here's an amazing fact, we didn't do this graph here: the width of those filaments has now been measured in infrared, and they are strikingly consistent. This is from the Herschel telescope, and you can see the region on the electromagnetic spectrum where they are able to actually measure the widths of these filaments quite precisely. And again, that is a prediction of plasma cosmology. "This consistency of the widths demands an explanation." "...Herschel has shown that newly-born stars are often found in the densest parts of them." That's a prediction of plasma cosmology. Then, to explore the heliospheric boundary, we resorted to the IBEX mission. The Interstellar Boundary Explorer It was funded on the basis of 30 predictions, and every prediction failed! The thing that's really shocking is this ribbon of energetic neutral atoms. Why in the deep vacuum of space would atoms ever be energized or gather into a ribbon? This is what happens in an electrical interpretation of the heliospheric boundary. Voyager's out there now, and it's left them all scratching their heads. I'm not the one to argue a point here but I can tell you if you will follow Wal Thornhill's predictions with respect to what is found at the heliosphere boundary, you will see a remarkable accord. And nothing that was anticipated by conventional theory, which imagined the heliosphere moving to neutral space, kinda like a comet that’s warping the magnetosphere into kind of comet-like tail, it's not there. "It's a huge surprise. In some sense we have touched the intergalactic medium, but we're still inside the sun's house." "The models that have been thought to predict what should happen are all incorrect." This is not a small thing. So, we come right to the Sun itself and ask, well, we know its big and round, but do we really know much more about it accurately. It's been on the table for decades the idea that the Sun could be a glow discharge responding to an electrified environment. Geissler tubes, Crookes tubes, neon tubes and all those exquisite cultural expressions. Controlled Fusion? It is time to actually raise the thermonuclear Sun model to doubt, to serious questioning. We know thermonuclear fusion occurs; we've seen it out of control. But we were so confident in the thermonuclear core of the Sun that we have spent hundreds of billions of dollars believing we could replicate that within 20 years. The 20-year timetable was announced in 1950, and we're still seeing the 20-year timetable. This is a tokamak. "In any useful fusion device, the energy output must exceed the energy required to confine and heat the plasma." It has never happened! Is it possible for us to begin wondering if our assumption about what was possible and what is occurring in the Sun is actually incorrect. This then forces on us a question of logic and reasoning on the basis of things we now know. How many attributes of the Sun follow from the assumption of a thermonuclear core? It's incredible, not a single one. This will drive some people crazy, and they'll immediately challenges us on this, but I believe it's absolutely true. One question can be formulated in these different ways, and do gases just boil off the surface of the Sun as "wind" as that last question is posed? Are surface features driven entirely from below? Are sunspot penumbra the "convection cells" we assume them to be? Now, I believe that the answer to all of these questions is not just no, but a definitive - No - in the sense that when all the evidence bearing on the question, once you ask it, it is not a coincidence that it's always pointing to the negative answer. So, "The Neutrino Problem" that was the phrase from solar physics when they examined the neutrino production of the Sun and they found it was just one-third of what was predicted by their model. Since then, there's been a lot of rationalization as to what's happening to neutrinos on their course from the Sun and that's not something for me to get into. But I can tell you, that in electrical terms, there is an answer to the neutrino issue that comes from a completely different way of seen everything. When a coronal mass ejection, a particularly strong coronal mass ejection occurs, the neutrino count goes up. Now, a coronal mass ejection is a surface event. Once we see that a surface event is creating neutrinos thermonuclear reactions are occurring at the surface. How can we ignore the simple fact that the surface of the Sun is incomparably greater then the focal point of a coronal mass ejection. Could we redirect scientific investigation, at least long enough, to determine if the Sun is dynamically presenting behavior consistent with thermonuclear reactions at the surface? There was on Wikipedia a very well presented page on surface thermonuclear reactions on the Sun, and you can imagine what happened to it. A year and a half or two years ago it was taken down. Solar Constancy & Solar Variability I see the issue of constancy on the one hand and variability on the other hand as posing questions that are simply not been asked. We can pose them from interdisciplinary vantage point just looking at issues of logic and reasoning. In visible light the Sun does not vary more than one-tenth of 1% over the entire solar cycle. That's the general rule. At higher frequencies, which are not coincidentally at higher elevations the variability grows profound. Here's the variability in ultraviolet light. And in X-rays through one solar cycle, the Sun virtually blinks out. Additionally, you have in X-rays this equally profound regional variation. And we have to reflect on how could it happen that a thermonuclear core would produce by heat transferred outward a uniquely stable photosphere. And then as you rise into a higher elevations, you get profound variability of emissions. What is causing that variability? Well, here is something that bears directly on that kind of question. And the line you see there is a voltage curve that was initially produced by Ralph Juergens, a brilliant engineer, who as you might say the father of the electric sun hypothesis, this goes back four or five decades. What that curve is, is a curve of the glow discharge, the voltage curve of the glow discharge. Wal Thornhill then has worked with this, and Don Scott has worked with this curve to explore how a voltage curve could relate to the known layers of the Sun. A breakthrough occurred with Don Scott when he looked at that curve and he said, that is the configuration, that's the profile of a transistor. And this gave rise then to a breakthrough concept of a transistor action on the Sun. And if you look at that curve that is stable across the photosphere just the slightest elevation or depression of that curve, if it's a transistor, would be regulating to a much greater degree other activity of the Sun, just as a transistor does. I am not qualified to evaluate the transistor effect in the Sun, but I have asked several electric engineers, one is here today, in fact - Hi Roger, and everyone has said, it makes perfect sense. The spicules of the Sun have to be investigated from a new vantage point and so much of this has to do with the inter-facial dynamics of different plasma regions and charged particles being launched into higher regions and so on. And to both Don Scott and Wal Thornhill place a great emphasis on the study of the spicule dynamics. Solar Wind Certain aspects of the Sun are so clear-cut in demonstrating that the sun has this electrical underpinning. But we hear from NASA that: "[The solar wind] defies a complete description by any one theory." They say, "It's hotter than expected, for one, and no one has yet agreed which of several theories offers the best explanation..." But these statements are made because there's no acknowledgment that an electric sun hypothesis deserves consideration. And I believe that this chart is the single most important chart that has come out the electric sun concept because it is showing you charged particles doing what only an electric field can do. You see down at the Sun's surface into the lower corona and into the upper corona spectacular acceleration. And then, across interplanetary space 96 million miles these charged particles are slowly, mile by mile, being accelerated, very slowly and immeasurably at any particular point but, this is published fact, accelerated across interplanetary distances and they are not little rocket ships. Something is acting on these charged particles, and that something as demonstrated in the laboratory for centuries, that something is an electric field. It's always good when there's an issue of principle or dynamic activity with a model behind it, take it to the extremes. And the transistor effect would in fact allow for the solar wind to completely stop because it's being regulated by a superior regulator, which is across the photosphere. And in January 2005, a coronal mass ejection reach the earth in 30 minutes. It was traveling a quarter the speed of light by the time it reached the Earth. So, it's not a small matter to simply acknowledge that an electric field is self-evidently present. There is nothing known to science which could accomplish that extreme other than any electric field. Photosphere It's imagery of this sort that has convinced folks that through the convective zone temperatures plasma are bubbling upward to form granulation or cellular structures. But we have to ask the question, "Are all energetic events on the Sun being driven by forces acting from below?" That's the bedrock of standard theory: everything is energized from below. Is there no evidence for electrical action from above? The evidence appears to be everywhere if we'll just ask the question. Here's the idea of the magnetic flux-injection hypothesis if you look at these twisted magnetic fields, which looks suspiciously like Birkeland Currents, they are all being pushed up from below in this model. It's called the flux- injection hypothesis. I spent a lot of time just asking myself, well, if the Sun is electrical that hypothesis won't stand up. And so I looked into the literature, and I found an article by Peter Shuck this is the best article I found, honestly, on the subject quite apart from my preference at finding such a thing. it is the best article I could find in terms of systematic evaluation and he says in that article in no uncertain terms, the flux-injection hypothesis does not work. The budget of energy that must be present in the lower region is not available. Shuck determined that the flux injection hypothesis doesn't work and must be dropped. What he found instead was... What he found instead was a sudden explosion triggered from above more like lightning. And that takes you right back to the worker of Charles Bruce in England, again decades ago a real pioneer who noticed that the signature spectroscopically of this energetic activity on the Sun is the signature of lightning; this is an electrified surface. Sunspots & Convection We can take this whole issue further by looking at sunspots you have a spotless sun and a more normal sun. And when we look into the sunspot what we see is the cooler subsurface region. But if it is millions of degrees rushing upward through the convective zone, how does it happen that we cannot find in the center of any sunspot any indication of subsurface super temperatures? So, sunspots are like an acid test because you see these penumbral filaments on the margin and they can only be one thing under the standard model. They are convection cells. You have to have convection, the heat has to get out somewhere and they think they see it and they talk about overturning convection but when you pull back up into the chromosphere it's not quite what they were expecting and you see everything is actually dominated and confided contained by magnetic fields. It's charged particles moving along the filamentary pathways. What does this have to do with temperature? Well, they decided that this was overturning convection. It depends how you diagnose something like this. Wow, that looks like the stuff is just pouring out. But this is actually quite deceptive because what you're seeing actually is material moving outward and show you more closely. The stuff around the penumbra is moving outward and that's what you're seeing in that image but the penumbra, the stuff is pouring into the sunspot. And Wal Thornhill has such an elementary explanation. He says, this is like tornadoes touching down. It's an electrical phenomena, and the discharging you actually watch this overtime and you can see, and in other NASA animations, you can see how what Wal Thornhill would predict, which is an explosive glow at a particular point that comes and goes but at the tips they're dipping down, it's a tornado touching down I don't think any anyone ever in the history of the electric's sun hypothesis before Wal Thornhill proposed that these twisting, helical filaments where actually tornado-like electrically-driven filaments. Where's the Convection But then again there's the overturning convection hypothesis. And for years now solar physicists have been seeking to find overturning convection and verify, through temperature profiles and so on, that it's superheated material rising surface they've been looking to the filaments of the penumbra and suggesting, well, maybe the temperature is being siphoned up through the center the penumbra. Where is the convection? Well, again you can find an article 'searching for overturning convection' by Professor Rubio of Italy and company "Despite the excellent quality of the data set, we do not detect downflows that could be associated with overturning convection in deep layers." "The lack of a clear detection of overturning downflows may simply indicate that they do not exist." Well, that would be news because you if you have no convection, you have no nuclear furnace. Well, they did an "MRI" of the Sun, they were so confident in convection, that means they could look into the deeper layers of the Sun through magnetic resonance imaging, and they were quite confident that that's how they would confirm that the motion of those charged particles convected upwards would explain the magnetic field of the Sun. At best they found 1% of the convection they needed. And notice this, "The result... upends our understanding of how heat is transported outwards by the Sun..." See, it upends our understanding of what we know is happening. They don't question whether what they think they know is actually known, is actually true. Same here, "...and challenges existing explanations of the formation of sunspots and magnetic field generation". But no fundamental questioning of the nuclear core hypothesis even though it requires something that is clearly not happening. Coronal Heating Corona heating, this is discussed so much within our circle, I'm not gonna make a big deal out of this. I just like the humor astronomer Jay Pasachoff saying that it's been solved a dozen times. And since he said that it's been solved another dozen times. And they continue to solve it, and what they get lasts only weeks or months. I'm gonna give a ridiculously elementary example of coronal heating from a radically different vantage point, the vantage point that would emphasize inter-facial boundaries between two domains, both of which are contributing to a dynamic event. Here's a candle; where's the heat, the maximum heat? It's not down at the fuel supply. It's in the interface of the fuel supply and the surrounding oxygen. In 1996, I was caught in a ridiculous debate with some people on it all talk I will call talk origins, and I said you know if you put a candle in space so that you didn't have gravity and you didn't have convection, you'd get a spherical flame, and you would see that the maximum energies are at the boundary of that fuel and the surrounding oxygen. And it just happened that a couple years ago that in the International Space Station they put a candle, and that's exactly what you do get here. That is an example of inter-facial dynamics that can be applied to the Electric Sun where you do not get to ignore the surrounding contribution of the plasma environment through the heat of the Sun and all of the electromagnetic emissions of the Sun and all of the layers of the Sun's atmosphere with such a different levels of constancy and variability. Polar Jets I'd gonna make sure that I get to this presentation. Polar jets that they help to complete the image of solar sized magnet here but this is not new, I mean, Birkeland's experiment gave you polar jets and essentially gave you the core or the focal point of the hourglass form that has been hypothesized by the Electric Sun proponents. And you see in such nebula as in the Butterfly Nebula. Torus The torus that Birkeland produced in his lab is such a beautiful example of the relationship between experimentation and theory. Forget the math until you have got a basis in observation and experiment to direct the mathematicians. Discharging from the torus to the sphere, the magnetized sphere of his terella, you see the polar jets there. And, by golly, the sun has a torus also projected into an axial view. And notice this. How does it occur that the equatorial atmosphere rotates 36 times for every 25 times of the circumpolar rotation? How would something... How would something driving the Sun from within produce super-rotation at the outer layer and at the equator. I mean, actually you're looking here at two levels of differential rotation because it's not just the equatorial atmosphere that is rotating fast, it's rotating faster than the surface below. Now, Wal Thornhill got me to thinking about something, this is a number of years back, he said, the sunspot appears to be, if you follow Birkeland's experiment, the location of a discharge moving right through the visible layer the Sun's atmosphere. I was looking at this and I thought well this is interesting it looks to me as if that discharge is parting the waves, you might say, and anchoring to a slower-moving subsurface layer. And for that reason, it is resisting being moved along by the super-rotating equatorial atmosphere of the Sun. I just think things of this sort would... These stand in such total and self-evident defiance of a standard model that you have to begin looking from an interdisciplinary vantage point, complemented by increasingly specialized research. You have to begin looking at a new picture of the Sun from the ground up because what we were given 70 years ago has failed every test. Earth-Sun Connection Perfect example, again, of the experimental approach and its impact on the future of science was the work of Kristian Birkeland who said, our earth aurora is being produced by charged particles from the Sun entering the upper atmosphere of our Earth. Sydney Chapman, a mathematician and Dean of the Earth-Sun Relationship Studies, said the Earth was insulated, insulated by its magnetosphere, and charged particles could not enter the upper atmosphere of the earth directly. And then in the 70's, we discovered that charged particles from the Sun were indeed entering the Earth's upper atmosphere. And now we call those particle streams Birkeland Currents in honor of the experimentalist. We have look closely enough to see that the currents are moving in cylindrical forms and ironically Don Scott has produced a recent paper, which I hope people will have a chance to access in the next few months, that gives the mathematical bases for this cylindrical or embedded cylindrical form of the auroras of Earth. There are no islands in space! And certainly anyone who has followed the evidence for the Earth-Sun connection, the circuitry connecting both bodies, would have to agree that you're not looking at islands. Question all theoretical assumptions! And that concludes my talk. Thank you. Exposing the Myths of "Settled Science" The Thunderbolts Project™ 
You've just entered the theater of an alien sky. If the words and images seem strange to you there's a reason for this. Our world was once a vastly different place. To experience this won't hurt you and there is nothing to fear. The Ship of Day and Night Ancient images of a cosmic ship give us an opportunity to question many popular assumptions about the ancient sky. Our message is that the sky we see today does not provide a useful guide to the ancient experience. Extraordinary celestial formations above the early sky worshipers provoked an explosion of mythic images. If we can see these images as a reflection of concrete human experience, a reconstruction of the events is possible. For observers on Earth a revolving crescent in the polar sky, reflecting light from the Sun, turned visually around a central orb or star in a daily cycle of brightening and dimming. In human imagination, that revolving crescent was the ancient ship of heaven. One additional feature must be included, as we've earlier noted: the crescent appeared above a cosmic pillar, inspiring a diversity of mythic images. All pointing to the same underlying form - one form in the sky fully explaining what will otherwise appear as hopelessly contradictory images. In our previous episode, we noted the strict identification of the crescent ship with the horns of the Bull of Heaven. Inhabitants of the celestial kingdom sailed on these horns in the daily revolution of a crescent-like ship. We also noted the absolute identity of the Bull's two horns as the twin peaks of the cosmic mountain. We have further suggested that Egyptian and other images of a pillar god either holding aloft the ship, or standing upright in the ship, must be understood in terms of the underlying equation of the ship itself with these outstretched arms. This equation can be fully elaborated. The Pyramid Texts say that the deceased king ascends to the sky to find his place in the cosmic ship - "within the arms of Atum", they say. This identity of the ship and the enclosing arms of the sky is confirmed again and again in Egyptian sources. "[The king is raised up] in the Day-bark... within the arms of Anubis". "Make ready your arms for me, O Ra, come and ferry me over to yonder side..." In the same way the god Osiris sails "on the two arms of Horus". Any doubt on this equation is removed by the description of the ship in the Coffin Texts: "Her starboard side is the right arm of Atum. Her larboard side is the left arm of Atum". But a huge confusion has taken over the language of day and night, due to the subsequent radical change in celestial conditions. In the ancient planetary configuration, the crescent - the mythic ship of heaven - was decsending to the left at sunset and beginning to grow more bright amidst the darkening sky. The ship achieved it's greatest splendor when the crescent reached it's position directly below at midnight. The ship's brightness then began to diminish as it rose to the right. And it was at its weakest when directly overhead. In today's reckoning of time, that would be called Noon. But when Egyptian texts describe the primeval Sun growing bright, the translators can only think of one thing: our familiar Sun rising in the east. That fundamental misconception sets in motion a series of irreconcilable contradictions in all of the standard translations. Egyptian sources are far and away the most complete references on this question. In unequivocal terms, they describe the vehicle of the gods, the ship of heaven, in two phases of a daily cycle, a phase of brightening and a phase of dimming. These phases have nothing to do with the appearance of the Sun itself. The Sun was not even present within the visual theatre of the gods. It was simply the external source of the illuminated circumpolar crescent and it's daily phases of brigtening and dimming. As commonly translated, the Coffin Texts express the hope of every king, upon his death, to find his place "in the Night-bark and the Day-bark like Ra, every day". But the translators can offer no natural referents for the terms. All that is literally meant are the two contrasting phases of growing bright and growing dim, of growing strong and growing weak. Strength and weakness, life and absence of life, waking and sleeping are the literal meanings of such terms. The boat in the phase of growing bright was named Atet, meaning literally, "strong or growing strong". And the boat of growing dim was named Sektet, meaning literally, "weak or growing weak". Once the literal meanings are clear, the mistranslations become transparent. "May you sleep in the night-Bark (Sektet), May you awake in the day-Bark (Atet)" a popular translation reads. The implied connections to sunrise and sunset are provably incorrect, and we can make this clear by simply observing the regional positions of the ship and the directions of the ship's motion in it's daily cycle. Did the ship actually move upward in it's phase of dimming and descend in it's phase of brightening? As we intend to establish beyond any reasonable doubt, the position of the ship was below in the phase of brightness, and above in the phase of weakness. That means a descending motion of the ship as it began to shine brilliantly in the sky and an upward motion as it began to dim. The directions of movement and the associated conditions of brightness and dimming are all critical to the integrity of the symbolism. The Coffin Texts describe the gods sailing upstream in the so-called "night", literally the phase of dimming, exactly the opposite of the solar interpretation, while another spell announces that "The sun shines forth when going downstream from the region above to the region below". Again the opposite of the solar interpretation, and the literal meanings are the key, "May you sail upstream, toward the upper region in the night-Bark (literally the ship of dimming) and downstream, toward the lower region in the day-Bark" (literally the phase of brightening or growing bright). Such texts as these are complemented by numerous others, all confirming that the ship of heaven is indeed an acid test of our reconstruction. We'll return to this explicit evidence in our next episode. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info On this series, we've explored the significance of common forms and shapes seen throughout the cosmos. Plasma, the fourth state of matter, pervades all of the universe and the unique structures produced in plasma laboratories are clearly seen at all scales in space. From the filamentations seen everywhere in the universe, from the giant snake-like filaments reaching from the surface of the Sun to the dark cores of sunspots, to the networks of long thin filaments along which stars form like pearls on a string, to the hourglass shapes of nebulae and the similar double-lobed form that appears to be the common shape of comet nuclei, a form reliably produced by the electromagnetic z-pinch effect in plasma, and even the spiraling structures achieved by parallel currents in the laboratory uncannily matching the form of the spiral galaxy. Plasma particle beams also produce distinct geometric shapes that can prove difficult or even impossible to explain through non-plasma processes when seen in nature. One such shape is the hexagon or polygon which is a generally straight- edged closed-plane form. The hexagonal craters commonly observed on planets and moons challenge planetary scientists since kinetic impact experiments do not produce such craters. However, as seen in these experiments by Jacob Gable, it is a form routinely produced by electrical discharge to a solid surface. Another hexagon in nature has puzzled astronomers since its discovery decades ago. As far back as 1988, scientists studying data from the Voyager mission found evidence for a hexagonal atmospheric structure at the North Pole of Saturn. Decades later, NASA's Cassini-Huygens spacecraft shared with the world the first complete images of the bizarre cloud pattern. Planetary scientists have struggled for an explanation since the form is not seen in any other planetary atmosphere. But in recent years, simple fluidic experiments on Earth have succeeded in producing a hexagonal structure providing an explanation that planetary scientists have heretofore favored. However, Thunderbolts picture of the day managing editor Stephen Smith outlines just some of the problems with this theory in a recent article. He writes, "The fluid dynamic experiment seems to provide a plausible description of what is happening on Saturn if several factors are ignored. First, there are concentric rings around the hexagon, each with different temperatures. Second, Saturn's North and South Poles are hotter than theories predict. Third, there are aurorae at the poles. Fourth, there are powerful currents of electric charge entering and leaving Saturn's poles, connecting it to its family of moons. As previous Picture of the Day articles argue, the plumes of Enceladus, for instance, demonstrate that charge exchange between it and Saturn." Recently, scientific reports have pointed definitively toward a non-fluid dynamics explanation. As reported on September 6 2018 on sciencealert.com "There's something strange over Saturn's north pole. A tremendous structure towering high above the clouds indicates that the planet's peculiar hexagonal formation is much, much bigger than was initially apparent." In 2014, scientists using Cassini's composite infrared spectrometer had begun studying Saturn's northern stratosphere, a region hundreds of kilometers above the atmospheric hexagon. The shocking discovery came when they began observing a vortex far above the famous hexagon. One of the investigators says of their discovery, "As the polar vortex became more and more visible, we noticed it had hexagonal edges, and realized that we were seeing the pre-existing hexagon at much higher altitudes than previously thought." As acknowledged in the Science Alert article, "...since wind conditions change dramatically with altitude, the fact that the hexagon shape persists so much higher than the cloud tops is a baffling conundrum." The Electric Universe position has always been that the key to understanding Saturn's hexagon is the planet's electrical connection to the Sun. The so-called magnetic ropes that have been discovered stretching the nearly 900 million miles from the Sun to Saturn, are one clue to this connection. The Sun is primarily an electrical phenomenon at the focus of a galactic "glow discharge" and electric currents flowing from the Sun to planets has implications for many atmospheric phenomena including the tremendous winds of gas giant planets and also jet streams and weather patterns on Earth. Based on this perspective, in 2005, physicist Wal Thornhill made a prediction that could only seem preposterous from a conventional viewpoint. Thornhill analyzed the mysterious hotspot in the vortex at Saturn's South Pole. The hotspot puzzled planetary scientists because, as described by the Keck Observatory, "...both the distinct boundary of a warm polar vortex some 30 degrees latitude from the southern pole and a very hot 'tip' right at the pole were completely unexpected." Thornhill wrote of this feature, "Its compactness is due to the electromagnetic pinch effect where it enters Saturn's atmosphere." He then stated, "The Electric Universe also predicts, experimentum crucis, that BOTH poles should be hot, not one hot and the other cold." In 2008, the Cassini spacecraft confirmed the astonishing prediction. Astonishing because the freezing cold North Pole had been deprived of sunlight for more than 12 years. Thornhill explained, "The polar hot spot and the long-lived hexagonal feature result from a continuous electric current flowing from the Sun into the pole of Saturn." On the peculiar hexagonal form, consider the side-by-side images on your screen. On the left are vortices of an electron beam etched onto a carbon witness plate. On the right are vortices of an electron beam photographed on a fluorescent screen. The hexagonal form is a distinct feature of a well-documented plasma phenomenon called 'The Diocotron Instability' and the phenomenon observed in the laboratory is remarkably scalable. As noted by Dr. Anthony Peratt in 'Physics of the Plasma Universe', "The vortices of the diocotron instability are found to occur over 12 orders of magnitude in beam current. This mechanism was first introduced to explain auroral curtains by Hannes Alfvén." The persistence of the hexagonal feature, hundreds of kilometers above the Saturnian clouds, is the clearest possible indication it is being driven by energy from above and cannot be explained by simple fluid dynamics. But the basic concept of electric currents flowing from the Sun interacting dynamically with electrically charged bodies, remains a road to new theoretical pathways that planetary scientists have yet to follow. 
welcome to space news from the electric Universe brought to you by the Thunderbolts project at thunderbolts.info on May 31st 2013 a 3 km asteroid called QE2 passed within 3.6 million miles of Earth astronomers used the opportunity to take radar images of the asteroid and its 750 m satellite the scientists describe QE2 as dark red and primitive and conclude that the asteroid is an entirely new Beast nothing like any asteroid we visited with a spacecraft but how does the electric Universe interpret this apparently anomalous asteroid Dr Ellen Hal a US ra research astronomer at arbo Observatory who took both radar images of the asteroid at arbo and Optical and infrared images using the infrared telescope facility in Hawaii said what makes this asteroid so interesting aside from being an excellent Target for radar Imaging is the color and the small Moon asteroid QE2 is dark red and primitive that's her description and of course primitive is just an interpretation she goes on to say that is it hasn't been heated or melted as much as other asteroids she says QE2 is nothing like any asteroid we've visited with a spacecraft or plant to or that we have meteorites from it's an entirely new beast in the managerie of asterid oids near Earth now the idea that this is quite different from all other asteroids and meteorites of course may be more apparent than real because if we go back and have a a look at something uh that was said earlier by Dr Patrick Taylor another us ra research astronomer at aroso uh he said that um approximately one out of six asteroids near Earth have moons and this is a very interesting and difficult to explain attribute of asteroids Dr Tom Tom van fandon uh in his book Dark Matter missing planets and new comets writes in fact many minor satellites of asteroids would either fall onto the surface of their parent or Escape into their own solar orbit within 10,000 to 10 million years or so with such a short time scale for orbital evolution by Tides these satellites ought not to be as abundant as they seem to be unless they had a recent origin this fits precisely with the electric Universe model which suggests that asteroids comets meteorites all the debris that's floating around in the solar system were produced in Close Encounters between planets in the recent past and those encounters involve electrical exchanges which actually tore matter from the bodies of the planets and hurled it into space this would fit both both with the fact that the asteroids are found in certain belts in the solar system and it also fits with the observation that so many of these asteroids and smaller bodies in the solar system have satellites the idea is that if these objects were formed in an explosion as Tom van fandon pointed out without actually explaining how a planet might explode then the material is released in the same vicinity and it's also ejected from the gravitational influence of the parent body under these circumstances the influence of the larger pieces of the debris expands and it means that it is able to capture nearby smaller pieces of debris in other words to form a satellite and this is what we find so Tom van fand's idea is supported but it's not a planetary explosion it's something that was actually observed by ancient man as we've been able to uncover and that is electrical exchanges the Thunderbolts of the the gods ripped material from the Martian surface in particular and so the fact that this particular asteroid shows a reddish and strange surface fits the suggestion that it is probably a piece of Martian surface that we're looking at and it satellite also would have been captured from that same event for continuous updates on Space news from the electric Universe stay tuned to thunderbolts.info [Music] 
[Music] In pop culture media, force fields are portrayed in a silly way. In Dune movies, personal force field armor was portrayed as a covering of all but impenetrable glowing cubes. In Star Trek, force fields are portrayed as almost impervious shell-type shields, and in Star Wars is being manipulated by the mind. Really? Let's think of two objects in space that attract each other. If there is nothing between them, why would there be any diminishment with increased distance? Heidegger said “Nothing nothings”. In other  words, nothing isn't something that can do anything. So how is it intellectually responsible to posit distance in nothing, as making any real difference? The lack of intellectual rigor in science regarding the nature of a force field, appears right up front in the dictionary definitions. One such is that it is a computational  method. Another is, it's a map of force. Webster's dictionary defines field as a special charm, aura, or spirit that can influence anyone in his presence. Then defines it redundantly as something resembling a force field. In contrast  to these nebulous offerings, the Electric Universe paradigm defines the force field in concrete terms, something that can be easily visualized. This issue needs more clarity, which starts with better conceptions and more useful definitions. A great mistake consistently being made in science, is the failure to recognize the existence of dipolar ether particles and their role in physical phenomena. Is not a force field a certain volume of dipolar ether particles, that are affected electrically, to stand ready to transmit one of the two forces, attraction or repulsion, upon any object that makes contact with them? Here is another question that should have been asked long ago. If there is  no particle medium that supports a field, what is the material or concrete explanation, not just the mathematical description, for the drop-off of the field intensity in a field where the distance is increasing? Keep in mind two metaphysical principles: Number one, there is no such thing as nothing. It's just a mental construct. And two, real physical reality can always be visualized or portrayed. In other words, if it cannot be visualized, it  isn't real. Given that we live in a material world of matter and that the basic units  of matter are what we call particles, physical science always includes dealing with units of matter or particles. Thus we need to think of a force field as something tangible and not as something theoretical, mathematical or non- material. However, when we feel a substance with our fingers, it is not the atomic matter that we feel, but it is the electric repulsive force from the material. Is this  not a violation of what was just claimed? No. In the EU model, force is always transmitted by contact, or across distance by branching chains of the ether particles in contact. Thus, in a field the number of particles that distribute the force is increasing by the distance - the square of the distance or the square root of the  distance. The force gets spread over more particles and is diminished in intensity. Anybody that has ever broken a rack with a cue ball in a game of pool or billiards, knows that. We know there are two overarching realms of reality: the physical, which is the realm of tangible substance, material things, body, brain, flesh and the sensory equipment etc. This is the domain of science. Then there is the greater spiritual realm which is the realm of mind, spirit, meaning, creativity, artistry and  all the other non-material aspects, like mathematics and logic. This is the domain of philosophy and its subset, theology. In the EU we start with basics or fundamentals, which include particles, charge, and force. Let us remember that mass and matter are not the same thing. The current thinking is that there are two kinds of particles or packets that can be filled to various levels with mass/energy; two types of charge, positive and negative;  and two kinds of force, attraction and repulsion. The developments that we find in the physical universe are built on this tripartite foundation. And along with motion, spatial dimension, size, shape, and structure, account for what we see or find in the material realm. Electricity, magnetism and gravity are secondary aspects or phenomena, and are always associated with a field. Simply, particles can carry mass, energy, charge and dipolarity. A magnetic field is always produced by charged particles in motion, even in permanent magnets. An electric current is always charged particles flowing, or transmitting charge. On the other hand, in the EU paradigm  a gravitational field is produced by all particles because they all have some dipolarity. Therefore in the EU thinking, a field is not just a mystical or mathematical con- struct, but really designates a specific volume of matter including neutrinos, ”carrying or supporting the field.” These have a force effect through increasingly branching chains of contact, upon other material objects or particles of  matter. This is very simple and straightforward, easy to visualize or imagine. Another question is this. Given that physical science deals with material, hasn't there been far too much phenomenological or mystical thinking that has crept in the back door of physics theory? Without a medium of ether to carry  the field, some theoreticians get so discouraged that they want to do away with  the whole concept of a field - dismiss it entirely. Wal Thornhill agrees with the premise quote “...that the ether, in the form of normal matter, that is neutrinos, can be regarded as the polarizable dielectric substrate that transfers the direct electric force (which includes magnetism and gravity) and also the slower transverse electrical disturbance of electromagnetic waves.” Just consider the two cases whereby the field intensity falls off by the distance or by the square of the distance in a radial field. This is simply because the number of ether particles in contact, carrying the force, gets increased and the intensity gets spread out, or diluted by the increasing number of the particle chain branches carrying the field out to that distance. Nothing mystical here at all. These two formulas, involving the distance or its square, are mathematically simplified or idealized. The true calculation for any specific case in the real world of even just two bodies, would be hopelessly complicated. Therefore, practically a field consists of a certain volume and somewhat quantifiable number of neutrino/ether/matter particles surrounding the field generator, where the force of the field is still detectable by contact with the remote particles.

Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info According to consensus science,  ancient cultures across the planet with no communication between them, independently and spontaneously invented dragons. Remarkably, they all invented the same physical description and modus operandi- a fire-breathing serpent, origin in the sea, havoc across the land and crazy weather. Given the consistencies and global  reach of this ancient archetype, a rational thinker might consider some significant global event is behind it, common to each culture. Yet the  consensus relegates this to coincidence, or a spontaneous glitch in  a collective consciousness, their own science denies the existence of. Truth is ancient man was intimate with an environment more extreme than we have today and understood it much better than we do. The ancients left us tales, artwork and structures that are more than just breadcrumbs. They are bold, articulate statements about the environment they lived in, and how different it was from ours. This is  Andrew Hall. I'm presenting Part 8 of my series: Eye of the Storm,  where we've been examining dragons. The features examined in this article are proof of the dragon's passage, not random and coincidental anomalies. They  appear predictably, as expected of the circuit. Reactive power is a two-way street. Energy is both released and absorbed as current alternates, spitting out and sucking back in. Chapter 7 showed the canyons and river channels arc- blasted by reactive power from resonant  discharges. That was an example of reactive power spitting out. When it sucks back in, reactive power creates a mountain, not a canyon. This is where things get really interesting. The resonant reactive discharge that blasted the river apart, creating a junction, also created mountains on reactive inflow vectors. The inflow current is backwards relative to reactive outflow. And since there's a bias in the line current, the  backwards direction of reactive inflow current produces a different vector  sum than the outflow. The inflow current depletes a region of  electrons. This breaks the bonds in crystalline rock, tearing it apart, heating  and dissolving it. Chemistry, magnetism and the Coulomb force compete to rearrange the landscape. The depleted region forms a mountain as atomic bonds recombine, first forming a rock wall called a dike. The dike forms where a filament of current begins to steal electrons from the surroundings, pulling material to the filament and pinching it magnetically. After  a discharge neutralizes the current, the material recombines, cools and solidifies into a wall of rock. Wind then piles dust onto the dike, aided by rarefaction from shockwaves and electrostatic attraction to the still depleted zone, building a mountain. The effect can be seen in this image of the Will Henry and its tributaries where they branch from the Colorado River. Adjacent to the capacitive discharge there are linear mountains, shown  in red lines, radiating away from the crux of the river branching. These are the reactive inflow currents, where charge depletion made a dike on which a mountain formed from wind-blown dust. These are at angles that increase between the second and third bifurcations from 40 to 50 degrees with respect to the outgoing inductive current. Because these currents are flowing backwards with respect to the line current and the positive bias in line current increases as reactive power is drawn away in successive discharges, which widens this angle. Since there is an inductive reactive inflow current, there must also be capacitive reactive inflow currents, and indeed there are. In the first image, the linear mountains were inductive reactive inflow  currents. The next image shows linear mountains aligned parallel with supply current just before these same junctions. The parallel mountains are the capacitive reactive inflow currents. Recall from part 7, these junctions are caused by resonant frequency that acts like a stopper in the current flow, forcing it to squirt out sideways in a reactive discharge. As the line current is slowed by the rising frequency, charge builds in the nose of the current channel, just like pressure behind a bottleneck. A far-field positive charge builds parallel and adjacent to the charge building in the line due to capacitance. This is known as stray capacitance in the electronics world and is generally something designed out of a system because it creates unwanted harmonic feedback. it's parallel to the supply current because it's actually making a capacitor at some distance defined by the magnetic field, which helps induce currents to build the capacitor's charge. It's to the right of the line current, because of the right hand rule which says the magnetic field is penetrating the ground at these places and saturating it with induced currents. These capacitors are filaments of positive charge that build up before  the line current explodes in a reactive discharge. When the discharge occurs, the capacitive reactive branch connects with the capacitor filaments and drains them, which has the effect of building a dike and hence a mountain from a depleted charge  zone. Once the connection is made in the filament’s drain, the capacitive reactive discharge current is free to turn its vector east to align with the electric field. In all, there are nine resonant frequency bifurcations, marked in  green on the accompanying image, along the Colorado and its primary tributaries, including Lake Powell, which is a staccato series of resonant discharges. Each  has the same crab claw shape, with accompanying inflow current generating mountains, inductive outflow currents that vector north, and capacitive outflow currents that vector east, parallel to the line current, which is aligned to the electric field. You may also note some of these bifurcations are where dams are built, including Hoover, Parker and Glen Canyon. It's no coincidence that the bottleneck of a resident reactive discharge creates a bottleneck canyon, with an arc-blasted basin behind, perfectly suitable for damming. The  rocky choke point is a result of induced reactive inflow currents aimed at  the crux of the resonant discharge. The next image shows line current and outflow reactants in blue, and inflow reactants in red, for the major resonant discharge bifurcations along the southern portion of the Colorado and Gila rivers. In some conditions mesas are created by reactive inflow instead of mountains. This occurs when the desaturated zones left by inflow currents leave mesas behind, as  landscape around is sputtered away. In the next image of Lake Powell there are inductive absorption currents 180 degrees opposed to the inductive reactive power discharges. See my articles on Sputtering Canyons, Part 1, 2 and 3 for some  background on sputtering. Note the fine tendrils running parallel around and between the highlighted mesas. These canyons are scars from tendrils  of charge that shot through this area, electrifying an aquifer or wet layer of deposits and causing the land to sputter away from that layer, leaving already desaturated areas behind, like the mesas. Another example of this is at the Green River branching. South of the junction is an arcing network of filamented canyons and  mesas parallel to incoming line current, just before the bifurcation. This is another area where capacitive reactive charge built parallel to line current prior to the resonant discharge bifurcation. Charge built in the ground and then was drawn away by three large short circuiting filaments which are the three canyons perpendicular to the river at top center in the image, that shoot from the line current orthogonally through the arc, zigzagging to touch each filament. This left depleted ground where the linear mesas are,  while the canyons were excavated by sputtering. There are two things that can be said about these reactive discharges. One, the current of electrons and negative ions in the discharge of the dragon's blood so to speak, is a destructive force that excavates the land in explosive arc blast events. The reactive inflow currents, however, are  constructive and build mountains and mesas. One is the inverse of the other. It's interesting to see how complex-number math actually displays itself in nature. Second, the  reactive inflow currents are slow and cold. They diffuse through the land, changing the chemistry and reforming rock over some time, not at the lightning pace of a spark. Take another look at the Google Earth image where the resonant discharges are highlighted in green. There are other features marked with yellow triangles and red circles.  Let's take a look at those. Refer to the yellow triangles on the image. Not all junctions occur as a result of resonant frequency. Some junctions occur as a result of sudden grounding. As the main line current climbs the plateau, it's encountering hot dry deposits of sand over sheets of water. Aquifers are layered below, left from past tsunamis, rain or ancient lakes. The grounding of the discharge happens when the supply line current induces parallel current in the aquifer and they connect, likely at a spring or other feature that provides continuity between the surface and the aquifer. The sudden grounding creates a new current vector. As supply line current encounters a conductive path to the ground potential in the aquifer, the supply line voltage is affected. The supply line voltage vector remains straight and a new, line-to-ground voltage vector branches  away. It basically creates a kink in the electric field expressed in two dimensions on the plane of the earth's surface. But it really results from an interference pattern in three dimensions multi-phase electromagnetic field. A line-to- ground current splits away with this voltage which is clocked 30 degrees counter- clockwise to line voltage in a balanced three-phase circuit. In a balanced three-phase circuit the currents would form a star pattern, with 120 degrees between each arm forming what is called a grounded Y connection. DC bias in a very  dirty signal to the current closes the current angle down to the 40 and 60 degree angle seen at the Green and San Juan junctions. The vectors  represent nature finding its own balance. Another clue to its formation is the fact supply line current vectors remain straight, while the tributary  forks away counterclockwise. But there is no opposing  capacitive reactive discharge evident radiating from the center of the branch, nor is there evidence of reactive inflow currents. These junctions are not due to  resonant frequency and reactive power, but to an instability in the electric field created by a sudden grounding. The effect is to bifurcate the dragon; it takes energy from the ground connection to clone itself and the clone takes a new current vector. Y connections are used for various reasons in high voltage transmission, one  being to join three-phase circuits with ground. Grounding the connection allows certain harmonic frequencies called third order harmonics to bleed away without interfering and unbalancing the primary phases. In particular, lightning  surges will pass to ground without surging the primary circuits. Navajo  Mountain sits next to the San Juan junction. It is a fulgurite created by  negative cloud-to-ground lightning. It looks very suspicious, sitting next to the bifurcation. But it's not yet apparent if it had a role in creating the bifurcation, or if it was a consequence. There are striations between the river and the mountain running parallel to the river's course, indicating capacitive stresses in this region. One thing that's quite obvious in the Canyonlands of Utah, at the heart of the charged capacitor dome, is that the rivers meander wildly, yet they keep true to  trajectories along the electric field. Oscillations in current phase and magnetic  fields cause the filaments to wobble and curlicue. When the branches are in-phase, they try to close together on a common transient current vector, but then push apart when out-of-phase and return to the original line current vector. In the image below are highlighted areas of extreme current bending and inductive discharges that flare from the bends in flame-like patterns, creating fractal chaos between and around  the Green and Colorado rivers near the junction. Magnetic fields pulsate and wrestle  the currents back and forth, create ring currents like the amazing Upheaval Dome. A ring current stuck in its own magnetic field which created an induction  coil. The induction coil generated a tightly wound supersonic plasma  tornado. The center of the ring current is a clump of sharply pointed  tetrahedrons aimed skyward from shockwaves, where the coil's  induction drew the central supersonic updraft. The surrounding rim  rock on the right side of the dome, is cut by parallel triangular bites, adjacent to scalloped walls on the opposing side of the canyon wall farther to the right. This displays the channels of multiple vortex wind where the tornado's inflow bent into the central updraft of the induction  coil. The triangular bites are from standing shockwaves where the wind turned into the updraft of the coil. The scallops display the eddy of multiple vortex jet streams as they make this  turn. Returning to the annotated image of the Colorado system, there are two red ovals  indicated. The ovals indicate massive downdraft craters caused by the two main  coronal loops on the Colorado plateau: the San Rafael and Capitol Reef dome and crater complex and the Monument Valley San Juan dome and crater complex. Recall from Eye of the Storm Part 3. These dome and crater pairs were caused by coronal storms which left immense tetrahedral monoclines where  the wind deflected abruptly, creating shock waves. Winds deflection was due to the magnetic field pinching around the updrafts and the downdrafts. The same magnetic field also redirected the ground-to-ground line currents, the dragon's blood so to speak, due to the Hall Effect. The Hall Effect basically says a magnetic field will either push or pull a current's direction, depending on polarity. You can see the effect in these diagrams where an electric current shown  in blue is either pushed away or attracted to a magnet in close proximity. Because these regions of high electric flux generated strong magnetic fields around them, especially at the interface of ground and sky, it pushed the arc around the negative craters and drew it through positive domes. You can see the San Juan river bend around the downdraft crater, circled in red, and shoot through the center of the updraft dome, shown in green. Similarly the  San Raphael updraft dome has tributaries of the Green River shooting through its center and the downdraft crater is avoided by the arc of  the Green River and its tributaries. Another example of the Hall Effect is displayed in these images of the famous Gila Bend in the Gila River. Note how the river bends  south and then returns to its original trajectory. It's as if it is detouring around an obstacle, and it actually is. The current is detouring around the Sentinel Arlington volcanic field, the magnetic field of which pushes the current around due to the Hall Effect. A similar effect happens in the Grand Canyon as well, but in this case the river detours to the south twice below the Uinkaret Volcanic Field. There is a distinct straight segment between the two detours. The bar in the center is possibly a function of the frequency of the alternating current and the discharge velocity as it advances. In other  words, the current is pushed away from the volcano while in  opposing phase and pulled back towards the volcano as phase rotates, then pushed away again, as its phase completes a rotation. Or it could be an artifact of the way the circuit connects with the volcano subsurface where it can't be seen, producing an effect similar to the diagram shown. The final feature to examine is related to the resonant discharge we discussed in the beginning of this chapter, only this type of discharge occurs in the middle of the line current. In other words, the resonant discharges we previously discussed were at the head of the dragon, as it searched its way along the electric field. These reactive discharges shot out of the body of the dragon, due to  pulsations in the flow of current. The dragon at this point is a thousand miles  long. The longest recorded lightning strike is only 200 miles in length. So this is  very big lightning; as discharge occurs, pulses of energy and bolides  of densely charged matter shoot up and down the line current. When two waves of charge density collide, they interfere, causing a momentary spike in energy similar to a rogue wave or the pressure waves in water pipes that cause hammer and cavitation. A reactive discharge results, creating box canyons to either side, rotated roughly 90 degrees to the line current and forming a cross. The reactive discharges are always a proper 180 degrees opposed and occasionally one of the tendrils will continue to be induced, generally north to form a longer canyon. The Grand Canyon especially exhibits  these types of reactive discharge. In Part 9 we will complete the description of the parallel RLC circuit that created the Colorado River, and then describe circuits beneath the crust from which the dragon emerged. Thank you [Music] 
our celestial neighbor the planet Mars astronomers once considered Mars to be a long barren and geologically dead Rock in space but since the arrival of our probes beginning in the 1960s the planet has come alive for us it does not reveal the inactive and worn down landscape astronomers and planetary scientists had expected nevertheless investigators continue to apply geologic concepts based on their understanding of the earth and the moon they could only see volcanism erosion surface movement and surface collapse all punctuated by episodic impacts from space over billions of years what force created the sharply cut gouges and depressions across the surface of Mars looking as if a giant trowel descended to scoop out material and radically different and irreconcilable depths running north to south we see massive inter woven scratches or grooves extending hundreds of miles and how remarkable that a planet only half the diameter of Earth exhibits canyons on a scale dwarfing anything seen on our own planet and mountains that would tower over Mount Everest today no planet outside the earth has received more attention than Mars but the mysteries and theoretical contradictions have grown spectacularly for decades now investigators have wondered why the two hemispheres of Mars look as if they were formed in different worlds a southern hemisphere dominated by craters a Northern Hemisphere with only sparsely scattered craters and note the contrasting crustal depths of the two hemispheres shallow crust in the north much thicker crust in the south why would a planet evolving in isolation displace are too profound dichotomy it's as if some unknown force excavated the northern crust miles deep the hemispheric removal of crustal material requires a force external to Mars acting on the planet but when it comes to external events scientific convention has only one thing to work with random collisions could a planetoid or huge asteroid crashing into Mars have removed millions of cubic miles of crust a shattering impact is all that theory would allow but what would Martian history look like where we to include electrical events events on a scale sufficient to sculpt the surface of the red planet from pole to pole of all the enigmatic features in the solar system perhaps none provokes greater amazement than Valles Marineris the largest Canyon on any planet her moon the deep trench complex stretches a third of the way around the planet hundreds of times larger than the Grand Canyon it would reach from San Francisco to New York and beyond prior theory of planetary formation had never anticipated such a chasm on a small planet what natural force excavated this colossal trench with the arrival of the Mariner probes NASA scientists thought the chasm could have been cut by water erosion though nothing even close was ever achieved by water on the known watery planet earth on any erosional hypothesis three million cubic miles of material were removed three million cubic miles and it had to go somewhere neither the means of fluid drainage nor the vast outflow required are in evidence now we know that the Valles Marineris reaches to a greater depth than any outflow channel originally envisioned and the tributaries imagined by some turned out to be cleanly cut alcoves and stubby depressions they are not connected to feeder streams at all one portion of the Valles Marineris system in particular underscores our point here planetary scientists acknowledge that heebies canyon much larger than our Grand Canyon is an inseparable part of Valles Marineris the scientists have now acknowledged it was certainly not created by water nor is it plausible to suggest that surface spreading created the massive chasm the Valles Marineris with its repeated morphology of sharply scalloped walls the surface was not torn it was carved and the detailed images imply a removal of material along the entire length of the chasm a process clearly illustrated by the neatly machined so-called tributaries all the way up to their rounded cleanly cut terminations whatever formed the canyon complex did not stop at the margins of the primary channel but added irregular craters and crater chains and surface grooves and gouges so the question cannot be escaped is there anything known to science today that can account for the extraordinary profile of Valles Marineris there is an explanation well known to science though it's never entered the geologists lexicon blimey the laboratory its power is demonstrated in electric discharge experiments but the form unfamiliar to conventional science today is the cosmic Thunderbolt a primary theme of our own investigation it was the brilliant engineer Ralf jürgens who first suggested decades ago that a cosmic Thunderbolt carved Valles Marineris with the benefit of more recent data electrical theorists Wallis Thornhill returned to this extraordinary possibility yes the electric hypothesis will unnerve many scientists but it is the only hypothesis that meets the test of direct observation here is a scar left by an electric arc on a piece of wet wood and a second example of a discharge to a piece of wood electric discharge provides a direct and complete explanation for the Valles Marineris the so called tributaries of the valley were cut by secondary streamers of the discharge that is a typical signature of an electric arc when it cuts a surface channel and here is the scar from electric discharge to an insulator notice in particular the network of secondary streamers to the left a perfect counterpart to the western edge of Valles Marineris it was long-held that this remarkable region on Mars was the result of uplift fracturing and spreading and from a distance it did look like fracturing but with a closer view in front of us it is simply irrational to cling to that interpretation material has been cleanly removed exactly as in the discharging to the insulator the evidence now available demands a new perspective a larger field of view in Thornhill's interpretation the discharge took the form of a plasmoid not unlike the plasmoid from which a spiral galaxy is formed on his website Thornhill noted how the discharge effect spiraled upward to the east and downward to the West an effect that shows up quite clearly on the elevation map given on his website in fact if we extend the view of the elevation map we see an even larger effect it seems that the spiraling trails to the east and west nearly completed two circles as they swung back toward the trench itself but one difference between the northern and the southern extension stands out the northern extension is entirely constituted of ravines and depressions while the southern extension consists of ridges and mountainous terrain for this unusual contrast electrical experiments offer a startling explanation it was George Christoph Lichtenberg who in the 18th century first showed that electric arcs create ravine networks on more negatively charged surfaces and elevated ridges on more positively charged surfaces could it be that simple that a cosmic Thunderbolt carving Valles Marineris acted on to regions of different charge negative to the north and positive to the south if such was the case the only plausible cause of the charge differential would be an electrical exchange between Mars and other charged bodies in the past and what was the relationship of these events to the hemispheric dichotomies the removal of crustal material through the north and the densely cratered southern hemisphere in the electrical interpretation the violent excavation of the surface to create Valles Marineris would have created immense deposits of sediment on surrounding topography and indeed we see that previous craters in the region were completely buried with only the largest craters appearing as outlines penetrating through the deep deposits it's apparent that the released material had a net drift to the west since the blanket of deposited sediment stretches all the way to the eastern flank of the towering olympus mons keep in mind as well that an electric discharge at energies necessary to create the chasm of Valles Marineris would have ejected great volumes of rocky material into space much of the rocky debris would have fallen back to littered the margin landscape and indeed shattered rock of all sizes across the surface of Mars is a long-standing mystery and the mystery is resolved by electrical events on a continental and even hemispheric scale given the energies of the events considerable volumes of material would have surely escaped the planet altogether and what might this tell us about the Mars earth connection in our reconstruction of ancient events or the surprising discovery that rocks from Mars have fallen on our own planet you 
EU 2017 FUTURE SCIENCE Phoenix 17-20 August Introduction to Velikovsky's Ideas Irving Wolfe OK, are we set up, can you all hear me? I'm getting an echo. I have no slides, no equations, no pictures, nothing. All I have is my charming personality, so I hope that will do. I'm going to introduce you to Velikovsky, but much more than that I'm going to tell you why he's important in terms of knowing what goes on in the world and how you understand science. So, first of all I have to explain that there is a gradation in his ideas that most people don't seem to understand. I look at it in terms of primary, secondary and tertiary, and Velikovsky's ideas can be grouped into his primary theories, which I think are extraordinarily important, his secondary ideas where he tries to fill it in and his tertiary ideas where he tries to answer the questions that he has himself raised. I don't know how many people agree with his answers, I don't even know if I myself agree with all of his answers but, what's most important are the questions he raised, so here's the background. Velikovsky wrote his most important book 'Worlds in Collision' during the 1940s; he did his best to sell it to a publisher between 1946 and 1950. By 1950, Macmillan, one of the largest publishers in America, had agreed to publish the book. That's when certain mistakes occurred and that's when all hell broke loose. Because a science writer called Eric Larabee, who was very well-meaning and admired Velikovsky, agreed to do a condensation of Velikovsky's theories for the magazine Harper's, which every intelligent person in America read. And he did it and it was fairly faithful except that it didn't contain any of Velikovsky's evidence. It merely gave his conclusions and it appeared in Harper's at least four months before the book was published. But overnight, it became a sensation. Now, a sensation in a negative sense. If you look at what's going on now with a Large Hadron Collider and CERN in Europe. They were looking for what they call the Higgs particle. Now, some idiot newspapermen dubbed it 'the God particle'. If I were an astronomer, I would have been seriously embarrassed by anyone calling the Higgs boson the God particle. It turns out that they may or may not have discovered it. It turns out that there may be five different Higgs particles, but since they spent billions of dollars on this enormous Collider, they wanted to show that they got something for their money and of course what they want is for governments to give them another ten, fifteen billion dollars to build an even bigger Collider and so they had to argue that they had found 'the God particle' which is nonsense. Now, the Larabee article in Harper's, unfortunately picked up on one of Velikovsky's theories which is how he explains the story of Joshua in the Bible where Joshua put up his arms and the “Sun Stood Still.” Now, we know that this isn't what happened because the Sun does not move, the Earth moves around the Sun and therefore if something like that was perceived, it had to have been a retardation of the Earth's spinning on its axis or a tilt of the axis that made it look like the Sun was not moving, but the Sun never moves. However, people picked up on this phrase 'the day the Sun Stood Still' and the next day it was a sensation across America. Here is a scientist who can explain the miracles in the Bible scientifically and he explained how the Sun stood still. So this was picked up all over the country and it was picked up by mainstream big science in America and it was picked up in particular by an astronomer called Harlow Shapley and the whole Velikovsky story for the first 10 years is really a battle between Velikovsky and Shapley. Shapley was the head of the department of astronomy at Harvard, he was also in charge of the Harvard College Observatory, he was the Dean of American astronomers and he went ballistic when he read about this. Now normally, if someone comes up with a, what you call a crackpot theory that the world was populated by little green men, most of mainstream science will just ignore it. But in this case, mainstream science attacked Velikovsky with all guns firing before the book had even been published. Shapley organized a whole campaign, he had his disciples who were also members of the Harvard astronomical community, he had them write articles, they photocopied the articles and sent them out all across the country, they asked individuals in different departments, "write letters attacking Velikovsky", they tried to block the publication of the book by Macmillan, and this went on months before the book was published. At the very last moment, the publisher of Mac..., this is the Velikovsky affair, you have to understand that there was a Velikovsky affair. It's very important that you understand why it happened and what it means in the long term for how you view modern science. There was an enormous campaign of name-calling, Velikovsky was called a crank, he was called a crackpot, he was called a pseudo scientist, he was called a fraud, and mainly this was all carried out by Harlow Shapley himself who protested that he never did anything, he never wrote letters to anybody but all those letters are extant, and they tried to block the publication of 'worlds in Collision' as if it's some kind of poison. And you cannot allow it to infect people's minds. Well, at the very last second, the publisher at Macmillan had to call in four more scientists to read Velikovsky's book, to decide if it should be published, they all agreed that it should, the book was published, it became an instantaneous bestseller and this was the man who could prove why the Sun Stood Still, a very unfortunate bit of history. Now within about six months, Macmillan was blackmailed literally by professors all over America who said, "if you continue to publish Velikovsky, we we will not order your textbooks at our universities" and you have to understand, if you have a very large university, like Ohio State and you have a couple of thousand kids in first year and they're all taking astronomy and they're all going to order Macmillan texts, this involved a lot of money. So Macmillan unwillingly had to give up the book when it was number one on the New York Times bestseller list. And they transferred it to Doubleday which did not have a textbook division. Doubleday was quite happy to take it over, they made a lot of money, it continued to sell and this is a story that everyone knows about because it was written in all the newspapers, everybody said "guess what's happening", it was a big scandal, if you google Harlow Shapley, they say quite openly that he led the campaign against Velikovsky. Now, you have to understand why Shapley personally was at war with Velikovsky. Harlow Shapley became a major astronomer at Harvard in the early ‘20s but he had a very unhappy career because at the same time alongside him was Edwin Hubble. And Hubble turned out to be a far more important astronomer than Shapley and the big battle between them, and it was a vicious battle, was about the size of the universe. Shapley wanted to keep everything neat and clean. What I mean by that is, he wanted to describe the solar system as the entire universe. And he called it 'an island universe' and when somebody said "what about all these dim spots and so on," he said "these are merely gas and so on, they're not important" whereas Hubble said "no, these things are individual galaxies on their own, they're way outside the solar system and the universe is much larger than Shapley would allow" and Shapley and Hubble fought it out and Hubble eventually won and Shapley grudgingly had to concede that Hubble was right, although he never liked it and he called Hubble's work “junk science” and so on, but that was a tremendous disappointment in Shapley's life. Now also, he had been a bit of a left-leaning communist before the war. He had wanted America and Russia, which had just become communist a decade or two before, to be friends. He wanted everyone to be friends and this reminds me of when I was a little boy and I went out on the street to play, remember those were the days when you could actually walk out and have friends on the street. Now you have to have your father arrange a playdate, he has to drive you 20 minutes away and he has to organize it three weeks in advance so you have a playdate with your friend. In those days, you just went out on the street and you played. Now, my mother used to tell me, "make nice-nice", in other words, get along with the people, make nice-nice you see? And Shapley wanted America and the Russians, and so on, to make nice-nice, but it didn't work out and at the end of the war, another war started between America and Russia and this left him very unhappy. Now, he also thought that America had the atomic bomb in 1945 or 46 and no one else had it so America became like the public school principal. When little boys are fighting in the schoolyard at recess, the principal goes out and says "now stop," and they have to stop because he has the authority and America had the bomb and they were like the school principal that had the authority, but by 1948 or 49 the Russians had acquired the atomic bomb so that didn't work out for Shapley, he was very disappointed but Shapley had one, I don't know if it was a secret, one secret obsession, one cherished idea and I found out about this because I went to McGill library in Montreal and I checked through four successive editions of the first year primer on astronomy that was sold to Harvard students in astronomy 101. And it went from the 30s, 40s into the 50s, it was approved by Harlow Shapley and there is a section there on the solar system in which he argued that the solar system is the most precise organization of units in the world, in the universe, and that everything happens with absolute precision down to almost a portion of a second. So the one place in the universe that Shapley could cherish, because everything else was going to hell. On Earth there had been the Second World War, there had been the rise of fascism, there had been atomic bombs, anger between different countries, he could not bring order on the world, he probably could not bring order in the distant areas of the universe because there were galaxies and I don't know if he knew, as early as 1950, that when galaxies collide or when super galaxies collide, it is the largest form of violence in the universe, but at least he could say it maybe all hell down here and it may be all hell way up there but in between there is this marvelous system of absolute unchanging serenity, it's been that way for 3 and 1/2 billion years, it will presumably continue for another three-and-a-half billion years and this is the solar system. And Velikovsky comes along and says "no no no no no, the solar system is violent, it has experienced major disruptions up until even - 1500 and - 700 which is 3,500 years ago" and so Shapley was being attacked in the last bastion of order that he could believe in and this was too much and he went into battle with all guns blazing. So you must see this as a war.... Is it down, oh here we are, very modern equipment I don't know how to handle this I'm very old-fashioned, OK. ...a war between him and Velikovsky, because it was all or nothing, he had to destroy Velikovsky or he would be destroyed. He had to go, it was a battle to the death and so Shapley tried his best to destroy Velikovsky. Now, if this had been 400 years earlier, Velikovsky physically may have been destroyed. Giordano Bruno, who was a major Medieval and Renaissance thinker, disagreed with the church about how many worlds there are and so on. He was given time to reconsider and see if he will recant, meaning take back what he said; he didn't, so the church condemned him to death. And in the year 1600, you think of this as a modern age but there they were on the plaza in Rome in front of everybody, he was burned to death, and you have to understand what that means, they tie you to a pillar and your feet are on fire while you're still conscious and it's a horrible long slow agonizing death. Now, they couldn't do this to Velikovsky in the year 1950 but they could try and destroy his books just like the Nazis burned books in the 1930s and they could try and destroy his reputation. And so, the mudslinging and the name-calling and everything else that went on has clung to Velikovsky. He should have become a major figure in 20th century thought, he should be one of the names we think about. He hasn't because of the Velikovsky affair. Now, I want to say that I think Velikovsky is one of the major intellectual figures of the 20th century, someone you ought to know about, he is what I would call a revolutionary or a game-changer. You can think of the phrase “Watershed,” meaning nothing was before  as it was after. You think of certain individuals like Pablo Picasso in painting because of Picasso, painting was never the same after him. You think of Einstein and his theories, nothing was the same after Einstein. A friend of mine, a late friend of mine who was a Olympic figure skater, most of you have probably never heard of him, his name was, my mind is gone blank, Taller Cranston, he was Canadian Olympic figure skating champion in the ‘70s and an Olympic medal winner, he transformed figure skating. Up until then, figure skating had merely been gymnastics on ice, the skaters wore uniforms that looked like military uniforms, they even, some of them wore ties and they performed exercises like a gymnastic competition. When Taller came on, he was a wild crazy man, he was flamboyant and he transformed figure skating and made it into ballet on ice and figure skating has never been the same since then. Velikovsky was that or should have been that sort of person, but the dirt that was flung at him because of the Velikovsky affair clung to him for many years. Now, in terms of primary, secondary and tertiary, I think it would have been much better if Velikovsky had published a much smaller and more innocent-looking book called 'Earth in Upheaval.' I would have preferred if I had been there at that time to tell him to publish 'Earth in Upheaval' which some of you should read, it's a very easy book, anyone who is intelligent and open-minded, if you read it you would probably have to agree after hundreds of pages of evidence that certain very huge cataclysmic things happened to the Earth within the last 4,000 years. And if he had put that book out saying, look here's my evidence, it looks like this is what it implies, what do you think about it? That would have been a better way to handle it, particularly because the last chapter of the book talks about cataclysmic evolution where he destroys Darwin. Now, Darwin needed destroying, I will point out that in a moment, but if he had..., see, Velikovsky was a trained psychologist, he had studied under Wilhelm Stoeckl who was a pupil of Freud, I think he actually knew Freud himself, he worked for about 15 years as a psychoanalyst before he came to America and Velikovsky should have known as much as anybody, that the difficulty when you're trying to cure a patient is not in finding out the cause of his problems but in how you reveal it to the patient. Because if you don't do it right, the patient is gonna be very angry and will fight you and you will get nowhere. He should have known this but what he did is the opposite, he wrote 'Worlds in Collision' where all his guns are set forth; he didn't hold back the theory about Venus which I would have preferred him to do; he completely disobeyed all the rules of how you communicate cure to a patient and instead he published 'Worlds in Collision' which was a direct slap in the face to all of American big science. I don't know if you're allowed to use what I call foul language. I checked with Dave, maybe what I'm about to say he won't invite me back again but, what Velikovsky did by laying out 'Worlds in Collision' foolhardy, a direct blow in the face of the science, he told mainstream science "you're full of shit" and he made it quite plain. Cheers, cheers, cheers! I guess I'm okay, all right! And so the war erupted because big science had to either destroy him or he would destroy them! Now you have to ask yourself, did he have a right to do this, and I say yes, he did, because Newton and Darwin needed destroying. Now, imagine I'm a man from Mars and I've just arrived on Earth and I meet an earthling and I say okay, show me your culture, what are the important things? So the earthling would say, "we are Western culture and we produce science; all the other cultures, Islamic culture, Hindu culture and so on they deal with mythology and gods and stories and fairy tales, we tell it like it is." And so I would ask this earthling "who are your icons," and he would say "Newton and Darwin", every schoolchild in 1950 would have said "we believe explicitly in Newton and Darwin." So I'm going to prove to you that there was no reason for that. in Newton and Darwin." So I'm going to prove to you that there was no reason for that. Aristotle proposed a cosmology and the Western world, which is supposed to be rational, believed in and bought Aristotle's cosmology for 2,000 years. Now I, as the cynical man from Mars would say to my earthling companion, "let's look at what Aristotle was selling, why did they buy it for 2,000 years?" Because I would say, Aristotle was in effect a religion, it was a secular religion but it was a religion because if you look at religion from a utilitarian point of view, which I do, what does religion offer? Three things; it tells you how the world works, it tells you that the guy in charge is benevolent and it tells you how you can connect to the guy in charge meaning, you have friends in high places, this is very comforting, you see? Newman, Paul Newman made a film in 1959 I think, it was called 'somebody up there likes me,' you see, and there is a famous Christian myth, 'what a friend we have in Jesus.' Well, what Aristotle was selling is, what a friend we have in the prime mover because Aristotle's cosmology was that there were nested spheres and each one was inside the other and they were all moving at different rates and they produced a beautiful music, this was the music of the spheres, and it was all governed by the prime mover who is himself unmoved and the prime mover, merely by the influence of his goodness, makes the spheres revolve and the basic message, you'll hear about this later on, but the basic message that Aristotle was selling was "don't worry," meaning there may be horrible things happening on Earth, giant earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, tsunamis, huge floods, drought, pestilence, disease that kills off people, it may look like the Earth is a very dangerous place but the underlying message is, don't worry! Because there is this eternal stability kept in motion by the prime mover and the prime mover likes you. So that's what Aristotle sold and people bought it for 2,000 years approximately. Now, around the year 1600, a lot of discordant data began to appear, troublemakers like Copernicus and Tycho Brahe and others began to show that, and Galileo, that the picture of the universe that Aristotle painted wasn't quite true and what happened then was a process that Thomas Kuhn in 1962 described in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. What he said was, when an old paradigm, the paradigm is the overriding belief, is called into question because there's a lot of data that it can't account for, then a new paradigm will be offered that does a better job. And so what happened is that Newton came along and said look, there's this thing called gravity! Now gravity begins with G, God begins with G, they simply replaced God with gravity and Newton's theory became the accepted belief of how the world works, Newton was a deist meaning he believed that God had created the universe and ordained the natural laws and he had built the world like a clockwork and that this clock ran perfectly and the underlying message there is the same as Aristotle; what was Newton selling? The message is, don't worry. Don't worry because, God who is benevolent did not design the world so it will destroy you, he designed the world so it will keep running like a perfect clock. Now there are two different kinds of deists, one group believes that God built the universe and then goes off to play golf and allows the universe to take care of itself, and the other is more like Newton who says that every once in a while God has to intervene and tweak the world a little bit and get it back online which implies that he may not be a perfect clock maker but that's the way it turned out. Now Newton, in my opinion, is simply Aristotle with numbers. In other words, he fed people the same fairy tale and the fairy tale is "don't worry, the guy up there likes you and the world will run perfectly forever." So, Velikovsky had a right to destroy Newton. Now as for Darwin, the second pillar, the second incorruptible everlasting pillar of Western science, I think Darwin is on far shakier ground, because what Darwin said is, "new species are formed but it takes about two million years" and therefore he asks you to take it on faith that a species acquires a slight change and another change and another change and over two million years it becomes a different species which cannot mate with the other species and therefore it is a new species and that's how speciation occurs. But since none of us, or since Darwin could not supply a CCTV camera that covered an organism for two million years to show how it became a new organism, you have to take it on faith. So Darwin; I can't, I don't understand why anybody believed in Darwin but the background to that which you must understand and I'll explain it now, is the battle between two concepts, uniformitarianism and catastrophism. Now, uniformitarianism, to put it very short, says "nothing ever happened in the past which is not seen to happen today," the present is the key to the past. And so, the essence of uniformitarianism is called gradualism, everything is gradual, just like my mummy said to me, make it nice nice, everything happens in a nice way. Catastrophism, I don't know what the antonym is, I suppose it's suddenism which is the opposite of gradualism, I don't know, but catastrophism says, things happen abruptly and they happen violently and these are two different ways of looking at the world and the Western world was obsessed with uniformitarianism, not because it had better proof but because it was comforting. And so, these two beliefs, Newton and Darwin were uniformitarianists, everything happened slowly and gradually and there's no violence. Now I'm going to try and prove to you why we should not believe in it. The idea is this, I, as the cynical man from Mars, I look at my friend, my dear earthling, and I say to him "can you not see that both of these ideas did not come out of a vacuum, they are not scientific in the sense of being objective, they are products of British culture!" Have you ever thought of that? They come out of the same culture. Now, what does that mean? Well, I'll tell you. Barack Obama, one of the nicknames, he was called 'no drama Obama,' you understand? He didn't like drama and the British don't like drama and one of the ways they identify it is, they are not crazy about sex. There was a musical that appeared in London which was called, ‘no sex please, we're British!’ And it even played on Broadway for a short while but it was a truism. Now, if you conflate these two, it's 'no drama please, we're British.' In other words, the British like everything to be orderly and regular, regular means no catastrophes and slow and peaceful. Now I'm going to give you scientific proof why this is not so. Are any of you familiar with the game of cricket? This is sort of, form like baseball but real cricket, original cricket, we spent some time in England a few months ago and we stayed for a while at the house of one of our friends who lives in a small village and to get to their house we had to go past a certain cricket field owned by the local Lord who owned most of the buildings in the area anyway and this was a real old-fashioned cricket field. Now the cricket field is green grass and all the players wear white, in other words when a young man says "I'm putting on my whites" it means he's going to play cricket. So all the young men wear white trousers and white shirts; why, because that's the way God wants it and they play cricket in a certain way because that's the way God wants it, even the umpire wears a long white coat, like a lab coat and if the Sun is shining and you have to believe that sometimes the Sun does shine in England, he wears a white hat. So everybody is dressed in white against the green and they play cricket in a very gentlemanly way. If you had gone in the year 1950 and watched a soccer game, we call it soccer, the English call it football, of course that's what it is, because our football is played with hands, you carry the ball with your hands, you pass the ball with your hands, you catch the ball with your hands, in England they play soccer with their feet and so then in England they call it football. But if you were to go to watch a game between working-class or lower-class teams, I shouldn't use that pejorative adjective, you would hear all the people in the stands drinking, you would hear thirty thousand voices singing together the songs that identify the team and they would be yelling things like "break his legs, break his arms, kill a bastard," you see. But if you went to a cricket match and somebody hit the ball properly, you would get that. If he really hit the ball well, you would have, you see, that that is rabid passionate support for cricket. And what else, do you think, happens in cricket? At four o'clock they stop playing. Do you know why? They stop for tea! Now here's how it works, the ladies don't play, I mean, there are some women who play cricket but God doesn't really want women to play cricket so, the ladies watch. Now there they are sitting there in their dresses, summertime dresses, which they call frocks and they're wearing their hats which they call bonnets, you have to remember, England and America are two countries separated by a common language, and they watch the match and they applaud because a gentleman or a gentlelady does not, you know, you have to understand that the English decided that they were the superior culture in Europe, meaning in the world, because this was Eurocentrism and it can't be the Germans because all they do is want to make war and slice each other with sabers, it can't be the Italians because they just sing opera and they kill each other in vendettas, it can't be the French because the French kiss their girlfriends in the street, no Englishman would ever do that, so it must be the English who are the preferred nation of God and the English are gentlemen, everything is proper. Now the ladies come out and they bring out food but I have to describe the food. Do any of you know what a cucumber sandwich is? Now the two pieces of bread are thick, the cucumber is sliced horizontally very thin, if you held it up to the light you could see through it and so you have this little bit of cucumber between two pieces of bread, you couldn't feed a mosquito on a cucumber sandwich. It's not really food but they bring out cucumber sandwiches and that's what the players eat. Now it goes further than that, they serve tea, the tea is served in a tea service which is either pure silver or silver plate, and the players get their tea in what, in bone china cups. Bone china is so thin you can almost see through it. It's not like a beer mug, it's not like some heavy piece of glass,  it's bone china. Now, how do they hold the cup? Between the thumb and the forefinger with your pinky up in the air and I ask this, as some of my students in Montreal are French Canadian, I say "how do the British cricket players drink their tea?" and they all did this because God wants you to hold the cup daintily between your thumb and forefinger and put your pinky up in the air and that's the way that God wants you to drink tea. You have to understand so can you imagine an American college football game played on natural grass? You remember, there used to be fields with natural grass and it's raining and it could be snowing in the Northeast and there's mud on the field and after five minutes all the players are covered in mud, you can't even see their numbers, the mud has gotten through their face guard and they're all looking like they're dressed for Halloween and they're all covered in mud. Can you imagine the ref blowing his whistle at four o'clock and all these players stop for tea? Can you imagine some defensive lineman who's 6 foot 5 and 340 pounds and covered in mud whose hands are as big as a catcher's mitt, taking his gloves off and picking up a little cup of tea and taking a sip with his finger up in the air? Obviously, so the English know how God wants it to be done. A gentleman does things in moderation and he does things in a certain prescribed order. So I, as the cynical Martian, talked to my earthling friend and I say, can you not see my good fellow, that Aristotle and Darwin are merely different forms of religion and that they fulfil the function that religion fulfills? What I'm saying is that Newton and Darwin deserved to be destroyed. Now because I'm an English professor, I can have the liberty of saying things that I couldn't get away with if I were a physicist, so there is my friend Wal who has to protect his professional integrity, I don't know if he would go so far as to say that Darwin, sorry, gravity does not exist. I would because I have a get-out-of-jail-free card. Anybody says to me "why do you say that" I say well, I don't know I'm just an English professor. I'm just, I'm just a humble English professor, how would I know, you see? So I can go further but I would say that in my opinion, in my humble opinion, gravity doesn't exist. There's no, you can't, it's not a force, Einstein said it's not a force, you cannot take a meter and stick it in the way and measure the force and get a reading, how does gravity propagate? It's supposed to be gravitons, but nobody has ever proved they exist, nobody's seen them, are gravitons merely a different form of saying there's an ether because the gravity has to move somewhere, there's no gravitons, as for gravitational waves, the speaker yesterday showed us that the LIGO experiments, which said it had detected gravitational waves, is nonsense, they had fiddled with the numbers and it's really a fraud. So in effect, gravity is unprovable and I would go so far as to say that it may turn out to be wrong. Therefore, if you imagine that I am now a speaker on the program 'the nightly Business Review' it's some of you may watch on PBS. They bring up people who are experts in the market and they advise you which stocks to bet on. Well, I would say to you, sell gravity short; I would say, sell Darwin completely short; because he's dead and if you're gonna buy stocks, invest in Lamarck, I haven't explained to you who he is, but Lamarck was supposed to be dead and he's coming back to life; invest in Robert Shapiro and so on because if you Google, as I did the other day, 'criticisms of Darwin' they listed, to start off, 76 names and I counted them and most of them are prominent major biologists, all of whom disagree partly or completely with Darwin, and then at the end they throw in, there's hundreds more. So I think Darwin is completely dead, he makes no sense whatever and I think Velikovsky was perfectly within his rights to deny Darwin and to deny the theory of gravity. Wal can tell you later if he is really going to go on a limb that far but of course he's a physicist and I'm not, so I can go further out on a limb than he can perhaps. But my feeling is that, I like Wal and I've known him for a long time and I respect him, so I go with people I like and if Wal says gravity ain't what it's supposed to be, I believe that because I have what they call, a smeller, the smeller means I can smell crap, there's another word, you see. I'll use it, a friend of mine in Scotland calls it crap and I will say crap. I remember when I was an undergraduate and one of my friends said look, they've discovered that the first two forces are actually the same and I laughed and I said well, of course they are. Nature is not extravagant, and I said they will probably find that the third force is also the same and lo and behold, ten or fifteen years later, they discovered that they are all the same. It didn't smell right to me that they should be different. Now when I stand on a huge boulder in the middle of a forest, as we did, and somebody tells me this Boulder is sending out forces of gravity which are mediated through gravitons that doesn't smell right to me and I follow my smeller, that's my standard of.. Now if I have to prove to you that Britain is a country that wants gradualism and quiet and order, I would give you three scientific proofs. These involve the theory which you may not like, that British women are not sexually arousable very quickly and that gives you an idea of the character of the British. So my first 'scientific proof' is this, a Frenchman is in bed with an English woman and suddenly he stops and he says to her, Cherie, did I hurt you, and she says hurt me, not at all, why do you ask? Because, he answers, you moved! Next 'scientific proof.' After good sex, the Russian woman says to her partner, you are my god, my czar, the French woman equally aroused says Cherie je t'aime, je t'adore, the English woman says to her partner, feeling better? Now here is my culminating 'scientific proof!' Alfonse and Gaston are two French fishermen coming down early in the morning on the beach to go and get their boat, then suddenly they see a body on the sand and they come running up and it's a woman and she looks dead. So Gaston says to Alphonse, you stay with the body, he will go and get the police and bring them back. When they come back on the beach, they see that Alphonse is on top of the woman trying to have sex with her. Now the French policeman runs up and says, "Monsieur, Monsieur what are you doing, can you not see this woman she is dead? Dead, says Alphonse, sacre bleu! I just thought she was English! So now that I have proved to you 'scientifically' beyond a shadow of a doubt what the British culture is like, you will understand why the British culture has produced these theories and why I am very suspicious because the apple does not fall far from the tree. The plant must reflect the soil out of which it grows. So Velikovsky was right in attacking these two icons, they were, they had feet of clay and it should have happened 70 years ago, it didn't. Maybe it's going to start happening now because I see one of my purposes here is to repay my debt to the old man. I called him 'the old man' although now I'm closer to his ages than when I first met him, but I have to repay my debt to him because I think he's a very great man, I am honored and respected to have known him and worked with him, I believe in what he says and I think it's time that he had a fair hearing and I think that people should start with 'Earth in Upheaval' which is a more moderate self-restrained book. People should read it and look into it and what we really need is what I need and Bill and everybody else, is three smart young assistants who will do the work, go back to the Velikovsky books, show how he's been right and show how he deserves to say the things he does, he had a right to attack Darwin and he had a right to attack Newton because they had, their theories were weak and nonsensical. Now, the dirt that has been flung on Velikovsky still adheres to his name. People take the time to attack Velikovsky to establish their own credentials among their colleagues and it goes so far as, when was Shermer here? In twenty fourteen or fifteen? 2015, OK, well that's just two years ago. Shermer is a skeptic. Now the point is that he calls himself a sniffer out of pseudoscience but there is no way of defining pseudoscience, you cannot take a degree in pseudoscience, you cannot become a specialist in pseudoscience, you have to appoint yourself as a sniffer out of pseudoscience, so people like Shermer are self-appointed vigilantes and they work on behalf of big science. Now Shermer's report, I believe, was published in Scientific American and we all know that everything in Scientific American must be true, that God stands behind the Scientific American, so it must be right. And Shermer was here for half a day and wrote a report, not because the electric universe people are directly Velikovskian but Velikovsky is behind them because everybody here today who is involved in this owes a debt to Velikovsky whether it's one, two, or three degrees of separation, they all belong here, I mean they all are connected because of the Old Man. And so, Shermer's report, I just want to read it because this is how it starts, "Newton was wrong, Einstein was wrong, black holes do not exist, the Big Bang never happened, dark energy and dark matter are unsubstantiated conjectures, stars are electrically charged plasma" and so on. Now he's giving you this as a series of beliefs that the EU offers, and of course the whole point of it is, he's asking you to laugh at them because everybody knows that Newton was not wrong, and Einstein was not wrong, and black holes do exist and so on, but if you paid attention to the second speaker on Thursday night, I can't remember his name at the moment (Jim Ryder) but he was a physicist, he showed us that all of the things that physicists believe in, as part of the standard model, they have never managed to find. Now, maybe we can perform a short thought experiment, Einstein loved them and I'm going to do two with you now. The first one will take us back 400 years, the next one will take us ahead 200 years. Imagine that 400 years ago there was a conference in, let us say Rome, where a group of rebels, iconoclasts, heretics, just like the EU today, were assembling to talk about Copernicus and so on and the church did not like this, because they believed in Aristotle so they sent someone like Shermer, a pre-incarnation of Shermer to go to Rome and report, he would have said the same thing. He would have said by starting in a sneering way, the concentric circles do not exist, the music of the spheres did not exist, the prime mover does not exist, and we are expected to laugh and say well, we know they do exist, and it would have been the same thing, so what Shermer did was quite disgraceful. He did not behave like a scientist, he did not look at the ideas and say look at, this is what people say, let's take a look at it, I think they might be right or wrong in the following ways; all he did is sneer and laugh and put people down. In fact, one of the people I forget who, he called him a self-taught mathematician meaning of course, he can't be right because he wasn't trained at a university. So I think, Shermer's reaction and his report was disgraceful but typical of the attacks on Velikovsky and because they happened 60 years later, you can see that the stigma is still attached to Velikovsky. Now, another thought experiment, 200 years years in the future. We go to Cambridge through department of the history of science, I spent a whole semantical year there, I had convinced my university that I had important things to do on Shakespeare and I had to be at Cambridge, but I went every day to the Department of the history and philosophy of science, I went there like a mole, I didn't tell them who I was, I went there like a spy to see what they were doing and what they were thinking and I met a number of young, bright young people who were there to get a PhD from Cambridge and I invited them out individually for coffee and we talked and so on and imagine that one of them 200 years from now, is being asked to write a thesis on the state of physics at the end of the 20th and beginning of the 21st centuries. Well he would do just what Shermer did, only he would say black holes and so on and he would list all the idiotic things that physics believed in in the year 2100 and how wrong they were and how a new form of physics has now appeared. So you have to place Velikovsky in that background. Now very quickly because I don't know how much time I have, I told Dave this morning that I want the whole morning, 3 hours, he says, you're not getting it! But, how Velikovsky has impinged on me? I began to see that the great works of art carry a subconscious, unconscious story and if you know how to decode it, if you're familiar with Velikovsky you can see what's going on. So I wrote an article about Shakespeare's play 'Antony and Cleopatra,' where I showed that the action in the abstract can really be a retelling of the Velikovsky story and I developed a theory that in the great works of art, we are allowed to revisit the catastrophes in disguise because we can never forget about them, it's too horrible. We revisit in disguise and we put in a happy ending so that we can relax again but every once in a while we have to go back and look at the trauma again in code and then give it a happy ending. So I began to write articles about Shakespeare's plays, I wrote articles about sport, about politics, everything else, and this is where Velikovsky left me, two years ago in Toronto I presented two papers, the first one was on baseball. Now, I saw pictures of pharaohs, mainly Tuthmose the third, and so on; photographs taken of carvings on the walls where Tuthmose is standing with a bat over his sholder, how much time have I got Bill? Five minutes, well it's five minutes plus two hours but let's make it five minutes. He's standing with a bat on his shoulder and he says, I have driven off the evil eye of Apophis. Now what it means is this, they believed that order, stability, orbit, is carried on by the god Ra who travels in a boat and when he completes the orbit, the world is safe. Now there is this villain who's called by different names one of them is Apophis and he keeps trying to destroy the path of the boat. So the eye of Apophis is the force that Apophis is sending to stop the boat of Ra, and the Egyptian god knocks away the eye to keep the boat safe on its journey. Now you imagine a photograph of Babe Ruth with a bat on his shoulder, imagine W.G. Grace who was the major British cricket batsman of the 19th century, with a cricket bat on his shoulder and then you have the drawings that I showed with the Pharaoh and the bat on the shoulder, you see that there is a strong correlation between Velikovsky and the game of baseball. They don't know it, but I could see it because I could decode baseball. Now I also gave an article on the Nazi rallies in the late 30s, the large stupendous rallies at Nuremberg and I showed how, at one point, the Nazis had gotten, they had a huge stadium that held close to 400,000 people and they had surrounded it with searchlights, they were anti-aircraft searchlights but they brought them all to the stadium, there was a hundred and sixty of them, each one had a beam that was five feet tall and it went up about thirty thousand feet, you can imagine that. So when these beams, all the lights were shut off, and these beams were lit, then you had the whole stadium surrounded by these pillars of light, but then, they got all the beams to intersect and where they intersected, there was an enormous brilliant ball of light, up in the sky about 20,000 feet and then the beams came down. Now, if you look at it from the opposite view, you have all these lights flashing down, you have this beam and then they all come crashing to the ground and I look through this and I said to myself, Hitler must have read worlds in collision except it hasn't come out but it was there, you can imagine it. Now, try and decode other things, let's take stock car racing, I don't know if everybody knows what it is. Maybe the ladies aren't as interested as the men, but if you have a stock car race, there's a hell of a lot of violence, cars go crashing into each other, bouncing off, some of them burst into flames, the driver is either injured or not, there's a hell of a lot of wreckage every once in a while, the race is stopped, it goes under a yellow flag and then it starts again and there's another crash and there's yellow flag and so on. But when the race is over, what happens? The winning driver does a victory lap and what he's showing is that the orbit has been re-established peacefully again and it's pure Velikovsky. So if you train yourself as I have, to decode items of popular culture, one can see that this is where Velikovsky can lead you. Let me give you one more example, one more. About 25 years ago, this was a conference and at the end we had a dinner, just as we're going to have tomorrow night here, and I was sitting at the table with a number of people, I'm not sure if Bill was there, and I mentioned that I had heard that Velikovsky had said that every 700 years a new major world religion comes into being because there's a fear about the end of the world and if you develop a new religion, God won't dump on you. Now, aside from the fact that there is a lot of debate about the number of years and the absolute dates, if we take every 700 as an interval without attaching specific dates, you have at minus 1400 or 1450, you have Hebrew monotheism, at - 700 you have prophetic Judaism, at the Year Zero you have Catholicism, at the Year 700, 750, you have Islam, at 1450, 1500, you have Protestantism, and I remember sitting at the table and saying where is the next world religion, I don't see it, I don't see any big religion. Well 25 years later the thing has blown up right in our faces. It's Islamic extremism which is also expecting the end of the world. My time is up, OK, so Velikovsky is right on that as well, what I'm trying to tell you is if you take a long drink of Velikovsky you will never be the same again, OK? 
Blinded by the Sun Good morning, everyone! The good news this morning appears to be from ESA that they have received data from the lander. and that they're able to trigger all of the experiments, as far as I'm aware. And that they are getting data back or they expect to get data back from that. And that's being looked at. So, hopefully we'll get some more information from them in the future to support the Electric Universe model of comets. But now I want to talk about the Sun. If comets are fundamentally an electrical phenomenon, it's telling us something very important about the Sun. And it's my contention that most of the mysteries of astronomy can be solved by really understanding the Sun. What we have now is a complicated narrative constructed over several centuries that has proven non-predictive in the space age. The noted Australian solar physicist Ron Giovanelli working at the Mount Stromlo observatory in the 1940's, and I should say Mount Stromlo is about 20 minutes from me. And we have somebody in the audience who actually works up there and so I see him occasionally at the astrophysics seminars. Anyway, Mount Stromlo in the 1940's. Ron Giovanelli concluded that solar flares are basically an electromagnetic phenomenon in which electrons are accelerated by electric fields induced by changing magnetic fields. Now, this is the problem that astrophysicists have in separating cause and effect. In 1984, he published "Secrets of the Sun" where he writes in the introduction, "Today there are five basic problems in solar physics. The first is the sunspot cycle which is closely interwoven with the second, the structure of the convection zone, which is supposed to occupy about the outer 200,000 kilometers of the solar radius. And with the third, the variation of rotation rate across the surface and with depth. The final two are the heating mechanisms in the outer solar layers and the causes of flares. There are many other intriguing problems, but central to almost all is the nature of the Sun's magnetic field. That's the end of the quote from his work. In a video prepared before his death in 1985, Giovanelli gently upbraids others for drifting into mathematics and leaving out physics. He continually reminds how little we know about the Sun or, to put it differently, how much there is to learn. In the intervening 30 years and incomparably better data from space, things have not improved. They have become worse! Astronomers remain unaware of Hannes Alfvén's admonition to first understand the electric circuits of the Sun if you want to understand its magnetism. You compare these images of the Sun which I will just bring up. Compare these images of the Sun with a comment by Fred Hoyle in "Frontiers of Astronomy". That's back in 1955, where he wrote, "We should expect, on the basis of a straightforward calculation, that the Sun would end itself in a simple and rather prosaic way. That with increasing height above the photosphere, the density of the solar material would decrease quite rapidly until it became pretty well negligible, only two or three kilometers up. Instead, the atmosphere is a huge bloated envelope. Not only that, the atmosphere extends well out through the planetary system to the heliosphere. Ralph Juergens, in 1980, stated the obvious answer for those not blinded by their training. And you see the quote here, "The modern astrophysical concept that describes the Sun's energy to the thermonuclear reactions deep in the solar interior is contradicted by nearly every observable aspect of the Sun." That was published in 1980. When I read his paper, it just seemed so obvious to me that he was correct. And that was when I began to really try and understand the Sun for myself. Ralph Juergens certainly pointed the way and did a very thorough job. So, what is a star? An undergraduate textbook on the structure and evolution of stars makes a star seem a very simple object. And I quote, "A star can be defined as a body that satisfies two conditions: a) it is bound by self gravity and b) it radiates energy supplied by an internal source. Behind this definition are some critical assumptions that Sir Arthur Eddington bequeathed to us long before the Space Age in his 1926 opus "The Internal Constitution of the Stars". But how many students now read Eddington's original work with a critical eye? Indeed, how many read him at all? Here is Sir Arthur Eddington. Eddington wrote, "The problem of the source of a star's energy will be considered; by a process of exhaustion we are driven to conclude that the only possible source of a star's energy is subatomic; because at this stage it had been discovered, nuclear energy had been discovered. He said, "...yet it must be confessed that the hypothesis shows little disposition to accommodate itself to the detailed (arguments) the detailed requirements (sorry) of observation and a critic might count up a large number of fatal objections." A single fatal objection would suffice to falsify the hypothesis but the apparent isolation of stars in the vacuum of space encouraged the belief that stars must consume themselves to fuel their own fires rather like a campfire in the sky, only a modern version. The fatal objections would be sorted out later. Two such objections are behind NASA's plan to launch a mission to the Sun called "Solar Probe Plus" in 2018, with first close approach in December 2024. And I hope I'm about to report on that. NASA says the mission’s primary scientific goal is to understand how the Sun's corona is heated and how the solar wind is accelerated. Solar Probe Plus will revolutionize our knowledge of the origin and evolution of the solar wind. That's the end of the quote. That will follow 92 years of denial that there is a serious problem with our understanding of our nearest star. Neither of these features are predicted by the standard solar model. Eddington argued the need for a central fire as follows, "No source of energy is of any avail unless it liberates energy in the deep interior of the star. It is not enough to provide for the external radiation of the star. We must provide for the maintenance of the high internal temperature without which the star would collapse." This is the rationale for having a high energy, high temperature core in a star. But this assumes that a star is basically a ball of hot gas obeying gravity in the standard laboratory gas laws. Edington's logic of exhaustion had to set aside facts that didn't fit the only "possible" theory. Appearances can be deceptive when viewed through the lens of a single idea. A kind of tunnel vision develops that accommodates fatal objections with the excuse that someday we will find the answers, just give me more money. To compensate for the weakness of the excuse, those who adopt the consensus view acquire a kind of evangelical zeal which you can see anytime you see these interviews with astrophysicists. For example, the undergraduate textbook, referred to in the last slide, opens with, "The theory of stellar structure and evolution is elegant and impressively powerful." Yet we have recently discovered stars that shouldn't exist. In one instance, the star is too huge to be inflated by a central fire. Tunnel-vision does more than magnify the elegance of the single idea. It also excludes consideration of other ideas. Alternative ideas are stymied by unquestioning faith in the "only possible theory". For this reason, as history shows, most fundamental breakthroughs come from outsiders, those who sit down before facts like a child. Eddington had addressed the problem of generating electricity when trying to explain bright lines in the spectra of some stars. The difficulty is that the heat of the star can't supply the energy of the atoms producing those bright lines. Something extra is adding energy. He came close to the answer when he wrote, and I quote, "If there is no other way out, we may have to suppose that bright line spectra in the stars are produced by electric discharges, similar to those producing bright line spectra in a vacuum tube." But he goes on, "A disturbed cyclonic state of the atmosphere might establish local and temporary electric fields, thunderstorms, under which the electrons would acquire high speeds." Collisions between the high-speed electrons and atoms in the stellar atmosphere would give rise to the bright spectral lines. However, in a footnote, Eddington revealed the fundamental limitation of his theory of stars and I quote again, "The difficulty is to account for the escape of positively charged particles. Unless charges of both signs are leaving the, the escape is immediately stopped by an electrostatic field." This statement will reverberate down the years as one of the gravest mistakes in science. It is an electrostatic model of an isolated self-contained star. But stellar magnetism is an electrodynamic phenomenon requiring electric currents flowing in circuits, both within and beyond the star. Birkeland recognized this, Alfvén insisted on it. A noteworthy outsider had already published an electrical theory of the Sun in 1913 long before Eddington's work on the subject. Kristian Birkeland, on the left, was a renowned Norwegian scientist and multiple Nobel Prize nominee, who set up observatories under great difficulties in the Arctic Circle to study the Aurora Borealis. His fascinating story can be read in Lucy Jago's biography "The Northern Lights" and I recommend it. His theory that the aurora is due to charged particle beams from the Sun has only recently been confirmed as Don Scott pointed out last night. Birkeland's approach was largely experimental. He managed to reproduce sunspot behavior, see the inset on the left, in his famous Terella or little Earth experiment where he applied external electric current in a discharge to a magnetized globe suspended in a near-vacuum. Another outsider was Charles Edward Rhodes Bruce, or C.E.R. Bruce. He was a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, the Institute of Physics, the Institution of Electrical Engineers and was a member of the Electrical Research Association from 1924 until his retirement in 1967. His interest in astronomy and research on lightning led him to write, in 1968, "Perhaps in no scientific discipline, other than cosmology, have so many theories got by on so little positive evidence. Imagination has had free rein, often at the expense of common sense. The main observational evidence indicating the existence of cosmic electrical discharges is the same as that which would lead an external observer to conclude that lightning flashes occur in our own atmosphere. Namely, the sudden change they affect in the spectra and the spectra of the Sun, stars and galaxies. In the Sun’s spectrum, line suddenly appear, indicating the existence of gas temperatures of hundreds of thousands or even millions of degrees. That's from his work "Electric Fields in Space" published in 1968, in Penguin Science Survey. Here's Sidney Chapman. He was one of the establishment, the British establishment, Sidney Chapman, fellow of the Royal Society, studied magnetic storms and aurorae, developing theories to explain their relation to the interaction of the Earth's magnetic field with the solar wind. He was recognized as one of the pioneers of mathematical solar-terrestrial physics. He continued the tradition of opposition by British scientists to Birkeland's work and Scandinavian science. He disputed and ridiculed the work of Kristian Birkeland and Hannes Alfvén but later adopted Birkeland's theories as his own. Near the end of his life he did acknowledge Charles Bruce in 1964, in a publication called, a book actually, called "The Solar Wind". And I quote, "It seems appropriate to call attention to the ideas put forward over many years by Bruce, concerning the importance of electrical discharges in the cosmos and in particular in the Sun's atmosphere. Bruce agrees that the Sun offers his ideas perhaps their greatest challenge because of the very high electrical conductivity of the solar material at all levels. Any electrical discharge in the Sun's atmosphere demands an exceptionally rapid and strong means of generating differences in electric potential." Here we see a recognized leader in the field who at the end allowed that the Sun itself, as an isolated body in space, might somehow generate its own electricity. But today, scientists don't know how the earth can generate its own lightning. That may surprise you but one of the experts, Dr. Newman or Professor Newman who's written on this subject, it's been his subject life-long, has admitted that we still do not understand what causes lightning, what actually causes that electrical separation sufficient to initiate a lightning discharge on the Earth. Let alone on the Sun. All we have is a cover story, one of a large and growing lists. Of course, you've all heard about the updrafts of ice particles and so on, separating electricity. It doesn't work. In fact, some years ago I wrote on my website, "The balloon goes up over lightning". And this was where high-altitude balloons were flown above thunderstorms. And the surprise that came from that was that the electric field already... The charge is already there, it's waiting to discharge through the cloud. It doesn't have to be generated in the cloud. So the source of the lightning is external and of course, since then we've seen sprites and elves and all of the other magical things that occur above powerful thunderstorms rising to the ionosphere and from the ionosphere to the magnetosphere and from the magnetosphere we already have these, so called flux ropes, which are electric currents to the Sun. So, our weather is driven largely electrically and this is something that climate scientists know nothing about. Now, here's the guy who made the most advance in the understanding of the electrical nature of the Sun, Ralph Juergens. An important outsider, an engineer and a pioneer of the electrical model of stars. He was inspired by Bruce. And also Birkeland. But because of the tunnel vision of the consensus view, he was forced to publish his ideas in obscure journals in the early 1970's. His model is a shining example of common sense and simplicity when compared with the infernally complex and improbable thermonuclear paradigm. One of the problems of the thermonuclear paradigm is that it took a lot of ingenuity to figure out how you might have a thermonuclear cycle which would work inside a star. Even then you required incredible pressures and temperatures. But what's more, some of those reactions, one in particular, the reaction rate varies as the temperature to the fifth power. Well, that is highly unstable. That's why they make hydrogen bombs. It's because it's highly unstable. And one of the other reactions requires quantum tunneling. So there all sorts of assumptions piled upon assumptions to actually end up with that so-called wonderful thermonuclear model of how a star works. Juergens' model is simplicity. Yet Juergens' insight was in danger of being lost following following his untimely death in 1979. In fact, it was within weeks of Velikovsky's death, which was ironic. Ralph wrote, "As I pursued the phenomenology of electric discharges, it gradually dawned on me that structurally, the atmosphere of the Sun bears a striking resemblance to the low-pressure type of electric discharge known as the glow discharge..." And when you look at the Sun in that way, you can understand how easy it is to describe what you see on the surface of the Sun in electrical terms. The Sun's surface is carpeted with complex magnetic fields. Whatever fine structure they go down to, they can see more and more levels of structure in this magnetic carpet. Now, as all electrical engineers know, only electricity or electric currents can produce magnetic fields. So, what we're looking at is a seething storm of electric currents. So the Sun must be understood in terms of electric circuits because (you cannot) all currents must flow in a circuit. And the questions then are, where are these circuits and what creates them? Well, Hannes Alfvén paved the way by drawing a circuit for the Sun. But, he assumed that the Sun was the driver of that circuit and it was closed. So you had the current flowing out along the equatorial plane of the Sun, the so-called solar wind. And then somewhere at some distance, he said it curls back and it comes in at the pole. So he drew the circuit but he assumed the Sun was the driver without explaining precisely how that might work. And having established the circuit, of course, that radiates energy, electromagnetic energy and so on. And the Sun is obviously radiating energy, so what sustains these currents? So there's the summary of just what I've said and here is the Sun in that solar circuit. Remember, I said there's a current flowing out here and this is the solar wind and it comes in at the poles. This diagram is from Don Scott's book "The Electric Sky" and I recommend that book for anyone who wants to go into the electrical theory of how this might work. The beauty of this relatively simple diagram is that it shows how you can explain the solar cycle. It's simple, you don't have to rely on unseen things going on inside the Sun. All of this is happening at the very top of the atmosphere of the Sun which is very highly conductive of course, and can carry these currents. So, the greatest puzzle of the Sun, its magnetic field reversals, is solved. The Sun is subject to a varying DC or direct current power input and so generates alternating magnetic fields because the magnetic field always tries to oppose a change in the current. It's rather like a power transformer but one that's operating with a current, a steady current through it with a varying input superimposed. And this makes some kind of sense because these Birkeland currents, as Don showed last night, can have waves passing through them to cause pinches and so on. So they're a part of a circuit. It has a resonance. So I would suggest the 11 or 22-year solar cycle, sunspot cycle, is driven by the resonances in the Sun's circuit. Other stars have different resonances and so their solar, their stellar cycles would be different. So I refer you to Don Scott's book. This diagram is on page 112 and explained more fully. I'll mention again that the polar current flow shown is referred to by Hannes Alfvén, but he considered the Sun as a generator in a closed circuit and not as a load in a galactic circuit. So the principal difference in the Electric Universe model is that the circuit extends beyond the heliosphere, and this is being confirmed by surprising discoveries by the Voyager spacecraft at the boundary of the Sun's interface with interstellar space, and the IBEX mission which has picked up, as Donald explained last night, the signals we would expect from an enveloping Birkeland current pinch around the Sun. As for what creates and sustains the circuits, I will address that in my presentation on Electric Universe cosmology which I think is tomorrow. Now, you've seen this picture before. As we said, this is an archetype for a stellar circuit where we can actually see it in glow mode. This particular object, M2-9, is 2,100 light-years distant and as Don said last night, most stellar circuits operate in a more diffuse plasma environment, a lower current density, so that the circuit does not glow. But you can imagine, all stars have this kind of plasma circuit impinging on them. The conventional caption for this image says, "M2-9 represents the spectacular 'last gasp' of a binary star system at the nebula's center." They require a binary star system, one star would rip material off the other (to perform) to produce that disk of dust and gas, that Don explained last night is necessary in their models, whether it's a black hole, a star or whatever. Such a disc can successfully account for the jet-exhaust-like appearance of M2-9. I don't think so. The last statement is patently false. The detailed structure of planetary nebulae has defied all attempts at explanation by flinging gas out of a star. On the contrary, the structure conforms to the concentric pinched cylinders of an interstellar current filament. More on that in a moment. Don also showed a stylized version of this object. It's called the Red Square Nebula and it's a celestial object located in the area of the sky occupied by star MWC 922 - in the constellation Serpens. And the quote here is from Peter Tuthill of the University of Sydney. He was one the people, his team actually discovered this thing and imaged it. The thing that really takes your breath away is the astonishing degree of symmetry within the intricate linear form. A series of rungs and conical surfaces lie nested, one within the next, down to the heart of the system where the hyperbolic bicone surfaces are crossed by a dark lane running across the principal axis." This of course is your, and once again, your dust Lane which is hiding what's going on inside. Then Tuthill makes the connection and this is important, "It is fascinating to take a second look at one of the most famous astronomical images of them all: supernova 1987A." And that was also mentioned last night by Don and I'll talk more about that. This particular object, the Red Square Nebula is 34 times closer than supernova 1987A, so we see fine detail in the inner structure of the stellar circuit. Tuthill goes on to say, it's the best astrophysical laboratory yet discovered for studying the physics of generating the mysterious sharp polar ring systems like that around supernova 1987A. And he goes on, "A system as complex and fascinating as this, is bound to keep us guessing for years to come. How did this beautiful, crisp structure form? He asks. This is the million-dollar question. Oh, I'd like the million dollars, thank you, because I explained it. I explained it in a peer-reviewed paper to the IEEE. And it is based, as Don explained last night, on Birkeland current filaments impinging on a star. What you're seeing there, these are double layers seen edge-on. The Birkeland current filaments. You can actually see the filaments themselves in the original image. They may be a little hard to see here but you can just see this hairy look here. And this is the pinch coming in here. It's quite a fantastic image and I'm really pleased that it's been discovered and is being examined in detail because this is important. So, let's move on. This is the supernova 1987A and the clue for this came from Tony Peratt's work. And on the far left there you see the stellar z-pinch. And this is one of his diagrams, a simulation. And then right at this is, in the neck of the z-pinch, this is the detail you see here. These filaments coming down here, strike the material which is in the solar wind if you like, the stellar wind which comes out in the equatorial region and... Let me see, I'll just catch up with my notes here... The bright ring of beads there are due to the current filaments lighting up the equatorial stellar wind like a ring of searchlights through a thin cloud. One of the interesting things is, as I mentioned in the article that I wrote for the IEEE Plasma Sciences Journal, that these beads, Tony said they tend to pair up. So that over time they coalesce and they become fewer in number. But they have certain classical stabilities where you get a particular number of these things. 56 was one of the the classical ones. I can't remember, this quite gets to that or might be 28 where they've tended to pair. But I suggested that rather than being a result of an explosion or light catching up with something that was left by a prior ejection of material which is the ad-hoc astronomical story, these would remain relatively stationary because they are actually the pinch itself. So they're not going to move very far. But these filaments that are twisting around one another, will pair up and so, and so I would say they would rotate. And this is the kind of research that anyone who's interested could take up and publish a paper on. The more distant coaxial rings. You'll notice over on the right here there are more distant ones. These are just double layers further along the pinch. And notice they're symmetric because the pinch is symmetric. They, and it's always a sharp boundary as we saw with that red square. Those double layers form a very thin layer and they, this is why it's so remarkable for astronomers. How do you form such delicate structures if this is all due to material blowing out of a star. OK. So we come to the Sun's environment and Don dealt with this but it's worth talking about again. And it was published, this picture was published in May 10, 2012, "New IBEX data show heliosphere's long theorized bow shock does not exist", was a quote from that article. I had written on my website in November 13, 2005, almost seven years earlier, "The solar plasma and that of interstellar space are two different plasmas, which must therefore have a double layer or Langmuir plasma sheath between them. So to treat the heliospheric boundary simply as a magnetohydrodynamic shock problem is naive." The heliosphere is the boundary of the Sun's electrical influence. That's where the Sun's presence in the galaxy meets the interstellar regions of the Milky Way. So the heliosphere is the boundary of the Sun's Electrical influence. And Juergens said, "Most of the Sun's driving voltage appears across this plasma sheath, simply because of the graphs here which show the relationship of a normal plasma discharge tube, so this is in the laboratory. These are the curves you find in the laboratory. And if you apply that to the Sun, here's the Sun, the positive electrode come down here, there's the Sun. As you move out from the Sun, you'll notice that there's only a very shallow voltage change. And this is important because one of the arguments against our work has been: if the Sun is electrical there should be all these relativistic electrons and particles streaming past the Earth. No, not at all. The voltage difference is very slight, such that it's just enough to cause the electrons to drift towards the positive anode and in the opposite direction for the solar wind to be accelerated rapidly close to the Sun and then it just continues accelerating very slowly out towards the heliosphere. Until it hits this bump. And I predicted before the event that the solar wind would slow down more than expected before it got to the boundary and that was found to be so. There were articles saying there was no explanation for why the solar wind should have suddenly stopped. Well, that's the answer, it's an electrical discharge. So I'll just repeat, if you refer to Juergens' original work, you will see that he invokes a very large voltage driving the Sun. But he was assuming that all of the Sun's radiant output must be accounted for by the electrical power input. But we have the evidence for that nuclear fusion is taking place at the Sun because we've got neutrino images now. I don't know whether you saw it some months ago. There was a picture published which showed this glow, circular glow in the sky. It was rather pixelated because it's not very good definition. And right in the center there was a little circle and that's where the Sun is. So the neutrino telescope, if you like to call it that, is very low definition so you cannot tell whether the neutrinos are coming from the core of the Sun or from the surface of the Sun. It's unable to distinguish. So what I'm saying is that the electrical power required to catalyze photospheric nuclear fusion, is yet to be determined. But the Electric Universe model says that stars, all stars, create the heavy elements in their photospheres. It's all happening right in front of our eyes. You don't have to postulate any crazy things or crazy conditions inside a star. It's all happening right in front of you. And that makes sense. I mean, nature always does things the easy way. And if that's the easiest way, and I'm sure it is, then that's the way we should be looking at. OK, I think I've covered all of that. Here we come to the plasma focus. This is something that Eric Lerner and his, is it Lawrenceville Nuclear Labs or some thing or other. He's actually producing fusion or using one of these devices. The important thing to notice is that what you have is two coaxial conductors. And if you think about it, these stellar circuits have concentric, conducting plasma layers. And when it comes down to a pinch, there's the possibility that you'll get a kind of short-circuit across the, between those layers. So, this is important. It's also important in the Sun's photosphere. What happens is that this little red thing here represents a capacitor bank where you store an enormous amount of energy which can be released extremely quickly, in millionths of a second. You have a special high-speed switch here. This yellow part here is your inner metal electrode ... your inner conductor. You have insulators then, between that and the outer conductor. You close this gap and, all of a sudden, there's an electrical discharge between the inner and the outer pipe, tube. The discharge doesn't stay still. It doesn't e just go from here to here. It moves by electromagnetic forces down the barrel and when it gets here it balloons out and then folds back in and forms a tiny little plasmoid. And you can have the energy of a whole roomful of capacitors, which would be an enormous amount of power, released into this (woops) plasmoid, here we go. This will show you what it does. We have sound. "These filaments are little whirlwinds of plasma. The sheath of filaments converges together into a dense pinch or focus, combining all the filaments into one. This filament kinks and twists itself into a tiny dense ball, only a few thousandth of an inch across, called a plasmoid. Instability in the plasmoid creates powerful beams in opposite directions. Positively charged nuclei flow in one direction and electrons flow in the other." That's it. Notice there was thousands of an inch. So you've got the energy stored, an enormous amount of energy in a very tiny volume. And where do we see that? We see it in the centers of galaxies. We see it in blazars, any of these very highly concentrated point sources of radiation. One other aspect of these devices that I should mention, is that it's not only X-rays and particles that come out of the beam. It's also the most copious source known in the laboratory of neutrons. And neutrons are very important when you want to create the heavy elements. Because you need to supply of neutrons to add to the nuclei which can then beta decay and what not and give you all the various elements up the table, of the chemical element table and the isotopes as well. And it's significant, of course, that in the solar spectrum you see the heavy elements, very highly ionized. Possibly because they've only just been created. Generated I should say, you can't create matter. So we go back to our beautiful M2-9. I've just put the little plasma focus down at the bottom here as a reminder. Here you have your concentric cylinders. And if there is a breakdown between the central column which, remember, there's a central column of current. So if you have a breakdown between the inner cylinder and the central column, you will tend to form a plasma focus effect. And these FLIERs have some of that shape. And see this kind of curved shape? And they are a real anomaly. There's no explanation for them. So, a distinctive feature of this nebula are the two bright patches on either side which are known as FLIERs or Fast Low Ionization Emission Regions. They appear to be relatively young moving outwards at supersonic speeds. According to Bruce Bellick, University of Washington, some of their observed characteristics suggest that they are like sparks flung outward from the central star, late in the very recent past. That's not very good. It doesn't explain anything. Yet, their shape seem to suggest that they're stationary and that material ejected from the star flows past them, scraping gas on their surfaces. Well, it has nothing to do with scraping gases and that. And this is under electromagnetic control so it's not a mechanical blast effect or anything like that. In any, in either case, the formation of FLIERs cannot be easily explained by any models of stellar evolution. (Just see if I've missed anything.) Oh yes, an interesting side issue is that this might also explain the asynchronous reversal of the solar magnetic field. You know, when the Sun's magnetic field flips it often does it in one hemisphere and not the other. And then later, the second hemisphere switches. If the solar cycle is driven by a regular disturbance traveling along the interstellar circuit, then one of these dense plasma focus effects will be affected before the other. But as you can see, the complexity of a star's circuitry will require a lot more research. Birkeland wrote with his unusual prescience in the "Norwegian Aurora Polaris Expedition in 1902-03, "It might be imagined that the interior of the Sun form the positive pole for enormous electric currents. This was Juergens' conclusion also. "This assumption has the advantage of appearing to give a natural explanation of the movement of the sunspots in various latitudes," he wrote, which he demonstrated with his Terella experiments. This guy was a great experimentalist. In this case, the origin of the sunspots must be that the presumptive, more or less insulating, photospheric envelope was sometimes pierced by disruptive discharges, thus forming great electric arcs. This is the position of the Electric Universe model. Because you've got this plasma storage ring. This is SOHO NASA spacecraft and in ultraviolet light you can see there's a plasma torus around the Sun. Now, the energy stored in there can reach a point where it discharges to the surface of the Sun. And depending upon the voltage differences, it will shift in latitude. Those discharges will shift in latitude which is exactly what sunspots do. So here's this guy, back in 1902-1903. He had it practically figured out. Nobody was listening, especially not Sydney Chapman. Sunspots. And these are very interesting. The sunspot penumbra shows the detailed structure and behavior that has nothing to do with turbulent hot gas. It has nothing to do with convection. And recent discovery by those people looking at the seismic activity, or what's going on underneath the photosphere, have shown that there is practically no convection. So the standard solar model has already been discredited, again, by this recent discovery. The sunspot is dark, showing the Sun is cooler beneath and so the bright Sun is a photospheric effect alone. One of the things about Birkeland currents is that it induces rotation so the problem of why do galaxies spin, why the stars spin, why the planets orbit stars and so on, is easily solved. It's driven electromagnetically. Super tornadoes have been discovered in the chromosphere between the corona and the photosphere. It is estimated there are more than 10,000s of them, continuously present in the quiet Sun. Surface and coronal vortices are connected. Rotation is a natural effect of Birkeland currents. So, what I'm suggesting here is that the penumbral filaments are actually electrical tornadoes. It's like a tornadic form of lightning. And a tornado is a slow discharge, like slow lightning. So what you're seeing, here on the Sun, is a form of slow lightning. The Sun is a ball of slow lightning. They have bright edges, dark cores. That's because on the right is a special-effects thing where you've got a helicopter blade rotating above and you put fuel into a fire at the base and it forms this twisting vortex. And the center, looking through it, is darker than the edges. And this is precisely what you see on the Sun. So they are tornadoes. It's the ideal site for nuclear fusion and heavy element synthesis by neutron capture. Because the electromagnetic forces, pinch forces and so on, that are active in those stellar tornadoes, are enormous and it's a place where the particles required for nuclear synthesis nuclei synthesis, are available. They're not going anywhere soon. These are actually drawn-out versions of anode tufts. Bright plasma "tufts" form as a secondary plasma in the primary plasma of the discharge. The number of tufts increases with increasing current density and the tufts float above the anode and are hotter than the anode. This is why the photosphere is bright and is darker underneath. They space themselves apart evenly over the anode surface and penumbral filaments have the features that may be expected of anode tufts in a gravitationally stratified atmosphere. Rather like the Earth. We get tornadoes. It gets bigger ones. The electric photosphere. This is a diagram that was based on Juergens' work and Don Scott noticed that this curve has the shape of a transistor. And the beauty of this is that a small change in voltage here, because what happens is, the positive particles in the Sun, any of them have sufficient energy and get into here, are free to move about and any of them that get over to this side here will suddenly reach the edge of this waterfalls effect and be accelerated to form the corona. I have to go through this fairly quickly. I'm running out of time. This is the tuft area. These are those electric tornados. This is where all the nuclear synthesis is taking place, I think. Just a small change in voltage here raises the barrier for these particles escaping from the Sun. So it's a very good control barrier. This is why the Sun, its radiant output, remains steady to within about 0.1 of a percent while the X-ray output of the Sun varies markedly. The Sun is a variable star in X-rays and the X-rays are a good indication of the electrical power that's being expended in a small area. So, the tufted sheath forms a barrier for protons escaping the Sun and the spicules, which are these little jets that occur between them, provide electrons to stabilize the sheath. Just like the porous anodes used in some arc lamps. There is no explanation for spicules in the standard model. So, summarizing. Electrical energy arrives at the Sun from dark mode galactic current filaments. The electric discharge intensifies close to the Sun, causing the thin atmosphere of the corona to appear to be heated to millions of degrees. The heavy element body of the Sun is cool and of unknown structure and composition. And I will address these questions in a later talk on Electric Universe cosmology. So, we cannot understand the countless stars in the heavens until we understand the Sun. All bright stars produce heavy elements in their photospheres. The incredibly complex, the evolutionary story of stars to fit the Hertzsprung-Russell plot, is invalid. We do not know the age of the universe or any celestial object in it. We have been blinded by the story of the Sun concocted a century ago by scientists who had no grasp of the complexities of plasma behavior. They were driven by a need to extend the theoretical lifespan of the Sun to accommodate the needs of the geologists lengthening timescales. So it's understandable that the discovery of nuclear energy was embraced at that time as the only possible answer. No matter that it was entirely unpredictive. Ironically, the astrophysicists were and still are unaware that the geologists' Earth history is a fabrication too. I will address that story in my next presentation. So, in a sense, Eddington was right. The Sun is a simple thing. Far simpler than he imagined. It is the electric universe environment that is complex but that complexity arises from a few simple concepts and repeated fractal patterns. Nature is like that. Meanwhile, for those trying to produce fusion power "like the Sun", it's high time to move on and find out how the Sun really does it. Nature never does anything the hard way. Thank you!

For thousands of years these visitors have mystified, enchanted and terrified humanity. And even today, despite much attention from astronomers, the popular science of comets is filled with enigmas and unresolved mysteries. We have long thought of these bodies as mere chunks of dirty ice warming in the Sun. But since the beginning of the space age it seems that the key comet discoveries have all come as huge surprises. "Every time we look, we find our textbooks were wrong." What did this continuing stream of surprises mean for the future of comet science? It means that the core theoretical assumptions must be reconsidered. "It's a mystery to me how comets work at all." The new facts about comets underscore the long ignored electrical behavior of the Sun and here the biggest surprise changes the picture of comets altogether. It is not rising surface temperatures and evaporated ices that provoked the dramatic discharging of comets. It is charged particles erupting from the Sun to exchange charge with both, the coma and nucleus of a comet. And there's much more to this picture because direct evidence will rewrite planetary history, as well. It seems that comets are born from the very stuff of planets themselves, they are the residue of shattering planetary catastrophe. Today, we can test two views of comets against decades of discovery. We can pose the long unasked question. Is a radically new interpretation of comets now required? Standard View of Comets It was only in the mid-twentieth century that a scientific consensus emerged on the nature of comets. In 195,0 astronomer Fred Whipple proposed a model that came to be known as the "dirty snowball" hypothesis. Whipple envisioned comets as conglomerates of frozen gases, mainly water, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, together with the primordial dust of the early solar system. But a dilemma had to be solved. Comets lose considerable material at each pass around the Sun. This means that the comets we see cannot have been around all that long. So, the Dutch astronomer Jan Oort envisioned a vast horde of icy objects circling the Sun about 1,000 times more distant than remote Pluto. He imagined that after billions of years one of these "dirty snowballs" could be deflected from the icy cloud by a passing star. It might then fall into the inner solar system to produce an active comet. As astronomers came to accept the idea, they called this theoretical source of comets the Oort cloud. But by the 1990s, it became clear that numerous objects circle the Sun at much closer distances than the conjectured Oort cloud. Astronomers came to imagine short term comets originated from the disk of debris called the Kuiper Belt, extending outward from Neptune's orbit. But then advanced computer simulations suggested that Kuiper Belt objects were too stable to be the source of most short term comets. One surprise at a time the origin of comets has become increasingly uncertain. But always it is assumed that comets are composed of dust and ice, warmed by the Sun to create a coma and tail, leaving a variety of dust. The theory suggests that beneath the black and shallow crust pockets of gas form. At critical moments the pressure breaks through the surface creating jets, blasting vapor and dust away from the nucleus. But, how well does this popular theory explain what we've more recently learned about comets? Electric Model of Comets In an alternative view, comets have a much different history. This view sees comets as debris left by intense electrical activity in an earlier phase of solar system evolution. Not billions of years ago - but a much more recent epoch of planetary instability and violence, one that reached even into early human times. This new perspective combines historical facts with surprising recent discoveries about comets. In the electrical interpretation, not just comets but asteroids and meteors, as well, were born in planetary upheaval as electric arcs blasted material from the surfaces of planets and moons to produce fused formations identical in appearance to fused material in laboratory experiments with electric discharge. Here, an arriving comet moves on an elliptical path to the Sun's electric field. An exceedingly weak field but immensely powerful across the great distances of interplanetary space. As the comet draws closer to the Sun the charge imbalance triggers electric discharge creating a coma and long cometary tail. The mysterious jets of comets can then be understood in terms of arc discharges to the nucleus, very similar to industrially electric discharge machining. The excavated material is accelerated into space along the jets filamentary pathways. Intermittent and wandering arcs erode the the surface and burn it black, leaving the distinctive scarring patterns of comet nuclei. The jets explode from the nucleus at supersonic speed and retain their coherent structure for hundreds of thousands of miles. Seen in terms of an electrically neutral vacuum in space, nothing of this sort should occur. The tails of comets reveal well-defined twisting filaments extending up to tens of millions of miles without dissipating in the vacuum of space. For proponents of the electric model, this contradiction of neutral gas behavior is no surprise; it is the testament to the comet's electrified environment. The proponents of this interpretation also say it's the electric force that holds the spherical coma in place against the solar wind as the comet races around the Sun. The diameter of the visible coma will often reach millions of miles. And it's surrounded by an even larger and more "improbable" spherical envelope of fluorescing hydrogen visible in ultraviolet light. The "Laws" of Compositional Zoning For decades we've been assured that comets were made in the deepest of deep freezes in interstellar space. Comets coalesced from interstellar stardust, the primal material of the universe before the emergence of the Sun as we know it, or it's planets and their moons. A foundational principle of comet theory - and of modern cosmology as a whole - is compositional zoning. At the outermost regions of the Sun's domain, formative processes were limited to the most rudimentary material, raw dust constituted in an environment close to absolute zero, with no complex chemistry. In contrast, bodies later formed close to the emerging Sun would exhibit minerals formed at relatively high temperatures. For decades this theoretical claim stood fast, and the claim was even carried into space. It's was what prompted the Stardust mission to Comet Wild 2. As indicated by the very name of the scientific mission, the theory required that a comet be constituted of stardust. "Today we know that comets are black and cold, consisting of ices and dust that coalesced from an interstellar cloud as it collapsed to form the solar system." But the core assumptions of comet theory could not withstand the shock from the data returned by the Stardust mission. Launched on February 7th, 1999, Stardust carried with it a tray of aerogel to capture samples of comet dust from Wild 2. And it returned these samples to Earth. Scientists could then view microscopically the raw material of a comet. The first surprise was the size of the dust grains - much larger, stronger, with far more complex structure and chemistry than theory allowed. And the gel did capture trivial amounts of the expected microscopic dust, invisible to the naked eye and leaving shallow bowl shaped pits in the aerogel. But more common by far were much deeper tracks, more in the shape of carrots than shallow pits. The particles themselves were clearly visible to the naked eye. To their amazement, the mission scientists found elaborately developed crystalline structures in the Wild 2 dust. It was an exciting discovery, but one that challenged all prior theory of a comet's origins. Crystalline structures cannot form in the absence of minimum temperatures, temperatures unavailable in interstellar space. The spectra of silicates in cometary comas were evident as far back as the probes of Comet Halley, though largely ignored. But the mystery couldn't be ignored after arrival of the Comet Hale-Bopp in 1997. This comet's spectra placed an exclamation point on crystalline silicon structures in cometary comas. To get past the problem astronomers hedged their bets. They surmised that billions of years ago, the raw material of the comet was ever so slightly warmed by an emerging Sun. Then all of the discrete particles in a vast circle around the Sun were transported outward by means only guessed at, to the far away and frigid Oort cloud. But this rationalization failed outright once the scientists had real comet dust in their laboratories. The grains were simply too large and the mineralogical and chemical compositions far too complex. "The comet samples collected by Stardust contain abundant crystalline minerals and in most cases it is clear that they did not form by the predicted mild heating of interstellar dust." One puzzle was followed by another. Comet theory assumed that water ice was a primary constituent of active comets. But no water ice was detected on the nucleus of Wild 2 and not a trace of water was found in the well-preserved comet dust. And yet, paradoxically, the rock comet material of Wild 2 contained iron and sulfur minerals that can only be formed in the presence of liquid water. Liquid water, not in the near-perfect vacuum of deep space and not in a deep freeze. "The sulfide minerals formed between 50 and 200°C (122 and 392°F), much warmer than the sub-zero temperatures predicted for the interior of a comet. The discovery shatters the existing paradigm of comets as 'dirty snowballs', whose icy bulk never gets warm enough to melt." Instead of trivial warming, the Wild 2 minerals revealed a diversity of formative processes. Various sulfide minerals requiring liquid water can only exist below 210ºC, or 410ºF. These minerals have never seen higher temperatures. But, also occurring in the comet dust was the mineral olivine, who’s molecular structure rapidly breaks down in the very presence of water. It's a common igneous form, an abundant by-product of volcanism. Perhaps, the biggest surprise was that some of the comet minerals such as Forsterite, in the instant of their formation, were heated to thousands of degrees. Forsterite is formed in the most intense volcanic heating of silicates, but occurs also in lightning strikes to silicate rocks. The message could not have been more emphatic. "That's a big surprise. People thought comets would just be cold stuff that formed out...where things are very cold." When these minerals formed they were either red hot or white hot grains, and yet they were collected in a comet, the Siberia of the Solar System." It was not just the hypothesized Oort cloud that failed to work as advertised. The entire concept of compositional zoning as applied to comets failed it's first acid test. "If this mixing is occurring, as suggested by these results, then how do you preserve any kind of zoning in the solar system?" Comet material requiring moderate temperatures in liquid water. Comet material formed at exceedingly high temperatures. Only the most trivial levels of the presumed raw material of comets, interstellar dust. A complete absence of water despite cometary material originally formed in liquid water, though the olivine abundances could not have been formed or even survived in the presence of liquid water. And of course, liquid water requires atmospheric or other pressure. It cannot exist in the extreme vacuum of interstellar space. To this seemingly contradictory picture, we must add extreme selective heating. Selective heating because much of the compositional material could not survive the super heating that created olivine, forsterite and other crystalline minerals. Wild 2's discoveries have forced upon comet science one inescapable fact: in our own cosmic neighborhood the diverse mineral content of Wild 2 is typical only of planets in the habitable zone of a fully developed Sun. "Most of the components from the comet have isotopic compositions similar to Earth and are of solar system origin." Is a coherent explanation possible? When the fundamentals of a theory are falsified by unexpected findings, a new vantage point is required, one that explains and predicts the surprises without introducing new contradictions. The conjectured Oort cloud freezer, forming and preserving comets for billions of years, is falsified by the Wild 2 findings. Only the diverse surface environments of rocky planets can provide the required raw material. And only the recent formation of comets can explain why these rapidly degraded objects are still with us. The bold question must now be asked: were comets created in recent periods of planetary instability and intense electrical events? Would minerals formed in liquid water then come as a surprise? Would comets now exhibiting no water be a surprise? Or crystalline structures suggesting igneous processes? Or, minerals pointing to the exceedingly high temperatures of lightning? A more unified picture of comet formation is available to us. And, if comets were born electrically, what might the causative connection be to asteroids and meteorites, the apparent cousins of the comet? The Wild 2 mineral cubanite, a copper iron sulfide, is abundant on Earth, and so too, on Mars. In fact, it's found in Martian meteorites now known to have been blasted up to escape velocity from the surface of Mars, later to arrive at Earth. A few years ago, things now stated by astronomers would have been considered preposterous. Astronomers now acknowledge that the Martian moon Phobos, long called a captured asteroid, was formed out of material blasted from the Martian surface. For the source of a comet's constituent materials, planets close to the Sun's habitable zone are the most reasonable places to look. The foremost candidate is the planet Mars. In this intellectual adventure, we must revisit all earlier ideas about solar system history. Evidence for high energy electrical events can no longer be ignored. The popular billion year scenarios describing a comet's origins will be displaced by things now established as fact. And the changing picture of solar system history will surely not stop with the new story of the comet. Where's the Water? Modern comet theory has long proclaimed that active comets are the result of sublimating ices. And yet, the comet Wild 2 was active, though no water could be detected on it's surface and none was found in the well-preserved comet dust returned to Earth. The theory requires cometary ices. And that's what scientists were certain they would find when the Deep Space 1 probe reached Comet Borelly in 2001. But the probe could find not even a hint of water. "The spectrum suggests that the surface is hot and dry. It is surprising that we saw no traces of water ice." In fact, an absence of detectable water on comet nuclei is the common finding. When astronomers discovered the fragments of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 in 1993, they expected to observe volatile gases from sublimated ices, but no such gases were found. When Comet Linear disintegrated, astronomers were shocked by the absence of water in the immediate debris - exactly as later occurred in the case of the disintegrating Comet Elenin. But, the momentum of theoretical claims is not easily overcome. When Borrelly's surface was found to be hot and dry, astronomers were not dissuaded from theoretical assumptions. Water must be emitted by the comet, even if not a trace is observed on the nucleus, not even at the very places where the jets erupt from the surface. "We know the ice is there. It's just well-hidden." But the mystery of missing water need not haunt comet scientists if they will question their theoretical assumption that water is necessary to create cometary displays. There's more to this mystery than common theory has even considered. Astronomers assure us that abundant water is detected in the luminous comas of comets. But this is where the real mystery begins. Cometary comas exhibit the hydroxyl radical O(sup)H. O(sup)H is not water (H²O), but just one hydrogen atom bound to one oxygen atom. Hydroxyl radicals can be produced from water molecules by photo-dissociation. When a photon of a ultra violet light from the Sun strikes a water molecule, it can break the bond holding a hydrogen proton to the oxygen atom. If one of the hydrogen nuclei breaks free from the water molecule, what is left is the hydroxy radical and a freely moving hydrogen proton or positively charged ion. What comet scientists believe they see is water released from the comet's nucleus breaking down to produce the hydroxyl radical. They don't see the water itself, but that's how a theory interprets the presence of O(sup)H in cometary comas. And, it does seem reasonable. Except perhaps for the missing water on the nucleus, and one additional mystery - the much greater accumulation of hydrogen than of O(sup)H in the comas of comets. These great envelopes of fluorescing hydrogen - entirely out of proportion to the presence of O(sup)H - suggest that something is happening around the nucleus of comets that the theorists have yet to comprehend. More than 25-years ago, scientists examining the Comet Tago-Sato-Kosaka noted the problem: the ratio of O(sup)H to hydrogen was clearly too low if the original source was water. "...Cometary scientists need to consider more carefully whether H2O-ice really does constitute a major fraction of comet nuclei." Here is a fact that has yet to enter official discourses on comet science. There is a simple and direct way to produce the hydroxyl radical in abundance, and it does not require water at all. Laboratory experiments by Nobel laureate Hannes Alfvén have shown that silicates, when bombarded by protons, produce abundant hydroxyl and other species found in cometary comas - with no prior involvement of water. "[The experiments] resulted in a substantial yield of hydroxyl ions and also hydroxyl ion complexes." The experimental evidence points directly to charged particles from the Sun, not light, and it directs us to the negative charge of the comet nucleus. The evidence for negatively charged comet nuclei has been with us for decades, since the Giotto spacecraft encountered Comet Halley in March 1986, discovering in the coma of Halley the negative ions prohibited by prior comet theory. "As negative ions are easily destroyed by solar radiation at ~ 1 AU, an efficient production mechanism, so far unidentified, is required to account for the observed densities." In the electric model, comets on elongated orbits pick up negative charge while far from the Sun. As they move into the Sun's positively charged environment electric discharge is the predictable effect. Electric discharge machining of the nucleus sputters negatively charged oxygen atoms from the surface. These negative ions then combine at some distance from the nucleus with solar wind protons to form the O(sup)H radicals so prevalent in the coma. Numerous variations in the electrochemistry of the coma are certain to follow and such reactions would be expected, even when no water is present on the comet nucleus. The hydroxyl radical may not mean what astronomers have routinely assumed. High Energy Emissions The electrical interpretation places a new light on the surprising high-energy emissions of comets. It was only as astronomers began to view comets beyond the spectrum of visible light, that they discovered the massive envelopes and more energetic emissions, including not just ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet light but X-ray emissions, as well. In common human experience, ultraviolet light means an electrical event. It can be a natural emission of glow discharge, or arcing, in ultraviolet lamps and mercury vapor lamps. In intense electric arcs, UV emissions are always involved. That's why arc welders wear their protective masks, to shield their eyes from the ultraviolet emissions. To explain these surprising levels of UV emission, astronomers envisioned atoms of the coma reflecting, or re-radiating, UV light from the Sun. But, if comets are electric discharge phenomena, their remarkable glow and ultraviolet wavelengths could well be a new window to discovery. Surprising Energies of Comet X-Rays Recent telescopic explorations of space far beyond our own planetary system have revealed pervasive, explosive X-ray emissions, the one thing never expected in supposedly electrically neutral space. X-rays are close to the most energetic forms of light, well beyond the visible spectrum, with exceedingly short wavelengths. These emissions are created when high speed electrons, moving at millions of miles per hour, release energy when striking an atom or their course is rapidly altered by a magnetic field. Because of the energies involved in generating X-rays, only the rarest astronomer expected X-ray emissions from comets due entirely to reflection of diffuse X-rays from an external source, the Sun. "We had no clear expectation that comets shine in X-rays." One of the great discoveries in comet science came quite by accident on March 27th, 1996. That's when the ROSAT satellite detected highly energetic X-ray emissions from the Comet Hyakutake - far beyond any astronomers expectations. "[Astronomers] were shocked by what they saw. ROSAT images revealed a crescent-shaped region of S-ray emission around the comet 1000 times more intense than anyone had predicted!" In the sciences an event a 1000 times more energetic than expected is a call to reconsider theoretical assumptions. In July 2000, when the Comet Linear disintegrated explosively, the Chandra Observatory confirmed profuse X-rays. In recent years it's become clear that X-ray emissions from comets are business as usual for these bodies. But why? All theorists acknowledge that an electrical event is occurring, but the meaning of the event - the relationship between cause and effect - needs to be made more explicit. The electric comet model explains this occurrence by a strong electric field across the comet's plasma sheath. The sheath surrounds the negatively charged comet and isolates it from the more positively charged environment of the Sun. Where the sheath is most compressed in the sunward direction, it's not surprising that the electric field is strong enough to accelerate charged particles to X-ray energies. Without that electric field, nothing dramatic would occur. That's why in the debris cloud of the disintegrating Comet Linear, we saw intense X-ray emission from the sunward face of the cloud. The emissions occurred at the interface of the cometary coma with the more positively charged solar wind. The electric comet model predicts that all active comets will produce X-ray emissions. "We now recognize that X-ray emission is a characteristic of all active comets." In an electric field the required electron speed can be achieved almost instantly. This fact was discovered over a century ago when Wilhelm Röntgen produced X-rays in his use of a Crookes tube. Both, X-ray production and the fluorescence of neutral hydrogen around comets, are readily explained by simple electrical events. Attempts to explain such behavior of comets in an electrically neutral environment will always require hypothetical effects more energetic than the conjectured cause. Deep Impact The single most critical test of the electric comet model came on July 4th, 2005. That was when NASA's Deep Impact probe fired an 800 pound copper projectile at the nucleus of comet Tempel 1. Cameras on the probe recorded the event. And even the projectile itself contained a camera to transmit data up to the moment of impact. As early as 2001, looking ahead to this event electrical theorist Wallace Thornhill began registering his expectations of surprises in store for comet science. On the evening of July 3rd, 2005, the day before the encounter, the Thunderbolts website published the explicit predictions of Thornhill and his colleagues. These predictions would highlight the contrast between the standard and the electric comet models. "Advocates of the Electric Universe expect a 'shock to the system' with revolutionary implications. They say that a comet is not a primordial object left over from the formation of the solar system." As the Deep Impact probe approached Tempel 1, key NASA figures gathered in the control room. The comet was racing toward the probe with some 23,000 miles per hour when the probe launched its copper impactor toward the nucleus. If the comet was electrically charged, how would the electronics of the impactor respond to the electric field? "Electrical interactions with Deep Impact may be slight, but they should be measurable if NASA will look for them... Electrical stress may short out the electronics on board the impactor before impact." For most of its journey, the impactor's signal was clear. But in the final seconds the signal was indeed disrupted. This apparent electrical disturbance was not all that Thornhill predicted. Also noteworthy was his expectation of an advanced flash ahead of the projectile's impact. "The most obvious would be a flash (lightning-like discharge) shortly before impact." This is exactly what occurred. The advanced flash left NASA scientists scratching their heads. "What you see is something really surprising. First, there is a small flash, then there's a delay, then there's a big flash and the whole thing breaks loose." NASA scientists involved in the Deep Impact Mission were well aware of the kinetics of impact explosions. But would the projectile be striking a solid icy surface or a more loose aggregation of snowy fluff? What they did not anticipate, but the electric model explicitly predicted, was a major contribution from the electrical energy of the comet. The explosion would therefore be greater than any NASA scientist envisioned while working with electrically neutral conditions. "More energy will be released than expected because of the electrical contributions of the comet." It seems that the spectacular explosion that followed the impact was the greatest surprise. Every scientist viewing the live images expressed his astonishment. "How did we make such a big splash?" "I'm at a loss to explain it." The scientists had expected to peer into a deep hole in a cometary "dirty snowball" before the Deep Impact vehicle was too far away. But the erupting cloud of silicate dust was so thick and the explosion so sustained that it completely obscured the local terrain. To the electrical theorists the exploding cloud was a predictable effect. "The impact/electrical discharge will be into rock, not loosely consolidated ice and dust." Fortunately, the Swift satellite provided a view of the comet explosion not just in visible light but in UV wavelengths which often give the best pointers to electrical events. "Swift scientists have seen a quick and dramatic rise in ultra violet light, evidence that the Deep Impact probe struck a hard surface, as opposed to a softer, snowy surface." The ultraviolet emissions required temperatures of over 3,000ºF. The temperatures of the last will explain why the initial eruption saturated the sensors on the Deep Impact probe. Calculations based on pixel saturation indicated a minimum initial temperature of the flash at almost 6,000ºF. Though, saturation means the temperature could have been much higher. Still Looking for Water The first purpose of the Deep Impact Mission was to excavate the envisioned subsurface water ice. But electrical theorists have consistently predicted little or no water on most comet nuclei. "An abundance of water on or below the surface of the nucleus is unlikely." Nothing approaching the expected levels of water was detected. Absence of volatiles as a dominant factor can only mean that something is fundamentally wrong in standard comet theory. "The material that came out was a surprise to scientists: a cloud of fine powdery material emerged, not the water, ice and dirt that were expected." "Theories about the volatile layers below the surface of the short-period comets are going to have to be revised." The last resort in the search for water was the effort to identify the vents from which, according to popular theory, pressurized gases were escaping at the extraordinary velocities of Tempel 1's observed jets. The vents were never found. "It has proven difficult to identify specific landforms that can be identified as the ‘vents’ discussed for many decades in classical comet literature, as it is difficult to locate them on Borrelly and Wild 2." When viewed through the lens of standard theory, some predictions of the electric model could only appear absurd. Thornhill anticipated that the locations of the comet jets could actually shift as charge re-distribution occurred on the nucleus after a significant electrical event. "The discharge and/or impact may initiate a new jet on the nucleus and could even abruptly change the positions and intensities of other jets due to the sudden change in charge distribution on the comet nucleus." Confirmation of this prediction came from the Nordic Optical Telescope in La Palma, Spain. As released by the observatory two images of the comet before impact and hours later tell the story emphatically. 15 hours after the blast, new jets appeared far from the location of the impact itself. Surface Features The Deep Impact Mission promised to give us the best images ever of a comet nucleus. On the eve of the impact, the Thunderbolts group stated the electrically predicted surface features in no uncertain terms. "The model predicts a sculpted surface, distinguished by sharply defined craters, valleys, mesas, and ridges—the opposite of the softened relief expected of a sublimating 'dirty snowball'." The surface of Tempel 1 astonished the experts. Expansive mesas and steep vertical ridges did not belong on a comet. And the presence of craters sparked a debate that continues today. Fortunately, scientists had an opportunity for a second look at Tempel 1. After the Stardust Mission to Comet Wild 2 that probe was re-directed to the object of the Deep Impact Mission. Stardust was then renamed NExt or New Exploration of Tempel 1. It would give additional views of the comet's surface. Arrival of Stardust/NExT With the arrival of the NExT probe, old mysteries only grew more perplexing, leaving scientists to debate the contradictions of theory. Even the scalloping of mesa walls and nearly vertical ridges, something we've mentioned so often in connection with electric discharge machining, was duly noted by NASA scientists. "The image reveals topographic features, including ridges, scalloped edges and possibly impact craters formed long ago." At least 60 craters were counted, though collisions along the comets path would be exceedingly rare, if occurring at all. And the surfaces of active comets are rapidly eroded. Far too rapidly to preserve a record of rare impacts across geologic time scales. In fact, most astronomers now reject explanation by impact and that includes Michael O'Hearn the Principal investigator of the Deep Impact Mission. "Another process must account for the depressions, according to Michael A'Hearn." What, then, was responsible for the pervasive cratering of the Tempel 1 surface? Laboratory experiments have shown that entire fields of craters are readily produced by electric arcs to a negatively charged surface. Nothing observed on cometary nuclei has contradicted the electrical interpretation. Surface Arcing Here is the most fundamental question one could ask about active comets: is electric arcing occurring at the surface? If so, should we not see this arcing where there is sufficient camera resolution? We have a good example in the energetic plumes of Jupiter's moon Io, where the sensors of the Galileo probe were saturated by apparent electric arcs, producing blotches of whiteout. A second example came with the Stardust Mission and the appearance of small saturation points on the surface of comet Wild 2 - but with insufficient resolution to make a definitive case for what the electrical theorists suspected. The enigmatic whiteouts on the active surface of Tempel 1 were everything the electrical theorists could have asked for. And the most prominent were placed exactly where the electric model envisions them. Eroding the cliffs of mesa walls and extending the floors of numerous craters and depressions. And yet these extensive blotches of whiteout, are receiving occasional comments from the specialists, have yet to provoke any deeper curiosity as to their cause. View from impactor But now, with a second look at Tempel 1, we can contrast the surface activity of the comet under two different circumstances. Deep Impact occurred just one day before the comet reached perihelion or its closest approach to the Sun. But the Stardust NExT Mission arrived 34 days after perihelion, as the comet retreated from the Sun, and the electrical activity of the Sun itself was far below its activity at the time of Deep Impact. On July 2nd, 2005, two-and-a-half days before Deep Impact the Space Weather website reported a remarkable surge in sunspot apparent a direct indicator of surging solar activity. "What a difference a few days makes. Three days ago, the sun was almost blank, now it's peppered with sunspots." An active Sun versus a quiet Sun. For Tempel 1, this means different levels of proton bombardment a couple a days after the ejected particles left the solar surface. The contrast is remarkable. The more active comet presents an abundance of whiteouts. The less active almost none. NASA scientists originally estimated that the Tempel 1 nucleus lost about a third of a meter in depth with each orbit. But the electric model emphasizes selective and focused excavation. The new look at Tempel 1 showed that the most prominent mesa cliff had been dramatically excavated. The mesa was an estimated 15 meters high, and it had retreated some 50 meters. The most dramatic change on Tempel 1 occurred precisely where the pixel saturation was the most dense. The only remaining plausible explanation for pixel saturation on the more active comet is electrical erosion. NASA scientists also say that existing craters were extended between the two visits. Three craters close to the dominant mesa had been further excavated to form a single trench. Electric arcs extend crater floors and erode the ridges of mesas and elevated terrain. The typical signature of both is the scalloping effect of rotating arcs. And it is no surprise to the electrical theorists that these processes energize a comet's jets. In fact, almost all of the jets of Tempel 1, when captured in its less active phase are said to have emanated from the erosion of a prominent scalloped cliff. Selective erosion is a trademark of the electric discharge machining. "Most of the jets observed during the SN flyby can be traced back to an apparently eroding terraced scarp." Deep Impact Crater Before the Deep Impact projectile was fired at the comet, scientists were confident they would strike a dirty, snowy surface, penetrating well below the surface to excavate deep material. That's how the mission would expose the primordial stuff of comet creation. What would this deep crater look like? Of course, if the projectile struck a rock are discharged above the surface in an electrical event, the target area might look a lot different. Then the removed material would be silicate dust and debris but with very little penetration beneath the surface. "The impact/electrical discharge will be into rock, not loosely consolidated ice and dust. The impact crater will be smaller than expected." To facilitate the investigation after a sub-surface explosion, the Deep Impact probe targeted the space between two well identified craters. So, in return to Tempel 1, mission scientists knew exactly where to look. But almost nothing could be seen and certainly there was no resemblance to the deep crater the scientists had envisioned. "There was a surprise in the sense that you could have expected a crater that was very well defined." To identify the crater location, the scientists published a view of the region with the circle of arrows around the impact site. How are we to understand the absence of a deep crater? "The images did not show much of a crater. The scientists say they believe the debris blown into air settled right back down." On this question, the investigation appeared to move into weird in theory defying science, a typical comet's gravity is perhaps one billionth that of Earth. Mere walking speed would be sufficient to escape the nucleus altogether. How would accepted theory allow material exploding from the comet at thousands of miles per hour to return to it's finite point of departure and to refill the crater? "It appears that the crater partly healed itself." Energetic Coma Activity A key to our understanding in the Deep Impact events is water production in the coma of an active comet. Abundant water or hydroxyl in the coma of Tempel 1 was readily confirmed, though NASA investigators saw only trivial levels of water on the surface. Patches of surface water in false color "What is significant is that the extent of this ice on Tempel 1’s surface is not sufficient to produce the observed abundance of water and its by-products in the comet’s coma." According to the scientific reports, the observed jet and coma activity of the comet would require 200 times more exposed water ice on the surface then was actually detected. This fact could only accentuate the absence of any vents to the previously supposed pressure chambers beneath the surface. No theoretically acceptable cause could be found for the energies of the comet jets. And nothing was observed that could account for the abundant hydroxyl or water in the coma. But this dilemma is removed by the electric comet model. The model explains the absence of water, the energies of the jets and the absence of vents to subsurface chambers. And the presence of hydroxyl and water in the coma, but not as a general rule on the surface or beneath the surface, is a prediction of the electric model. "Negative oxygen ions from cathodic etching of rock minerals in the nucleus will combine with protons from the solar wind to form water in the coma and tail." The evidence points to high-energy electrical exchange, electrically sputtered silicates from a negatively charged comet nucleus transacting with the charged particles of the solar wind. Water production through the electrochemistry of charge redistribution. The paradox of trivial surface ice on Tempel 1 then finds a coherent explanation. "The particle size of the water ice, is greater than the icy grains in the coma and is probably recondensed onto the comet's surface." The surface ice was produced electrically in the coma. Meager amount of this water ice later drifted from the coma to the surface, condensing as a few shallow patches of frost. Scattered frost seen in false color It's the hydroxyl radical that gives us the persuasive answer. Investigators thought they saw an injection of water into the coma from the nucleus several days after the eruption of dust had returned to normal. But that conclusion arose from an unsupported assumption. Based on data from the Swift satellite, investigators from the UK and US reported a spectacular increase in water content within the coma. But that increase did not begin until five days after Deep Impact. When the normal production of 16,000 tons per day increased by at least 250%, continuing for five more days. "After the Deep Impact probe hit the comet, this rate increased to 40,000 tonnes per day of the period 5-10 days after impact." As reported the rise in water content of the coma all occurred with no increase in dust content. No increase in dust. That's the fact that precludes the investigators interpretation, comet outbursts are never dust-free. In electrical terms the rapid increase in hydroxyl or water would predictably come days after Deep Impact. And this is why the comets X-ray emissions continued to grow. Above the nucleus, highly energetic explicitly electrical events created a flood of X-ray emission. And water of the coma was the by-product of that electrical exchange not the cause. A reconsideration of water production and it's direct link to a comet's X-ray production is now essential. In fact the contribution of charged particles from the Sun to comet activity is now acknowledged. It happened in 2012 when the distinguished Russian astronomer Subhon Ibadov´s paper appeared in the Journal "Advances in Space Research". Prof. Ibadov's paper described a comet nucleus responding to charged particles from the Sun. His calculated capacitor like discharges or equivalent to observed energies of comet flaring in ground-based observations of comets. Now that the door has been opened to discussion of the Sun's electrical role in comet discharging, how long can that role be overlooked in comet investigations? The Message of Deep Impact Taken as a whole the message of Deep Impact is remarkably consistent. But why did the crucial findings all come as a surprise to comet scientists? And what does it mean that these surprises were the explicit predictions of the electric model? Deep Impact provided us with a stunning confirmation of the electric comet, confirming as well the larger electrical environment of the Sun. Converging evidence from every line of investigation makes clear that the space sciences will be forever changed. Comet Hartley 2 Perhaps no flyby of a comet produced more instant surprises than the visit to Comet Hartley 2 in early November 2010. It was achieved by the original Deep Impact probe, subsequently renamed EPOXI, for its encounters with Hartley 2. Even the shape of the comet caught investigators by surprise. The awkward bookends are double-lobes made no sense. Astronomers likened it to a pickle, a peanut, a dog bone and a bowling pin. Why would accretion of a dirty snowball or icy dirtball from the homogeneous primordial cloud produce such a remarkable configuration? Standard accretion theories never envisioned anything of this sort. The theories always claimed that comets preserved the original raw material out of which the Sun and planets slowly accreted over billions of years. Hartley 2 revealed a split personality. Astronomers were in disbelief when they discovered that the two lobes exhibited radically different compositions. That finding flatly excluded prior assumptions and eliminated the imagined Oort cloud of earlier theory. One end of the comet was highly active and the other much less so. But why? "We have a very heterogeneous nucleus. The lobes are different." "How you'd get what looks like a volatile-rich object linked up to a volatile-poor object is a bit of a puzzle." The primary outgassing of Hartley 2 was coming from the smaller lobe. Astronomers were forced to a highly incongruous conclusion - that the two end-pieces of the comet formed separately in much different regions of the solar system. And here again, we meet undeniable evidence of a common history for planets and comets, both forming from well-differentiated materials in the habitable zone of the Sun. "The ingredients for both comets and planets must have been mixed up early on in the formation of our solar system. Without this mixing, comets would have more homogenous composition." A collision of two comets in the vastness of the heliosphere would involve the most extreme improbabilities. And, if two small comets originated in much different regions of the solar system, how likely would be a merging by gentle collision? "We are speculating that this means that the two lobes of the comet formed in different places in the Solar System. They came together in a gradual collision..." Hartley 2: Enigmatic “Waist” The strangely smooth "waist" of Hartley 2, seems to have invited extreme speculations from NASA scientists. A comet just a mile wide would have no appreciable gravity. But could gravity have, nevertheless, guided dust from the ends of the comet toward the waist? "We think the waist is a deposit of material from other parts of the comet, our first evidence of redistribution on a comet." "Material coming off the ends of the comet then falls back into the lowest point, the waist." The electric model does not force scientists to such conjectural extremes. The electrostatic deposition is well established in environments of electric discharge. High-Energy Jets The spectacular jet activity of Hartley 2 continues to haunt comet scientists. Jets erupted from the sunward face of the comet but could also be seen exploding from regions in shadow with the same force as those exposed to sunlight. "We have jets in the night time, we have jets along the edge, we have jets in the sun...We have a lot of work to do to try and understand what’s going on here." What was driving the velocities of Hartley 2's jets? Traditional theory has always explained cometary jets through both surface and subsurface warming. Surface sublimation in areas of brightness or exposure to the Sun alone would not be sufficient to drive the high-speed jets. Subsurface pressure chambers are a requirement. Investigators found that dust and carbon dioxide were being emitted by the comet in consistent proportions. This led them to the conclusion that CO₂ pressures building up in chambers beneath the surface were driving the explosive jets and in the process carrying dust along with them. Fortunately, Hartley 2 investigators could trace the jets to topographical features. But these features did not include the expected openings to subsurface chambers. Without the required pressures, the acceleration of material away from the comet would have no identifiable cause. In the vacuum of space, a mere surface response to light from the Sun would involve virtually no pressure all. "The real surprise was that the [surface] brightness was sufficient to do that... Putting it together is something we’re struggling with." The Cyanide Anomaly Here is a remarkable fact reported by NASA investigators in September 2010. Prior to the arrival of EPOXI, Hartley 2 produced an immense cloud of cyanide or CN gas. The explosive increase in cyanide occurred over a little more than a week, an event investigators dubbed the "CN anomaly". "We don’t know why the amount [of CN] coming off the comet changed so drastically for a short period of time. We’ve never seen anything like this before." Typically, during the ebb and flow of a comet's activity, we see a consistent proportion of removed dust to the gases emitted. But the EPOXI probe detected no dust increase at all. "In other cases where a comet has had a big outburst, a lot of dust has been released at the same time. But in this case, the amount of dust did not change, yet the CN gas abundance exploded." Equally stunning was the fact that the cyanide increase did not show up in the comet's jets, though this is exactly where one would look to identify a source if this source was, in fact, on the nucleus. "If observers monitoring Hartley 2 do not take into account this new phenomenon, they could easily get the wrong picture of how the comet is changing." Is it possible that the cyanide abundance did not originate from the surface but from the electrochemical activity in the coma? Could electrical exchange between a highly active comet and charged particles from the Sun resolve the mystery of cyanide production? To clarify this issue, we consulted with Dr. Franklin Anariba, an electrochemical researcher and lecturer at the Singapore University of Technology and Design. Dr. Anariba agreed to explore the question, and we subsequently invited him to present his findings at the recent Thunderbolts Project™ conference in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In his investigation, Dr. Anariba found that electrochemical events could account for several key features of comets. These would include: plasma generation in the coma, the observed hydrogen gas cloud surrounding the comas of comets, dust tail formation, the ionized plasma tails of comets, and gas production within the comas. Electrochemistry requires a voltage difference. And the coma of Hartley 2 was well suited for the electrical production of water, cyanide and a good deal more. As for cyanide, the confirmed presence of methane and of ammonia would be quite sufficient. Add electric discharge and cyanide WOULD be the byproduct. Hartley 2 is a hyperactive comet with a continuing potential for surprises and anomalies to standard comet science. But, when is a mystery really a mystery, and when does it mean the breakdown of an onboard instrument? As pointed out to us by Dr. Anariba, NASA investigators recently announced that the so-called CN anomaly was actually an instrument failure. It appears that no further analysis of the claimed failure has been made public. Did an instrument really fail to perform properly, or did speculation take over when the standard theory could not account for a recorded event? Either way, the electrochemistry of cyanide production in the comas of comets is a crucial issue that must be explored. The Mystery of Exploding Comets December 2010. Russian astronomer Leonid Elenin announces the discovery of a new comet roughly 400 million miles from Earth. Calculations show that the comet, moving on a highly eccentric orbit, will intersect the orbit of the Earth. Based on the size if it's coma, most astronomers viewed the comet as typical and unexceptional, suggesting a body two or three miles wide. But the projected earth-crossing orbit sparked an outburst of Internet rumors and Doomsday predictions. Most remarkable were the suggestions that the comet was a rogue planet, and claims that it would profoundly disturb the Earth, causing earthquakes, or a shifting of the poles, and even the end of the world. Respected astronomers were dismayed. How could such scientific illiteracy attract millions of viewers to Internet articles and videos? Experts reminded us of the trivial mass of a comet just 2-3 miles (3-5km) wide, passing millions of miles from Earth. "Just driving to work every day in my subcompact car is going to have far more of a gravitational effect on Earth than this comet ever will." The Surprise As it turned out, what actually happened to Elenin posed a profound mystery for comet science. In the summer of 2011, Elenin grew brighter than expected, and astronomers began to anticipate a respectable show. But, the situation changed when a powerful coronal mass ejection erupted from the Sun. On August 19th, the CME struck the Comet Elenin. The comet flared brightly, appearing to disintegrate explosively followed by rapidly dimming before it was visually lost against the glare of the Sun. On October 24th 2011, only days after the expected closest approach to Earth Italian astronomers captured the remains of Elenin on film. An extremely faint and diffuse cloud of dust was all that could be seen. How did the disintegration and virtual disappearance of Elenin occur? The answer appears to lie in the role of charged particles in an electrical event. When the charged particles of a coronal mass ejection struck the Comet Elenin, the oppositely charged nucleus could not withstand the electrical stresses. It disintegrated like an exploding capacitor. The electrical theorists assure us that comets are not what we are taught in school. No practical experiment ever demonstrated that a dirty chunk of ice would disintegrate explosively under gentle warming from the Sun. The explosive demise of comets cannot be due to solar heating. In fact, eruptions and comet disintegration have occurred in regions so remote from the Sun that warming is not even a factor. We saw one of the most improbable flarings in the case of Comet Halley, a regular visitor to the inner solar system. In 1991, 5 years after Halley's closest approach to the Sun, it was well beyond the orbit of Uranus, where temperatures hover around minus 330ºF. Then, it erupted, producing a dust cloud a 180,000 miles (289,682km) across. "The cloud was more than 1,000 times brighter than the comet was supposed to be at that distance. To have something turn off and suddenly brighten at that distance is unheard of." "It is not a simple matter to explain the outburst." If thermal stresses are excluded, it seems that only one consideration remains. Shortly after the Halley outburst, a few astronomers began to wonder: could charged particles from the Sun be a factor? At the time, solar wind activity had peaked at a higher level than had been seen in decades. Then, two astronomers observed that the charged particles of a powerful solar flare on January 31 would have likely reached Halley around February 12, the date of the outburst. The coincidence of the outburst with that arrival seemed too great to dismiss. "A kick from the solar wind is the cause of the Comet Halley’s February 1991 flare." Could electrical events be the key to comet outbursts and fragmentation? To this day, astronomers have no explanation for the sudden and spectacular brightening of Comet Holmes in 2007. It had been moving rapidly away from the Sun for about five months when it's coma size suddenly grew by a factor of a million, making it even larger than the Sun. "We have guesses, but we don’t yet understand what happened." "This is really a remarkable event. We're at a loss." Was it a coincidence that just two days before the comets display, there was a sharp spike in the output of the solar wind? In the electrical view, this sudden arrival of charged particles from the Sun will explain what otherwise would have no known cause. Electrical surges and capacitor breakdowns go together. High-tech image processing later showed that the nucleus of Holmes had broken apart with many fragments contributing to its brightening, confirming a general pattern. Comets flare brightly when breaking apart. In 1976, Comet West brightened greatly in a series of outbursts, perhaps a dozen or so, then shocked astronomers by breaking into fragments. Warming by the Sun is not a reasonable explanation of such events. When Comet Wirtanen fragmented in 1957, it was just inside the orbit of icy Saturn. Much the same occurred in the case of Comet Biela/Bambert. "Most of the comets observed to split have done so for no obvious reason." "We still do not know why comets split. The problem is left unsolved." More than once, comets have broken up at their greatest distances from the Sun, well beyond the orbit of Neptune, and when break up occurs the fragments have separated at inexplicably high velocities. Mainstream theory has no explanation for the energies driving such events. "One really does require an explanation when the velocity of separation is some 20% of the velocity of the comet itself!" The progressive disintegration of the Comet Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 beginning in 1995 left astronomers grasping for answers. Though 150 million miles away, it brightened spectacularly, shining hundreds of times more brightly than expected. Then, astronomers discovered that the comet had broken into at least four pieces. Then in 2006, the Hubble Space Telescope captured the spectacular disintegration of the comet in progress while it was still out beyond Earth's orbit. It was then clear that the comet had broken into more than three dozen fragments as house sized chunks of the comet appeared to disintegrate completely, some within the span of a single day. Remarkably similar to the fate of Elenin, was the explosive demise of the Comet Linear in July 2000. Like Elenin, Linear entered the inner solar system from its outermost regions on a highly eccentric orbit. For the electrical theorists, that means a maximum change in the electrical environment. As it approached it's perihelion, some 70 million miles (112 million km) from the Sun, it flared, then rapidly disintegrated. The disintegration of Linear provides a strong parallel to the story of Elenin. The tear-drop form of the flare and the relationship of the flare to disintegration are virtually identical. All that was left of Linear was a cloud of dust. The expected abundance of water was simply not there. And what of Elenin? As reported by Leonid Elenin himself, the expected water vapor was missing. "American radio astronomers report they did not detect water coming from any remains of Comet Elenin." If charged particles from the Sun are triggers for outbursts or disintegration of comets, the behavior of these bodies has almost nothing to do with relative masses, or surface temperatures, and everything to do with the electric force. Is it possible that one question could remove the anomalies? That one answer could explain the flaring, the fragmentation and the catastrophic demise of these cosmic intruders? When Planets Gave Birth to Comets In the Electric Universe view of comets, these bodies were excavated from planetary surfaces in an epoch of cosmic violence. From this vantage point, even asteroids and meteors originated in the same or similar events. Electrical theorists have gathered many volumes of evidence to show that planets once moved on much different courses than today. In violent encounters, planets were immersed in electric discharge as stupendous arcs passed between these charge bodies. Electric arcs acting on planetary surfaces and on the resulting dense clouds of dust and debris fused material into the unique shapes of comets and asteroids, including the double-lobed forms often observed. Was Comet Hartley 2 fused into its odd shape by electric discharge? In one of the first electrical experiments by plasma scientists, C.J. Ransom, the fusing of surface material produced a near-perfect replica of Hartley 2's unique morphology. The only appreciable difference was in the relative sizes of granular material, as we'd expect. Could this remarkable similarity be merely accidental? At Hartley 2's smaller end, mission scientists observed what they called "shiny clumps", or "cubicles", reaching up to 16 stories tall. They were not just oddly configured, they were two or three times more reflective than other surface materials. But, look again at the Hartley 2 counterpart produced in Dr. Ransom's experiments. Here we see materials fused electrically into shiny more reflective clumps, giving us the very answer that NASA scientists missed. Fusing of material into glassified texture will multiply reflectivity. "These are spectacular features, but at this point we don’t know whether these are deposits or growths, or something else." The Electric Comet Questioning the core assumptions of popular science And so, the mysteries of comets deepen. And the most urgent need is to reconsider the nature of comets as a whole. It seems that anomalies are just too easily ignored or forgotten. But recurring anomalies can be the door to discovery. What better way to move science forward that to ask the question: what is a comet? "Every time we look we find our textbooks were wrong." Popular astronomy has long imagined the comets to be dirty chunks of ice moving through electrically neutral space. But, a growing number of electrical experts see comets as charged bodies responding electrically as they move more deeply into the electric field of the Sun. One question leads inexorably to another. How are comets formed? What holds the spherical coma in place against the force of the solar wind? How are the long filamentary tails created and maintained in the extreme vacuum of space? What force creates and confines the powerful collimated jets from the nucleus? What is the source of the intensely energetic X-ray emissions? Spacecraft have now visited a half-dozen comets, and popular theory cannot withstand the surprises that followed. "Comets are perhaps at once the most spectacular and the least well understood members of the solar system." "It’s a mystery to me how comets work at all." The collapse of theory began with the visit to Comet Halley, and the discovery of forbidden negative ions close to the coma of the comet. Astronomers were stunned to find that the bone-dry surface of Borrelly was the opposite of the "dirty snowball" expected. Then the foundations of the Oort cloud theory were overthrown by a series of discoveries beginning with the recovery of comet dust from Wild 2. The dust could not be distinguished from the diverse materials of planets in the habitable zone of the Sun. In 2005, we fired a projectile into the nucleus of Comet Tempel 1. The outcome of that comet visit contradicted every theorist's expectations while confirming the explicit predictions of the electric comet model. Disruption of radio signals from the impactor, the advanced flash, the astonishing energies of the impact explosion, the sharply carved surface of the nucleus, direct evidence of surface arcing, the changing jet positions, the overwhelming dominance of dust, not water, in the immediate explosion. Then, we returned to the comet in 2011, and found that the excavation of mesas and ridges on the nucleus had occurred exactly as the electric model has long claimed. We visited the highly active Comet Hartley 2 in 2010, for the electrical theorists the findings that so surprised and perplexed mission scientists were in no way surprising. The radically different composition of the two lobes of the nucleus; the jets erupting from regions in shadow; the absence of vents to the imagined subsurface pressure chambers; the smooth dust-covered waist; and the shiny cubicles on the surface; all point emphatically to the electric comet. Decades of comet exploration have now demonstrated beyond any reasonable doubt the inseparable connection of comet activity to electrical attributes of the Sun and it's domain. The erratic flaring of comets and the explosive disintegration of such bodies occur naturally in the Suns electric field and particularly in response to a sudden increase in charged particles ejected by the Sun. Nor can comet science afford to ignore the experimental evidence. Most significantly the ability of the electric arcs to create the extraordinary morphologies of comet nuclei and their cousins, asteroids. Our understanding of comets is already and forever changed. And this new perspective does not stop with comets. Verification of the electric comet, will eventually touch everything we thought we knew about the cosmos, about solar system history and about the history of our own planet Earth. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info In episode 2 of this presentation, Dr. Michael Clarage continues his discussion of the Earth's electrical environment and his ongoing role as a scientist on the SAFIRE Project. In episode one Dr. Clarage offered his thoughts on a recent space.com report on mysteries fluctuations of electrons in Earth's atmosphere. We ask Dr. Clarage to further explain his thoughts on the best experimental approach to investigating electrical phenomena associated with planets and stars. As the primary astrophysicist on the SAFIRE Project it's my job to design the experiments that will best allow us to explore electrical aspects of planets and stars. What might the electrical potential between a star and a planet look like. Here's one model that I am working on, the Earth is on the left the Sun on the right, that squiggle blue line represents the rough structure of electrical potential at any point between a planet and a star. Drawing is quite representational, just trying to sketch out the general shape of things. This model is based partly on experimental data from SAFIRE partly on known geophysical data and partly on NASA satellite data of the Sun and solar wind. On the left, the potential rises quickly to about 300,000 volts as you move away from the planet. This is that 'fair weather' potential I mentioned. The sawtooth squiggles as you move up are those bands of increasing and decreasing electron density mentioned in the space.com article. Then continuing to move away from the Earth we reach the Van Allen belts. The inner Van Allen belt, dominated by positive charges, is the high point of the curve, then a potential drop as you move out into the outer Van Allen belt, dominated by negative charges, then we have a long slow rise in the potential as we move towards the Sun. There is data to support a 600 volts rise in potential from the Van Allen belts to the Sun. I've spoken about that at several conferences and I'll give you the references below. Putting everything together on to one graph like this is really breaking new ground. Astrophysicists are not talking about things this way, not yet at least. This is understandable, every scientist has enough difficulty keeping up with data in their own sub-specialty. It is difficult to be combining measurements from the atmosphere, the ionosphere, Van Allen belts, interplanetary space, solar atmosphere and photosphere. And like I said, none of us on the SAFIRE team are pushing any particular model the real shape of that curve between a planet and a star might look very different from what I've drawn here. This still needs much more exploration and continued work matching SAFIRE data to NASA data, and further reinterpretation of the NASA data in an electrical context. Pictures such as these, of the overall electrical potential layers, are not yet seen in books because most astronomers have continued to assume that charge separations are not maintainable at cosmological distances. Is almost an irony to it, because my little drawing is actually the much simpler first-order effect natural in plasmas. It should have been the first thing people look for, but since planetary charge separations were not considered possible investigations were forced to look at the much more complicated second-order effects of complex magnetic fields and induced local currents. With the SAFIRE chamber, we are in a unique position to run experiments exploring the possible overall electrical nature of stars and planets. Coming back to the space.com article, I would propose that the phrase 'The case of the missing electrons' is somewhat of a misnomer. Calling them missing, implies there is something wrong about it, like an awkward glitch in what should be nature's otherwise tidy charge neutrality. I have become convinced that the whole mantra of charge neutrality is preventing us from seeing reality. Nature is almost never charge neutral, and by that I mean, if you look at anything interesting in nature, like a cell, or an organelle in a cell, or a tree, or a thunderstorm, or the Northern Lights, nature is always separating charges. Inside our cells all the workings of life are powered by charge separations across chloroplasts and mitochondria membranes. Bees always have a greater electrical potential than flowers so there are always electrical fields connecting bees and flowers. And when a bee pollinates a flower there is a quite measurable and very exciting exchange of electric charge between the two. The more we look at what nature is actually doing, the more we see that charge neutrality seldom exists in any dynamic environment. Coming back to the ionosphere, I would say that the shells of free electrons are not missing from regions of the ionosphere. I would propose that the electrons in the ionosphere are simply arranging themselves as needed. Now, as needed for what? That's a really good question. There was another recent article, a review article that make similar mistakes, I would say, in describing large-scale electrical phenomena. This was the press release describing an unexpected Star Trek shield protecting the Earth from 'killer electrons'. Again there's an undertone like something is wrong, like the Earth should not have high energy electrons around it. Or if it does, then that somehow a scary thing. Think an analogy might help here, by way of analogy you could say that the stomach protects the rest of the body from the dangerous enzymes and acids in it. You could certainly say that, but you need to acknowledge that it's all part of a larger structure. The enzymes are needed inside the stomach for specific reasons. The high potency acids are supposed to be there, for the stomach to do its function. When it comes to studying planetary and stellar structures, it would be better if we all would broaden our thinking. We would learn much more if we came to expect that cosmological structures are performing useful functions also. For reasons that we do not yet understand the Earth is supposed to have high energy electrons around it. That is a required part of a larger structure. Just because we do not understand, does not mean it's a dangerous accident. Electrical plasmas naturally form barriers, membranes if you will, these plasma barriers, or membranes, let through some particles, but not others. We have a lot to learn about that, our theoretical understanding of all this is still very primitive, but such plasma membranes have been known about for about a hundred years. The SAFIRE team is trying to take us a step back and explore experimentally some of the basic assumptions about the electrical nature of the solar system.

You've just entered the theater of an alien sky. If the words and images seem strange to you, there's a reason for this. Our world was once a vastly different place. To experience this won't hurt you and there is nothing to fear. Symbols of the World Mountain For well over a century the documented traditions of the world mountain have invited scholarly attempts to explain them. The mountain rolls along the world axis to the visual center of the sky at the celestial pole. But do any of the proposed explanations actually work? That question can only be answered by penetrating to the core idea across a wide range of imaginative images. The celestial reference was not just seen as a mountain but as much more than that. By following the theme back to its earliest expressions, we can reconstruct the concrete celestial form beneath the full range of mythic symbols. The complex ancient images of a cosmic mountain can only find meaning in a human experience that is not occurring today. Events in the skies above our early ancestors provoked an explosion of mythic content. In its first form, human witnesses saw the great mountain as a cosmic pillar, the visual support of the sky. Its summit was the seed of a power remembered as the universal sovereign.   In the most archaic traditions, the great column served as the perch, pedestal, or resting place of the creator god himself. The ruler on the mountaintop was the primeval Sun, the central luminary of the sky, not the body we call Sun today. Ancient chronicles of kingship name this luminary as the Father of Kings, the first in the mythic line of kings, the one from whom kingship itself descended. In ancient Mesopotamia, this was the Sumerian An, the Babylonian Anu. For the Egyptians, it was Atum-Ra. For the Greeks, the god Kronos. As we've observed in earlier episodes of this series, ancient astronomical traditions identify this archaic dominating power as the planet Saturn. Our present sky is not the key to the past. Always the cosmic mountain appears as the site of mythic creation, and the mount itself is part of that creation story. Early traditions describe the mountain as a cosmic pillar, arising out of luminous ejecta that exploded from the primeval Sun as the central act of creation, a great shout producing a cloud of chaotic debris. In the archaic creation accounts, this explosive outflow was the raw material, or primeval matter, from which the unique form of creation emerged.   Human imagination interpreted this ejecta in many ways. It saw the clouds or waters of chaos, or an army of barbaric or frenzied warriors yet to be controlled. The same ejecta was seen as the creator's luminous speech. Visible words shouted into existence and gathered into concrete form, the world mountain providing the creator with the support that served as his own lower limbs. Imaginative contemporary illustration of the Primeval Hill, the Akhut The Egyptian creation account describes the appearance of the world mountain from this ejecta as a defining moment. It meant the emergence of the far-famed Primeval Hill, the Akhut. Akhut, the name itself came directly from the ejecta, called Akhu, signifying the radiant words of power erupting as the primeval shout of creation. The text recall the creator Atum or Ra alone wandering to and fro in the heavens before finding a stationary resting place. "I found no place where I could stand," the god recalls in the Egyptian creation account. "I was alone. No other worked with me." For context the words are critically important. This celestial resting place was in fact the Akhut, the world mountain. Thus, the hieroglyph for the idea "to stand" conveys the sense of support and stability. "That was before a perch had been formed for me to sit on," the god states. The perch, described by its hieroglyph, was the cosmic mountain or pillar, the very pillar that the Egyptians personified as the god Shu. It was a common Egyptian practice to place emblems of the creator on the perch sign as a testament to the critical role of Shu as the emerging pillar of the sky in the creation accounts. The equation of the god's pedestal, the Pillar of Shu, and the Mount of Creation is unequivocal in the Egyptian language. The god Osiris, enthroned upon the Primeval Hill, "was like an exalted one upon thy pedestal." And the god Anubis, the god "who is on his mountain" was called also, "the god who is on his pedestal." But the symbolism of the cosmic column ranges across many mythic interpretations. It includes the hieroglyphic image of the god Sept, a close counterpart of Shu. It includes the twin-peaked mountain, Akhut, that we previously discussed. And it includes all Egyptian words relating to the etheric wind or fountain at the region below the creator. This luminous column served as the resting place of Atum, as made clear by the coffin texts. "The Great God lives, Fixed in the middle of the sky Upon his support." This pervasive language of a cosmic pillar and resting place constitutes a profound challenge to all common assumptions about the origins of ancient thought. Egyptian creation accounts consistently refer to a time before the appearance of this resting place. But concrete translations are essential if we are to capture events seen and heard. The texts make clear that in his original condition, Atum was alone. "I was alone. I had not spit in the form of Shu, [the pillar of the sky.]" "I had not poured out Tefnut, [first form of the feminine power.]" "No other worked with me." "Then I laid the foundation with my own heart." "I poured out the primeval Akhu in the form of Shu..." The literal references is to explosive outflow, interpreted most emphatically as visible speech, called "words of power" shouted by the primeval Sun god. But the same outflow is interpreted as masculine seed, water, fire, and wind. This primeval matter, the Akhu, is always identified as the raw material of creation in events seen and heard. Though our focus here will be on the emergence of the towering column personified as the god Shu, the Egyptian priests insisted that the same explosive events gave birth to the first form of Shu's counterpart, the goddess Tefnut, appearing as the spiraling life breath of creation; a subject to which we'll devote considerable attention in due course. The creator announces: "I could find no place to stand." "Words of power came forth from my heart to lay a foundation." It was from this shout of visible words of power that the column of Shu emerged. "I am Life, the Lord of Years, living forever... the eldest one that Atum made in his words of power," the Akhu, "in giving birth to Shu." Or again Shu announces: "I came into being in the limbs of the Self-Creator." "He formed me through the activity of his heart and he created me in his words of power [the Akhu]." Any attempt to interpret the fiery words of power as an abstraction can only distort the explicit awe and terror of the human experience. The Egyptian priests clearly knew that the pillar god Shu, who held aloft the resting Atum, was the perch or pedestal upon which the creator eventually rested. So while one coffin text reads: "I'm raised aloft on my perch above yonder places of the Abyss," another speaks of the great perch: "I do not fall on account of Shu." This resting place was also called the foundation of Ma'at. A stylized glyph of Ma'at is, in fact, an image of the Primeval Hill. Often the glyph is simply read as the pedestal of the great god. In its root meaning, Ma'at denotes the stable enduring foundation, the source of cosmic regularity. The creation texts say that the creator "rests upon Ma'at." Repeatedly, we see that the concept of support or foundation merges with the mountain or hill. The word "thes," for example, means "support, to bear or lift up" but also "mountain." The reason for this is that the only mountain with which the ritual celebrations were concerned was the cosmic mountain, the foundation of heaven. One finds no exceptions to this. "May I endure in the sky like the cosmic mountain, like the primeval support," reads a hymn of the Pyramid Texts. For this celestial peak, the Egyptians continually look back in their myths and rites. On behalf of the deceased king, the priest poured a heap of sand on the floor inside the pyramid, placing atop the sand a statue of the king and reciting a prayer which began: "Rise upon it, this land which came forth from Atum... Assume your form upon it." The sand poured out meant the primeval matter and the hill so formed meant the Primeval Hill. And so, according to T. Rundle Clark, "Osiris sits in judgment in a palace in the Primeval Mound, which is the center of the world." "May I be established upon my resting place like the Lord of life," the king declares. One of the most familiar representations of the Primeval Hill is the obelisk. The small pyramidion on top of the obelisk denoted the Benben stone, the living soul of the creator, Atum. "Atum-Khepri, thou wert high as the Hill. Thou didst shine forth as Benben." Thus, the obelisk came to be employed as an idiograph for the Egyptian word "men." The word meant the "mountain" or "pedestal." But it also meant "stability" and "to rest in one place." Derived from the same root is the Egyptian word "mena" or "menat, the celestial "mooring post." The Egyptians conceived this stationary pillar as the stake around which the secondary powers of heaven revolved. That's the meaning of Mena Uret, "The Great Mooring Post," connecting the masculine post to the complementary symbolism of the mother goddess, whom we shall identify as the spiraling life breath of creation. As we delve more deeply into the symbolism, we'll return to the special nuances of the cosmic column as world axis, the post, peg, stake, nail, or anchor of creation. The distinguished authority, Henri Frankfort, understood the principle well: "Everywhere the site of creation, the first land to emerge from chaos, was thought to have been charged with vital power. And each god counting as Creator was made to have some connection with this Hill." If the significance of this idea is to truly register on human consciousness, it must be seen as something more than an obscure regional experience or abstraction. It is a worldwide memory preserved through competing imaginative interpretations all pointing back to a singular experience. 
thank you very much I'd like to begin again by expressing my honor to be here I've really met a lot of nice people so it's been a it's been a privilege to attend the conference as you remember yesterday I started my talk by speaking about anchoring so the question becomes if you're going to do physics you do have to trust the laws of physics I mean we can't just go back and recheck everything every time we do something or else physics wouldn't advance and actually some laws are almost forgotten like kirchoff's law a few people use it in astrophysics most people don't think about it at all but it's an extremely important it's it's a lot of extremely important consequences actually I as I spoke about yesterday relative to the Cosmic Microwave Background I mentioned that Penzias and Wilson are not allowed to take a temperature and the reason that they're not is that they cannot guarantee that they understand the nature of their source that it has no conduction no convection basically that the universe would be the same as the condition required by Kirchhoff's law which is thermal equilibrium with an enclosure now I have reassigned that signal to water and I've said that water has different degrees of freedom and B and its ability to contain energy in any one degree of freedom it can be vastly different so the hydrogen bond contain very little energy it's basically full right around three Kelvin and then the hydroxyl bond can take much more energy into it so that degree of freedom it can handle more energy well all materials are going to be like that real materials are going to be written aid up of real atoms that are oscillating against each one another there's going to be electrons and conduction bands valence electrons and all these things that are making up that real material are going to have different degrees of freedom and those degrees of freedom will have a different ability to take up energy now this is Kirchhoff's law is important the downfall of Kurt slaw is important because physics will start looking at materials a different way because they know that this law is no longer universal so that has implications in statistical thermodynamics now relative to the Sun it's extremely important because if kirchoff's law is not valid you can never have a gaseous Sun because a gaseous Sun uses the equations of radiative transfer and those equations all have at their source kirchoff's law of thermal emission so for instance in Mills classic paper on local thermal equilibrium he states that at the center of the Sun you can have blackbody radiation because the atoms there are colliding so quickly that you can consider things enclosed but actually he described a condition for conduction not thermal radiation so you cannot have blackbody radiation at the center of the Sun and with kirchoff's law collapsing this is the only thing that's required for the gaseous Sun to go away now of course the collapse of kirchoff's law also means that we don't have universality and this has consequences relative to our understanding of universal constants like planks and Boltzmann's and we should remember the laws of physics they summarize experimental observations if a formulation is contrary to laboratory findings it cannot continue to exist as a law of physics it is in this light the kirchoff's law can no longer hold any place in the annals of science so now that I've been so hard on for Kirchhoff I did want to say that he was still a brilliant scientist remember he's the father of spectroscopy we have spectral analysis because of him he was the first with Bunsen to analyze elements on the Sun and also we for the electrical engineers here we all know the laws of current come from him but unfortunately his law collapses and the proper law is comes from balford Stewart it was written two years before and that law is much simpler than Kirchhoff's it doesn't say that all cavities came black radiation it just says that at thermal equilibrium the emissivity of an object will be equal to its absorbed Tiffany so in this talk I'm going to review thermal emission and I'm going to give you a statement of kirchoff's law then will quickly cover Planck's equation and it's a nurse so derivation einstein's derivation I'll just glance over it no not too much time and I'll just present Wiens and Stefan's law then we'll talk about thermal emissions and gasses and solids then I will discuss briefly the experimental basis of Kirchhoff's error and then we'll talk about the central thing that comes from this talk perhaps is the linking of Planck's equation to physical reality and this has dramatic consequences for both physics and chemistry so now you'll have to excuse me when I did the slides by the way this was a last minute thing that I knew I was coming here to give this particular talk but when I made the slides I I put the diagram in wavelengths and the equations in frequency but it doesn't matter you you can just put the right diagram if you want now so Kirchhoff this is a summary of Kirchhoff's laws it whoops sorry this is a summary of Kirchhoff's law and it just says that there's some function of temperature and it depends on the image Civet ii of the body divided by its opacity or absorbed Tiffa t and so you have some function now Kirchhoff didn't really know what the function looked like back then he just knew it was a continuous spectrum but what he did believe is that this equation was universally applicable to all cavities now here's the statement of the law from his paper if a space be entirely surrounded by bodies of the same temperature so that no rays can penetrate through them every pencil in the interior of the space must be so constituted in regards to its quality and intensity as if it had proceeded from a perfectly black body of the same temperature and must therefore be independent of the form and nature of the bodies and determined by temperature alone so he's saying if I have a cavity any it doesn't matter what it's made out of the radiation inside will always be the same the interior therefore of an opaque red hot body of any temperature the illumination is always the same whatever be the constitution of the body in any other respect now Planck of course is tied to kirchoff's law as you'll see in this next slide but Planck initially writes down his blackbody equation without derivation he sees the data and by just visualizing the data he knows his equation this was a marvelous feat in physics and still is today and that's why one of the reasons that Planck's equation is called a miraculous equation quantum physics was born on that day he derives the law he he then goes ahead after he writes it down he writes it on a postcard mails it to his friend and that's how Planck's law is born he derives the he then spends many weeks deriving the law of blackbody radiation treating the problem with oscillators and then invoking quantum values for the vibrations so when you look at Planck's law you see that within it here you actually have kirchoff's law this is kirchoff's law and this is Planck's okay now there's another law that's quite important this is called Stefan's law and it this is used all the time with the astronomers they actually think that the the emissivity of a body will always move with the fourth power of the temperature well actually there's almost nothing on earth that follows this law and I will demonstrate that for you in a couple of examples and gases but anyhow just the the total emissivity so the area under the curve here is just proportional to a constant times the fourth power of the temperature okay so if you have a real black body it's truly black a perfectly absorbing cavity this will be true but other than that it's never true now we ins a lot of thermal emission can also be used and that law says that if you go to the maximum wavelength here I switch back to wavelength for the equation that the wavelength times the temperature is just equal to a constant so we won't go through Planck's derivation but I did mention to you that it used oscillators now Albert Einstein very elegantly derives Planck's equation in 1916 using a two energy system Einstein coefficients and what people often forget a radiation field which doesn't come from nowhere the physical nature of the transmission the transition species is never considered so we'll just I won't go through this too much you you just got two energy levels and you're gonna permit transitions within these levels and he considers energy going from this one to this one this one to that one so you have the rate of stimulated absorption the rate of spontaneous emission the rate of stimulated emission he puts them all together with the the Planck brightness and then he uses these coefficients and then poof plant oh and then wait a minute there's one more thing before the poof we have to use Boltzmann's distribution and then of course poof you get Planck's equation now the problem with this of course is that people often forget well people don't forget this part the critical step in the derivation was C was to include stimulated emission if this is not done you get the Rallye gene solution but Einsteins derivation also requires the presence of a radiation field from which he can deduce his coefficients and he uses Wiens blackbody approximation to characterize this the energy of this radiation field so his derivation looks very easy it's it's beautiful it's simple but of course he's introducing something for which we Ned worked very hard to obtain now here's a brief review of thermal radiation so the first thing that we have we all recognize in this room is most people in this room will recognize is that gases always emit radiation in the discontinuous matter their total emission now this is something that people don't always recognize their total emission can draw up as a function of temperature and this is in direct contradiction to Stefan's law right Stefan's law told us that the temp that the emission always moves with the fourth power of the temperature so this situation is unlike what is found in solids and liquids so gases solids and liquids tend to emit in a continuous manner I won't say that they follow Stefan's law may be an ideal solid my so when you learn spectroscopy you the hit you with this spectrum diatomic molecules the they have rotational vibrational spectra which looks something like this so you know just a bunch of lines at different frequency okay if you want to see the actual spectrum you could just go to this reference this is uh I did these figures well my son did a lot of these figures this shows you how bad I am in art and this is a figure that is my son had an exam so you couldn't help me but so this is just a schematic representation of absorption bands and for something like co2 for instance you'll have a bunch of absorption bands you know and they're they're discrete and they come down to zero and there's no there's no absorption then though there'll be another band then so you get bands that's never continuous for gas now if you look at the emissivity of carbon dioxide and now we'll look at it as a function of temperature and I'll just look at one pressure well what the log of the emissivity looks like according to Stefan's law right this should a move at the fourth power of the temperature so as the temperature went up this curve should be going up but in reality if you look at this authoritative book on radiative thermometry you'll see that the emissivity of carbon dioxide actually drops with temperature it doesn't go up and this is true at all pressures so if you go to this text you'll actually see a whole bunch of lines you know a whole bunch of lines all dropping here and each line will have that will be for a specific pressure so the emissivity of a real gas drops with temperature here's water pressure water vapor the same thing the emissivity does not follow Stefan's law for a gas the emissivity drops with temperature and again you can have a whole bunch of lines here and each at a different partial pressure of a water pressure vapor pressure now how about solids solids emit radiation in a continuous manner their total emission usually does not follow Stefan's law except in the crudest sense in materials like graphite soot or other near ideal absorbers in all other cases the behavior of the emission as a function of temperature is highly erratic and polished metals tend to have a low emissivity value now this is important for the people looking at the Sun because sunspots have low emissivity and that is just a related to their high ability to conduct so different materials if I say okay I'm going to have different solids well the way that the light looks like is all going to be different each material is going to have is going to give you a different spectrum okay so different materials emit light with varying features which change as a function of temperature so what are we describing here an absolute mess right nothing is universal here all materials are different right so how did Kirchhoff come to tell us that things were universal if you look at the spectrum of aluminum oxide powders or silicon oxide powders you'll get spectra that look like this whereas some free at some wavelengths there's essentially knowing it nice and then they'll come up and wow they have almost perfect immittance over a very small range okay but this is not a blackbody spectrum so materials real materials really vary look at graphite of course I made this slide myself again now if you look at graphite for instance okay you'll see that even when I talk I said well graphite we can treat it as a perfect absorber or a perfect emitter and actually it's true at some wavelengths graphite can be pretty good but different graphite comes from different minds and those different minds will give you different emissivities okay so you can have graphite with terrible emission at certain frequencies essentially zero it's not emitting out there okay so even for graphite it doesn't work very well now here's one frequency though at 0.66 a whole bunch of forms of graphite at point six six micrometers you see that a whole bunch of forms of graphite actually give you an emissivity that's not too bad you know 0.9 we're getting in close now in Kurt Ross today what did he used to do well he made his boxes and then he'd line him with soot people used to use blood lampblack in those days they just took the soot from the lamp and that was such a good absorber okay so soot has a structure very similar to graphite and that's what they use they coated everything which stood their cooker monitors their black bodies there the whole Lab was covered in soot okay so obviously everything became universal they busted needed a maid I don't know okay so now modern physics believes that blackbody radiation is universal and this is a resort salt of kirchhoff's air so let's restate kirchoff's law states that within a cavity the ratio of emissive and absorptive powers is independent of the nature of the cavity walls and Max Planck wrote according to kirchoff's law now this is critical for physics because Planck is about to give birth to quantum physics here according to kirchoff's law this radiation is independent of the nature of the radiations radiating substance and therefore has universal significance now he's not talking about the universe although we could be it could be anywhere in the universe but he's actually talking about from material to material it doesn't matter make me a cavity and you're gonna have black radiation inside of it yet if kirchoff's law was actually valid is it actually valid and do arbitrary cavities that we make in the laboratory do they really contain black radiation if so why is it that all our laboratory black bodies are always constructed from nearly perfectly absorbing materials so obviously it cannot be true kirchoff's law can not be valid or else we'd be making black bodies out of silver this is also important there is no proper mathematical proof of kirchoff's law now this has been true in in a paper and he ends his discussion by saying well then Einstein came along and then we get kirchoff's law well unfortunately remember I told you I 9 used a radiation field and that was a Wiens field and that field was a blackbody field and it came from a blackbody saying you can also read these papers that discuss these issues but remember black bodies are always made from nearly per ideal absorbers of radiation or the frequency of interest now let's look at kirchoff's law a little bit we're going to consider two cases so if I look at the law you saw it this is a right on the one of the very first slides and now we're going to consider two cases we're going to look at a perfect absorber where the emissivity is 1 the absorptivity is 1 and then we're going to look at the perfect reflector where we don't have a Mississippian absorptivity but we have reflectivity as 1 so this is a perfect reflector all they could do is reflect now when I do this now remember in physics they tell us well we can assume that cat that episode that epsilon is one that we do that all the time we always assume you can get 1 we have an ideal blackbody let's assume it can be 1 well let me assume that it could be 0 when I put a 0 in there this becomes undefined so this equation doesn't work so the problem is is that the true equation which is not shown in this slide but I published in a in another paper it's just it should be epsilon plus Rho divided by Kappa plus Rho is equal to some function of temperature frequency the nature of the material and anything else you want to add into it now do cavities really contain black radiation now if you look at some astronomy books they always have this example lots of storing books have this example they give us a nice spherical cavity ok and they say look would make a very small hole in it and the radiation that comes in once it comes in it's trapped and it can't come out so therefore the radiation and it must be black well this is a fallacy because if it can't come out it never came in now let's look at this argument now this argument actually I gave a talk at the American Physical Society in Denver two weeks ago it was a poster and in front of my poster there was a discussion of this case and the professor who was discussing it with me we left in a discord because he couldn't understand the point so let me go and explain the point now so astronomers say look I'll prove to you that every cavity contains black radiation okay so what they do is they say okay on the Left I'm going to take a real black body it's going to be an ideal black body okay we know it has black radiation in that one now the question is does this one have black radiation in it okay now I'm gonna take an ideal blackbody this is gonna be perfectly absorbing wall and I'm gonna make another cavity with a perfectly reflecting wall but now I want to keep my radiation from going into space in other words I don't want this wall to be radiating out here right so what I'll do is I'll take this black lining here and that's gonna be an adiabatic barrier adiabatic is a big word but it only it only means no heat will go through that wall okay heat is prevented from going through that wall in any form so all the energy of this system is contained within it it cannot go into the universe same with this one all the energy contained is within it and it cannot go into the universe but now this is a perfect reflector so their question is does this have black radiation in it well the argument that the astronomers make is look if I put these two cavities together and they're at the same temperature now they say these are at the same temperature when we begin okay when I put them together photons are going to come from the cavity on the left into the right that means that photons from the right cavity must go into the left one or else the temperature of the left cavity would drop and they're already at the same temperature so that cannot be allowed under the laws of thermodynamics under the zeroth law we can assume that there's another body out there also at the same temperature the zeroth law involves three bodies so because this temperature cannot drop that means that photons must come from the right cabbie and go into the left okay that's the argument that's used in astronomy but unfortunately that's not correct because the problem is is what have you built here you've made a cavity out of a perfect reflector right and you put an adiabatic wall around it right so where's the energy well if you can't put it in the phonons in the wall and you're not sure that there's radiation here you don't even have the same temperature you can't even characterize this this cavity with a temperature so here's another insight now I'm going to take cavities surrounded by adiabatic walls and they're now truly going to be at the same temperature because now what I'm going to assume is instead of building cavity to out of a perfect reflector instead of building cavity to out of the perfect reflector that's just an adiabatic wall I'm gonna build it out of something that's like silver and I'm gonna say this is gonna be a real material and when I put these together what happens is when they're at the same temperature as soon as a photon wants to come from the left cavity into the right a phonon moves from this wall directly into this one and creates the photon again so what happens in this experiment is you just redistribute the energy you create block radiation in this cavity but it never had any initially and the temperatures do not change so this is the correct way to look at it so cavity one is transforming phonon energy of cavity two into photons the energy or temperature of the system of each system remains constant now here's another little experiment and you know what since I'm running out of time I'll just tell you that you can take a perfect box and you could read this paper is a very simple paper and the citation is here you could just read this paper I take a perfectly reflecting cavity I take a perfectly absorbing cavity and you can prove that the radiation inside the perfectly reflecting cavity will not follow kirchoff's law but we'll skip it because we don't have time for it so arbitrary cavities do not contain black radiation that's absolutely false so what is strength what is kirchoff's box well remember when he was in his lab coated his box with soot well what he had discovered is he had made a transformer of light he wanted to know what the temperatures of the objects was he'd put the objects inside the cavity and then they would occur liberate with the walls and once the equilibrated this the spectrum started looking like the graphite spectrum but there was still impurity because the the object could directly emit light right so let's refine it a little bit and now put cavity the hide the object over here and put some put some soot covered walls inside now the only photons that will come out will be photons from the soot if you let this come in thermal equilibrium with the cavity now you always get black radiation so what Kirchhoff had done is he had figured out a way to take any object he didn't know his temperature if he put it in the cavity let them to come to thermal equilibrium and took the spectrum he would know the temperature so he had made a transformer of light so here's an example if I take an aluminum oxide chunk I put it inside a cavity we'll assume that there's walls here it goes from the aluminum spectrum to the blackbody spectrum but what if I put it in a perfect reflector well if you put it in a perfect reflector you can wait all day but you're always gonna get aluminum oxide because that's a perfect reflector so it can never transform this spectrum but then this is what Planck does throughout his work if you read heat radiation Planck's in love with a carbon particle he keeps putting it everywhere inside the problem he wants to put a little carbon particle in the box so what cutt playing what Planck does is he always uses a perfectly reflecting enclosure okay it's perfectly reflecting now he knows in the lab that that doesn't work so what he does is he says now just ensure that I have the right radiation I'm gonna go ahead and put a little piece of graphite in here and as soon as he does what has he done he's just put a perfect emitter inside this box well it's going to become in thermal equilibrium with this aluminum oxide right let's make this a silver box put this guy on the floor put that guy on the floor there temperatures go to equilibrium and this starts dominating all the radiation now you get a blackbody spectrum so as soon as you put a perfect absorber and I can show you this mathematically in one of my papers as soon as you put a perfect absorber inside the box you now govern everything because guess what this thing is perfect that's as if you had line the whole cavity with graphite so Planck had written it is therefore possible to change a perfectly absorbing radiation which exists at the start of an evacuated cavity with perfectly reflecting walls under consideration but by the introduction of a minut particle of carbon as a result Planck came to see the graphite particle as a catalyst in fact it was acting as a perfect absorber it was as if the experimentalist had lined the entire walls of the box with graphite as a result both Planck and Kirchhoff had left the perfectly absorbing had never left the perfect absorbing cavity yet Kirchhoff and planck should have considered the case of the perfect reflector as a separate case this was a serious error which resulted in Planck believing that his equation could be applied universally so in conclusion Planck erred when he assigned to graphite the role of a catalyst in fact graphite was a perfect absorber and Kirchhoff and Planck had never left the perfectly absorbing cavity so they can't speak about all cavities all arbitrary cavities having black radiation they never left them right they never left the perfectly absorbing cavity so consequently Planckian radiation is actually absolutely dependent on their bate nature of the emitting object graphite smoke soot and carbon are still used today to make black bodies now all black bodies are always limited to solids since only they can be perfect absorbers and can be near-perfect absorbers and unlike liquids they cannot sustain convection now this is important Planck's equation remains the only fundamental equation in physics which has yet to be linked to physical reality Planck couldn't link it because Kershaw had told them the radiation is independent of the nature of the walls so don't look for the cause it's independent of the nature of the walls so it was never linked this is a direct result of Curtiss error we must explain why a thermal photon is being produced as a result of the temperature of an object this still hasn't been done it's sorry whenever in physics or chemistry we have light okay so whenever in physics and chemistry we have the production of light we always have to have five components these must always be defined we have to have a setting we have to have the nature of the energy levels we have to have the nature of the transition species the equation which describes the process and finally the absorption of light so what am I talking about let's look at the Lyman series which the astronomers use all the time the setting is the atom actually the hydrogen atom what's the energy of the the energy levels what's the electric atomic and orbitals right what's the nature of the transition species it's the electron everybody knows that what's the equation is the Ryberg equation with the Rydberg constant and what's the production what's the production of light eventually the Lyman series so everything is defined very clearly how about an NMR my discipline well the setting is the nucleus and now we have to be fussy we have to take this nucleus and it has to have spin and we have to put it in a magnetic field what's the nature of the energy levels it's the spin energy levels what's the nature of the transition species it's a spin there's an equation describing the process it's a llamar equation and finally after all that we get the NMR lines bah bah bah Planck what Kirchhoff told us that it's setting doesn't matter so we don't know the setting so everything can produce black radiation the Big Bang the Sun a gaseous Sun everything can produce it right the nature of the energy levels are not defined they've never told us what the transition species is all we have and this is all directly because of Kirchhoff's the first three are missing because of Kirchhoff all we have is Planck's equation and the blackbody spectrum so that Planck's equation has not been linked is a direct result of Kirchhoff's era now I have a little joke here if there's any black hole in physics that's it now so I've advanced there is a solution to this problem because I'm living in the graphite world I want to live in the perfect absorber that I know will produce a spectrum pretty close to a blackbody so what do I want the setting I want a nearly perfectly absorbing solid something like graphite because that's the closest or soot they have similar structures so it's not something very close to that what's the nature of the energy levels it's probably the vibrational energy levels within the lattice so we need a lot Asst you cannot get a blackbody emission unless you have a vibrational lattice now that is a big requirement because there's none in the Big Bang and there's none in the gaseous Sun what is the nature of the transition species well we know that in physics it's usually always the electron it's always the electron causing light but I suspect that in black radiation it's actually a vibrating nucleus within a lattice field and then of course we have the other known too so there's some consequences here some of them are positive we are currently portraying physics as if we understand everything okay but in the end the emissive properties of all cavities are directly dependent on the nature of the materials involved okay so that has enormous consequences not only in real material work but in theory remember I keep saying the equal partition theorem is not valid this has enormous consequences okay that means that within the material again what you get the distribution of energy within that material will depend about what receptacles it has to take the energy and that depends on the type of material you have there is no universality in cavity radiation and as such the concept of Boltzmann and Planck are not Universal in nature and this has enormous consequences throughout physics each material must be characterized by its own constants and its own variables and finally by admitting our shortcomings we give hope to our children that they too can contribute to the advancement of scientific thought and discovery now I've written a lot on kirchoff's law these are some of the papers this last one just just came out I want to acknowledge my son for most of the drawings in this presentation except the bad ones the sketches of Kirchhoff and balford Stuart came from Bernadette I also want to thank my department for supporting me the editorial staff of progress in physics where so many of my papers have been published for accepting my work and I want to close with this followed up by Max Planck we cannot order men to see the truth or prohibit them from indulging in error thank you very much 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info Today we delve more deeply into a highly promising ongoing investigation in the Electric Universe community. In the previous episode, physicist Eugene Bagashov introduced the analysis he and several others in the community have conducted into the evidence for the pervasiveness of a type of electric current, called a Birkeland current within or nearby our cosmic neighborhood. Of course when electric currents can't be directly measured by space probes, the task of inferring their existence in space is complicated. Eugene and his colleagues have followed Dr. Donald Scott's model of the structure of a Birkeland current. In Part 2 of this four-part presentation, Eugene outlines in finer detail what he and his colleagues have found to date. In the previous video, we've discussed Dr. Scott's model for cylindrical Birkeland currents and have hypothesized that one major example of such a structure around us might be represented by the so-called local chimney; perhaps with more localized sub filaments on smaller scales inside it. But at the same time, at least one argument against such an idea might be made. If these are indeed strong electric currents, why don't we actually see them? In particular, where is any synchrotron radiation from them? And moreover, if there are strong magnetic fields in this structure, why can't we observe them in some way? The answer to the first part of that question lies in the fact that these are most likely force-free field-aligned currents, just as the ones analyzed in Dr. Scott's works. What that means is that the electric currents are in all points of this structure parallel to the magnetic fields. So this is a minimal energy configuration with little to no electromagnetic stress and therefore as the charged particles are not accelerated by the magnetic fields but rather move right along them, no significant synchrotron radiation is being produced. This is just a plasma current in dark mode and that's it. The second part of the question is a bit trickier. At first we should consider the main method of detection of magnetic fields in space. It rests on the so-called Faraday effect, or Faraday rotation. Without getting into the physical reason for that effect, as it is slightly complicated, we might just say that the Faraday effect causes the rotation of the plane of polarization of light. That is the directions in which the electric and magnetic field of an electromagnetic wave are oscillating. And for it to happen, we should have some medium in a magnetic field in it. The effect is only valid for the component of the magnetic field that is parallel to the direction of propagation of the wave. But the most important property of that effect in our context is that it is reversed, if one reverses either the field direction or the direction of propagation of light. So, if we now consider again the structure of the Birkeland current filament as follows from Dr. Scott's model, what we see is the cylindrical shells where each consecutive shell has the magnetic field that is reversed with respect to the previous one, which would mean that indeed any such shell would change the polarization of light to some degree. But as the light enters the next shell with an opposite magnetic field, we get the opposite change which effectively eliminates any change that took place as light passed through both of these layers. In that way we might argue that any Faraday effect would be virtually absent and the best we might count on is seeing some much weaker background magnetic field that the filament as a whole is spiraling around. Well, let's assume then that we can't directly detect the currents themselves, then what can we detect to at least recognize their presence? One of the possibilities here might be represented by plasma refraction of light, that is bending of light when it interacts with the charged particles that carry the current itself. Previously the works of Dr. Gupta and Dr. Dowdye have shown that the bending of light in plasma might alter the trajectory of light rays, and among other things, imitate the hypothetical gravitational lensing of light. It might be expected therefore that the areas with higher current density in the Galactic neighborhood of the solar system might also impact the measurements of the direction of propagation of light. In general, any inhomogeneity in plasma distribution would introduce various errors if not properly taking into account. Let's look at some examples of that. One well-known technique of the distance estimates to the nearby stars and clusters is the parallax method. So, the parallax method is based on the idea that as the Earth moves around the Sun, we might observe the same star at slightly different angles, as our own position and space changes. From this angular difference one may geometrically determine the distance to the star, or in principle any other object. This angle is usually very small as the stars are very far from us. The largest parallax angle is obviously observed for the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, as it apparently moves in the sky the most as we proceed in our orbit. And even that angle is only about 0.76 angular seconds; that is about two tenthousandths of a degree. However, the precision of modern observational methods based on space telescopes in principle allows us to measure parallax angles as small as about 10 micro arc seconds, which corresponds to distances of tens of thousands of light-years. But let us now consider the situation when the space between us and the star is not empty, but rather filled with refracting plasma. In this case, the reading of the parallax angle might be distorted, and the parallax determination of the distance would be erroneous. One of the famous examples of that is the so-called Pleiades distance problem. So, according to modern astronomy it is possible to determine the distance to Pleiades cluster at least in two different ways. First, one might do that by looking at smaller stars in it in infrared wavelengths, determine their brightness, or correctly speaking, the absolute magnitude, and then compare that to the apparent brightness or apparent magnitude and get the distance measurement. Applied to Pleiades, this procedure would return a result of about 435 light-years. And second, one might utilize the current theory of stellar operation and estimate the mass from the surface temperature. Then, if we're looking at some binary star system in that cluster, we might track their orbits. Since before we estimate their masses, we might find the real size of the orbit from Kepler's laws and thus find the distance to them from simple geometrical considerations. In that way, the distance to the cluster was estimated to be about 430 lightyears. But the problem appeared when these estimates were compared to parallax measurements, especially the ones performed by the Hipparcos satellite. The satellite did measure the parallax angle of the cluster, but the according distance turned out to be only about 385 light-years. Moreover, some later analyses have shown that Hipparcos systematically gives smaller distances for many other stellar clusters. The later measurements made by the Hubble Space Telescope and radio telescopes from Earth, using the very long baseline interferometry method, seem to discount Hipparcos data also. And, finally, the new Gaia satellite essentially using the same technique as Hipparcos, has also acquired the result which is inconsistent with Hipparcos. This seems to have ended the debate, basically meaning that something is wrong with Hipparcos itself. Although one could argue that the difference could have been caused by different statistical processing of the results. In particular Hipparcos data was analyzed using a weighted mean of parallaxes for different stars in the cluster, when there seems to be a correlation between distances and distance errors for stars in it. The later estimates were made using an unweighted mean for separate stars in the cluster. Another source of discrepancy could have been the various methods of measuring the parallax itself. Hipparcos and Gaia were measuring the so-called absolute or direct parallax, whereas Hubble and radio telescopes from Earth have been measuring the so-called relative or differential parallax, basically taking some distant objects right behind Pleiades as a reference point. So we might assume that the differences in these readings and the need of invoking different statistical procedures for the stellar clusters might have been caused by the refraction of light in plasma in the Pleiades cluster itself or on the way to it. Moreover, there might exist a certain dispersion, that is the dependence of the refraction amplitude on the wavelength so that the radio telescope data might introduce additional shifts of position with the respect to visible range observations. The importance of plasma bending of light for Pleiades in the framework of our hypothesis might be reinforced by the fact that this cluster is situated in the constellation Taurus, the line-of-sight to which lies somewhere close to the axis of the local chimney. So, if there is indeed an enhanced current density at the center of the chimney column, it is not surprising that the objects observed in that area of the sky would demonstrate some anomalies of that sort. Perhaps it is worth noting that earlier works have also demonstrated some correlated erroneous readings for the Hyades star cluster which is also situated in Taurus. Another prominent example of suspicious parallax measurements would be Polaris, the pole star. Various parallax measurements of Polaris made in the last two decades have been steadily returning incompatible results. The according distances range from about 330 to about 800 light-years, which doesn't seem to be very precise and consistent. And there are some other examples like that. All of them might be related to the behavior of plasma in the local interstellar chimney and nested cylindrical shells of current and sub-filamentary structures on smaller scales. In the case of Polaris, as Jim Weninger argues, even the smaller scale Birkeland current filament that is connected to Earth's North Pole might be the cause for the discrepancy. I have certain doubts about that, but it sounds like an interesting hypothesis anyway. The importance of both Pleiades and Polaris in astrophysics and cosmology is very high. The Pleiades represent a model star cluster and the properties of stars in it that we infer from our observations, are directly related to the distance to the cluster. And Polaris is a so-called Cepheid variable star. Cepheid variables are widely used in astronomy to determine the distances to various objects as it is assumed that we know how exactly they work. In particular, it is assumed that there is a direct relation between their pulsation period and their absolute luminosity. And Polaris is the closest one to us; so if we don't know the distance to it, all the other distances determined through Cepheids should also be questioned. To get a proper reading of that distance, we need to firstly figure out the proper arrangement and properties of plasma structures in our vicinity. 
ELEGANT SIMPLICITY In the sciences, that's the Holy Grail. As mysteries arise seek out the root causes, the gems in the rubble pile, and then even the rubble will begin to make sense. Is it gravity that drives the universe forward? Within the space sciences, that's long been a foundational assumption, not to be questioned. But is it true? Or is there a deeper level at which gravity itself is an effect, not a first cause. Day-by-day this question rises to the surface, even taking center stage on occasion. Today's most inspired scientific discussion places a spotlight on the electric force acting at all scales in the natural world. The subjects range from the subatomic domain and bio-electricity up to galactic and intergalactic space, even including profound events close to Earth in ancient times, some affecting human consciousness the world over and provoking new interest today in experimental verification. With the introduction to the Electric Universe comes a wave of realization and inspiration, the signature of electrical events is now more clear than ever and the result is a scientific revolution now well underway. Come to our conference in June and meet today's pioneers of the Electric Universe paradigm. June 17th to 19th, in Phoenix Arizona. Thunderbolts.info 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project at Thunderbolts dot info. It is a fact known to any high school student, electric currents produce magnetic fields. Incredibly, this law of physics is virtually nowhere evident in the so-called Standard Model of the universe. It is therefore no surprise that many so-called baffling discoveries in the space sciences have involved the detection of magnetic fields at virtually all scales throughout the universe. A Universetoday article from 2011 describes the conundrum for astronomers. It states, "The mention of cosmic-scale magnetic fields is still likely to be met with an uncomfortable silence in some astronomical circles -- and after a bit of foot-shuffling and throat- clearing, the discussion will be moved on to safer topics. But look, they're out there. They probably do play a role in galaxy evolution, if not galaxy formation, and are certainly a feature of the interstellar medium and the intergalactic medium." In recent years one of the great mysteries in astrophysics was the detection of astonishingly powerful magnetic fields in so-called young galaxies. A 2008 report on such a discovery reads, "Astronomers have made the first direct measurement of the magnetic field in a young, distant galaxy, and the result is a big surprise. Looking at a faraway protogalaxy seen as it was 6.5 billion years ago, the scientists measured a magnetic field at least 10 times stronger than that of our own Milky Way. They had expected just the opposite." But what is the cause of these magnetic fields? The answer to this question, which we revealed in the opening statement of this report, remains elusive for astrophysicists. Today, increasingly fine data across the entire electromagnetic spectrum only deepens the astronomical mysteries. Recently, scientists in Germany, using the Hubble Space Telescope, have detected extremely strong magnetic fields in the quasar which is believed to be about 4 billion light-years from Earth. The magnetic fields were measured at 200 million Gauss. In comparison, the strength of the magnetic field at Earth's surface is only about one Gauss. The scientists state that the magnetic fields are very close to the quasar's theoretical central black hole and they suggest that the magnetic fields play a role in expelling matter from the black hole's accretion disk. However, how confident should astrophysicists be in their ideas about magnetic fields in space or their belief in the existence of black holes. Scientists from the university of Göttingen in Germany have detected, for the first time, the existence of very strong magnetic field of 200 million Gauss immediately next to a supermassive black hole in a quasar four billion light-years distant. As a comparison, the magnetic fields on Earth are measured in the range of one Gauss. The report states that, "The existence of such magnetic fields could explain why so much of the matter, which happens it to enter into the surroundings field of a Black Hole, still manages to escape." Now years ago I was at a meeting of professionals where leading astrophysicists admitted, "When we don't understand something we blame it on magnetism!" But what that leading astrophysicists didn't say is that astrophysicists don't understand how the magnetic fields are generated! If you have a look at Scholarpedia on the web and it says and I quote, "The origin of the first magnetic fields in the universe is still a mystery" and it goes on, "It calls for a mechanism to sustain and organize the magnetic field." Of course mysterious dynamos are called upon to provide these magnetic fields. You'll notice in astrophysics that these dynamos are in fact inside the Earth, inside the Sun and now inside galaxies but no one knows how they work, they've never been shown theoretically to work so they remain mysterious. Meanwhile, plasma cosmologists have shown both theoretically and experimentally that the magnetic fields in galaxies are due to electric currents flowing into the centers along the spiral arms of the galaxy. Now when the current reaches the center of the galaxy it is twisted into a plasmoid where all of the electromagnetic energy is stored until that plasmoid becomes unstable and ejects matter in jets along the galaxy axis, as observed. And all of this was published and is easy to read in Eric Lerner's book, The Big Bang Never Happened. In plasma physics the plasmoid is the most concentrated form of electromagnetic energy known. You can store the energy of a room full of capacitors in something a few millimeters across, the tiny donut-shaped plasmoid. That plasmoid of course, to contain that energy, has an intense magnetic field itself generated just by the electric currents and the way they twist themselves together. So this discovery confirms the plasma cosmology model. This means of course that black holes are mathematical fiction. Now at our Electric Universe conferences in the past year or two, Steve Crothers has shown that the mathematics of black holes is nonsense; that the most significant argument against them is that the mathematics invoke a universe where there is no other matter, it exists on its own, they can be no other matter in its universe. If you want to have a simple explanation you could look at his paper called, Black Holes, Unicorns, and All That Jazz. At the heart of all of this is the problem that physicists themselves don't understand magnetism, gravity or mass so this talk about what's going on in the centers of galaxies is complete nonsense. I'll be talking about all of these subjects and particularly "The Long Road to Understanding Gravity" at my presentation at the Electric Universe conference this year in Phoenix, in June. There's a great deal of evidence against Black Holes from other observations that have been made in recent years, one is the idea that these massive gravitational concentrations called Black Holes will cause gravitational lensing. Now, the stars orbiting the so-called supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way have been observed over a number of years and they orbit this so-called Black Hole at high speeds and their orbits have been tracked but in no case has there been any evidence of gravitational lensing of those stars. Another thing that was observed recently and was tracked was a cloud of gas and dust which was approaching the center of the Milky Way, the so-called black hole, and it was expected to be gobbled up by the black hole but that didn't happen and that was a surprise. The point is, it's not a black hole and therefore the forces in action there are not purely gravitational as this research has just shown. Like the theoretical wormhole celebrated in the recent blockbuster film "Interstellar", black holes are a beloved staple of science fiction and popular science media routinely present the theoretical Black Hole as a science fact. How might the general public form independent opinions on such a complex and arcane subject? The public is at a disadvantage with science reporting these days because it's done by press release and the original papers which present the data are usually interpreted in such a way as to make these assertions and assumptions real objects. We have artists' impressions of black holes, we have artists' impressions of all kinds of things in space -- none of which are images of something that has been actually observed. As Einstein once said but didn't actually follow; the ideas of the most important thing, not the mathematics, and yet the ideas are often not well organized logically or well expressed so that the public can be misled. But not only the public, the scientists themselves mislead themselves. The Electric Universe, on the other hand, follows the tradition of classical physics where there is a freewheeling exchange of ideas and those ideas are organized into a coherent big picture, something which makes sense of a widely disparate set of information from different disciplines. The Electric Universe has not been surprised by any of these surprises for astronomers and astrophysicists simply because it starts from a much bigger picture, it accepts empirical evidence from plasma cosmologists, which astronomers unfortunately ignore, and the result is that we have been able to predict things in advance and to accommodate new information and actually find confirmation in new information week by week, as it comes in.

In our very first jointly published article some 40 years ago, Dave Talbott emphasized the theoretical scientific importance of anomalous mythological motifs. Quote “Ancient statements appearing to contradict elementary experience or logic are key to discovery.” End of quote. The ancient testimony and artwork surrounding the divine thunderbolt is anomalous from A to Z and impossible to square with present reality. Far from being a fairy tale deriving from our ancestors experience of a terrestrial thunderstorm, the Thunderbolt was a heaven-spanning structure of awe-inspiring splendor and stupendous power, one which likely endured for generations and played a pivotal role in all ancient mythologies. Creation itself, according to numerous traditional accounts of the event, traced to the primordial coupling of a thunderbolt and the mother goddess. Thanks to numerous variations upon this globally attested mytheme, the catastrophic events in question can be reconstructed in great detail shedding much light on the historical evolution of the polar configuration and the thunderbolt's manifold forms. Perhaps the most famous example of this archetypal mythological theme is  the lurid tale told by Euripides in the opening lines of the Bacchae, wherein Zeus couples with Semele in the form of a fiery thunderbolt. Quote, “Semele brought to bed by the lightning- fire.” End of quote. According to Greek tradition, the thunderbolt not only impregnated the maiden thereby producing Dionysus, it killed her instantly. Now here is a most peculiar idea, in what sense is it possible to understand a thunderbolt as an impregnating or fertilizing force? A vestigial remnant of this archaic theme is evident in the legendary stories that grew up around Alexander the Great. In Plutarch's life of Alexander the conniving Olympias, the Macedonian general's mother, is said to have been visited by a thunderbolt on the eve of her wedding night. Quote, “The night before the consummation of their marriage, she dreamed that there was a crash of thunder, that her womb was struck by a thunderbolt, and that there followed a blinding flash from which a great sheet of flame blazed up and spread far and wide before it finally died away.” Strange as it must seem to modern readers, analogous traditions will be found around the globe. The Norse thunder god Thor, much like Zeus, was celebrated for his prodigious powers of fertility. Thus it is that Thor's thunderbolt Mjolnir served as a fructifying talisman, hence the famous passage in the Eddic poem, Thrym's Song, wherein it is stated, quote, “Bring the hammer the bride to wed, place Mjolnir in the maiden's lap.” As Hilda Davidson documented in her compendium of Norse lore, such ideas hark back to ancient conceptions of the thunderbolt as an impregnor or fecundator, survivors of which persist well into modern times. Thor himself was frequently invoked at weddings, the gods thunderbolt forming a familiar accouterment of many a bridegroom's attire. Quote, “In certain parts of Norway and Sweden, it continued to be the custom for a bridegroom to bear an ax at the wedding long after Thor was forgotten; the weapon was said to give him mastery, and also to ensure a fruitful union.” It will be noted that Thor's thunderbolt was here conceptualized as an ax rather than a hammer. Very similar ideas are attested in ancient Lithuanian where Perkunas's thunderbolt axes were commonly regarded as agents promoting fertility. Quote, “In Lithuania, the ax as a life-stimulating symbol, is laid under the bed of a woman in labor; or the sill to be crossed by the newlywed couple... During sowing, axes were thrown into the field.” End of quote. Here too, it is obvious that no farmer in his right mind would ever view the fiery thunderbolt as a life-stimulating talisman. Hence the profound puzzle presented by these widespread belief systems. Analogous conceptions  are found already in ancient India. Witness the following hymn from the Rig Veda dedicated to the thunder god Parjanya. Quote, “The winds blow forth; the lightning bolts fly. The plants shoot up; the sun swells. Refreshment arises for all creation, when Parjanya aids the earth with his semen... (Parjanya) come nearby with this thundering, pouring down the waters as the lord, our father. Roar! Thunder! Set an  embryo!” Here the thunder god is implored to inseminate mother Earth and implant an embryo in her womb. Perhaps the earliest attested example of this archetypal motif is to be found in Spell 148 from the Egyptian Coffin Texts, circa 2000 BC. There it is reported that a thunderbolt or meteor fell from heaven and impregnated Isis. The fall of  the thunderbolt resulted in Horus being implanted within its mother's womb. Quote, ”Isis wakes pregnant with the seed of her brother Osiris.” End of quote. I.e., Horus himself, the soon to be king of the gods. To return to the question posed at the outset of this inquiry, how is it possible to understand the ancient tradition of the thunderbolt as impregnor or fertilizing agent? One can search the world's corpus of scholarly books devoted to ancient myth, and never find even the first glimmerings of an answer to this question. Horus's identification with the planet Mars provides the all- important clue. As I have documented elsewhere, Mars is everywhere identified as a meteor-like object that fell from heaven. The Babylonian God Nergal for example, expressly identified with the red planet, was invoked as “miqit isatu”, denoting the ”fall of fire” from heaven. Equally telling is the fact that the same phrase is employed to describe ”lightning” or “meteor.” Analogous conceptions were associated with the planet Mars in the New World where the Skidi Pawnee explicitly likened the Morning Star to a falling meteor. Quote, “Now they sang of the origin of the Morning Star itself that they thought had come from a meteor.” End of quote. The same basic idea is evident in the Skiddy belief that, quote “The power of the Morning Star is the fire- impelling stone.” We know the Skiddy Morning Star was explicitly identified with the planet Mars. Granted that Mars was indeed conceptualized as a meteor-like celestial body by indigenous peoples around the globe, how does this finding help us understand the archaic and seemingly universal belief system, whereby a thunderbolt meteor impregnated Venus, and thereby sparked creation? According to the historical reconstruction offered here, the myth in question encodes the close approach of the planet Mars to Venus during one of the most spectacular phases of the polar configuration. Moving from outside the general vicinity of Venus, the red planet seemed to fall like a meteor into the center of Venus. In reality, Mars was then on an orbit between Venus and the Earth and appeared like a tiny orb at Venus's belly. Looking  up from Earth, Mars appeared to be nestled within the body of Venus. As  the red planet appeared to enter the visual outlines of the much larger Venus, it was conceptualized as impregnating it. Or alternatively as implanting an embryo within the mother goddess's womb. Hence we would understand the Egyptian tradition of a heaven-sent thunderbolt impregnating Isis-Venus. The Vedic tradition of the thunder god Parjanya implanting an embryo in the belly of  the mother goddess, finds a similar explanation. So too we would understand the mythological role of Thor's thunderbolt as fertilizing force or as located within the mother goddess's belly. Such traditions encode the extraordinary conjunction of Mars and Venus, the sacred marriage that sparked  creation. It goes without saying that the planetary scenario outlined by Dave Talbott and myself requires that Mars formally appeared in front of Venus, an impossibility in the present sky, whereupon the red planet always moves  on an outer orbit far removed from Venus. Yet, as we have emphasized again and again throughout this series of videos, it is the so-called “impossible situations” that are the key to discovery, as they would never occur to terrestrial sky watchers around the globe, without the stimulus provided by the natural events reconstructed here. And the fact that Mars's placement within Venus is impossible given the current arrangement of the solar system, actually serves to make the reconstructed planetary configuration the decisive test case in evaluating the predictive power of the present historical reconstruction against that postulated by orthodox science. We  rest our case, confident that our understanding of recent Earth history will be vindicated in the coming decades. [Music] [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info A new scientific study could radically change our view of the Sun. It seems that the Sun is not behaving as it should. Scientists have recently created what they call an MRI of the Sun's interior plasma motions. For decades, solar physicists have believed that at the Sun's core is a superheated thermonuclear reaction. This theory requires a massive transport of thermal energy to the Sun's surface through convection. But the results of this study indicate a virtual absence of convection, just 1% of what a thermonuclear core would require. How does this affect our understanding of the Sun? The thermonuclear model requires several things to be going on which don't appear to be going on. One is, there's supposed to be a radiative zone inside the Sun and then above that, a convective zone. And, of course, the radiative zone is purely speculative. It's only required by the model, there's no evidence for it. And the convective zone is also speculative, based on the granulation seen on the surface of the Sun that was interpreted as being the tops of convection cells. But the fact that they've discovered very little convection, means that both the theory of the granulation, the theory of the generation of magnetic field and the theory of transfer of energy from the center of the Sun, all of these are in peril. And I would say that what we are seeing is the demise of the standard model of the Sun. The absence of the expected convection is just the latest in a long string of surprises for solar physicists. There are many anomalies, in fact, the very magnetic fields above the Sun and the very hot corona, none of these have been properly explained. There've been a lot of arm waving about energy as somehow transferred from inside the Sun to the outside without afecting the photosphere. Because this is what's required, but this is a really weird kind of model. We've got 16 million degrees on one side of the photosphere and tens of millions of degrees up in the corona and sitting in the middle is the 5,000 to 6,000 degree photosphere. And it's required very, or sort of, extreme speculation as to how you would ever get that energy out of the Sun? And there's been no satisfactory answer. Thornhill points to a different model of the Sun which relies on the principles of plasma physics. Well, the Electric Sun is, energy received from outside the Sun in the form of an electric current lighting up the ionosphere of a body which is no different to many of the other bodies in the Solar System, only it might be much larger. And so, we're looking at the top of the, very top of the atmosphere like the ionosphere of a body like, say Jupiter or Saturn. Because of the electrical energy coming in, it's lighting up like any of the new gas discharge electric lights that you see in car HitLights and so on. So that's what we're looking at, it's just an electric light. I think the theorists have to begin to look at plasma physics, real plasma physics, the physics of electrical discharges in low pressure gases and forget about thermonuclear models at this stage but concentrate on plasma discharge phenomena.

[Music] The planet Mars is alive with geophysical activity. The term ‘geophysics’ literally means the study of planet Earth's physical processes. For planetary scientists, the idea of such processes occurring on Mars, was once highly improbable, if not unthinkable. Mars has no coherent global magnetic field. It has a very tenuous atmosphere, only about one half of one percent as dense as Earth's and it is said to have no tectonic plates. And yet for nearly half a century, scientists have puzzled over the surprisingly dynamic activity on Mars, including its towering dust devils, its planet-engulfing dust storms, its mysterious aurorae and, perhaps most surprising of all, the recent discovery of at least hundreds of seismic events which remain unexplained. A new scientific paper, published in the Geophysical Research Letters, analyzes  the largest Martian quake detected to date. The quake registered a relatively astonishing magnitude of 4.7. Astonishing, because as described by seismologist John Clinton, the energy released by this single Marsquake is equivalent to the cumulative energy from all the other Marsquakes we've seen so far. The best guess planetary scientists have offered at this point, is that the quakes may be connected to hidden volcanic activity, inside or deep below the  Martian crust. However, seemingly lost in the discussions of the Marsquakes is the challenge they clearly pose to long-held assumptions in Earth seismology. It has  long been considered a settled fact that tectonic plate movements cause earthquakes. And yet  Mars has no tectonic plates, demonstrating that the mechanism is not required for seismic activity. As those who have followed the Thunderbolts project have long been aware, for decades a number of scientists have proposed that the Earth- Sun  connection plays a major role in triggering earthquakes. Some of the evidence that seems to support this view, includes the apparent correlation between sunspot activity and earth- quakes. Along these lines, it's been proposed that changes in the geosphere result from a  temporary intensification in the Earth's magnetic field. This might begin to explain a host of strange phenomena that have been observed for many centuries preceding large earthquakes, including mysterious low-frequency electromagnetic emissions; rapid unexplained changes in the ionosphere; major temperature anomalies seen in satellite images; the observation of so-called earthquake lights from ridges and mountain peaks; and unexplained animal behaviors; including migration several days before a destructive earthquake. As early as 2003, Dr. Friedeman T. Freund addressed these anomalies in the scientific paper, ‘Rocks that Crackle and Sparkle and Glow: Strange Pre-Earthquake Phenomena’, Dr Freund proposes an explanation for earthquakes that would actually place the phenomenon in the realm of semiconductor physics. In the paper, Freund states that rock acts like what is known as a p-type semiconducting material when placed under  stress. Deep within the Earth quote “Positive holes are liberated and flowed to the Earth's surface, collecting there without being reabsorbed, which is the proposed mechanism behind earthquake lights.” In the 2013 paper, ‘Nature of Pre- Earthquake Phenomena and their Effects on Living Organisms’, Dr. Freund offers this simple summary of his hypothesis, which could explain some of the anomalous earthquake related animal behaviors. ”Earthquakes are invariably preceded by a period when stresses increase deep in the Earth. ”Animals appear to be able to sense impending seismic events. During buildup of stress, electronic charge carriers are activated deep below, called positive holes.” ”Positive holes have unusual properties: they can travel fast and far into and through the surrounding rocks. As they flow, they generate ultralow frequency electromagnetic waves. When they arrive at  the Earth's surface, they can ionize the air. When they flow into water, they oxidize it to hydrogen peroxides. All these physical and chemical processes can have noticeable effects on animals.” In the Electric Universe, the electrical nature of the Sun itself provides the missing link between sunspots and earthquakes. The Sun is connected to the larger electrical circuitry of the Galaxy. And the same electric discharges to the Sun that cause sunspots, can affect our planet's ionosphere. As physicist Wal Thornhill explains in his 2005 article, ‘Electric Earthquakes’, ”The ionosphere forms one ‘plate’ of a capacitor, while the Earth forms the other. Changes of voltage on one plate will induce movement of charge on the other. But unlike a capacitor, the Earth also has charge distributed in rock beneath the surface. And if the subsurface rock has become semi-conducting because  of stress, there is an opportunity for sudden electrical breakdown to occur through that rock.” Thornhill has proposed that underground processes occur similar to those found in atmospheric lightning. The small-scale traveling of charge results in precursor electromagnetic effects, perhaps similar to the so-called ‘stepped leaders’ between cloud and ground with lightning. However, larger earthquakes may involve a vast electric circuit from below, through the atmosphere, to the ionosphere. In other words, Thornhill argues that the Earth stores internal electrical energy which can trigger subterranean lightning, which may cause deep earthquakes. In this view, massive disturbances of  the ionosphere accompanying major earthquakes, are expected. The Martian environment is of course very different from Earth's. On our planet, Birkeland Currents entering the poles, spark aurorae and modify Earth's magnetic field. However, as stated earlier, Mars has no coherent global magnetic field. When solar storms strike Mars, the  result is sometimes a global aurora. As we've discussed previously on this channel, in recent years, scientists have observed other dramatic atmospheric  and quote ‘geologic events’ which have coincided with impacts from solar proton storms at  Mars. For a number of years, astronomers have puzzled over dramatic dust plumes sometimes seen erupting at up to hundreds of kilometers into Mars's upper atmosphere. As we reported in 2016, scientists studying Hubble Space Telescope images of Mars found an apparent correlation between one such plume and the likely arrival of a CME at Mars. However, no mechanism exists in standard planetary science to account for the dramatic phenomenon. As described in a New Scientist report on the discovery, ”One possibility is that plasma could be interacting with ice grains or dust lower down in the atmosphere and electrically charging them, boosting them higher, but it's not clear how the effect would be big enough.” Likewise, the planet's towering electrified dust devils and tremendous global dust storms remain mysterious in mainstream planetary science. However, the Electric Universe has always stated that the Martian ionosphere is electrically charged, even though Mars has no thunderstorms. This Viewpoint was outlined in a 2005 TPOD, “When Dust Storms  Engulf Mars”, ”On Mars, electrical effects will reach directly from the ionosphere to the surface without the ameliorating leakage via storm clouds that we see on Earth. Unlike radiant energy from the Sun, electrical energy can accumulate in the ‘planetary capacitor’ for some time, with a potential for planet-altering events when the atmosphere finally ‘breaks down’ and massive discharge activity is initiated.” On Mars, as on Earth, could an electrical circuitry from beneath the ground, to the atmosphere, to the ionosphere be driving seismic  activity? Of course, the Martian environment is still alien to scientists on Earth. So from any vantage point, surprising revelations are to be expected. However, the discovery of seismic activity on a world which is acknowledged to have no tectonic plates, is not a surprise to proponents of the Electric Universe. But it might serve as a call to planetary scientists to begin exploring theoretical alternatives, such as those offered by the Electric Universe. [Music] [Music] 
[Music] As I explained in the first episode of this story arc “Playing with New Thinking”, scientific activity doesn't begin with observation, as commonly thought. It begins with expectations of making sense of selected observations with particular general presumptions or world- views. I'll call these presumptions ‘Key Presumptions’ after James Hutton's 18th century proposal that the present is the key to the past. Traditionally these expectations of making sense have been called metaphysics. Meta meaning beyond, or  after physics, because it's concerned with a critical evaluation of physics. Metaphysical keys set the cognitive framing which selects observations, and constrains one's thinking about the possible interpretations of them, to a manageable  size. The selected observations are then considered to be evidence. With a different presumption, a different metaphysical key, the set of possible interpretations for observations will be different. The evidence will be different with each  key. The possibility of different keys is what allows for what is called, in popular discussions after Thomas Kuhn, paradigm shifts. In this episode we'll be playing with Key Thinking. An awareness of plasma behavior reveals Hutton's Key to be temporal provincialism. How long a time span will demarcate the present. Plasma events appear to follow a power law distribution. Many small, lower energy events that happen often, and a few large higher energy events that happen rarely. A global event, say an ultra-energetic solar flare with catastrophic consequences that occurs only once in a thousand years, will not be included in a mere century-long definition of the present. That temporal provincialism will be especially emphasized if there are political and psychological incentives to preserve, or to rebel against a domineering organization, or a tradition that justifies itself with myths that have no representations in the present. A present that includes rare high energy processes will raise doubts about the accepted interpretations of observations. The accepted theories, the expansion of the worldview that underlies the theories to include larger, faster and more intricate possibilities, will overturn  them. The geological record, a key interpretation of otherwise ambiguous observations, will be shredded by processes that disrupt atomic decay rates, and that may deposit geological strata in multiple distorted layers at once. The collapse of long time, a related key interpretation will open up evolutionary thinking to such ideas as fast, stepwise speciation. A present that includes high energy plasma events, will also provide naturalist interpretations for a large quantity of evidence from prehistory that heretofore has been dismissed as unintelligible. For example, petroglyphs around the world depict 80 some similar forms. If they depicted sunrises and hunting and thunderstorms, they would be explained by our present theories and we would think no more about them. But they depict alien things: squatter figures, duck-headed humanoid figures, strange geometric figures, and  so on. A common speculation for their origin is that the ancient artists were hallucinating. But why would ancient artists around the world have similar hallucinations, and only during a similar era of prehistory? Whatever forms the petroglyphs represent haven't been seen since. Until today. They appear as instabilities and pulse power discharges in plasma laboratories. When the photographs of the instabilities are enlarged to a similar size, they overlay the petroglyph image almost  exactly. With our new instruments we know that the magnetospheres, sheaths in plasma terms, of Earth and the other planets are laced with electrical circuits. Many are connected to the Sun. Flares can bump up the power in them to cause magnetic storms and auroras and power grid blackouts. Infrequent flares with an order or more greater magnitude of power, which have been observed on other Sun-like stars, could cause breakdown discharges similar to the pulse power ones in labs, but on a planet- sized scale. The instabilities would appear in the sky and last for days. The collateral damage to the planet and its creatures would discourage artists from documenting the events with texts or paintings, and suggests the more permanent technique of pecking the images into rocks. But Hutton's key doesn't allow such possibilities, so the evidence is excluded from allowable selections of  observations. Here's another example. Myths around the world tell similar stories with similar themes and characters. If they told of sunrises and hunting and thunderstorms, they would be explained by our present theories and we would think no more about them. But they tell alien stories. Sky gods waging wars, warrior heroes hurling thunderbolts, dragons. A common speculation for their origin is that the ancient storytellers were hallucinating, but why would ancient storytellers around the world have similar hallucinations, and only during a similar era of prehistory? Whatever events the stories are telling haven't been seen since. Until today. They appear as instabilities in pulse power discharges in plasma laboratories. The twisting and pulsing plasma discharges that last only several nanoseconds at a laboratory scale, could last for days or weeks at a planetary scale. The evolving forms would be dramatic for small soft creatures like humans caught up  in them. If the witnesses had no scientific discursive prose with which to  describe their experiences, but only anthropomorphic, dramatic poetry, they would make mythic poems to memorialize the events. Before Irving Langmuir began experimenting  with plasma, it was called radiant matter. Langmuir borrowed the term ‘plasma’ because the behavior of radiant matter reminded him of living processes. Scaled up to auroral dimensions, plasma discharges would appear as giant luminous living creatures, fighting dragons and each other in the sky. The events among the sky gods would be especially impressive if they were accompanied by thunderbolts hurled to the ground, and by upheavals in the earth. But Hutton’s key doesn't allow such possibilities, so the evidence is excluded from allowable selections of observations. There are many similarities between petroglyph images and mythic themes: Axis Mundi figures and myths, columnar forms and ladders to heaven, concentric wheels and so on. The similarities of images suggest a similarity of phenomena. Plasma discharge  instabilities. This opens the possibilities of the past to the idea that prehistoric people in the age of myth-making, may have experienced upheavals of the earth. Entire cities may have been destroyed by blasts from heaven; plasma discharges from space, as the ancient people testified. They may have witnessed mountains, melting like wax; and rivers of fire, carving valleys; and seas overflowing entire regions. That's what the ancient writings say they witnessed. We should respect what people say about their origins, even if we don't understand it. With the key of plasma behavior, the range of allowable evidence is larger and more inclusive. Petroglyphs and myths become explainable as manifestations of a physical phenomenon: planetary scale plasma discharges. But caution is warranted. We think in metaphors by noticing similarities among experiences, and carrying the logic of the source experiences over to the similar  experiences. However, metaphors not only highlight similarities, they also hide dissimilarities. It's easy to overlook the dissimilarities, to mistake the similarities for identities, and to conclude that we know it all. This applies not only to myth and plasma, but also to gravity and planets. That gap in the metaphor between similar and identical, constitutes an essential epistemic uncertainty in what we call  knowledge. If that uncertainty is imbued with trauma-induced terror, it will generate a compulsion to believe, or to disbelieve, that we know more, or don't, and with greater confidence than is justified. We tend to turn our attention away from the question of how we know, with its essential uncertainty and often unconscious metaphysical keys, and to place an unquestioning belief in what we claim to know. A more appropriate criterion for metaphors than truth with its implication of universality and absoluteness, is aptness. The similarities must be tested and  the domains of aptness discovered. For example, the metaphor of gravity theory, carried over from Newton's alleged experience of a falling apple, becomes  inapt when used to explain galactic motions. On the other hand, the metaphor of plasma instabilities may be apt for explaining hitherto unexplainable commonalities between petroglyphs and myths. Awareness of plasma behavior not only reconfigures what we think we know about today's events, but also illuminates a prehistory that has been shrouded by the inertia of our prior beliefs and blind spots. This  turns the uniformitarian metaphysics on its head: the past may be the key to the present. Ancient glyphs and myths may be a key to unlocking a presentist prejudice. A criterion of aptness for science, instead of truth, recognizes its provisionality and counteracts the tendency to believe in theories as if they were religious dogmas. My interest here is not so much in what those events, memorialized in petroglyphs and myths, might have been or on how they might be explained, but in how we think about them. We perceive orderly patterns that suggest the possibility of intelligibility, of composing a coherent narrative that will make sense of them. How could those patterns of evidence  be interpreted so as to fit in with, or modify, as many of other observations  as possible? How many of the other observations could be, or should be, re-selected and reinterpreted with different metaphysical keys? Could the new interpretations enable us to do things; to invent new processes and to build new gadgets; and to create  new values that would improve our lives? The next and final episode will bring this entire story arc to bear on our daily lives today. We should never think that we've arrived at a final thought. We should never stop asking, ‘what else could it be?’ We should never take ourselves and our thinking too seriously. We should  never stop playing with thinking. [Music] 
Albert Einstein is a cultural phenomenon. He has enjoyed scientific celebrity status for decades. He also has a lot of critics, although you don't hear too much about them from Popular Science sources. Ironically, I sometimes wonder if he would be more sympathetic to his detractors if he were still around today. And I say that in all seriousness. “I am no Einstein” he once joked in response to the adulation that began in his lifetime. According to Wikipedia – yes, I know - the German-born theoretical physicist is widely ranked among the greatest scientists of all time. Despite his cult-hero status  however, growing numbers do not even regard him as a scientist, let alone great. The clue is in the two words ‘theoretical physics’. This rests almost entirely on mathematical modeling, unlike classical science which emphasizes experimentation and observation. Quote, “As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.” Close quote, Albert Einstein. To summarize this philosophical viewpoint, one common among critics of Einstein and apparently Einstein himself, ”Math should be ancillary, not dominant.” Making science subservient to mathematics is putting the cart before the horse, let alone hubristic. Just think epicycles, where the mathematical model can make accurate predictions up to a point, yet fail to reflect the underlying reality. Heavier-than-air flight was also considered impossible a little over 100 years ago, and they had the math to prove it. The importance of mathematics is not denied. Again, the point is that the math should follow the science, rather than building the science on idealized mathematical models and selectively interpreting data to fit. Furthermore, current models rely on three variables to balance the equations - equivocations, some might say - dark matter and dark energy are the oft-cited Achilles heel of pop science. They remain undetected after decades of searching despite allegedly comprising roughly 90% of the universe. Those who pretend there isn't any debate to be had on the dominant role of mathematics and science have a problem. But don't take my word for it. Quote “Physics is mathematical not because we know so much about the physical world, but because we know so little. End quote, Bertrand Russell. Quote, “Today’s scientists have substituted mathematics for experiments, and they wander off through equation after equation, and eventually build a structure which has no relation to reality.” End quote, Nicola Tesla. Oh, and here is another one from Einstein himself, quote, “Since the mathematicians have invaded the theory of relativity, I do not understand it myself anymore.” End quote. Even if you think Einstein had his tongue planted firmly in his cheek at the time, I would suggest that many a true word is spoken in jest. Philosophical issues aside, Stephen Crothers has done a fine job exposing the flaws and leaps of faith in so much math-based cosmology. A preeminent mathematician, he is counted among the most competent critics of  general relativity, the Big Bang and black holes et al. Quote, “Hawking was a pop scientist who ipso facto contributed nothing of value to science. Einstein was the first pop scientist; promoted sometime or another by that other entertainer, Charlie Chaplin. Hawking and the Einstein cult have ruined physics and astronomy, turning them into circus freak shows.” Science cannot just wait until they all disappear. Whilst they are active, they are ruining young minds entering science, to be caught up in the same rat race, producing more pop scientists. The cycle must be broken.” End quote, Stephen Crothers. Too bad that, for the time being at least, complex and esoteric math shield so much institutional science from robust scrutiny. Quote, “If you can't explain  it simply, you don't understand it well enough.” End quote, Albert Einstein. Isaac Newton admitted he did not understand the mechanism behind gravity and had to settle for describing it mathematically. Quote, “But hitherto I have not been able to discover the cause of those properties of gravity from phenomena, and I frame no hypotheses.” End quote, Isaac Newton. Einstein solved this problem by factoring in time as an additional dimension, the fourth dimension resulting in alleged spacetime curvature. But has he effectively replaced a mathematical description with a mathematical abstraction? Quote, “There is no model of the theory of gravitation today, other than the mathematical form.” End quote Richard Feynman. In classrooms today, Einstein’s solution is sometimes illustrated by rolling balls around on suspended blankets with the smaller balls being attracted to the larger mass in the middle, as if falling into the well of spacetime. This self-evidently relies on gravity as its own explanation. It's a classic case of circular reasoning. Time dilation is often cited as conclusive evidence for special relativity. But could bias confirmation be the significant factor here? In 1972 Hafele and Keating performed experiments that purported to confirm special relativity. The evidence was derived from the differences in time recorded by cesium clocks transported in aircraft moving east and west. However, the results have been contested. Louis Essen for example, the inventor of the atomic clock, published an article in which he discussed the inadequate accuracy of the experiments. Essen concluded that the theory was no more than a bunch of contradictory assumptions, together with actual mistakes. It is important to add a caveat to the above. When time contraction and length dilation can be observed, it doesn't necessarily lend credence to the fantastical spacetime framework. Quote, “Poincare’s advancement of Lorentz's ether is mathematically indistinguishable from ‘Special Relativity,’ while being utterly opposed to Minkowski's diagrams and formalization  of ’isotropic constancy’ found in the spacetime metaphysics regime.” End quote, Anti-  Relativity.com. GPS is often cited as conclusive proof for general relativity but this is a fallacy too. but According to this 1996 paper published by the GPS joint program office, quote, “The operational control system (OCS) of the Global Positioning System (GPS) does not include the rigorous transformations between coordinate systems that Einstein's general theory of reality would seem to require.” End quote. Adjustments are made, but this is because clocks at high altitude tick faster resulting from variations in air density, not gravity. The air is denser closer to the Earth's surface. Atomic clocks are also sensitive to temperature and pressure changes in their orbit. In addition to dark matter and dark energy, black holes are also talked about today as if they were real. Consensus scientists who describe them as one of the most successful predictions of relativity choose to ignore the fact that Einstein dismissed the idea. In a 1939 paper from the Annals of Mathematics, he concluded that the black hole hypothesis was not convincing and the phenomena did not exist in the real world. The paper is now hidden behind a paywall, but there is also a reference to it at History.com. Bizarrely, theoretical physicists describe black holes as points with zero volume, infinite density, and infinite mass. Think about that. Does this concept sound credible, or more like another mathematical abstraction? Claims that a black hole has been pictured for the first time at the center of Galaxy M87 are at best contentious. The straightforward plasma focus approach makes more sense on every level. Einstein coined the term “spooky action at a distance,” latterly referred to as “quantum entanglement.” It seems that one particle knows something about another particle instantaneously over a vast distance. This phenomenon is problematic because it breaks the speed of light barrier, supposedly the upper speed limit of the universe. Because it contradicts special relativity, Einstein was compelled to issue a traffic violation. Quote, “I cannot seriously believe in it because the theory cannot be reconciled with the idea that physics should represent a reality in time and space, free from spooky action at a distance.” End quote, Albert Einstein in a letter to Max Born 1947.  SAD - Spooky Action at a Distance - has been confirmed post Einstein. As a result, we have seen numerous attempts to reconcile it with SR - Special Relativity - by the mathematical mysticism known as quantum physics. Quantum superposition conjectures that particles can exist in different states simultaneously. Much like the criminal who claimed to be at home when he was seen robbing a store. Science fiction can't hold a candle to it. That much is certain. But I'll take a step back. I'm not saying quantum physics is entirely without merit, just that it's highly speculative too. To be fair to Einstein, he was a modest man and a reluctant hero. The truth is that others ran with his ideas, and ran, and ran. Today they are still running around like dogs sniffing each other's butts. Typical of this breed is the British Professor Dr. Brian Cox who made the seamless transition from pop star to pop scientist. He was a keyboard player with D:Ream in the '90s. They had a UK number one hit with “Things Can Only Get Better.” I'm not saying Cox is any worse than any of the other talking heads paraded on television today. But things really don't seem to be getting any better. Daring to question relativity remains an anathema, and doing  so is liable to draw comparisons with flat earth quackery. Cox is the UK's answer to America's Neil deGrasse Tyson. Several luminaries regard him as the best man to front  BBC scientific programming moving forward. Which reminds me of Fred Hoyle’s famous words. Another former Royal Astronomer, Hoyle was critical of peer review and the graduate school system and their abject failure to encourage independent thinking. Prophetically, he summed it up: “The road ahead is hammered out!” Quote, “Unthinking respect for authority is the greatest enemy of truth.” End quote, Albert Einstein. A famous line from Shakespeare's Twelfth Night seems apposite: “Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.” I submit that Einstein belongs in the latter category. He was more victim than genius at a time when science took a wrong turn and mathematical modeling began to take precedence over traditional  empiricism. Doubt is supposed to be at the heart of good science. The funny thing is though, while Einstein's fan club hang on almost every word he uttered, they ignored his many doubts.  The last word belongs to him, but quote, “You can imagine that I look back on my life's work with calm satisfaction. But from nearby it looks quite different. There is not a single concept of which I'm convinced that it will stand firm, and I feel uncertain whether I'm in general on the right track”. End quote. Albert Einstein. [Music] 
Future Science Future Science Of course, I can't foretell the future but what I can do is provide some ideas which may form the revolutions in technology and so on that we may expect in future. First I've got to set a bit of context, we need a bit of perspective. Science today and this... just a moment, see if I can pick up at the top, it's okay... this is a doctored picture from the 'March for Science' which you'll all remember, occurred a few months ago where all of the scientists came out and marched on the political capitals. I doctored this si.. this sign. The problem really here is, what were they marching for? You know the march for science boiled down to the concern that future funding of science projects will be cut or redirected. I don't think there's any clear idea of what science really is, we seem to have lost that. The point is that science is never "settled". And yet we hear an awful lot about settled science. Science being settled suggests it's going nowhere. Of course, the placard there says that we want a theory of everything and of course we want it now. The other aspect of that is that that so-called theory of everything can be focused right down and put on a t-shirt. Now, that's the exact opposite of everything in my opinion because the Electric Universe is about an expansive picture of everything which you cannot fit on a t-shirt. Just a few little problems that science faces. We don't understand why matter has mass. and yet we have built an umpteen- billion-dollar Large Hadron Collider to try and find out. The very question hardly makes sense because if the electrons and the protons that make up matter have no mass, they can have no energy, they can have no structure and we know that's not true. Energy is undefined. Einstein took care of that because he gave us nothing to measure it by. Gravity isn't understood. Now I am going into that again because I've settled off already. But of course, when I say gravity is not understood, that's the basis of modern cosmology. So modern cosmology is not worth the paper it's not written on. Time is not understood. I mean, Einstein thought a clock was time and Steve Crothers pointed out the stupidity of that. And the result is of course that the language of science has become meaningless. Those people who can stomach watching science programs on television... I've attempted occasionally but after having sat through a few minutes of being able to pick holes in almost every sentence that's uttered, I give up! Yet we have the hubris to think we are prepared for this theory of everything. Here's settled science, they look pretty settled. This is the math magicians' conference in Brussels October 1927. A very famous picture, it's full of famous men. Right there, center front row is Einstein. Now, he stopped us from doing physics because he removed the standards of length and time. They became malleable, they become rubbery. In fact, Salvador Dali admitted that he was inspired by Einstein's work to paint his melting clocks and his weird landscapes. And on, in the second row on the right hand side is Niels Bohr and he introduced quantum theory which divorced cause and effect. So he crippled that aspect of science as well. So we stopped doing science about this time. Science, so science has been "settled" for almost a century. It's technology that has made our existence starkly different. You know, the past was a different country, they did things differently there. Today, the difference is all due to technology. But technology advances without the science. It bootstraps itself. The better instrumentation you build, the better rockets you build, using as a basis the old technology but doing it better, has got us to where we are now. So most of the science required for modern technology was invented before this photograph was taken. Think about that. Now Faraday's work, Ampère, the people who worked on electromagnetism, Maxwell, all of these people more or less produced the requirements for modern technology. But of course, scientists have to show something for their existence. So they claim the credit for advances in technology which is generally tinkering with things in the laboratory, finding something that works and then building better mousetraps and selling them as a new product. We are being treated like lab rats as a result. And you can see this in every field; in medicine, in food production, in pharmaceuticals, in radio smog... I remember attending an IEEE meeting in Canberra some years ago, and the concern with mobile phones then was that is the radiation from the phone sufficient to heat the cells, just heat by the way, so that it could cause damage to the biological molecules in a cell? There's no thought that there is something more going on in a cell than just chemistry. Of course, we're suffering the cost and the consequences both in our health and the impact on the environment that we're having. So the things we must first learn, this is a picture from the new movie that was shown on the National Geographic Channel on Einstein. That's Geoffrey Rush, an Australian actor playing Einstein. Now, Geoffrey Rush is very good at getting into the character so he read everything he could about the man and he described Einstein as the 'glorious daydreamer.' Well... Einstein, the 'glorious daydreamer,' wasn't so glorious at physics or math as Steve Crothers has pointed out. He disconnected mathematical physics from real standards of measurement. Mass, energy and time are undefined in terms of matter in motion relative to a standard. This is why the, I insist on defining these terms. The energy is matter in motion with respect to the fixed stars. In other words, to the rest of the universe. Also, light is a wave in a medium. Then unfortunately, the ether got lost sometime around about here. It is not a massless particle, it is not a photon. Multiplying zero by infinity to give you a number is idiotic. The universal gravitational constant, so-called, and 'c' the speed of light, are not universal constants, 'c' is not a speed limit for the transfer of information. In fact, when you talk about the speed of light you must have a standard to measure it by but Einstein removed that standard. There's a consequence, now they define the meter in terms of the wavelength of light which is in other words, requires you know the speed of light. So it's a circular argument. They've made sure that 'c' remains constant simply by defining the standard of length. This is pretty tricky. Also as I said, quantum mechanics must have cause and effect and particle physics must apply these lessons and start over again almost from scratch. Here's the real genius of the 20th century in my opinion, the psychoanalyst and polymath Immanuel Velikovsky. I took this photo on the date shown in Princeton. He recognized a, what he called a, "desire not to know" about chaos in the celestial order. It may explain the delusional belief in order and control of nature through mathematics and of course we heard the story about Harlow Shapley and how he wanted perfect order in the solar system and of course was one of those most hostile to Velikovsky's attack. It may also explain the religious conviction of science and the academic book burning of Velikovsky's best-selling Worlds in Collision in 1950. In other words, in my opinion, to have a future requires a real human cosmology. We have to be included. It's not good talking about black holes and dark matter and dark energy and all of that nonsense. We have to be central to the cosmology, otherwise it has no meaning for us. And that involves us really understanding our past. And it was Velikovsky who provided the forensic keys to future cosmology, to the Thunderbolts of the Gods and to the Electric Universe. So some Electric Universe rules; It goes back to classical science before Einstein and Bohr destroyed it, its principles and simplification that guides the Electric Universe model. It's a strange thing that the more I understand about the history of science the more I understand that there's practically no (idea,} new idea under the Sun if you look hard enough. And I think those other scholars in the audience and Electric Universe aficionados know that. When you do take the trouble to go back in history you find people who have had those ideas in the past. So the Electric Universe is a synthesis of those ideas ― and that is new. Modern science tends to have no interest in anything beyond a few years old because that's all been done, that's settled. I should say that this big picture here is done in the form of a puzzle simply because this is how I've approached it looking for the bits and pieces to put together. But the Electric Universe therefore by doing this is a bigger picture than any before and fewer missing pieces. Of course, this is all my doing, this is what I took on many years ago having been inspired by Velikovsky and this is why I encourage others, many of them have been up here speaking, to propose new pieces or point out misplaced ones. So technology rules, okay? Technological advances are often claimed to be scientific advances. This forward button tends to be rather hard to get on with. The technology bootstraps itself building ever better mousetraps. If only the science was advanced as the technology because the basic science behind the engineering of the Large Hadron Collider is about 100 years old or more. It relies on electromagnetic theory and so on which has been known for that length of time. And as I said, the notion that mass is caused by a "cosmic treacle" particle (of Higgs pink pigs) is cranky. It is cranky, it fulfills the definition of cranky science. So is the gravitational wave detector which was pulled apart by Steve Crothers the other day and fusion energy "like the Sun." As the SAFIRE project, I hope, is about to say. That's better. I showed this slide, I think it was last year, the simplicity, Elegant Simplicity of the Electric Universe was the title of my presentation. But this particular slide shows you just how cranky particle physics is because this is an explanation of what a proton is according to an expert, Professor Matthew Strassler. He says, 'imagine all of the quarks because protons are supposed to be made like J.J. Thomson's plum pudding model, out of these weird pieces, quarks. Up, down and strange denoted by u, d and s; anti quarks up down... u, d and s with a bar on the top; and gluons (g) zipping around near the speed of light and banging into each other and appearing and disappearing. And of course the notes go on to say that the gluons themselves also contribute to the mass of the proton and these particles wink in and out of existence which of course defies one of the principles of physics. So this is, and the, of course you've got the ultimate let-out here because quarks are unobservable in principle. So this is just a story. And here's the fellow who looked at the sociology of this behavior and said there is no obligation on anyone to take any notice of any of it. So I choose to do that. Now Edwin Kaal told me about what he was working on a year or so ago and I encouraged it because this is an extra simplification over the model of an atom. And that is to have no neutrons in the nucleus and that makes an awful lot of sense because how do you hold a whole lot of positively charged particles together if all you do is stuff a few neutral particles between them? That is not going to work. But if you put an electron between two protons, on average the force between the protons and that central electron is four times stronger than the repulsive force between the two protons because of the distances between them. This can be a stable arrangement which is the basis, I think, of Edwin Kaal's attempted model to reproduce the the periodic table. I think it's excellent and I think it shows great promise and I feel it's on the right track, intuitively. ...I've just said that and that... This results in a resonant geometric structure. There is no need for an extra strong force. This is, a very bad habit that physics has introduced in the last hundred years, is more forces and more particles in the hope of getting a Nobel Prize, I expect. So only two particles are needed to build all of the elements. I like that. What about the neutrons? We know they exist but we only know they exist outside the nucleus as a short-lived dance between a proton and an electron in the kind of a relationship they have inside the nucleus. And that makes sense. And the fact that a neutrino is involved in the final breakdown of the neutron tends to suggest that it's a neutrino that may be responsible for radioactive decay. The present radioactive decay is a statistical thing. In other words, the cause and effect are disconnected. So I think the neutrino is involved in this. Light is simply an electrical wave in a polarizable medium ― the ether. No imaginary photon is involved. Get rid of it. You can't have a wave or a particle just depending on your whim. And the receiving atom is one that happens to be tuned to the sending atom through the instantaneous electrical resonance between their constituent subatomic particles. That's the same thing as saying you have quantum entanglement between the sending and the receiving particle. So when the energy wave arrives at the speed of light, you happen to have an atom that is perfectly set to receive that energy and once it's done so, because all matter in the universe is connected instantly, no other particle can take it because this one's accepted it. That's a simple way of looking at it anyway. This so-called 'quantum entanglement' currently has no explanation, of course. Gravity, and this is from the BBC General Certificate of Secondary Education, GCSE, website for schools and this is what they say about gravity, 'It pulls objects on Earth towards the center of the planet. It holds the Earth's atmosphere in place. It holds all the components of the solar system in orbit around the Sun and holds all the components of the galaxy together.' Well, this is not a good start for students. The Large Hadron Collider can't tell us why inertial mass is equal to the gravitational mass because particle physics is a mess. It simply assumed that Newton's law of gravity applies all the way to the center of the earth. I remember over the decades after I left University there were several occasions when anomalous readings down deep mine shafts resulted in the suggestion that there's a fifth force or a sixth force to explain these anomalies instead of thinking, hang on a minute, maybe we don't understand gravity. The balanced dipole model of gravity has the field reversing at depth. And also cosmologically. And I've talked about this so I'm not going to go into any detail here. The repulsive aspect of gravity dominates and provides a balanced universe which is what Halton Arp's research demands. So there is no Big Bang and collisions tend to be avoided. The electrical nature of gravity provides a feedback mechanism essential for forming and stabilizing orbital planetary systems. Because it's a bit [inaudible] ...that didn't sound good... The electrical nature of gravity provides a feedback mechanism essential for forming and stabilizing orbital planetary systems. Because one of the big issues with Velikovsky's recent history of the solar system is that you had a chaotic system, say 12,000 years ago, or in his case he was talking about you know only 3000 - 4000 years ago and here we have this clockwork system. How the heck do you do that? Gravity can't do it at least through the conventional view. The electrical exchange of charge between the Sun and the planets and their cometary tails which tend to stretch from one planet to the next gives you a means of adjusting their masses electrically that is their gravitational fields and I've been through this before but it shows that the inner planet, when they pass, if the sun's here and one planet's here and the other one's out here when this comes around here and the tail of this planet reaches this one, if they're close a lot of charge is transferred and the two planets move apart. And they keep doing that until they hardly affect each other at all. And if one tends to diverge from its orbit, the other one will tend to shift it back again. So there is this feedback mechanism which is essential for a clockwork mechanism. Plasma cosmology is a central part of the Electric Universe and Hannes Alfvén said, There's one great branch of physics which up to now has told us little or nothing about astronomy. That branch is electricity. You won't find any reference to electricity in the back of a textbook on astrophysics or astronomy. He says, it's rather astonishing that this phenomenon which has been so exhaustively studied on the earth, (principally by him) has been of so little help in the celestial sphere. Electricity has illuminated our cities but shed no light on stellar phenomena. It has linked the earth with the dense net of communications but has given no information about the universe around us. Nobody paid any attention. Astronomers don't attend the lectures or the presentations or the symposia of the electrical engineers who are now carrying the torch for plasma cosmology. The Sun Our understanding relies on century-old assumptions which don't predict any of the features of the Sun and that was one of the things that caught my eye when I read Ralph Juergens' article about the Sun for the very first time. Because a moment's thought I said, yes he's right! There are huge problems with the thermonuclear model. They're glossed over. 'The corona is like a flame coming out of an ice cube, it doesn't make any sense,' one scientist said. Iron increases in the corona with increasing solar magnetic activity. Why is that so? What is the Sun doing? We know there are nuclear reactions coming, occurring at the Sun. I'm not saying in the Sun. Because of the neutrino telescopes that have been able to see the haze of neutrinos in its vicinity. And iron is one of those elements which would suggest that the iron is being formed right in front of our eyes. And of course, we've seen the presentation on SAFIRE and that gives you an idea why we're so interested in those heavier elements appearing in the spectrum of some of the material on the anode, our electric Sun. And if we're right, this could, this will revolutionize our understanding of nuclear physics and energy production. Space Science The New Horizons mission to Pluto was a technological marvel that finally completed the imaging of significant bodies in the solar system. Pluto was the very last. Of course, it's no longer a planet so I had to say significant bodies. It took 4 years to launch and a team of only 50 people were involved, that's pretty incredible. It's the fastest spacecraft ever launched on an Atlas V rocket, it took one and a half seconds to clear the 300-foot tower, 15 seconds to punch through the 10,000 foot clouds. The second stage reignited over the Middle East and the craft could have reached the Moon in 9 hours. Apollo astronauts took 3 days, gives you some impression. Alan Stern, I attended a meeting about three weeks ago at the National University where he and another, one of the team members, presented their findings on Pluto. It was a good meeting and he said "Everywhere we turn are new mysteries." There are low energy X-rays from Pluto that are unexplained. And the moon Charon has been active and there are mountains in the Kuiper Belt. "This system is amazing", said Alan. Now these are supposed to be equivalent to large cometary snowballs. We weren't expecting rocks and all of these kinds of features. Pluto is 70% rock instead of ices with mountains up to 11,000 feet with no tidal heating to power tectonics. Pluto has clouds and is losing atmosphere at tons per second which questions all this business about how old these things are. And also, the moon Charon which you can see there to the right of Pluto, these are natural colors too, is so unlike Pluto that they are puzzled because these objects, all of them out there, should be roughly equivalent in their composition. So Charon and Pluto are "too different". What's more, those smaller satellites Nix and Hydra are too bright because cosmic rays are supposed to affect the surface and darken it over time but these things are shining like they're covered with snow. The small moons are "too reflective." So I'm more or less showing you where we're up to now. Biological Science Biologists don't have the physics to understand embryogenesis, the mind and mind-body connection, extrasensory perception or homeopathy. All of these, most of these things are "impossible" and you're not even allowed to investigate them because the subjects are "taboo." Rupert Sheldrake has done some very good work on embryogenesis and shown that there is something going on beyond the body involved in it but of course such a thing is taboo. I get the science journals delivered and I'm rather dismayed and I got fed up with Nature because it was almost cover to cover biochemical models incredibly complex and of no help in trying to understand what life is. I mean, it's all very interesting, the chemistry, but the actual relevance to a living system seems to be lost in the detail. So we're treated more or less as chemically driven machines. We have become "lab rats" for the pharmaceutical industry and the medical and food technologists. Far worse ― publicly funded research has been corrupted by industry, influencing government and regulators to shut down research into alternative modalities on the basis that "They're impossible". Never listen to an expert when they say something is impossible because they are last to know when a paradigm shift is about to come. One I took out of a magazine. Talk about misleading... see a difference, GMO corn and non-GMO corn? Neither can science. Well that says a lot about the blindness of science. It's certainly not an argument for GMO corn given our limited understanding of living systems and the interconnectedness of everything. Genetic engineering is an experiment with unknown consequences since it relies on a flawed understanding of genetics. They're only beginning to get involved in epigenetics that is the changing of the genetic information in a living creature during their lifetime. We have great hulking molecules of DNA with an unknown number of genes that interact with one another in unknown ways under circumstances we don't know! That's terrific! It really gives you confidence, doesn't it? I should point out too that we have less genes than a nematode and less than a grape. This gives you an idea that the morphogenesis of an embryo has more to do with signals from outside and that the DNA is more or less a factory floor acting under instruction. So all you need in the DNA is the instructions on how to make things, in other words the coding for the proteins and so on. But what switches them on and off is something that really needs to be investigated. I'll talk more about that later. It assumes a closed system and as I said yet epigenetics shows the gene expression is somehow tuned to environmental signals. Science hasn't figured out yet what all of those junk sequences do. When they say junk, it just means they don't understand. Once again, we're treated as lab rats to "whatever sells" culture with no thought of the consequences in such an unfathomed eco system. Here we go, "To know the future don't ask an expert" and this is Richard Feynman. "Learn from science that you must doubt the experts. As a matter of fact, I can also define science another way: Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts." I mean, when you look at the history it's dreadful. Ignaz Semmelweis could offer no acceptable scientific explanation for his findings and some doctors were offended at the suggestion that they should wash their hands between the autopsy room and the delivery room. I mean, you think about it now, it just seems incredible. I would also say that the words debunk and labeling dissidents denier shows the agenda to be unscientific. Debunking is a case of selecting the evidence to suit your argument and ignoring the evidence that doesn't fit. It's the sort of thing that skeptics do. Yeah, it's impossible that washing hands between the autopsy room and the childbirth ward will prevent deaths from puerperal fever. Heavier-than-air flying machines are impossible. Cold fusion is impossible and I saw a show of hands on a television, interview with the experts, and there was one guy who was obviously the alpha male, the dominant one and he put his hand up and he looked along like this waiting for the others to put their hands up and the other, sort of, you know, finally put their hands up. So this is how you do science. It's a media show. Of course, homeopathy is impossible but if you don't understand structured water and Jerry Pollack's work, of course it's impossible. And also the transfer of information faster-than-light is impossible. Isn't it? And yet the earth manages to maintain its orbit around the sun by knowing where the sun is at this instant, not eight minutes ago. Future Science Sir Fred Hoyle The future is a different universe, they do things electrically there in the Electric Universe. No, he didn't say that. What he did say is, it's a strange thought but I believe a correct one that twenty or thirty pages of ideas and information would be capable of turning the present-day world upside down or even destroying it. I have often tried to conceive of what those pages might contain but of course I am a prisoner of the present day world just as all of you are. Well not us. We cannot think outside the particular patterns that our brains are conditioned to or to be more accurate, we can only think a very little way outside and then only if we are very original. That was in his book 'Of Men and Galaxies.' So, the Electric Universe is the path less traveled and it is a game changer. The Earth's real past and the post traumatic stress disorder that humanity seems to suffer. Quantum matter interactions -- the ether, time, mass, energy, light, all of these crucial basic things need to be understood. Cosmic matter interactions ― electromagnetism, plasma behavior, gravity and understand stars. And also in, when it comes down to the orderliness of the universe, the orderliness of the solar system and the amazing ability of living systems to control trillions of reactions in the body every second requires that real-time connectedness and it's also associated, I believe, with consciousness. So In Future The future started yesterday and we're already late. Right In future, we may understand quantum mechanics as resonances between matter connected instantaneously by the direct electric force. In future, we may understand light as the energy in a light wave traveling through the ether arriving at an atom that is tuned by the direct electric force to receive that energy. In future, we may understand the real electrical structure of atomic nuclei and catalytic, that is resonant, nuclear chemistry, or "warm fusion" energy of stars etc. In future, we may understand gravity as a near-instantaneous dipolar electric force that can be attractive or repulsive like magnetism. In future, understanding electrogravity may allow us to begin to understand the real interiors of stars and planets and ways to harness the gravitational force for propulsion. In future, understanding the instant signaling between resonant systems may allow biology to advance beyond biochemistry into the realms of morphogenesis and consciousness, the basis of life. In future there is no time travel. I'm sorry. But galactic communication at the speed of thought? Who knows? In future, a new science must be causally complete that is every effect has a cause. It must be coherent. There can't be any exceptions. It's got to fit in with everything. And also, it has to be coherent in the sense that the whole thing is stable and it must be consistent. The rules and so on that apply are consistent. In future, the language of science must be accessible to all. This is why, whenever I present, I try to use just plain language, something that's accessible to all. In future, the real mysteries of our existence will become clearer. Right now, the mysteries that you find published in New Scientist and other places, I remember getting a copy with 10 of the big mysteries and all of them were artifacts of having the science wrong in the first place. In future, we may understand our connectedness and the insane divisions caused by our false beliefs. Carl Jung said the conflict between science and religion is a consequence of the immature state of both of these domains of thinking. In future, we may appreciate that we are earthlings with an intimate connection and responsibility to this pale blue dot. I thought that picture was rather evocative and I, when it was first published I thought, surely people can get a better perspective on our situation on Earth instead of battling amongst ourselves for, you know, a few square inches of land. It just seems so insane. In future, these changes are essential if we are to have a sustainable future on this planet. Because, for those who saw that program last night by the mythographer David Evans, Dr. David Evans, he himself made to stress this that we are currently living with a Bronze Age mythology, with all of its gods and heroes and wars and so on and this is the basis of our present culture. He says we need a new cosmology and he found us, the Electric Universe and said this is the only one that fits. It doesn't, it discards the old cosmology because you can understand it and once you understand it, it no longer has a grip on you. The Electric Universe provides a cosmology which is about connectedness, our understanding of our real place in the universe for the first time and of our real history and that of the earth. Once you understand those things, science fiction stories pale into insignificance. Future Science There is nothing more important for the human race than to know its past, to be able to face it. This was a quote from Immanuel Velikovsky in a documentary made by the BBC in 1972. And as Eric Unzicker who is a great critic of the Large Hadron Collider says, "With each paradigm shift there should be a simplification." Well, the Electric Universe has got that in spades. And as Dr. Iain McGilchrist says, "Meaning comes from understanding the whole, the big picture." And I think that's been my obsession most of, almost all of my life, is trying to see that big picture, seeing the whole. Connectedness, which gives us the ability to see our place in the world more clearly, is also the key to happiness. I believe that's true too. I've never seen such a bunch of happy people as I do at these conferences. And science and technology may flourish with more wisdom and mastery. Future Science is about us not about things. Thank you. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info In the previous Space News, we discussed the electrical nature of dramatic dust-raising events on the planet Mars. Today, we review one of the great ongoing mysteries in the history of Mars exploration. In January of 2004, the Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity arrived at the Red Planet about three weeks apart. Due to the extreme dustiness of the Martian environment, it was believed that the rovers would be hindered by dust accumulation of their solar panels and were only given anticipated lifespans of 90 days each. Fast forward more than 11 years to 2015. For reasons that no planetary scientist has successfully explained, the rover Opportunity is still alive and transmitting data to scientists on Earth. The rover Spirit survived for over 6 years until 2010 and only expired after being ensnared in the soil of a Martian crater. Let us go back to the beginning of the rovers' respective journeys. When their missions began, the rovers' solar cells were providing 900 Watt-hours (Wh) of electricity per day. Over the months that followed, Spirit's output dropped to 400 Wh daily while Opportunity dropped to about 500 Wh due to dust accumulation on the panels. But then, to the amazement of mission scientists, Opportunity's power began to increase and kept on increasing until the power peaked at just over 900 Wh. As reported by newscientist.com, the Mars rover Opportunity, "...stumbled into something akin to a car wash" which somehow cleaned its solar panels. Jim Erickson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory admitted that the cause of the surprise cleaning could not be explained; "These exciting and unexplained cleaning events have kept Opportunity in really great shape." The remarkable cleaning occurred in spurts during the Martian night. The team managing the rover reported that on at least 4 occasions over a 6 month period, the rover's power output suddenly increased by up to 5% in a single night. The ad hoc explanations immediately followed. The first suggestion was that the Martian winds might have somehow swept dust off of the panels. Others wondered if frost could have caused the dust to clump, exposing the panels to more sunlight. It was even suggested that the tilting of the rover while climbing hills might have caused a portion of the dust to drop off. One wonders, does one's car become cleaner when one drives uphill on a windy day in the desert? With Opportunity still alive in 2015, having now lived more than 40 times longer than its anticipated lifespan, more than ever the enigma demands explanation. The great irony is that scientists working with NASA have developed technology that provides the answer to the mystery. Self-cleaning solar panels that rely on electrostatic cleaning have proven extremely effective at dust removal. As noted in a 2010 review, "The technology was developed for future rover missions to Mars, but it could work here on Earth to keep solar panels operating at peak capacity. It uses electrostatic charge to repel dust and force it to the edges of the panels. It can remove 90% of the dust on a solar panel in a two minute cycle..." As noted in the previous Space News, the accepted models of the Martian atmosphere have never adequately explained the dramatic dust-raising events on Mars. A 2006 NASA report of the strong electric fields in Martian dust storm states: "Dust particles [could] become electrified in Martian dust storms when they rub against each other as they are carried by the winds, transferring positive and negative electric charge in the same way you build up static electricity if you shuffle across a carpet." But the tenuous Martian atmosphere, less than 1% as dense as Earth's, and an average of about 75 degrees colder, is not substantial enough to generate the mechanical winds required to generate such huge, sometimes planet-wide dust storms. Despite its atmospheric deficiency, Martian dust storms are much larger than any seen on Earth and the planet's fierce dust devils, some as tall as Mount Everest, would dwarf the typical tornado on Earth. On Mars, without the ameliorating leakage by a storm clouds that we see on Earth, rather than lightning, we see glow discharges which occur from the ionosphere to the ground and drive the so-called dust devils. In 2005, The Thunderbolts Project made a highly controversial assertion about the greatest dust storm in Martian history. The article ― When Dust Storms Engulf Mars ― asserted that the massive global dust storm in the summer of 2001, involved a packed assembly of dust devils carrying great volumes of Martian dust into billowing clouds. Since its publication, the assertion has been confirmed though the concept of compact dust devil congregations can only seem absurd to conventional schools. In the standard theory, an atmospheric vortex requires a vastly larger circulation of wind, a condition that precludes what seems clearly to be seen in edge-on pictures of storm fronts on Mars. In the Electric Universe, planets, like comets, are charged bodies that are interacting with our changing plasma environment. Laboratory experiments have demonstrated the ability of electric fields and electrical discharges to levitate dust and to organize dust particles into familiar planetary features such as sand dunes. On March 18th of this year, a new NASA press release has provided further confirmation that this process is indeed occurring on a large scale on Mars. The report states: "NASA's... (MAVEN) spacecraft has observed two unexpected phenomena in the Martian atmosphere: an unexplained high-altitude dust cloud and aurora that reaches deep into the Martian atmosphere. The presence of the dust at orbital altitudes from about 93 miles to 190 miles above the surface was not predicted." Mission scientist Laila Andersson states: "If the dust originates from the atmosphere, this suggests we are missing some fundamental process in the Martian atmosphere." Also surprising to MAVEN scientists was the discovery of a highly energetic glowing aurora that reaches shockingly deep into the Martian atmosphere. As one team member states: "What's especially surprising about the Aurora we saw is how deep in the atmosphere it occurs - much deeper than at Earth or elsewhere on Mars... The electrons producing it must be really energetic." The scientists have concluded that the source of energetic particles is the Sun. The report states: "MAVEN's Solar Energetic Particle instrument detected a huge surge in energetic electrons at the onset of the aurora." These observations are reminiscent of a 2014 scientific paper which states that charged particles from the Sun provoke increased lightning on Earth. It was the Norwegian experimentalist Kristian Birkeland who correctly hypothesized in the early 20th century, that electric currents from the Sun power the Earth's Auroras. For many decades, the scientific mainstream largely rejected Birkeland's thesis favouring instead the idea that Earth's magnetosphere is an impenetrable envelope squeezed by the solar wind to induce auroral activity. Only when satellites detected the magnetic signatures of electric currents in the aurora, in 1973, was Birkeland's hypothesis irrefutably validated. However, more than a century after Birkeland's polar expedition to investigate the Northern Lights, mainstream scientists still express surprise or even astonishment when they observe the tell-tale signs of electrical circuitry connecting the Sun and the planets. In recent years, NASA investigators have observed what they described as "giant magnetic ropes" that "connect" Earth's upper atmosphere to the Sun and explosions in the outskirts of Earth's magnetic field. The so-called ropes to which the investigators refer, are commonly described in plasma science as electrical Birkeland currents, named after Kristian Birkeland. The rope-like structure is not just a curiosity. It's the structure taken by current flow due to the long-range attraction and short-range repulsion between current filaments. The so-called twisted magnetic fields are simply the signature of the electric current flow. In plasma cosmology, these entwined plasma filaments act as transmission lines carrying field aligned currents across interplanetary and interstellar space. As stated in many recent Space News episodes, each new discovery brings NASA scientists closer to finally inevitably acknowledging the electrical circuitry throughout the solar system. Until this reality fully dawns on space scientists, the list of surprises will continue to grow. For continuous updates on Space News from the Electric Universe, stay tuned to Thunderbolts.info 
[Music] For the past century or so, the dominant trend in classical circles has been to deny any and all reality to the ancient gods. Richard Seaford, a world-renowned expert on ancient Greek religion, made the  point most forcefully, “Greek deities are human constructions.” It follows according to this prevailing orthodoxy that the Greek myths telling of the great gods’ lives and loves are the stuff of fiction, projections  of human affairs onto an imaginary Olympus as it were. It is  our opinion that such views are wrong from A to Z and that the Greek gods  were real. We also maintain that the myths attached to the gods were empirically based and described catastrophic natural events during a recent prehistoric  period. A few examples will suffice to illustrate the profound differences in our two positions. One of the most familiar tropes in Greek mythology is that the Sun God Helios sees everything; hence the epithet ‘all seeing’. In the Iliad for example, Helios is invoked as, “You who see all things.” The very same claim appears in the Odyssey and in various plays of the great dramatist. This trope is employed for comedic effect and a famous scene in the Iliad wherein Zeus assures Hera that their furtive love making will be invisible even to Helios thanks to the golden cloud he has created. quote, ”Not even Helios can look at us through it although beyond all others his light has the sharpest vision.” Why  exactly Helios was ascribed sharp vision has never been answered. The  conventional explanation, entirely ad hoc in nature, maintains that inasmuch as the solar orb travels across the entirety of the sky with each passing day, he must perforce be capable of seeing anything and everything. Martin West's opinion is representative in this regard, “The Sun's capacity for seeing everything that people do qualifies him as a supervisor of justice, or at least gives him a valuable role as the god of justice's eye and as a trusty witness.” Interestingly enough, Zeus shares the very same ability with Helios. In  “Works and Days”, Hesiod states that, ”The eye of Zeus sees all things.” Far from being an error on the part of the Boeotian bard, the same idea is current among the early poets. Thus Sophocles makes reference to the ever vigilant eye of Zeus Morios, ”For the sleepless eye of the Morian Zeus beholds it.” Here we find an unequivocal reference to the round eye or kuklos of Zeus. Yet, kuklos is the very phrase employed by Aeschylus to describe Helios's all-seeing eye. It is significant that a cognate term is employed to denote the all-seeing eye of the Sun in Indic lore as well, namely ”cakra”, commonly translated “wheel”. Quote “With his eye on men, he sits in the middle of heaven.” So too the Indic Sun God is described as all-seeing and wide of vision, just like the Greek Zeus. How or why the ancient Sun God should be equipped with the wheel-like eye remains  unknown. Certainly there is nothing about the present appearance of the solar orb that would suggest a wheel-like eye. Especially telling are traditions reporting that Zeus launched lightning-like fire from his eye. Aeschylus described the Greek Thunder God as follows. “The jealous eye of God hurls the lightning down.” The same conception is evident in Euripides’ Bacchae, “Unveil the Lightning's Eye.” With apparent reference to these archaic idioms preserved by the great dramatists, the Greek grammarian Hesychius observed that the phrase ‘Eye of Zeus’ meant ‘a flash of lightning’. As we have documented elsewhere, analogous traditions will be found around the globe. Indeed, a widespread tradition views lightning as the angry glance of the Sun God's eye, this  despite the fact that the Sun and lightning have no conceivable relationship in today's sky. In order to understand the traditions before us, it is first necessary to identify an ‘obvious’ celestial prototype for Zeus's lightning-hurling eye. ’Obvious’ that is, for prehistoric sky watchers around the globe. Consider the image depicted in Figure 1, analogs of which are ubiquitous in rock art everywhere. Can it be doubted that, were such an astronomical apparition to present itself in the Northern circumpolar heaven, traditions of a Sky God Cyclopean eye would be virtually certain to follow? Now consider the image depicted in Figure 2, a close variation on the previous image, representing a slightly later phase in the evolutionary history of the polar configuration, whereupon fiery lightning-like filaments radiate out across the disk of the Sun. It is our view that the global traditions of a lightning-emanating eye likely have their origin here. It will  be noted that the central eye is composed of the conjoined orbs of Mars  and Venus. Note further the Greek word for ’lightning’= ‘asterope’ preserves the inherent link to a material celestial body inasmuch as ‘aster’ denotes ‘star’. This etymology alone offers compelling circumstantial evidence for the conclusion that the Greek concept of ’lightning’ was quite literally a star-based phenomenon. The archaic phrase “star-flung Thunderbolt”, preserved in an orphic hymn, points to the same conclusion, needless to say. Now consider the related image of the so-called Sun cross. Prehistoric in nature, the  image in question resembles nothing so much as a wheel centered on a solar disk, a wheel-like eye as it were. If the Sun God's central cyclopean eye was conceptualized as a wheel-like object, it follows a descending orb of fiery lightning-like rays might well be conceptualized as the act of seeing. Hence we understand the indissoluble connection between solar radiation  and the act of seeing in various ancient languages. Yet Zeus's eye also flash lightning and thus we must expect to find an otherwise bizarre connection between the act of seeing and lightning-like pyrotechnics. The concrete nature of this meteorological imagery is most explicit in the Egyptian language wherein “m33” denotes the act of “seeing”, while “m3wt” denotes “lightning” or ”lightning-like radiation”. Yet, the very same word also denotes the spokes of the wheel. The startling extension of meaning, apart from the cosmogram depicted in Figure 3, where the Sun's rays are quite literally the spokes of a wheel, an analogous semantic development is apparent in ancient Greek where ”derkomai” denotes “to see/look”, but also “flashing fire” or ”lightning from his  eyes”. Ruth Bielfeldt, surveying the Greek testimony, posits a direct connection between the act of seeing and fire. Quote: "In both the Iliad and the Odyssey, we find the idea that fire, light and vision form an inseparable unity. Not only is fire endowed with sight, but the eyes are in turn also conceived as fire-like, their glance figured as spraying sparks. Homer considers eyes and glances as themselves emissive of fire.”  Such ideas have no conceivable basis in human biology or in Greek philosophical speculation. Nor, for that matter do they reflect the projection of human ideas onto the celestial landscape. Rather the exact opposite. Such traditions were directly inspired by astronomical events namely the awe-inspiring spectacle presented by a lightning-hurling eye in the northern circumpolar sky. If the classic Ra sign in Figure 1 was conceptualized as a Cyclopean-eyed Sun, the second image illustrates the emission of fiery lightning-like radiation from the God's central eye, universally conceptualized as a fiery glance, or the act of seeing. Insofar as the visible ray-like structures emanating from the central eye pervaded the entire cosmos, defined in ancient times as a unified heaven and Earth, it follows that the Sun God saw everything that transpired in the cosmos. In short, there can be no denying the dramatic contrast between the naturalist historical reconstruction offered by Talbott and myself, and the projectionist interpretation offered by orthodox scholarship. In a new book on Zeus published by the special series on gods and heroes of the ancient world, Ken Dowden begins by stating “To us Zeus is a mere fiction...” And then he gets downright dismissive and condescending, quote, ”How could the Greeks have worshipped such an empty god?... From beginning to end Zeus has been unseen, operating  the causal system of the universe in mysterious ways, and underlying every event... The mythology was only a way of talking about Zeus, a figure of speech.” ”No one believed that the gods actually had a palace at the top of a mountain in  Thessaly. Mythology was always a parable, a transposition of the mysterious into another language.” End of quote. It would be difficult to imagine a more erroneous opinion or one more disrespectful to the Greeks themselves. The manifold mythology surrounding Greece's greatest god, far from being a parable or figment  of imagination, accurately described terrifying planetary interactions of a catastrophic nature, albeit in figurative language. Thus it is  that sky watchers around the globe witnessed lightning being launched from Zeus's eye. Make no mistake about it, Zeus was seen, Zeus was real. [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info The parent star of planet Earth holds a strange and special place in countless ancient traditions around the world. The celestial body identified as the sun in myth, religion, ancient astronomies and rock art routinely bears no resemblance at all to our familiar Sun. One of the most common ancient depictions of the Sun is an orb or star within a crescent, an image with no modern natural referent, and numerous traditions depict the Sun as a spectacular celestial wheel, with a warrior hero appearing as the axle of the wheel. For decades, comparative mythologist Ev Cochrane, as well as his colleague David Talbott have worked to reconstruct the natural events to produce these extraordinary mythical patterns. It is their conclusion that in the relatively recent past, in the era of prehistory, a period of instability reigned in the inner solar system, bringing planets within close proximity to Earth. In this episode, Ev begins our investigation into the question, did ancient man observe a different Sun? It is important to underscore the radical nature of our hypothesis. We hold that the solar system has only recently been subject to wholesale reordering that in fact, well within the memory of mankind, a different Sun prevailed. Our hypothesis is fundamentally a work of historical reconstruction based upon our mutual researches in comparative mythology and ancient religion. The research of Dave and myself, is distinguished from other comparative mythologists in that we draw upon and emphasize the message of prehistoric rock art to illustrate our findings from literary traditions. To take but one example from hundreds that might be offered, ancient paintings and petroglyphs of the Sun depict a wheel-like object commonly 4- to 8- spoked in structure. Such artworks are global in nature, yet how is this fact to be explained? From the conventional standpoint, such artworks are interpreted as abstract or metaphorical in nature. Miranda Green for example, in her otherwise interesting book, The Sun-Gods of Ancient Europe, concludes, "The pictures do not describe reality." We beg to differ, it is our view that the prehistoric paintings accurately reflect the appearance of the ancient sky and offer compelling testimony with regards to an unfolding catastrophic celestial event, in which nearby planets dominated the northern circumpolar heavens. The mere fact that analogous Sun petroglyphs will be found around the globe, supports this conclusion. At the same time, ancient myth offers corroborating testimony in this regard, wherein a different Sun dominated the sky in former times and presented a wheel-like appearance. In this sense, as in countless other examples, the testimony of ancient myth and prehistoric rock art agrees at a level of detail that is impossible to explain by mere coincidence. In the Thunderbolts of the Gods, together with a number of other recent publications, Dave and myself have presented a wealth of evidence that the former Sun was the focus of prodigious electrical activity and the source of spectacular outbursts of lightning, heaven-spanning storms, and Aurora-like phenomena. In ancient Mesopotamia for example, the Sumerian word for Sun is Ud. The same word is employed to write storm or thundergod, a startling extension of meaning. Sumerian hymns invoking the ancient Sun God, likewise, describe it as a source of storms. So one hymn reads, "The Sun God thunders over the mountains like a storm." Another hymn reads, "As my king the Sun God comes forth the heavens tremble before him and the earth shakes before him." Now I ask, does this sound like a realistic description of the modern experience of sunrise? In what sense is the Sun's appearance over the eastern horizon ever accompanied by a shaking of heaven and Earth or great bouts of lightning? What could the Sun have to do with thunder and lightning? In the present solar system, of course, the answer is nothing at all, yet the mere fact that other ancient languages preserved this very same semantic link between Sun and lightning, confirms the fundamental historical veracity of the Sumerian traditions and cries out for an explanation. Ancient Egypt, for example, offers corroborating testimony in this regard. In the Pyramid Texts from the 3rd millennium BCE, the Sun God's thunderbolt is specifically compared to the lightnings of the Sun. The word in question here is mawt, m a w t, which has cognates denoting lightning in numerous other African languages. Significantly however, the very same word is used to denote the spokes of a wheel. In the present world of course, lightning has nothing whatsoever to do with the Sun or wheels, hence the fundamental importance of such terminology for our historical reconstruction. But we need not rely simply on ancient language in myth alone. Mesopotamian cylinder seals, together with prehistoric rock art and other early artworks, likewise depict the Sun with lightning- like structures emanating from its core. Students of comparative myth will recognize the structure adorning the face of the Sun here as the thunderbolt wielded by the Thunder God. So for example, thunder gods like Zeus or the Semitic Hadad are routinely depicted holding exactly this thunderbolt. Properly understood, the evidence from ancient language, like the testimony of prehistoric rock art, represents an enduring fossilized record of a different solar system, much as the discovery of a dinosaur bone harks back to its former age, one radically different from that which currently prevails. It must be remembered here that the denigration of myth is a relatively recent development basically originating during the early decades of the 20th century. The science of comparative mythology, like the complementary science of comparative linguistics, grew out of the 19th century writings of world-class scholars such as Max Mueller and Adalbert Kuhn who rightly emphasized the prominent role of the Sun and the Thunder God in ancient myth and religion. Yet the excesses of these schools together with that of the Pan- Babylonians led to a general backlash against naturist or astronomical interpretations of myth and religion. Current models of myths such as that advanced by Georges Dumezil, which dominates scholarship, emphasize linguistic connections above all else and are much more narrow-minded in scope. For example, Dumezil largely focuses on Indo-European myth. Most important perhaps is the fact that current models of myth always seek to understand the ancient traditions by reference to the present sky. But the ancient testimony is impossible to square with the present solar system and as a result, scholars are left with empty slogans pointing to figurative language, metaphor and such statements as that of Green quoted earlier, to the effect that the pictures do not describe reality. As Dave and I have documented however, granted the fact that the ancient traditions and prehistoric rock art complement each other. It therefore stands to reason that they do indeed describe historical reality. Confronted by these sun-wheels for example, on ancient rock art, the default position of so many modern scholars is just to ascribe those artworks to imagination or abstract forms, completely overlooking the fact that the same exact design is found all over the world. So, at that point you need to ask yourself a question, were ancient sky watchers on every continent on the Earth imagining the same fantastic structure in the sky, which in this case is just a cross on the face of the Sun or a lightning bolt on the face of the Sun? But we could cite a thousand other structures that we could describe if we wanted to, we're just trying to focus the discussion on these particular structures at the moment. But are we supposed to imagine that all these sky watchers all around the globe were imagining the same thing? That is not a logically sound position. It's much more rational to assume that the ancient sky watchers were trying to describe their personal reality. They drew the picture of the Sun that they saw, and that's why those pictures agree all around the world. Things that are imagined are not going to agree unanimously around the world. It's just that simple! 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by the The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info This month on Space News, we reported on a recent study that confirms electrostatic dust transportation occurs on airless bodies in space, including comets, asteroids and moons. The NASA-funded research suggested that electrostatic effects could explain a number of mysterious discoveries including the emission of fluffy dust particles from the nucleus of Comet 67p, the formation of weird dust configurations on 67p on the asteroid Eros. And the surprisingly smooth surface of Saturn's moon Atlas. The investigators observed electrostatic effects in the laboratory when dust was exposed both to UV radiation and to plasma. Nevertheless, few astronomers today consider electrical effects on comets or asteroids when attempting to explain the still mysterious behaviour of these bodies. This may be evidenced in recently published scientific research into a newly discovered active asteroid called P/2016 G1. The object has been studied, in part, to try to answer an ongoing question. Should asteroids that show comet-like activity be categorized as main belt comets? The team observed that asteroid P/2016 G1 became active 350 days before perihelion or its closest approach to the Sun. Over a period of 24 days, the asteroid emitted a total dust mass of at least 17,000 tons. The only hypotheses scientists have considered are impacts, thermal fracturing, rotational instabilities and sublimating ices. The explanation the team is settled on is that an impact partially destroyed the body, causing the subsequent emissions of dust. Their paper states, "We speculate that this dust ejection could be associated to an impact, and that the subsequent modeled activity is due to the asteroid partial or total disruption. The impact itself had produced the ejection of some 240 tons of dust." The team noted that, "...a conspicuous westward feature in the head of the comet-like object indicates that a significant fraction of the dust was ejected along a privileged direction, right at the beginning of the event." Let us also consider the case of P/2013 P5, an asteroid which was recently reclassified as a main belt comet. The asteroid astonished scientists around the world when it suddenly displayed six comet-like tails. One scientist said at the time, "It's hard to believe we're looking at an asteroid." The mystery for astronomers was apparent. How can a rocky asteroid grow and maintain highly collimated jets of material, forming the comet tails? An ad hoc theory arose to the effect that the asteroid suddenly began spinning faster for some reason. Possibly because, as one scientist suggested, pressure from sunlight exerted a torque on the body. This change in the asteroid spin-rate may have caused material to, "avalanche down slope towards the equator and maybe shatter and fall off, eventually drifting into space to make a tail." It was then suggested that radiation pressure stretched and comfined the dust into the comet tails. If mainstream astronomy is now recognizing electrostatic dust transportation on airless bodies in space then why is this not among the hypotheses considered for asteroid or comets' dust emission? Traditionally, astronomers have only envisioned minor electrostatic effects on asteroids and comet nuclei due to direct surface exposure to solar radiation and the solar wind. But for decades, surprising discoveries in the study of both comets and asteroids have demanded new theoretical pathways. Mysterious comet-like behaviours from asteroids are not a mystery. Comets and asteroids are not as different as astronomers have long believed. In the Electric Universe theory, as developed by Wal Thornhill, asteroids, comets and meteoroids were all born in interplanetary electrical events. Their distinctive orbital groupings and spectral features point to separate catastrophic events and to different planetary bodies involved in different phases of solar system history. Comet activity, including the production of the familiar coma and tail are not the result of sublimating ices due to solar warming. A long-standing mystery is why comets sometimes flare or even explode at vast distances from the Sun, much too far to explain through solar warming. This will happen when a comet experiences a sudden voltage spike when traveling through varying regions of electrical potential. One such source of a voltage spike is solar flares, a subject of growing scientific interest. At the recent Thunderbolts conference in Phoenix - Arizona, the Russian scientist dr. Subhon Ibadov proposed that a capacitor-like breakdown occurs between a comet's charged subsurface and a differently charged surface due to arriving protons from the Sun. In the electric universe theory of Wal Thornhill, any body moving on an elliptical orbit within the Sun's weak electric field can exhibit comet-like electrical discharge activity. Though of course on a much smaller scale, such behavior may have been recently witnessed when astronomers observed giant plumes jetting from the surface of Mars. Scientists recently reported the completely unexpected discovery that a coronal mass ejection hit Mars immediately before the plume was first spotted. The NewScientist report on the Discovery states, "One possibility is that plasma could be interacting with ice grains or dust lower down in the atmosphere and electrically charging them, boosting them higher, but it's not clear how the effect would be big." A similar phenomena may have been witnessed on the aforementioned asteroid P/2016 G1. Just as the Martian plumes were not caused by an impact, the asteroid's emission of dust, which initially ejected along a preferential direction, was most likely caused by an electrical discharge. Investigating scientists should explore the changes in the asteroids' plasma environment such as the asteroid's proximity to a planet's magnetotail. Just as the Earth's magnetotail has been found to create regular electrostatic dust storms on the Moon. With each new discovery, it seems that the behaviors of comets, asteroids and all bodies within our Sun's domain provide greater and greater affirmation that we live in an electric universe.

The Earth was once the center of the universe. It was flat. Then it was round and it circled the Sun. It was no longer the center of the universe. It was a tiny part of the Milky Way. The Milky Way was the only Galaxy. Except it wasn't. It was only one of billions of galaxies floating in space without end. Every single time we think we have got it all figured out, we realize we have merely found another piece of the picture. It is a big picture with many pieces. Sir Isaac Newton was the first to state the Law of Gravity. Eventually everybody agreed that gravity alone formed galaxies and that stars and planets and gravity alone holds the universe together. Then we discovered a force a 1000 billion billion billion billion times more powerful than the gravity. Until recently we believed that the space between the stars and planets was empty - a vacuum. We now know it is teaming with charged particles. We see glowing electric filaments spanning millions of light years. We see stellar and galactic formations shaped by magnetic fields. Only electric currents create magnetic fields. It is possible that the predominant force in the universe is not gravity but something else. Recent discoveries in space have amazed and perplexed astronomers. Currently popular theories in the sciences can neither predict nor explain the phenomena we are now observing. A new theory is being proposed, a theory which can both, predict and explain the data coming back from deep space. Its implications are profound and affect all scientific disciplines. It is in fact a synthesis of the disciplines, a synthesis which has already led to discoveries that link modern astronomy, leading edge plasma physics and ancient mythology. The electric model offers us a new interpretation of the workings of the universe, the history of our solar system and even human history. Myth & Science The rise of science was a triumph over mythology, over magic and superstition. That's why the word science today implies reliability. The word myth means fiction, not true and it turns out that the key to understanding the myth is the same key that is now helping us to understand objects in deep space, to understand the workings of the physical universe. That key is electricity. It was 33 years ago that I first began to wonder about these preposterous stories told around the world, what we call world mythology. What was it that provoked this incredible outpouring of human imagination just a few thousand years ago, just before the birth of the first civilizations? I came to a radical conclusion that the myth arose from extraordinary natural events. Our early ancestors witnessed things in the sky that are not seen today. The events were awe-inspiring, both beautiful and terrifying. So it shouldn't surprise us that the myth so incomprehensible Well, of course, they're incomprehensible. The celestial references are no longer present. It was in 1994 that I was invited to come to the US to attend a conference, which was dealing with the possibility that the ancient sky as witnessed by our earliest forebearers was different to the one we see today. I've been interested in this kind of idea because it could only be explained in terms of electromagnetic influences within the solar system. So, it came as a bit of a shock and as a surprise to see David Talbott showing slides at one of the sessions of the conference, which I recognized immediately as being similar to those of electric discharges in the laboratory. It was wonderful for me personally to come to my first Kronia meeting and hear David Talbott. And I still want to see some of those slides that he showed again and again and again. That explained the white crown of Egypt and the rest of these things that he showed us all from mythology all from thousands of years ago. These things clearly were seen by civilizations that never talked to each other from the far corners of the Earth. It all just click together like a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzles in my mind. Unity of Myth A breakthrough for me came when I realized that many different cultures spread around the world used different words, different symbols, different myths to describe precisely the same formations in the sky. The ouroboros or celestial serpent biting its tail for example occurs on every habitable continent but it has no ties to the world we now observe. Like all of the archetypes, it is part of an alien sky: a cosmic column rising to the center of the sky, holding aloft the wheel of heaven and much more than a wheel because this was the revolving cosmic temple, the city of the gods, the kingdom of heaven, always resting on the cosmic column. Then there is the image of the four rivers or pathways radiating from the center of the sky out to the boundary, the rim of the wheel. The simplest forms lead you invariably to the full story of world mythology. The hero's journey unfolds as the story of the wheel's axle. The mother goddess finds her identity in the star at the summit, the hub and spokes of the wheel. The Key From childhood on, I've always had a deep interest in mythology and I remember that as a child I was trying to draw up genealogies of the gods as provided in greek mythology and I soon found out that it didn't work nor did anything else in mythology seem to work. There was no singular fitting explanation that would make sense of these stories. So, I basically laid this whole subject to rest, and I didn't look at it for many years until I came across the work by Dave Talbott and Everett Cochrane mainly whose articles were real eye-opener for me and as soon as I began to read these articles it became clear to me that we were really looking here at a very important key to the unlocking of myth. And the recent findings provided by plasma physics are capable of providing that key. Based on the results we have seen so far and Dr Peratt's investigations with petroglyphs, which he matches successfully to laboratory experiments involving plasma, it has now become crystal clear and I think undeniable that the morphology of plasma as it manifests itself, both in the laboratory and in space, can account successfully for the major themes in mythology. To find the true meaning of the myths, we follow a forensic approach. The purpose is to expose the points of agreement between the different cultures because here at the level of the archetypes everything is unified. There are no isolated themes of myth at the level of the substructure. This is like a holograph, follow one archetype and its links to other archetypes, and you'll find one story told around the world. PLASMA The Fundamental State of Matter Throughout almost all of history we have regarded the states of matter as being solid, liquid or gas. But in the last century or so, we have found that there is a form of matter where the charged particles within atoms are separated to some degree or another and that is known as a plasma. It is the fundamental state of matter. It was not until the second half of the 20th-century that we came to realize the role of plasma in the universe, and this has changed the picture of space completely. Not long ago we thought of the physical universe as being constituted fundamentally of nothing more than atoms and empty space. But a plasma includes at least a percentage of charged particles, protons and electrons, that are not bound to any atomic structure, and plasma is an excellent conductor. Electrons will move efficiently in the direction of charge equalization, and that is an electric current of course. Now the reason why we see magnetic fields everywhere we look in space is because electric currents produce magnetic fields and only electric currents produce magnetic fields. But astronomers working only with gravitational equations did not anticipate the discovery of pervasive magnetic fields in deep space. Electric currents also account for the abundant filamentation of space plasma. First the electric currents produce the magnetic fields then these fields confine the electron flow to narrow paths. Such currents paths are filaments called Birkeland currents, named after the pioneer, Kristian Birkeland. They are typically braided just like the twisted wires of transmission lines on Earth. Well, that's their role in space: to conduct electricity across vast distances, creating the astonishing structures we observe in every direction. None of these structures were anticipated by gravitational theory, and none are indicated by the behavior of neutral gases in a vacuum. In any theory of the universe, plasma is extremely important because it has been found since the space age that it makes up 99.99 percent of the visible universe. So our inexperience with it on the Earth's surface is rather crippling when it comes to trying to decide on a cosmology to explain the visible universe. Now, plasma behaves rather oddly compared to normal matter, the matter we find as solids, liquids and gases on Earth. If we look at a novelty plasma ball, you will see that it forms these bright filaments that dart all around inside the globe. And if you look closely at them, you'll see they are actually twin filaments twisted together. In other words nature finds it efficient to be able to transfer energy over a distance by twisting two pairs of filaments together, and this is a characteristic of the way plasma carries electric currents in space. And one of the puzzles that has faced astronomers since the space age is the discovery of filamentary structures in galaxies, around stars, even the cometary tails of planets and comets themselves. These filamentary structures have come as a surprise. Plasma is Scalable We now have plasma physicists who are doing important experiments in laboratories around the world. And one of the virtues of plasma experiments is that they can be scaled over an enormous numbers of magnitudes. In other words, a discharge phenomenon that may be seen in the laboratory that occupies only a few centimeters can be scaled up to the size of a galaxy and you will see the same structures. Now, this introduces a new area into cosmology where we can do experiments on Earth, which can verify our ideas or theories about how the rest of the universe works. Similar Patterns in the Lab and in the Sky Some of the natural consequences of electric cosmology are the patterns that we see, both in the laboratory and in the sky. A very good example of this is the work of Dr Anthony Peratt, who was a graduate student of the very famous Hannes Alfvén, who was really the father of electric cosmology. Peratt simulated on a super computer using just a cloud of electrical charges and a magnetic field just using the laws of electrical science, not using anything to do with gravity. He simulated what looked like a spiral galaxy. And the interesting thing is that Peratt's spiral galaxy in the laboratory had exactly the same rotational properties as the real spiral galaxies that we see in the sky. Plasma, Gods & Monsters Plasma was named by Irving Langmuir because of its life-like qualities. In other words, the similarity to blood plasma gave rise to the term "plasma" now used in the sciences. Well, this has incredible meaning for us because of the nature of the metamorphosing. The god, who is now an eagle, now a serpent or dragon, now a leonine figure with long flowing hair. These figures take on a whole new meaning when we can interpret them with the benefit of plasma science. Cosmology The new instrumentation that was developed in the space age expanded our ability to perceive things, perceive facts. We can now see things in the entire electromagnetic spectrum instead of just the narrow sliver of visible light. And we had sensors that were out in space. We were freed from the geocentric and anthropocentric order that had prevailed before. We've got a whole new universe, and theoreticians are still trying to look at it through [a friend of mine says they’re peering through] the wrong end of the telescope [and trying] and telling us what they imagine they see. The Disconnected View Modern cosmology gives us a rather disconnected view of the universe. In other words, we are separated star from star by vast distances. Light takes a long time to travel between stars and across galaxies, and, therefore, we look upon ourselves as isolated and disconnected. The Electric Universe takes a different view. It says that we are part of the sun's environment, electrical environment, and the sun is a part of the galactic environment and the galaxy itself is strung like all galaxies on huge electric currents flowing through the universe. Electricity in Space? One of the typical questions that plasma cosmologists hear all the time is: How do you know what's out there in space? How do you know there's electricity out there in space? Is there energy out there in space? Why should we consider anything more than gravity? And the answer is that through the years we've used optical telescopes but recently we have what are called radio telescopes and we've broadened the spectrum that we can look at the sky with. And those radio telescopes can measure electric currents and magnetic fields and we can determine from those measurements the strength of the electric currents, the strength of the forces involved and the amount of energy that's stored out there in space. Relativity & Quantum Physics The two major pillars of modern cosmology are based on the theories of relativity and Quantum Theory and as Einstein himself noted the two are incompatible. And that is maybe because the theories of relativity deal with matter as if it's only consequence is the bending of space. The Electric Universe, on the other hand, deals with the electrical structure of matter at the subatomic level then works its way up through living systems if you like, planets, stars, galaxies and the entire universe and shows that it is the electrical structure of matter that forms the amazing shapes we see in deep space. Magnetic Fields We can demonstrate the existence of these currents flowing between galaxies and between stars by the presence of the magnetic fields they generate. Magnetic fields are threaded through space at all dimensions, within the solar system, on the surface of the sun, between stars, and within galaxies and even between galaxies. Now magnetic field can only be generated by electric currents. So, in other words, to continue that magnetic field for any length of time requires that there be electrical power input into those magnetic fields. And that raises the whole question: Where does this power come from? The Mathematical Cosmology Modern cosmology is highly mathematical. In fact, we were joking before about the idea that the only people who understand cosmology are professional cosmologists. The basis of cosmology really if you hunt for it lies in Einsteinian relativistic mechanics and, when Einstein promulgated his ideas, he totally and completely ignored anything electrical. And so the modern cosmology with all of its ideas of Omega and expanding universe and inflation theory and the Big Bang and all the rest of it are predicated on a foundation which ignores almost half of man's knowledge about the way the universe works, which is electricity. It may sound like I am dismissing Einstein and his theories of relativity out of hand but we have to give Einstein credit for his integrity in pointing out that his theory did not meet his requirements, and that is that his theory had to be tied back to some form of reality. And there is no explanation as to why matter should curve space to give the effect of gravity. He felt that quantum theory being a probabilistic theory divorced cause and effect. And this is one of the things you can not do in physics, is divorce cause and effect, otherwise you might as well give up and get a real job. But this is a puzzle that dogged Einstein through his later years to the point that his followers tended to go off and use his geometrical explanations to conjure up things like black holes and neutron stars and so on and the expansion of the universe and the Big Bang without referring back to Einstein, who with great integrity said he wasn't satisfied with his explanation. Black Holes One of the problems faced by astronomers, after the space age began, was to explain the discovery of very concentrated outbursts of energy in deep space. And that meant for them, since gravity is the only driving force available to them, that they require an infinite concentration of mass because gravity is an infinitely weak force. The black hole as Wheeler originally visualized it sucked everything, including light, in and so therefore was invisible. So, he could postulate its existence, and we couldn't see it. And because we couldn't see it, we couldn't prove that it wasn't there. Later on, in order to explain these fantastic emissions of energy from galaxies, it was proposed, and I believe it was Stephen Hawking who did it, that there were various types of black holes, some of which actually then spat matter back out again in jets because why, because we had observed jets. In the electrical model, it's quite simple if you think about it. The power that's expressed in your own home in the heaters and the electric motors and the lighting and so on is actually generated at a vast distance away from your house. In deep space the same thing is true. The energy, which we see concentrated in these events, which are attributed to black holes and so, can more easily be explained as the confluence of electric energy from different parts of the same galaxy or even from other parts of the universe. And it is this explosive release of energy which forms the vast jets that we see lit up and exploding from the centers of active galaxies. We also have observed double radio sources either side of galaxies and that event was predicted by Hannes Alfvén the founding father of modern electrical cosmology and is still to this day unexplained by standard cosmology. The Pulsar One interesting phenomenon in the sky is the so-called Pulsar. The pulsar is an object, that is observed to put out pulses, both of light and radio activity in the RF [radio frequency] spectrum, and those pulses are extremely rapid. They are something like milliseconds apart. So, it's like an extremely fast strobe light. And, thinking this of a strobe light, astronomers immediately leapt to the lighthouse kind of analogy. Something must be spinning around, a beam was going around, and its going around so quickly that this thing goes flash, flash, flash. Well, once the repetition rate of the pulsars was observed to get up to in the millisecond range that meant that this star that was putting out this beam of radiation would have had to be rotating at three hundred times a second. And three hundred times a second, we're talking about the speed of a dentist’s drill. So, the astronomers decided, well, normal stars couldn't possibly rotate at that speed and so they postulated the existence of what they called a neutron star. A neutron star is a star that is so dense that it holds together so well, that it can, indeed, rotate at the speed of a dentist's drill. Well, the problem is that in nuclear chemistry we know that you can't pack neutrons together that densely. They will all fly apart instantaneously. There is a [thing] a principle called the Island of Stability in nuclear chemistry that absolutely prevents that. So, here again we have the standard astronomers or astrophysicists going directly against another well-developed science. In the electrical model, however, there is a very simple explanation for pulsars. Everybody is familiar with the idea that pulses can travel back and forth on electrical transmission lines. Such uncontrolled pulses for example were responsible for the famous northeast black outs. A similar effect can occur between two binary stars connected by a plasma. The two binary stars act like capacitors that store charge. And if you reduce that in size to something you can produce in the laboratory, you can produce it in the laboratory, and it's called relaxation oscillator. Electrical engineers use it, and have used it, for decades. The idea of producing pulses every few milliseconds is a sophomore level of experiment in electrical engineering laboratory. It doesn't require neutronium, strange matter or any other fictitious device. All it requires is two capacitors, a battery and and a nonlinear resistor. And we maintain that's exactly what a binary pair of stars connected by a plasma field presents. Magnetic Force vs. Gravitational Force A typical ion in the solar wind hydrogen nucleus moving about 20 km per second, which is relatively slow for the ions in solar wind, in the magnetic field of the sun experiences potentially magnetic forces that are something like 10 million times the strength of the gravitational force on that same ion from the sun. An interesting demonstration that illustrates very readily the relative strength of magnetic force and gravitational force is the simple idea of a ball bearing sitting on a wooden table. The entire mass of the Earth is pulling downward on that little ball bearing, and that's what prevents it from flying out into the space. But a child can come along with a little horseshoe magnet, and click, can pick that ball bearing up instantly. The space age presents us with an interesting paradox. That technology of science is really quite extraordinary. And technology has taken us out into space, taken us to the Moon, taken probes to distant planets, opened up whole new vistas in remote space with new telescopes and new ways of measuring what's happening in space. But the picture of theoretical sciences is much different. And many decades ago, assumptions began to crystallize in the theoretical sciences, beginning at the top, that the queen of the sciences, as we say, which is cosmology. These theoretical assumptions have constrained all of the other theoretical sciences. Cosmology deals with the big picture questions, the first questions. How did the universe begin? What is it made of? How will it end? And so many popular theoretical constructs from the big bang to string theory, to dark matter and black holes, the formation of stars, formation of galaxies, all have arisen from assumptions first postulated by cosmologists. At the same time these assumptions have defined boundaries for other theoretical sciences, working down from astronomy and astrophysics to the space sciences, solar theory, even Earth history, even human history, have all been confined by these boundaries established by the queen of the sciences: cosmology. Sun The sun just dominates our sky as the source of light and warmth and life itself on Earth. This preeminence of the sun is so clear and obvious that it remains a mystery why virtually every ancient culture insisted that before the present sun there was a quite different luminary ruling the sky. The central sun, the superior sun, the best sun, the motionless sun. And all of these cultures, whatever may be the meaning of these traditions, are insisting that the sky has changed. Of course, our ideas about the sun have continually changed. Only a few centuries ago the sun was a campfire or ember in the sky. Then early in the 20th-century, under the influence of gravitational theory, the sun was seen as a gravitationally collapsing nebular cloud. In the atomic age, astronomers began to visualize the sun in terms of a nuclear furnace hidden at its core. But now we are in the age of plasma science. With discoveries of the electric currents in space, and it's inconceivable that these discoveries would not change the picture of the sun again. An Electric Phenomenon Plasma cosmologists have been able to demonstrate experimentally and also in a supercomputer that galaxies are an electrical phenomenon. Which raises the question about stars and in particular our own sun, which is the closest star to the Earth, of course. Any theory of the Sun has to explain how it could continue to burn for billions of years and also explain its present size based on its known mass. And of course, as soon as nuclear energy was discovered, it was grasped immediately as the energy source of the Sun. But all of that assumes that the Sun is disconnected and an isolated body, and that it must consume itself over its lifetime to provide the heat and life that we receive from it. But if the Sun is connected to the rest of the galaxy in an electrical sense, it doesn't require to burn itself at all. And the energy that we receive is actually being received from the galaxy, and the sun is acting as a focus for that energy. The Sun is actually a fairly typical star. And so, if we want to understand stars and cosmology, we really have to understand the Sun. And the Standard Model of the Sun, so-called, that astronomers are so very proud of these days, really doesn't explain very much about the Sun. Why is there a corona in the first place? Everybody knows about the corona, the beautiful corona that we see during solar eclipses. Why is it there? It is clearly an electrical phenomenon. Coronal Heating One of the greatest puzzles about the Sun has been: with the surface temperature of six thousand degrees [Fahrenheit], high above that surface we have temperatures of millions of degrees. And the question has been: How do we get the energy from the center of the Sun somehow past that surface to heat the upper atmosphere of the Sun to millions of degrees? In an electric model you don't have that problem because if the energy is arriving from outside the Sun, the first place you expect to see that energy expressed is above the Sun and its tenuous atmosphere. And that is the place where particle acceleration occurs, and the apparent temperature goes very high indeed, often into the millions of degrees. Solar Wind The fact that the particles in the solar wind accelerate, that is to say increase their velocity with increasing distance away from the Sun. The farther away they get the faster they go. And the fact those particles are indeed charged particles, leads me as an electrical engineer to come to the immediate conclusion that this is an electrical process. In the Solar Model, think of the Sun as being a positive anode, a very high voltage body that obviously would emanate an electric field. And if you put a charged particle in an electric field it will accelerate. That's the way we accelerate particles here on Earth. It's the way every physicist and electro-dynamicist has ever increased the velocity of a charged particle, is put it in an electric field. Sunspots One of the features we observe on the Sun, which have no business being there according to the Standard Model, are sunspots. The most significant thing about a sunspot is the fact that the center of a sunspot is dark. And if the Sun is trying to radiate energy from its core into space, we should expect that it is bright. And if you think about that umbra, the darkest place in the center of sunspots, that's the place where we can see deepest into the Sun. And just consider the fact that, at that point where we can really see down into the Sun, that's the absolute coldest place that we are able to measure. If the center of the Sun is really a nuclear fusion furnace, it should be the hottest because we're closest to the source. And it's not the case. We ask any astronomer, why are there sunspots? Why are the umbra dark? They would blame it on some sort of warp-twisted magnetic fields. They will say that it has to do with the solar dynamo. All of which lurk unseen like a big genie somewhere below the surface. These phenomena are only to be expected if the Sun is electrical in nature. Fusion Model Astrophysicists make the claim that the Solar Fusion Model has indeed been tested in a laboratory. And nothing really is further from the truth. Although each of the steps involved in the hydrogen to helium fusion reaction have indeed been verified experimentally, the overall experiment, the overall reaction has never been produced in a continuous laboratory experiment. Continuous Hydrogen to Helium fusion has not been attained in the lab. The strength in fact of the electric cosmology is that indeed all of the mechanisms that the electrical people talk about have been verified over decades, in fact at least a century in the laboratory. The plasma scaling is well-known and plasma and electrical experiments have verified every step of the way. Fusion Model, No Explanations There are any number of observations that have ad hoc present explanations, but really have no explanation in the Standard Model and are natural consequences of the electrical model. For example, heavy elements, the solar spectrum, the neutrino deficiency, the neutrino variability, solar atmosphere, differential rotation by latitude, differential rotation by depth, equatorial plasma torus, sunspots, sunspot migration, the sunspot penumbra and the sunspot cycle itself, magnetic field strength, the even magnetic field, helio seismology, solar density and the changing size. All of the observations in that list are natural consequences of the Electrical Sun Model. Standard astronomers tend to pass them off as being inconsequential difficulties that will eventually someday be solved. I maintain, and so do our colleagues here, that these are not inconsequential but are rather death blows to the Solar Fusion Model because they are important. They're not secondary. They are primary falsifying observations for that failed nuclear fusion model. What I find so fascinating about the electric model of the Sun is not just that it is a challenge to a long-standing theory but that it opens the door to the ancient world, to an electric sky. The electromagnetic phenomenon that we now observe on the surface of the Sun and in the vicinity of the Sun are direct pointers backwards to the plasma formations that were seen above the ancient sky worshipers. Comet Electric Currents in Space Electrical currents in space can either be invisible or they can be visible. If they are very diffuse, in other words, if there is very little energy per cubic meter, they will be invisible. But where that energy becomes concentrated, it will begin to glow. And we see this kind of thing in the ion tails of comets, for instance. Where the energy becomes very concentrated, we begin to see arcs and sparks, if you like, electrical discharge phenomena. Standard Theory of Comets The Standard Theory of comets comes from the view that the solar system was formed from a rotating cloud of gas and dust and that the planets, in some fashion as yet unexplained, completely formed from most of that gas and dust but there were leftovers. And the leftovers are beyond sight outside the solar system in a hypothetical Oort cloud, as it's called. We have no observational evidence for such a cloud. The Electric Universe Model of comets is that they are actually parts of well-differentiated planetary bodies that have in the past suffered from electrical plasma discharge machining, and that some of the surface material has been lofted into space. So, it is expected to be rocky. The second thing is that because comets trace an elongated orbit, both away from the Sun and toward the Sun, in that trajectory its charge changes, its voltage changes. Since it spends most of its time in the outer solar system, the voltage that it has reflects the voltage in the outer solar system. But as it hurtles towards the Sun, as it enters toward the Earth orbit, the voltage is changing rapidly and the comet has to respond to that by beginning to discharge and that's where we see the familiar cometary phenomena of the coma and the various tails that it produces. This creates a very distinct difference between the two models, the Standard Model of a comet, which is supposed to be a dust and ice leftover from the formation of the solar system, and the Electrical Model, which says that a comet is an electrical body, which begins to discharge as it enters the inner solar system. Comet 'Jets' Ever since we began to look at comets in close-up, and Halley was the first one that was observed by several spacecraft close-up, it was found to astronomer's surprise that the material coming off the comet was coming in discrete jets and seemed to be coming from what looked like circular areas on the crater. But the imagry wasn't sufficiently sharp to be able to tell exactly what was going on. This required the Standard Model to come up with an idea that maybe the surface of the comet is coated in black tarry substance or something which was preventing the material from just evaporating from the surface and forming jets as it burst through the surface. But when later images were looked at as we passed other comets, it was found to the astronomers amazement that they were seeing very sharp relief. It was not like a melted ice cream, it was looking like a piece of heavily cratered rock. Now this fits the Electric Model of the electrical discharge birth of such a body. In other words, there is rather no distinction between an asteroid and a comet other than its orbit. Comet Tempel One It was in this context that I looked at Comet Tempel 1, which was chosen as the target for an impact. The idea was that the impact would create a small crater, which could then be photographed by the passing spacecraft and we can determine whether the material was ice or dust or rock based on the size of the impact crater. It seemed to me that, if this comet was a charged body, there would be several other effects that were unexpected. Principally as a metal copper object approached the comet, there should be an electric discharge to that copper projectile. In other words, there will be an initial flash and then there would be the impact itself. And the impact, I suggested, would be far more energetic than was expected because it would tend to concentrate the electrical discharge in the area of the impact and also it may change the nature of the jets nearby. So, it was with great interest that I waited the results of the impact and watched that on television. Before the impact, the astronomers in the assembled control room were worried that they wouldn't see anything, that the impact would result in a very small puff of dust and that would be the end of it. So, when the impact occurred, they were surprised by two things. One was that there was an initial flash followed by the main impact which was so energetic that some of the sensors were almost swamped and the passing spacecraft was unable to achieve it's primary aim, which was to photograph the crater. Comet Tempel One Finely Divided Dust Apart from the surprising brightness of the dust released from the impact with Comet Tempel 1 was due to the fact that it was so intense and so wide-spread and one of the initial findings was that it seems to be very finely divided dust. Now this is the same thing that was found at Comet Halley, and it was a surprise then. So, it's rather surprising that they were surprised once more. The point is that an electrical discharge on a surface will release material, dusty material, very finely divided. It's a technique that's used in sputtering of metals on to, for instance, astronomical mirrors. So this production of very fine dust is to be expected in the Electrical Model. But in the Standard Model you are asking ices to evaporate or to sublimate and in doing so to drive off pre-existing dust grains. So there is no way that the dust can be finely divided; it will be in its pristine state. So, the production of this great cloud of very fine dust is rather inexplicable in the Standard Model. Comets & Electromagnetic Forces The Electrical Model of comets was driven for several people by Velikovsky's challenge that the solar system had electromagnetic forces to be taken into account. One of the early pioneers in addressing this issue of comets and electrical phenomenon was Ralph Juergens. When he proposed the electrical model of the Sun, it implied that all bodies in the solar system must have to some degree a cometary appearance or a cometary effect associated with them. Electric Forces Induce Cometary Display Ralph Juergens in his model of the Sun showed that bodies moving radially toward or away from the Sun would experience electrical forces which could induce a cometary display, as a visible display. Also working in late years with Ralph Juergens was Dr Earl Milton, and he made some predictions and statements about the impact of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 fragments with Jupiter. And his view of the electrical nature of those impacts was also vindicated. Venus with Comet Tail In the Electrical Model of the solar system any body moving away from or toward the Sun at any great rate, for example like a comet, will experience electrical effects, which result in a cometary appearance, and that can apply to a planet. Now Velikovsky in his research found that Venus was described as a stupendous comet at some point in ancient times. So, it was very gratifying for him to be able to announce at a conference in 1974 that astronomers had discovered what they called a cometary tail of Venus. Some years later it was announced that it was discovered that stringy things were coming from Venus and, of course, this was confirmation to the Electrical Model because plasma currents flow in strings. This discovery of a cometary aspect of Venus raises the issue of the intense heat we find on Venus. That intense heat is not well explained at all by the idea that the planet is somehow a twin of the Earth. It raises the distinct possibility that Venus has had a far more dynamic history than would have been taught. Comets and Catastrophe Our ancient ancestors were obsessed with the comet. Let the slightest wisp of a comet appear in the sky and all of humanity was thrown into terror. But why was this? It was cosmic catastrophe that inspired the ancient words and phrases for the comet. The comet was the torch of the sky, the sword hanging over the world, the spiraling serpent or dragon, the spiraling sidelock or ribbon, the angry or lamenting goddess soaring across the sky, her hair disordered and blowing in the wind. Anyone exploring the roots of the ancient comet fears is going to run into the work of Immanuel Velikovsky, the controversial theorist who suggested that there is a reason for that fear of comets around the world. We experienced this horrific cometary catastrophe. The world was devastated by a comet just a few thousand years ago, and Velikovsky went further. He said that not long ago planets appeared in the sky with comet-like attributes. In particular, he named the planet Venus as the great comet of antiquity. Both Wal Thornhill and I disagreed with many components of Velikovsky's reconstruction but we also felt that Velikovsky had nailed certain principles that can help us to understand the early cultures. In particular, Velikovsky was correct in naming the planet Venus as the great comet. And the cometary language of Venus goes far beyond anything that Velikovsky himself published. In every corner of the world, the language of the comet and the language of Venus are identical: Venus as serpent or dragon, Venus as torch in the sky, Venus as long-haired star, Venus as bearded star. The Sumerian goddess Innana was identified as Venus. She was the lady of life but in her terrible aspect she became a dragon-like flame in the sky. The texts say: "Like a dragon you have deposited venom on the land...", "Raining the fanned fire down upon the nation..." Innana became a roaring storm, "With a roaring storm you roar..." she devastated the land. "Devastatrix of the Lands..." "Mankind comes before you in fear and trembling at your tempestuous radiance...", the texts say. Innana's Babylonian counterpart Ishtar was also identified as Venus. "She was the shining torch of Heaven and Earth...", "...furious and irresistible onslaught..." "I rain down like flames...", the goddess announces. The Egyptian goddess Sekhmet has the same attributes. She takes the form of a fiery Uraeus serpent. She becomes "A flame of fire in her tempest...", "A star scattering its flame in fire..." Sekhmet herself says: "The fear of me is in their hearts..." and "The awe of me is in their hearts..." "No one at all can approach her...", the Coffin Texts say. "The streams behind her are flames of fire..." The astonishing fact is that goddesses everywhere exhibit this terrifying cometary aspect. The Canaanite Anat, the Hindu Kali and Durga, the Greek Aphrodite, Athena, Medusa and countless others. And, of course, you can add numerous counterparts in the New World from the Incan goddess Chasca to the Aztec goddess Xochiquetzal to the legendary Nokomis of North American Indian tribes. The serpent or dragon is an unexplained mystical archetype. There is nothing like it anywhere in the biological world. And yet, the same recurring features will be found in cultures the world over. The dragon's disheveled hair and shaggy beard its knotted aspect, and its world-wide appearances as entwined twins, its fiery or lightning-like emanations, and its effusive feathers. In all of the ancient serpent or dragon images, it's the luminous, filamentary, braided, spiraling, metamorphosing and the destructive aspect that stand out, the very traits of high energy plasma discharge. The attributes of these mythic monsters remain unexplained only until we see the hairy and feathery attributes of the electric arc in the laboratory. We see precisely the same thing in enhanced images of the comet's tail. And we see the same thing in the comet-like discharges of distant nebulas. Gases in a vacuum don't behave this way but electrified plasma does. INTERSECT The recent discoveries about the comet have astonished astronomers. Extreme ultraviolet light, X-rays, supersonic jets, sharply etched surface relief, and cometary nuclei fragmenting explosively, no one expected such high energy events. The Electric Model proposes that the comet is a charged object moving through an electric field. This would explain these phenomenon. But what is creating the electric field? Suddenly everything changes and we are talking about an electric Sun, electric stars and electric cosmology and a whole new way of looking at how the universe works. The End Dedicated to Amy Acheson -- 1946-2005 
Stephen Smith on Planetary Catastrophism & Electrical Scarring of Planets and Moon - Part One Scientists now working with the Thunderbolts Project have proposed a new theory of our Solar System and its history. In the relatively recent past, only thousands of years ago, several planets moved on unstable paths and engaged in violent electrical exchanges. However, the apparent clockwork regularity of planetary motions today precludes many scientists from considering the planetary instability. But let us consider the evidence that these events did in fact occur. In part one of this extended interview, Thunderbolts Picture Of the Day managing editor, Stephen Smith, offers an introduction to the theory of planetary catastrophism and the electrical scarring of planets and moons. We begin by asking the question, where did this theory of recent celestial catastrophe come from? It's difficult to say exactly where the idea of electrical scarring arose since there have been myths as far back as we can trace that talk about Gods hurling energetic weapons at one another and striking various objects like the Moon or the Earth. The myth of Phaeton and Helios comes to mind as an example of an Earth-based catastrophic event. Phaeton, as most people realize, stole the sun-god's chariot and he lost control and steered close to Earth causing a disastrous fire that, according to Greek myths, was worldwide. So from a scientific standpoint some early proponents of planetary scarring were probably people like Ignatius Donnelly, who in the late 1800s thought that Earth in particular had suffered a terrible catastrophe involving the approach of a giant comet. And then later, Immanuel Velikovsky wrote 'Worlds and Collision' where he proposed a similar catastrophe due to the interaction of planetary bodies with Earth, especially Venus and Mars. The two theories, from Donnelly and Velikovsky, have been expanded as time has gone on and they've been modified because planetary probes and solar satellites have made essential discoveries about the electrical nature of planetary plasma-spheres. Each planet, moon in the solar system is pretty much immersed in a sea of a great electric field generated by the Sun. And that field is formed because of the action of electrically charged particles streaming through the solar system. And that stream or actually a storm of particles, is called the solar wind and it's composed of plasma. And plasma, you hear it often described as the fourth state of matter, but since it makes up more than 99% of the universe, in my opinion it should be considered the first state of matter. And as I just mentioned of course, the Sun is an example of plasma. Now the general idea that Earth is somehow an electrical entity, is probably thousands of years old but it's only been in the last hundred years that scientists have given credence to the possibility that we are living in a dynamic solar system where electricity is an important factor. The Sun's electric field extends for billions of kilometers and it influences the planets, it influences their motions, it influences how they interact with each other and it maintains the various charge signatures or electrical potential of each of the planetary bodies. Now, several members of the Thunderbolts group including Dave Talbott, Wal Thornhill, Mel Acheson and me for that matter, have come to the conclusion that Earth and other planetary bodies and moons in the solar system were probably impacted by huge bursts of electrical energy sometime in the recent past and that would be the fairly recent past. And my personal opinion is that what we see on various rocky bodies in our neighborhood, was caused by the action of gigantic lightning bolts and clouds of electrically energized plasma, rather than asteroid impacts. Scientists on Earth were surprised when space probes returned images of heavily tortured planetary surfaces and enigmatic features that conventional geologists have been unable to explain. Planetary scientists were stunned by images from the first flyby of Mars in 1964. I think it was, that was Mariner 4. And in fact, the giant Valley, Valles Marineris on Mars, is named for that mission, it's the Mariner Valley. The surface of Mars was a complete surprise to the mission team. No one thought that Mars would look more like the Moon than anywhere else. So as far as lunar missions were conducted in the 60s and 70s, more craters on the Moon and huge cracks and what they call sinuous rills, were discovered there and sinuous rills are deep canyons on the Moon and they run for a thousand kilometres or more through the terrain. And one of the most puzzling things about some of the rills is that they go uphill and downhill. If they were formed from flowing lava, then they certainly defy the laws of physics, that's for sure. So Mars and the Moon have a lot of similar structures. Mars exhibits sinuous rills just like the Moon. They wind across its surface for great distances and I might say also that the moons of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune also possess nearly identical features. On Jupiter's moon Europa, for example, deep rills nearly cover its entire surface. On Dione, one of Saturn's moons, there are cliff faces that crisscross the landscape and what they do is they outline gigantic fissures that are many kilometers deep. So you could name practically any moon in the solar system and I could point out features that are difficult to explain when we rely on conventional theories. For generations, geologists have envisioned planetary landscapes shaped incrementally over eons of time. But does this approach actually explain what we see on Earth and other planetary bodies? Most children are taught geological theories on a simplistic level when they enter elementary school. They're taught about erosion, the principle that wind and rain are natural processes that take millions of years to create the various formations on Earth. I remember being taught that rain is a carbonic acid solution that dissolves rock. It changes that to carbon dioxide and other minerals that gets swept down into the rivers and then to the ocean. This weathering is thought by conventional geologists, to erode the mountains in time spans that they mark as hundreds of millions of years. And that's rain and then wind is supposed to carry dust particles in sand that scour away cliff faces. It's slowly eroding them down. Steep valleys are said to gradually become shallow meanders and sharp mountains flatten out into rolling hills that eventually disappear. Freezing water expands pushing cracks and boulders apart every winter and after millions of years they're said to crumble into pebbles that pile up into mountains of gravel and form sandy beaches or desert dunes. But since the earliest days of the Thunderbolts Project there's been a suspicion that something's really wrong with that long slow view of geology. Now I know it seems like what I'm saying is far too sweeping and that I'm trying to supplant so-called normal geological processes with unproven hypotheses, but since I can only provide a cursory view of these ideas during the interview, it's important to take what I'm saying at face value and the listeners should look into the matter more closely when they have the opportunity. I've written scores of papers that discuss these ideas so they'd be a good place to start. Some of the most interesting things I've discovered in my research are, for example, forests of mineralized trees under some of the deepest ice in Antarctica. Cores that they've drilled through the ice sometimes contains scorched and petrified wood when it's brought up to the surface. Mineralized trees are also prevalent in the Prairie, in the American Prairie, and elsewhere in the world. They're called petrified forests and they often contain thousands of shattered and splintered tree trunks that have been turned to stone. There are fossilized animals in literally unbelievable numbers encased in sedimentary rock that's been hardened into stone and these deposits are hundreds of meters thick. And you can find millions of fish skeletons that look like they're swimming through sandstone. So I ask what force can fossilize fish leaving their skeletons in lifelike postures as if they were killed and turned to stone in an instant? How could it keep them whole without being crushed or scattered? Also there's anomalous formations on Earth that can't be readily explained and some of them I've written about would be like the great Trango Tower in Pakistan, the Brandberg Massif in Namibia, Shiprock - New Mexico, Ayers Rock, the Olgas in Australia, mount Thor on Baffin Island, then Table Mountain in South Africa for instance. Now when the Cassini space probe entered orbit around Saturn, it found that several of Saturn's moons also demonstrated electrical scarring. There's signs of electric discharge machining everywhere. Cathode sputtering, anode blisters and sinuous rills. They're cut into those moons. For example, Tethys is a moon of Saturn. It's only about a thousand kilometers in diameter, yet it's got huge scars on its surface in comparison to its size. Saturn's other moons exhibit the same difficulties with scale, moons of small mass with craters and canyons that are hundreds of kilometers wide. On Tethys, for example, there's Ithaca Chasma and the Odysseus multi-ring formation, as it's called. Now, Odysseus is 400 km wide. And remember Tethys itself is only 1,000 km in diameter. Odysseus has steep walls, its interior is flat, it has wide terraces along its walls and in the center is a circular mountain range. They call it the crown of Tethys and it's more than 5 km high and 100 km in diameter. Ithaca Chasma, that I just mentioned, is 1,000 km long and 100 km wide and it's also 2 km deep. So since frozen, barren, airless moons and a warm, water-rich, oxygen planet like Earth are home to bizarre landforms and structures that defy convention I think it's a mistake to use Earth-based geological theories as a model for the formation of what we see out there. Rather I think we should do the exact opposite and use what we find in the Solar System to model the topography of Earth. Scientists generally envision only two processes when explaining craters on planetary surfaces, impacts and volcanism. But countless crater formations routinely defy these explanations. As far as craters on planets and moons, those are easy to see because the moon is so close to us that we can get some idea of what a heavily cratered body might look like. But contrary to the impact of giant asteroids or extinct volcanoes being the cause of these craters, they have highly anomalous features. For example, they have flat, melted-looking floors. They have very steep sidewalls. Now you would think that an impact would create a conical formation that's rather chaotic-looking and not leave vertical sidewalls on the sides of a flat melted crater floor. There's also a lack of blast debris around the crater. There's no giant fields of boulders and dust starting out with large objects and then tapering off to small objects around these craters. In fact, the surroundings look like they're as clean as the crater floors themselves. There are also dendritic ridges extending up the sides and I know Dave Talbott has done quite a bit of research on dendritic ridges, particularly on Mars. But those same dendritic ridges are found on the Moon and they're also found on the crater walls on other planetary moons. Some of the craters have ramparts around them, in other words, the crater is inside of a raised mound and surrounding sometimes these ramparts are moats, their deep trenches carved around the exterior of the crater walls. Craters (lay) often have offset multiple rings. Just like I mentioned earlier on Tethys, craters have central peaks or bulges. Now a lot of planetary scientists claim that those peaks or bulges are due to what I call it, what's called rebound effect, that when an asteroid hit, it melted the surroundings and it started to rise up like you sometimes see slow-motion films of water-drops, where they rise up and leave a peak in the center, briefly. And they contend that that's been caused by the same sort of rebound effect. However, those central Peaks are often steep and sharp. They have flat sides, there are often multiple peaks and a lot of times the bulges in the centers of craters are criss-crossed by deep channels. So I don't understand how any of that sort of formation could exist when you're talking about a rebounding liquid that then hardens. You would think it would be a slumped-looking, rounded, relatively coherent looking bulge and not these trenched bulges or sharply pointed peaks. Another interesting thing about craters on the moon and other bodies, is that they have hexagonal or other polygonal shapes. I've seen craters on Mars, for example, that are square! So I have no idea how an impactor is going to leave a hexagon or a square when it strikes a solid surface. There's closely spaced chains of craters. You have smaller craters on the rims of larger craters and in fact that seems to be a preferred formation. When you look at craters on Mercury, for example, you see these wide-angle views that show hundreds of craters within the field. On more than half of them, you see multiple craters on the rims of larger craters. The craters often have scalloped edges too, like they've been cut out with a cookie cutter and one of the perfect examples of that is Victoria crater on Mars that a lot of people are probably familiar with. It got a lot of press when the Opportunity Rover parked on its edge for quite some time. Unbeknownst to many scientists today, experiments with both plasma discharge and electrical discharge machining have reproduced many of the cratering patterns that defy conventional reasoning. Plasma discharges are scalable. When you look at formations created in the laboratory, for example, Dr. C.J. Ransom at Vemasat labs performed several experiments where he blasted different materials with rapid electric discharges at a very short duration. He formed domed craters. In other words, you've got a big old crater with a melted looking interior and a dome in the center and those formations can be seen on Mars, particularly at the South Pole. He formed bullseye craters, that is craters with multiple rims, one inside the other. He created various sample materials, sandstone and calcium carbonate and other materials that might be found on planets and moons, and when he exposed them to these fast transient electric discharges, he created a lot of different formations that we see. It's not exactly electric discharge machining but electric discharge machining is an industrial process where they use high-energy electrical discharges to machine metal. And they use it because it gauges out tiny little pits in the metal, leaving very, very smooth surfaces. So they can make very complex metallic forms that don't require a lot of finishing. And when you look at some of these surfaces under an electron microscope, and then compare, for example, some of the formations on Mars, it looks, you could almost tell that Mars must have also been electrically discharge-machined. Since the Earth and all of the bodies within the Sun's electrical domain are electrically charged, it is not surprising that we see ample proof of electrical scarring happening today on a smaller scale. You do see electrical scarring as I would call it, on comets, for example. I would say that we've been fortunate in this time that we've been able to send spacecraft out to different comets and observe their features. One of them, that Wal Thornhill wrote about extensively, was comet Wild 2. And Wild 2 is a perfect example of the electric discharge machining hypothesis because its surface, rather than being a slushy snowball with a bit of dirt in it, looks like it's hot and dry, more like an asteroid. And when you look at its surface and compare it to some of these electric discharge machined metals, they look very similar. The comet Hartley 2 also revealed what could be considered an active process of electric discharge machining on its surface, because one of its ends was glowing brightly as if it was being eroded by a plasma discharge. We didn't get any close-up views of that end of the comet but surrounding it was a cloud of ultrafine dust that had been presumably machined off the surface. Now also you can look at moons like Io, Jupiter's moon Io, and you can see that there are what they call, volcanoes on its surface but these volcanoes are so hot that any imaging by any spacecraft of these formations has overloaded the camera because they're so bright. In fact all the images that you see on the web, of Io's volcanoes, are false color because the camera imaging system simply could not resolve the interior, they were so bright. Now as Wal Thornhill has pointed out, because these formations tend to move around on Io these are probably the touchdown points of vast electric circuits that are occurring between Io and Jupiter. And in fact, Io moves through the magnetosphere of Jupiter and it acts like an induction motor. It's actually creating current flow between it and Jupiter, that are millions of amperes in power. So I would say that Io and Wild 2 and comet Hartley and as well as, for example, Saturn's moon Enceladus with its bright plumes of vapor that are being machined off its surface, are excellent examples of what might be happening currently in the Solar System. However, I should point out that some of the things that I've been discussing on Mars and Earth and Venus or Mercury, those events are orders of magnitude greater than anything we can see now because we're presuming a Solar System that was far more electrically active at some time in the past. Stay tuned to the Thunderbolts Project's YouTube Channel for Part Two of this discussion 
You've just entered the theater of an alien sky. If the words and images seem strange to you there's a reason for this. Our world was once a vastly different place. To experience this won't hurt you and there is nothing to fear. The subject of this video series is the ancient experience of towering celestial forms that are no longer present. Worldwide testimony points to planets extremely close to Earth and gathered in close congregation. We've called this gathering of planets the Polar Configuration because it was centered at the celestial pole, around which the heavens visually turn. The huge sphere of Saturn filled the circumpolar sky. Close to the centre of Saturn stood another body, the planet Venus, discharging electrically, the streamers of this discharge stretching upward across the face of Saturn. And seen in front of Venus was a smaller, darker reddish sphere, the planet Mars. At a critical juncture, a crescent cast by light from the Sun, appeared on Saturn rotating in an awe-inspiring cycle of day and night. That's because the axis at the Earth was aligned to that of the assembled bodies, causing the configuration to rotate visually above observers in the northern hemisphere, exploding into life at sunset, the beginning of the archaic day of the gods. Yes! The claims are outrageous, but also extraordinarily specific leaving no doubt as to what the ancient evidence should look like, in stark contrast to all common opinion about the ancient past. From a single snapshot of the configuration, seen here, we can work backwards to the first appearance of these bodies out of an undifferentiated cloud or sea of dusty plasma. We can follow the configuration's evolution through phases that range from quasi-stability to earth-shaking catastrophe. In these presentations, we will suggest that all of the mythic and symbolic archetypes can be explained by the presence of these bodies, their electrical exchanges in a plasma medium, and their relative movements in relation to each other. Intense electric discharge formation stretched between the gathered bodies, transitioning from one form to another. First to emerge was the triangular, or threefold, discharge form of Venus - interpreted mythically as the name of the creator, or 3 goddesses in one, a widely acknowledged archetype still unexplained. Here three goddesses reveal their triangular form with their entwined fingers, but the variations on the ancient theme are almost endless. And the initial three-faced form is inseparable from the identity of Venus as the emerging, radiant Great Star. The ancient astronomies name the components of this dynamic configuration as planets. Different sizes and colors, and changing relationships to each other. The shock comes from seeing the described events in the demanding terms of 3-dimensional perspective where relative movement said the bodies dramatically alter the visual appearance of the configuration. No room for arbitrary explanations. With the later displacement from it's polar position, the configuration was seen well into the southern hemisphere. Electric discharge forms metamorphosed violently above human witnesses providing us with a stunning comparison to plasma instabilities seen in laboratory experiments. Our message comes down to one overriding conclusion: Things anciently remembered bear no similarity to the commonly accepted picture the ancient sky. In a former time, our world was indeed a much different place ... 
Well, they say the planets are as the lore of God which moves in mysterious ways but apparently, I've got a bad throat, something's concocted here. It won't silence me, no, but I've got some medicinal knowledge here so we'll pop that down for the moment. Instant fossilization. Now what a subject! Everyone's talked about planet configurations, of the damage they do. This could be one of the subjects, I think, we should tap into far more than we do. But Instant Fossilisation... Now, around the world, living plants and animals have been petrified into solid rock in violent paroxysms of nature! Their end was agonizing and instantaneous as witnessed by their contorted death throes. Now there are plant fossils and there are animal fossils. How do you turn this piece of wood into this fossilized piece of wood which has high calcium, silicon, and other mineral content? Or even into this fossilized piece of wood which has very high iron content? I'm not going to the next slide. So let's look at four examples of petrification and we will come to the difference between petrification and just mere fossilization, soon. Here's some. Ammonites are like squids but in a shell, swimming along soft-bodied, and now we see them fossilized within this beach. They're associated with the Jurassic age and can be anything up to six foot across. So let's go, that's the first example. Let's go to another one. I'd wanted you to actually see the reality of these things. So these have come off the tree on Lesbos And how do you explain this? They are all cut off. Not ripped apart, cut! And it's solid rock, solid rock. Amazing! That's example two. So this is the reality of petrification. Here's the next one. Here in the area and he was leveling that - kinda took maybe It took ten feet off the top and up and the bulldozer operator looked behind even there were big bones sticking out everywhere he had been. Right and it's an incredible site. Now we're treating there roughly, I've got to think in terms of feet. Where it's about a 100 foot by about 80 foot something - About 125 by 100. - Yeah - This is a kind of ellipse and although this is a mammoth site, in actual fact there's a number of species in situ, isn't there? Right, the mammoth kind of dwarf everything else. That's what I love. Notice the layering of the limestone. I will come back to this anyway. This is a fourth example and this is my favorite. The northward... whoops, sorry! The northwest mineral gallery I've come to and you've got not only petrified trees to show us but some really interesting concretations containing... you tell us about! Yes Peter, these, um, what you're going to see inside of the museum here are fossilized crabs. They're actually soft bodied fossils which are found inside of concretions. So when we say concretion, we'll be talking about a round egg shaped rock and it's solid rock. - Yes And within that rock when you break them open, there is a crab, right? And that crab is actually rock as well, is that right? - Yes Fossilized, so okay, sorry. Just want to make sure I understood. Yeah, well, concretions are, the most popular and known kind of concretion are round rocks. There are other kinds but the ones most of us know are round rocks and they are, they often form around the nucleus of a fossil, a little bit of rock, a little, I mean a little bit of shell maybe, a little piece of leaf or something. - Yeah In this case we have the whole crab. - Yeah And the crab has a lot of his anatomy, it's all right there, you'll be able to see his orifice, you can see the spikes on his, his back, his claws. Right, you'll be able to see them down to the minute detail of the whole skeleton. - Yes So that's amazing, isn't it? So what do these petrified organic fossils, remember they were actually living, have in common? Their end was instantaneous and dramatic. Their chemical composition changed, they changed from a carbon water base to silicon whatever. But the unanswered question, what pungent force of nature changed their chemical composition whilst they're in their death throes? Let's look for some answer. Now conventional geology counts time as a slowly moving tool that leached their bodies, all the chemicals are taken out, and replaced them, the carbon with silicon and calcium. That's the conventional wisdom. But the rapid decay of biological matter, in my opinion, makes a nonsense of this theory. What then is the answer? Now let's go outside the scientific square but before we do, I just want to get some of these terminologies sorted out. There's fossilization, there's petrification. Now, fossilization can preserve tissue and particularly bones. For instance Alaska and Siberia, Antarctica. The uh, within coal and the peat of Snow Mass Colorado is, when I visited, where they've got mastodonts and mammoths etc. There they're preserved, but they're not actually changed to rock. Petrification is a subset where the original carbon-like material is either replaced or transmuted, remember that term transmuted, to different compounds of silicon, calcium, iron, aluminum, etc. In other words, they turn to rock. They're not just preserved. Now although fossilization generally is undoubtedly the result of cataclysmic events, as you know, we can read about in Velikovsky etc., petrification tends to occur either in a bolus such as we saw with Larry Agenbroad in South Dakota or along coastlines. Now I'm not sure how we can explain this but let's try. So there you are. Petrification would seem to magnify the catastrophic event and actually transmute elements and compounds. I suspect this is a result of powerful electromagnetic forces that have centralized in a certain area. They're not necessary over a broad area such as the normal catastrophe that does fossilize things, but petrification tends to be in secluded areas. Not sure why but anyway. Often these, so there we go, we've got some examples here. There's the Hot Springs ones, Romsey Marsh in Australia, at the Jurassic Coast we saw before and Diamond Bay which you'll see later. OK, the causes of petrification. Now, I noted before, we should search in other places apart from scientific endeavor. And mythology from Rens Van der Sluijs to Dave and Wal, etc, etc, holds a lot of the key to this, in my opinion. They're witness to catastrophic destruction. Now Georges Cuvier who visited the Americas around about 1800 or so, around the time of the French Revolution and the American War of Independence, investigated a lot of apart from looking... He was a paleontologist. Apart from looking at bones and things like that, he was extremely interested in local or the Indian mythology. And Adrienne Meyer studied this a lot and followed up on Georges Cuvier's efforts and she advocates, as a lot of this myth, Indian mythology talks about, the cosmic thunderbolt as the weapon of choice in this megafauna destruction. Now let's just listen to this. Monstrous creature preyed upon early humans and that the Creator then wanted to make the Earth safe for, for the new human beings. So the Creator then killed them with a sort of cosmic lightning bolts. Something beyond just ordinary lightning. So it wasn't just as description of normal everyday? No! No, this was a massive destruction of these creatures. And it's actual fact that did happen, the megafauna are now extinct. They did, yes. And they're the, the early colonists described the Americas as a land of, covered with bones. I mean, they were everywhere you went. There were skeletons emerging or partially petrified, yes. And apparently Georges Cuvier came out. Georges Cuvier, the father of paleontology in Paris. He was extremely interested in the stories that were told by the Native Americans because he was at that time developing his theory of extinction and evolution which was quite different to, let's say, Darwin and some of those. I mean, Darwin essentially was saying that it's taken millions of years to develop whereas Georges Cuvier was, more or less, saying something like number of extinctions have occurred. He thought there must have been a series of catastrophes whether there were floods or volcanic or something like that. I think he settled on floods but he was very interested in the disaster scenarios that the Native Americans had in their oral cultures explaining the disappearance and mass... OK, so let's look at a couple of these, there's here these mythologies from the Native Americans and here's one cited by Erdoes and Oritz around about the Creator. We'll get to quote of what i said, the Lakota Nation had sent hunting tribes down here for many, many years. And they had a different interpretation on what had caused the fossilizations of these great beasts. Karley repeats the traditions of the first Americans. The Creator sang a song of destruction and set down fierce thunderbirds to wage a great battle against the humans and the giant animals. They fought for a very long time because the evil humans and the animals had become very powerful and neither could gain an advantage. Finally, at the height of the battle the thunderbirds sent down their most powerful thunderbolts all at once. The fiery blast shook the entire world toppling mountain ranges and setting forests and prairies ablaze. The flames lept up to the sky in all directions sparing only a few people at the highest peaks. It was so hot that the world's lakes boiled up and dried before their eyes. Even the rocks burned up red-hot and the giant animals and the people burned up where they stood. A great flood followed and when the survivors went out, they found bleached bones of the giant animals in mud and rocks all over the world. They're still found today in the Dakota badlands. But can we believe these bizarre stories of mass destruction? Mythology from the Lakota Nation tells us precisely how this destruction happened and it was not so long ago. Now what event was that, we're not sure. You know, you go back through the mass destructions of the Velikovsky and Hesiod, you know, from around about 2000 BC before right up to a 500 BC. So we can tie that in though with a lot of the Greek mythology and Rens Van der Sluijs is very good at that as are many of the people in the EU. So let's look at some of this, particularly the Gorgons. Earthquakes and volcanoes routinely emit flashing transparent plasmoids emerging like giant bubbles out of the ground. These chaotic electromagnetic formations come in many shapes and colors and can travel at supersonic speed while seamlessly passing through or alternatively boring through obstructions. Plasmoids reach far in destruction and according to Regan Buck, they burnt down cities and tunneled through mountains. And in great fear the ancients called these ground emerging destroyers Gorgons. Hesiod was writing about them around 900 BC. Stratification of rock under the sea. Now it seemed that the Gorgons may have been active in Australian aboriginal mythology. Verbal records and dance traditions recorded these demonic plasmoids at many sites and in various forms. Their Rainbow Serpent was responsible for carving river systems as Lichtenberg scars on the face of the Earth and even held responsible for building mountains and forming lakes. Fantasy, you might ask? Well, I don't believe it was fantasy. Let's go to the next. So here we go. We're in search of the causes of petrification. We've dealt a little bit about mythology. What about going to the scientific side of things and plasma physics? Anthony Peratt certainly is an advocate of giant plasma discharges that shaped history. To him, this mythology could be simulated in his laboratory. But what evidence do we have that electrical phenomena can cause elements to transmute? E.g. water, and I say water so think about that, to calcium. What tool of nature fossilized these once watery marine ammonites? The ones along the Jurassic Coast. We have a powerful clue. Now there's two. There's Eric Milton and some work Wal did at the Telstra Laboratories years ago which gives you an indication of the power of electrical discharge. Conversion of the wood to rock. Wal again demonstrates the creation of fulgurites by powerful electric discharge. Here There we go. Right there in that light, right there. What is this, Wal? This is a fulgurite. It's fused silica which follows the path of the lightning or electrical discharge. Which is how these trees were petrified? Further evidence comes from Canada. E.R. Milton describes his examination of a petrified tree trunk in Alberta. The piece was pure clean silica inside. It was coated with a rougher opaque crust of partially fused sand. The tree whose stump was petrified was alive five years ago. After the tree was cut down to accommodate the right of way for a new power transmission line, an accidental break allowed the live high-voltage wire to contact several tree stumps in the ground. The power was cut off within hours of the break. All of the tree roots which contacted the broken wire were fossilized. Obviously, electricity can metamorphize matter quickly. Look at this! A round about 67 foot long [this is Lesbos, again] solid rock but it's amazing. clearly a tree See how this is actually still wood, part of it. But otherwise, it has been turned to rock. A substance a bit like marble. Here's another example. Opal mines in Australia, White cliffs. We're just going to go down one of the opal mines and see some interesting things. These are essentially limestone caves carved deep into the hillsides. This is where they find the opals. But what really intrigues me are these Lichtenberg figures you see in front of you. I interpret these as telluric currents coming deep from within the bowels of the Earth and thrusting upwards under some dramatic geophysical crisis. These are where the opals are found. This current coming up through the Earth seems to have transmutated the calcium into some sort of ferrous compound. Notice all the red. And at other times, under different conditions, it's formed opals. And the opals we're interested in are these shells and various other forms of life. They've been totally converted and opalized. Some scientists take this as a sign of very old age. But are there other explanations? Let's continue our investigation. Well with red colored rock pebbles scattered over miles and miles of countryside. I suspect C.J. Ransom with experiments in creating concretations in his laboratory may have been very interested in these rounded pebbles. They bear a remarkable resemblance to the Martian blueberries. Is this yet again some evidence of a major electrical discharge event? In fact, my colleague in the US has done experiments on material like Martian soil and he has created the blueberries that they found. - OK You know, he's done that in the lab and yet the blueberries themselves are a mystery at present to the planetologists who are studying the surface of Mars. We can enlighten them. Well it's interesting that you say that there are magnetic reversals found at the site because that indicates a change in electrical currents. Basically you don't get a magnetic field without an electric current. - That's a precursor to That, yeah, that's an indicator that we're looking at an electrical phenomenon. And at certain places, for instance Lake Mungo, because after a magnetic variation when the rock turns molten it actually collects the signal of the magnetic field. It was found that a magnetic field was up to eight times what it is today. That means a powerful electric current flow. Could that be a possible indicator of petrification here? But what if.., here's another question. This is where we start to think hopefully a bit laterally and I don't have a solution but I'll propose a couple. What about the medium the fossils were actually embedded in? And in the cases we're talking here, it's water. The ammonites, the crabs possibly, well we would think so certainly etc. They're in a bolus and it's a volumetric disaster. So if, let's have a thought about how, if a crab is in water which it was, and the fishes were in water, and the mammoths have fallen to watery pit. Could the calcium change to water? Big question and certainly is contentious. But if you look at the chemistry here, we got H₂O, two elements, hydrogen and oxygen, with a combination of 10 protons, 2 hydrogen protons and 8 oxygen. Calcium, the basic stuff of limestone is, has a proton count of double that, twenty. This is twice that of water. All that is theoretically needed to convert the water to calcium is an abundance of neutrons to match the lack of ones in the hydrogen which only has one proton but no neutrons. Is that feasible? You know, the chemistry's there, I mean, some people could look at H₂O as an isotope of calcium, possibly. Russian studies of lightning discharges have shown that neutrons are promulgated during a lightning storm. So neutrons could be involved in this. It's a possibility. But something tells me if the fish and the crabs are in water, and that's in rock later on, how the hell did that happen? And this, the water itself has been transmuted together with the bodies. And they have the periodic tables; hydrogen, helium, lithium, beryllium, boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, we know them all and how close they are. And only one, for instance, nitrogen oxygen, only one proton away. Silicon, the most abundant element on Earth if I remember rightly, they're all fairly close together. So there's a lot of scope and we still don't understand how elemental change can occur. It certainly can do, though. But how can it? Plasmoid research by Matsumoto and a number of other people, shows that when you put electrodes into a certain solution, the damaged electrodes can produce new totally different elements in that solution and also plasmoids. Let's have a look at a little bit of this. July the 19th, 2012, an eruption occurred on the Sun. A moderately powerful solar flare exploded on the sun's lower .. sending out light and radiation. Next came a CME which shot off to the right out into space and then the Sun treated viewers to one of its dazzling magnetic displays. A phenomenon known as coronal rain. This is a little bit about the Kimberley diamond region where a giant Barramundi jumped out and came back in on diamonds on either side. Other icon of Australian mythology, the Rainbow Serpent. The Rainbow Serpent is cited by the aboriginals as the creator of geological formations such as rivers, mountain building and gorge cutting. But the other real question is, could these very same processes create diamonds? Plasmoid research in cold fusion suggests that this might be replicated. In laboratory experiments with various electrodes immersed in different solutions, we can witness cold fusion. This creates new elements around damaged parts of the electrode. The electrical current flow forces mini plasmoids to emerge from these very electrodes. Some quite curiously look totally like comets. With their tails and angled colored sampling. [This is very interesting to me at least.] Claims by Wal Thornhill that electrical phenomena are scalable gives us pause to think. The emerging plasmoids then leap and wander across sensitive gel plates. Work from Matsumoto and others show how they crater and form tracking lines. In fact, they perform exactly as the legend told to me by Aboriginal elder Murray Butcher. He tells the story of the wee Wagtail bird that lept and darted along rivers, boring water holes. He insists these are actually facts, not fiction. Large plasmoids from volcanoes and earthquakes, these are other electromagnetic phenomena, have been shown to sculpt the Earth as they bore and tunnel at great velocities. They often convert to the tightly related tornado. Even tsunamis are produced when giant plasmoids explode. But the plasmoid's ability to create new elements whilst emitting light, is an area still at a pioneering stage of our understanding. Where on Earth these major electrical discharges came from, that completely changed the geology of the landscape? And what's more, what could possibly have caused the electrical fossilization of not only giant wombats but mammoths and other megafauna in this period of the Earth's development? Both of us agree that some form of Peratt instability led to the final discharge causing these geological effects and I believe, electrical fossilization. This is not only backed up by mythology, with petroglyph carvings but also by a large amount of mythology. Not only Aboriginal, the North American and around the world from Zeus's thunderbolts, the aboriginal lightning brothers. Aboriginal mythology and tradition is all about cosmological warfare in the plasma space. Comets are mentioned, meteorites, planets in disturbed motion, great flashes of thunderbolts from outer space, earthquakes, tsunamis covering the land, people going mad, huge oral traditions. But one thing is plain in Aboriginal mythology. It's not myth, it's fact. Every word that's breathed by these oral traditions actually happened, here in Australia. I'll just pause that for a second. I hope I can go on with this. This is Diamond Point Bay where I live, Victoria. And the Australians spell it wrongly but we won't worry about that. See this big hole here. This is where a giant wombat, if you don't know what a wombat is, it's like a badger, I think you have badgers here, I'm not sure. But it was the size of a Volkswagen. It was fossilized, petrified. And this amazing area it only came out last year. But hopefully I can play this. We might go on to the next one. And home we go! Electric fossilization and the Carolina Bays. I decided to include this because you're finding out that it's again the possibility of things that have happened that have transmuted or created elements. So I won't bore you with reading all that out. Let's see some of the guff about it. This is Rick Firestone from Berkeley National Laboratories. He ran the first cyclotron in the US and is the current table of isotopes expert. He knows his stuff. Had to say about these mass destructions. We discovered that there was a parallel line of research where they had been studying the disappearance at that same time of mammoths and bears and horses ... and bison. All of these animals virtually disappeared from just that region. So it's kind of like a dress rehearsal for what happened 13,000 years ago. So he did a survey of the Carolina Bays and the Carolina Bays, you'll see about them in a moment, but there are thousands of depressions all on the east coast of the US and up into Canada, I believe, and even down this far in some cases. But let's see what he found out. The remarkable study of the Carolina Bays system by Berkeley nuclear physicist Rick Firestone stimulates even further speculation on the production of diamonds. The Carolina Bays is a vast system of shallow elliptical depressions whose origin is highly debatable. Some claim meteorite storms, however their shallowness and lack of debris precludes this. Others speculate windborne dramas from past eras. However, plasmoids may be involved in the Bays production. Importantly it should be noted that Carolina Bays accompany and bank along Lichtenberg river systems. EU Theory suspects, Lichtenberg river systems are ancient electromagnetic discharge lines along, and I suspect, beneath the Earth's surface. So what did he conclude? Well, he was laborious in a lot of these studies, driving around hand and foot, analyzing them and taking things back to the laboratory. But he found they contained large concentrations of nano diamonds and we're talking about creating new elements here. This is not outside of these small craters. It's actually within them. Outside it’s totally different. Nano diamonds, iridium, helium-3, fullerenes, that's Bucky Balls, carbon glass, hollow spherules and magnetic particles. Could an electrical discharge or an emerging plasmoid such as we saw with the electrodes, plasmoid instability possibly create diamonds? And we're talking here about transmutation. So is this a vehicle of transmutation, if plasmoids did actually create the Carolina Bays? Is this an indication of, they could do other things like petrification? And some backup stuff here that I was curious. I actually went to Calabria but I couldn't find these. See these round craters? They were penciled in at this stage around about 1560 I think it was. There were huge earthquakes killing thousands upon thousands and one of the things that happens with earthquakes and volcanoes, as we know, plasmoids emerge out of the Earth on mountains. It's well documented and these, they're so. They're fairly similar to the Carolina Bays but in a smaller way. So Louis Hissink, a geologist involved in diamond exploration in Australia, said to me, he said you know, some of the cherished theories we hold may be quite wrong and that's a typical EU statement if I've ever heard one. Get it right... Here's the summary note. Sort of dead and perish, they're actually living at the time of fossilization. They're instantaneously, you believe, frozen if you like, in time. Yes, what these fossils dramatically illustrate, even though concretions with soft body fossils are found all over the world. These will dramatically illustrate to you that these are not creatures which are disarticulated. They appear to have undergone no breakdown and no decomposition. They are in very lifelike positions and you may have some of your own favorites but some other examples of soft bodied fossils were found by, that are in particular moments of life seemingly fossilized and turned to stone. There was a plesiosaur that was giving birth in Holtzmaden, Germany. She was seemingly fossilized. The famous paleontologists Charles Wolcott also found concretions which had specimens of jellyfish which were actually dividing into two when they were fossilized. So it is an instantaneous thing. It would seemingly be so. They display all of the kind of characteristics that you would expect from an electrical discharge, formation of these types of stone orbs. It's got the layering, it's got the, it's got the equatorial bulge, if you like, it's got the polar markings and and it's wonderful because I think that the work that C.J. Ransom is doing kind of gives us an alternative unified view of how this type of geologic formation which is really found all over the United States, all over the world, could be, could have been formed not by a patchwork of explanations depending on the area but really we can see that the qualities that we see in concretions in electrically formed, in electrically formed stone. That's Paulina West, by the way. So here we are. Let's start summing up now. Here's a classic, a petrified fish turned to rock in rock, eating another fish. Caught at a moment of death. Quite staggering. So let's sum up what we've gone through. Is instant fossilization an electrical phenomenon? And I think we've, we can never say positively because we haven't actually seen it happen but let's go through some of the things. Mythology states unequivocably that plasmoids and... I was talking to Rens Van der Sluijs the other day. He's coming up with a lot of research he's done in mythology that brings in not only electrical discharges such as Zeus but plasmoid formation. So I'm waiting to see on that. But ...and celestial thunderbolts cause petrification. C.J. Ransom and others have shown the ability of electrical discharge to form (concretions). It would appear that the medium in which the petrification has occurred has also dramatically changed and no one seems to get that bit. That's so important to me. You know, something's in rock. How can it be in the middle of rock? I mean, if that was molten they would have just vaporized it, surely. But it's not, it's intact. And it's therefore, has the rock, has the water turned to rock as well? Big question to me anyway. Elemental, a change occurs during the process. At some fossilization you get marginal change. You certainly get mammoth bones preserved in muck and peat and ice. But in, particularly in petrification it's turned to rock. Elemental change, compound change. The change, and this is an important part, is very rapid and theories that endorse long periods of transition, the classic theories, do not fit the fact that biological matter deteriorates very quickly if not preserved by some means. And that about sums it up, thank you! 
You've just entered the theater of an alien sky. If the words and images seem strange to you there's a reason for this, our world was once a vastly different place. To experience this won't hurt you and there is nothing to fear. Before the Counting of Time In previous episodes of this series, we've claimed that the first civilizations arose under the influence of extraordinary natural events. But these events including phases of overwhelming catastrophe remain largely unrecognized today. In supporting this extraordinary claim, we've offered global evidence suggesting an ancient gathering of planets close to Earth. We've called this planetary assembly The Polar Configuration due to its alignment with the rotational axis of the Earth. Documentation supporting a reconstruction of the configuration comes down to us from cultures the world over, we see the events reflected in the rise of kingship, the emergence of the first writing systems, of monumental construction, and the great national wars of expansion, all explicitly linked to intensely remembered events when planets appeared to battle in the sky as clouds of celestial debris shrouded the Earth and great volumes of dust and rock fell upon our planet. We've called this human memory "The One Story Told Around The World." The universal tradition takes us back to an age of planetary gods and celestial wonders, the universal source of the world's archetypal myths and symbols. And so we've claimed that there could be no archetypes without the implied global experience. It's the common experience that gives the archetypes both their context and their concrete detail the world over. We now know that since the dawn of the great civilizations, memories of fear-inspiring catastrophe pervaded all of human activity, an outpouring of imagination and pervasive fear, doomsday anxiety showed its face in every culture that followed. And above all else, this body of magical and ritual practices sought to deflect or to forestall the return of remembered catastrophe. Our historical argument is drawn upon evidence left by the great civilizations starting with the appearance of formal writing systems. But there is also a layer of prehistoric evidence and this archaeological layer can help us to visualize celestial events before the appearance of any written records. This prehistoric evidence directs our attention to the human response in the very midst of a deadly threat, in other words, contemporaneous with Earth-threatening catastrophe. Here we're not dealing just with a compulsion to reenact celestial dramas but something more immediate and more urgent, refuge. Human beings either seeking shelter from anticipated catastrophe or desperate to find refuge from catastrophe already under way. Seen from this more radical perspective, today's common picture of a prehistoric world takes on nuances that archeologists appear to have missed. Critical lines of evidence converge to suggest a human retreat into caves. Or alternately to find refuge in crudely constructed stone enclosures or earthen mounds as defenses against rock and celestial debris falling from the sky. To appreciate the perspective offered here, we need only allow for the implied urgency, and that's a consideration virtually never included in standard treatments of prehistory. What was on the minds of those who entered caves or raised giant stone dolmens or great mounds of earth, seemingly with no clear motive to account for them. How much of this activity might be explained in terms of perilous events once occurring in the sky but not occurring today. Such events could only mean that the present cannot be the key to the past, and a fundamental premise of modern science must be corrected. From this vantage point, certain features stand out. The urgency is endlessly reflected in the crude architecture of the dolmens that punctuate ancient landscapes across the British Isles and Northern Europe, all the way to Russia and Korea and even with counterparts in North America. Such structures are readily distinguished from the more ambitious and more obviously skillful architecture that followed with the emergence of the great civilisations of Egypt and Mesopotamia. How significant for example are the repeated indications of interruption and incompletion? In numerous instances as if a massive undertaking was begun but ended in tragedy and was never finished. That should not surprise us if these undertakings occurred in the presence of the very catastrophe that all ancient communities most feared. In many instances, a partial seemingly irrational raised roof draws our attention, entirely out of proportion to its support. Indeed the massive stone roofs are commonly the most imposing structure. Has any historian or archeologist ever explained this human investment across the vast region? When you see the undertaking as a defense against falling rock, the mystery of human motivation instantly vanishes. Other considerations also enter this picture. The apparent role of celestial catastrophe will not permit us to ignore the implied context of extended deprivation and nostalgia as we can see in the conditions portrayed on the walls of caves. In the catastrophic environment suggested here, what might the paintings of human hunting and abundant game be telling us? A familiar phrase from American Indian tradition comes to mind, the happy hunting ground. Not an illogical phrase if the actual condition was one of profound nostalgia. Were the artist painting on walls of caves and rocky cliffs nostalgically remembering something lost? Psychologists know well that in a state of deep deprivation the mind will become increasingly obsessed with what is missing or what has been taken away. That point was made explicit in an army experiment years ago. When placed on a narrow diet of nothing but potatoes, those participating in the experiment began to dream nostalgically of the missing diet. Perhaps of steak dinner, their favorite beer or her apple pie. In this case we have two different themes, humans retreating to caves and their nostalgic remembrances, both pointing in precisely the same direction. Look again at the prehistoric paintings on the cave walls across Europe and beyond, the hunting scenes and the abundant game. Could we entertain the possibility that these scenes actually celebrate a community life no longer available but actively remembered? Why such pervasive nostalgia if nothing had been taken away by natural events? With that concrete question in front of us, additional questions arise. Is it possible to identify such an experience in the thematic links of the cave dwellers to the emerging civilizations that followed? Or is there a connection to the explosion of monumental construction launched almost simultaneously in Egypt and Mesopotamia? Since Napoleon first stood in awe of the wonder of the Great Pyramid, scientific commentary was taken over by questions of technology and architecture but have we missed something? In the conditions of the time, what was the role of human urgency or protection, in particular, the protection of kings and royal families. And how might our picture of the ancient world, the rise of kingship itself, or the explosion of military conquests be changed when seen in the light of an Earth-threatening sky? Answering such questions will require us to see the ancient monuments in a new light. And the Great Pyramid becomes something more than an enchanting monument standing out on the ancient landscape, more than just a dark chamber for practicing magical rites, or recording hieroglyphic prayers to the gods, or charting a sky map to guide the mythic ascent of deceased kings. Of course, such motives are well documented but could there be more to the story? What was on the minds of those who invested vast resources in urgent construction? In the following episodes, we'll consider a new perspective, one in which all of the ancient motives converge as a testament to remembered catastrophe. In particular, a desperation for protection against unpredictable rains of rocky debris from the sky to which we shall add a noteworthy emphasis on the planet repeatedly named as the source of falling stone, the planet Mars. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project at Thunderbolts.info. Astronomers are reporting their observation of the so-called brightest and furthest pulsar ever observed from Earth. Using data from the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton satellite, the supposed spinning magnetized neutron star presents a major challenge to the consensus ideas about such theoretical objects. Identified as NGC 5907 X1 the ”pulsar” appears to shine with the brightness that is a thousand times greater than the object’s theoretical limit. To gain a perspective on just how stupendously bright the pulsar appears to be, a phys.org report states, “In one second it emits the same amount of energy released by our Sun in three and a half years.” As the lead author of a paper on the object states,  “This object is really challenging our current understanding of the accretion process for high luminosity stars. It is 1,000 times more luminous than the maximum thought possible for an accreting neutron star. So something else is needed in our models in order to account for the enormous amount of energy released by the object.” The mystery for investigators is not simply the object’s brightness, but also the speed at which the ”pulsar’s” alleged spin rate increased over a period of 11 years. As phys.org reports, “The same relative acceleration in Earth's rotation would shorten the day by five hours in the same time span.” What is a so-called neutron star? Scientists tell us that the material left over from a supernova explosion of a massive star collapses gravitationally, forming an incredibly small, yet massively dense star mostly composed of tightly packed neutrons. A rotating neutron star is said to emit regular pulses of radio waves and other sources of radiation, called pulsars. But the hypothesis of the neutron star was not a predictive theory that was composed and then verified through observation. Rather, the hypothesis was invented in the nineteen sixties after the completely unexpected discovery of radio pulses from the constellation Vulpecula. In 1968 it was the world-renowned astrophysicist Thomas Gold who proposed that  the source of the pulses was a rapidly rotating star acting very much like a lighthouse, with the light beams becoming visible on Earth with each revolution of the star. The extraordinary speed with which such an object is said to rotate is sometimes many times faster than a dentist's drill. However, in recent years, with finer technological data have come numerous discoveries that in effect falsify the neutron star hypothesis. As reported in previous Space News episodes, this is not the first instance that a so called pulsar’s apparent brightness has exponentially exceeded its theoretical limit. Other behaviors have proved equally puzzling, including the discovery reported in 2013, of a pulsar that switches suddenly and unpredictably between radio and X-ray emissions. The lead author of a paper on that discovery said at the time, “The people creating models will have to rethink what we are discovering here. When we look now to what is so far published in papers, nothing at this moment can explain what is happening.” But is the hypothesis of a mechanically spinning lighthouse of sorts really the only explanation for pulsars? If a crisis in cosmology exists, is it a coincidence that institutional science continues to try to explain stupendous electromagnetic phenomena through purely gravitational mechanism? In the case of so-called neutron stars and pulsars the disciplines of plasma physics and electrical engineering do offer theoretical alternatives. It has been suggested that a more useful analogy to pulsar flashes is the complex radio signals induced in Earth's ionosphere by powerful lightning. This clue could help to explain the evidence inexplicable in the standard model of pulsars switching from radio to X-ray emissions, since lightning can produce both. In fact, scientists attempting to explain this puzzling switching of emissions, are considering changes in the star’s magnetosphere, which does bring them closer to the electrical interpretation. In fact in 1995 the renowned plasma physicist Anthony Peratt and co-author Kevin Healey published a paper, ”Radiation Properties of Pulsar Magnetospheres: Observation, Theory, and Experiment.” Peratt and Healy examined well over a dozen pulsar anomalies yet to be explained by the standard lighthouse model. They state: ”There yet exists no self-consistent theory to describe the Pulsar electrodynamics.” Using electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations, the team investigated a, “Magnetospheric disk field-aligned current transmission line system as the origin of the observed radiation.” With external wave excitation by as yet an unexplained source, this model does not require a rotating object, or the lighthouse effect. Rather, it in effect states that an electrical discharge occurs close to a star which then travels along the magnetic field lines outwards, where it meets a disk of matter surrounding the star. Where it meets that more dense matter, a kind of short circuit occurs and the signal is reflected as in transmission lines in electrical engineering theory. In fact, in a Space News interview, retired professor dr. Donald Scott has suggested that the ideal analogy for a pulsar’s flashes is not a lighthouse, but rather a strobe light. A strobe light is a small ball containing a plasma driven by a simple electrical circuit. As seen in this picture it can consist of nothing more than a resistor, a capacitor, the voltage source, and a glass tube. In the 2015 Space News, “The invention of the Neutron Star,” professor Scott explained the analogy in space as follows, “If we have a pair of stars, a binary pair of stars out in space and if they're closely spaced there may very well be a plasma bridge between them and the resistance in the relaxation oscillator is the resistance of that plasma bridge, and so the capacitance value depends on the surface areas of the two stars and if one of the stars is [at a as] being driven by an external current to higher and higher voltage, clearly this kind of oscillation is possible. Also, voltage pulses can bounce back and forth along a plasma bridge; if we have a plasma bridge that connects the two stars and we get a voltage pulse that goes from one to the other, it can bounce back again and there's all sorts of possibilities for reflections of pulses on high-voltage power transmission lines.” But in institutional science today, theorists seeking to gain a better understanding of “neutron stars” tend not to be specialists in electrical engineering and plasma physics. Always the assumption is that the detected light pulses are produced by spinning magnetized neutron stars, even though said objects remain entirely hypothetical and the predictive record of the hypothesis grows increasingly poor. The mantra of self-styled skeptics is that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Astrophysicists freely acknowledge that the neutron star, if it exists, would be one of the most exotic objects in the known universe. But an ongoing series of theory shattering discoveries have transformed the neutron star hypothesis from exotic to extraordinary, to perhaps impossible. However, as in countless other fields of space science discovery, real alternatives await in our Electric Universe.

[Music] In the final chapter of the Eye of the Storm series, I presented Easter eggs, surprise geologic findings that confirmed a theory, or presented astonishing new information about Earth's electric circuitry. Exploring the Electric Earth is a perpetual egg hunt, because every rock confirms that the bunny is real. Electrical discharges follow patterns and behaviors that yield definitive information about cause and effect. Discharge patterns on the landscape indelibly record discharge events, like a holographic data bank. Chapters 8 and 9 of Eye of the Storm discuss surface conductive discharges across Earth's surface that form the Colorado River and its tributaries. The trace of a surface conductive discharge is particularly rich in information because, unlike a lightning bolt that momentarily sticks on the Earth, a surface discharge has to crawl across the surface, meeting significant impedance, seeking out conductive pathways, expending vast energies transporting matter, while explosively faulting and excavating. It takes time, it's not energy efficient and it leaves its mark. A stunning display of a particular type of surface conductive discharge can be found in the Laramie Mountains in Wyoming. Embedded in these mountains are gorges and ridgelines that literally form a phase diagram of what took place. It couldn't be more explicit than if God had left his blueprint on the drafting table for all to see. This 15-mile cross is from a discharge between two out-of-phase circuits. First however, let's consider the geometry of a surface conductive discharge. Each discharge branches out in fractal self-similar dendrites, to absorb all the surface charge on the conductive object it's attached to. In our case it's the Earth. This is a diffusion-limited aggregation. Each filament of a discharge soaks up charge from a particular domain. The domain is a region surrounding the spark, defined by its electromagnetic field, from which it sucks charge of one polarity and spits charge of the other polarity in reactive power surges. It does this because it's not insulated current, like we use in electrical systems. Filament domains cover every square inch of solid land on the planet. We call them watersheds, because they serve to collect rain water into river channels. But that's a consequence, not a cause. The Earth once crawled with electrical discharges. This should be self-evident in any theory of planetary formation. In consensus theories, planet and comet collisions would necessitate big sparks. In Electric Universe theory, sparks are already acknowledged. Why consensus science doesn't look for evidence of electrical discharge, is evidence they don't ask the right questions. What is interesting, the big Easter egg i'm getting to, is that domains cross and that filaments interact. Giant sparks result. The interaction we'll investigate created a landscape that can only be explained electrically. The statistical probability of a consensus theory doing it, is nigh impossible. Domains don't usually cross, because skin effects occur between domains that keep them segregated, as if by a membrane. But they can cross and interact, if domains are out of balance. An over-voltage in one could make it aggressive and overcome another. Depending on phase disparities, this can be a gentle handholding connection, or it can be an explosive punch. We'll look at one of the explosive kinds. The annotated image shows the area of interest circled in violet, including the Laramie Mountains surrounded by green and red circles. The Laramie is part of the Continental Divide as it cuts through southeastern Wyoming. The circles denote the major streams flowing from the mountains. Green are streams flowing to the North Platte River and then to the Missouri and ultimately the Mississippi valley and the Gulf of Mexico. Red are streams that flow to a sink in the basin west of the mountain range. The sink forms the Seminoe and Pathfinder Reservoirs, also circled in red, west of the mountains. And the North Platte River forms the Glendo Reservoir on the opposite side, circled in green. The high basin drains around the mountains in two flows, shown by yellow connections. The North Platte runs near Casper, Wyoming, and around the north of the mountains, and the Laramie flows from Medicine Bow to Fort Laramie through a path to the south of the range. The overall structure is shaped like a heart, with the mountains filling the upper half, the basins filling the lower and the rivers acting as arteries and veins. The distinctive yellow X in the center of the range is the X-pattern that was shown earlier and it's a discharge pattern that occurred when the North Platte filament of the Mississippi discharge met a separate domain with a different phase. What you see is literally a natural phase diagram that records the phase angles of the discharge. The discharge took place because the Missouri circuit was an AC current that made connection to a ground current in the basin and sparks shot between the circuits where the domains came together. The Laramie Mountains formed as a consequence. The discharge adopted an X-pattern where it made connection with the east-west branches vectored along the electric field denoted by the dotted red and green lines. The electric field is the dipolar alignment between the lakes. The lakes, or the depressions where these lakes are now, were created in the same discharge event that met at the crux of the X and sent reactive discharges rotated at 90 degrees to the originating spark, between the circuit domains. The discharge is much like the resonant frequency discharges discussed in chapter 8 and 9 of Eye of the Storm which created the major 180-degree branches of the Colorado River. The geometry is different, an X instead of a T, but that is because the X is a resonant discharge between two existing circuit domains, whereas the T is a result of a single circuit bifurcating. The bifurcating discharge means critical resistance due to a buildup of stray capacitance that resonates the circuit, increasing frequency and therefore resistance, until the current is stopped, causing it to explode and reactive discharges 90 degrees to either side of the original current. The X is produced by two out of phase circuit domains coming together. The Missouri circuit is an alternating current, whereas the Basin circuit is a direct current to ground. The two circuits go in and out of phase with each other as the AC current alternates. This makes a connection, then a discharge. The discharge is totally in reactive power mode, because the out-of-phase circuits are 180 degrees out of phase, and that has the same effect as resonant discharge, raising resistance to infinity and forcing the current out sideways at 90 degrees. The first case is like putting a finger on the nozzle of a hose and forcing water to spray out sideways, 90 degrees to the direction of the nozzle. The second case is like having two hoses aimed at each other where the streams impact, flow sprays out sideways. In one, the water pressure changes flow direction and makes a T, and in the other two flows impact and the pressure changes flow direction to make an X. The reactive discharge dissolves the voltage differential between circuits by expending their charge, the entire accumulated charge in the Missouri circuit in this case, in an explosive X-shaped spark. It created what astrophysicists call magnetic reconnection. Astrophysicists don't recognize electric circuitry in space because in dark mode current doesn't emit radiation they detect, and since they can't see it, their reductionist minds can't make the intuitive leap to circuitry. But they do detect the magnetic flux that results. They invented the term magnetic reconnection in lieu of an explanation, because they can't fathom the simplicity of two out-of-phase circuits coming together to make a spark. Magnetic reconnection. The moving lines are magnetic field lines, the things astrophysicists think are reconnecting, but they are actually the magnetic field lines generated by current flow, oriented along the dotted lines. Their model only recognizes magnetism, so the dotted lines are just separating the magnetic fields. The big yellow arrows pointed inwards and outwards in different quadrants of the X, are the vectors of electric current, induced by the changing magnetic field. In the Laramies, induced electric currents were expressed in the atmosphere by plasma winds. Plasma winds drew to the crux of the discharge at ground level in top and bottom quadrants, and blew outward at high level, like an anvil cloud in the right and left quadrants. The winds lifted in a vertical updraft over the center of the X, but even more astounding is the effect that magnetic fields and reactive currents had in shaping the entire basin and range structure. The landscape is a 3D photograph of what happened. To appreciate what took place, the three-dimensional nature of the circuit domains needs to be recognized. Charge diffused across the ground, as well as through the ground, and into the sky. Capacitance between the Earth and sky force mirroring currents in the atmosphere, stirring a violent storm system. Think of it as a local squall line of thunderstorms, raging over the mountains at the time they were formed, and while the ground discharge took place. The central updraft over the X formed a huge mesocyclone, flanked by smaller thunderheads to either side. Most of the energy of the discharge went straight up into the mesocyclone, pulsing it with energy. The wind paths to be described, are ground level winds, that were shaped by the electromagnetic field at the planet surface. The combined effect of the discharge at ground level, its magnetic field and the resultant plasma winds, makes an X pattern shown in red. The magnetic field lines, shown in blue, are just like they're shown in the pattern of magnetic reconnection. The yellow vectors are pointing to the direction of wind paths at ground level following this storm system along the magnetic field lines. The winds in the northeast and southeast quadrants flow parallel, patterned around the X. In the northeast, they cross magnetic field lines perpendicularly, flowing straight to the crux of the discharge. The jet stream winds leave valleys with broad rounded or V-cut bottoms, carpeted with silt, but no inner gorge. They may have a superficial meandering stream erosion, but not a deep-cut, straight inner gorge. We'll examine more wind-cut valleys later, but first, let's distinguish between a wind-cut valley and a discharge-blasted canyon, like the one that formed the X. The path of a discharge leaves canyons rough-cut, with deep inner gorges. This is the Platte River, or northeastern arm of the X in the Laramie mountains. The size of the discharge canyon indicate arc blasts which expose granite tetrahedrons. On one side the tips of the tetrahedrons jut out. This is the leeward side, exposed and broken, whereas the other side shows the flat faces of windward tetrahedrons. This indicates the mountains were laid down by a crosswind before the discharge occurred and blasted this canyon. So the mountains resulted from an evolving storm system that changed its winds surely, due to this big spark. Note on both mountain sides the cross-hatched patterns of shock diamonds, in the canyon flanks created by shock waves. Northeast quadrant wind-cut valleys between north and east arms of the X discharge. Note the many transverse striations of cuts and gorges and how they change orientation between the arms of the discharge. Striations come from deposition layers, shaped by shock waves, transverse to the winds, and by secondary discharge filaments between the circuit paths. The winds drew into a central vortex at the crux of the discharge, drawing dust into a pile, to form the mountains. Therefore each quadrant of the discharge displays shock waves that are oriented by the wind in that quadrant. Secondary discharges are from short- circuiting sparks between current paths, like sparks between live bare wires that are too close together. There is one secondary discharge visible that makes its own X pattern, center right in the image. This is a mini discharge between the AC current in the big X and the static buildup of charge in the wind-cut lane due to the plasma jet stream. It's essentially an AC to DC connection that makes a perfect 90-degree reaction, just like the big X. And it's even oriented in the same orientation, repeating self-similar forms. In the next show, we'll conclude with a look at more wind-cut valleys in the Laramie mountains of Wyoming, and how they're shaped by electromagnetic fields. [Music]

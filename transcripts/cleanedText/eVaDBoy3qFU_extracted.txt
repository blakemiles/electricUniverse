 
You've just entered the
theater of an alien sky.
If the words and images seem strange
to you there's a reason for this.
Our world was once a
vastly different place.
To experience this won't hurt you
and there is nothing to fear.
 
 
We've said it before, and it bears repeating,
that the first step in assessing the
complex and extraordinary claims
of this reconstruction
is to be crystal clear as to the core
details and their testable implications.
This stylized form is the
fulcrum of the reconstruction.
From here, we can look
backwards and forwards,
to name critical events in the
evolution of the configuration.
We earlier named the planetary components:
Saturn is the large sphere, at the celestial pole,
no rings at the time. Venus is
the discharging star-like form,
on-axis in the center of Saturn.
And the smallest sphere, Mars,
visually appearing within
the sphere of Venus.
We've called this a quasi-stable phase of
an evolving or metamorphosing configuration.
Episodic motions of Mars occurred
along the axis provoking streams of
material alternately
between Mars and Venus,
and between Mars and Earth. We also
observe dramatic changes in the number
of discharge streamers that
stretched between Venus and Saturn.
In episode 4, we describe the emergence
of a triangular form from the dusty
plasma medium, and a
subsequent explosive discharge,
producing a vast cloud of luminous and
chaotic debris in the space surrounding
the aligned bodies. Later
appeared the 8-rayed star,
the centerpiece of our chronology, marking a
tentative stabilization of the discharge activity.
We've noted as well, that a libration
occurred along the axis, such that, from
Earth the different discharge
configurations were seen alternately
on-axis and off-axis. For any
assessment of this reconstruction
the shifts in 3-dimensional vantage
point will be essential.
In the early phases of the configuration,
the interplanetary medium
prevented observation of
the Sun as a discrete sphere,
though the Sun's lighting effects on the
configuration become quite clear
with the appearance of the crescent on
Saturn. This meant not only a reduction
in the surrounding dusty plasma medium, but
a more clearly defined cycle of day and night.
At the polar location, the crescent
visually revolved around the polar
center with the
rotation of the Earth,
in a daily cycle of
dimming and brightening.
Closely associated with the appearance
of this turning crescent,
was the descent of material from Mars.
The first effect was a luminous spike
reaching earthward. As Mars moved closer
to the Earth the downward stream of
material extended well below
the visible sphere of Saturn,
eventually connecting with the
circumpolar region of the Earth.
It seems that, over time, the 8-fold
Venus discharge was compressed into just
four directional streamers,
expanding across the face of Saturn.
This phase seems to have merged
insensibly with another,
as a dusty plasma column between Mars and Venus
exhibited a conical form when seen slightly off-axis,
while appearing as a bright equatorial
band around Mars when viewed on-axis.
Metamorphosis continued with the
progressive displacement of Venus and Mars
from their axial positions, the plasma stream
between the two bodies taking on a spiralling form.
As we'll see in due course, with continued
displacement, the spiralling plasma stream
between Mars and Venus gave way to a chaotic,
undulating appearance as the configuration itself
grew catastrophically unstable.
The violent episodes that followed
marked the most terrifying events in
all of human history.
The disastrous interlude between the
dismemberment of the configuration
and a spectacular
phase of reconstruction.

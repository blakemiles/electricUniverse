A new picture of the
cosmos is emerging.
A vastly different picture than the one
astronomers have been painting for over a century.
But a picture that was
drawn many decades ago
by specialists in plasma and
the electrical sciences.
In this picture, antiquated notions of
charge neutrality in space have been erased,
replaced with theoretical models which
recognized the pervasive conductive medium
or fifth state of
matter called plasma
through which electric currents
flow throughout the cosmos.
For many decades,
electric currents were,
and in some instances remain,
verboten in the space sciences.
But with improved instrumentation
and ever finer data,
cosmic electric currents at
all scales are now undeniable.
Nevertheless, a strange dilemma is
unfolding in astronomy and astrophysics.
Scientists attempt to explain
electric currents in space
through theoretical models in which
electricity does not cause anything.
But as we will see,
electric currents in space
are not just a curious byproduct of
gravitational and magnetic phenomena.
From the Electric Universe perspective, the
measurement of electric currents in space
is in the inevitable recognition of the electrical
circuitry that connects celestial bodies
across interplanetary, interstellar
and intergalactic space.
It's essential to remember that
electric currents are only visible
when they meet regions
of dust and gas
where one sees the unmistakable filamentary
structure of electrified plasma.
As in the vast star-forming
networks in our own Milky Way.
Measuring the strength of
cosmic electric currents
is of course no easy matter
for scientists on earth
and is even vastly
more challenging
than estimating the strength
of cosmic magnetic fields.
A good recent example can be
found in our own solar system
and scientists' investigation of
the Saturnian moon Enceladus.
As we outlined in a
recent Space News,
prior to the arrival of the Cassini
spacecraft at Saturn over a decade ago,
planetary scientists had expected
Enceladus to be "geologically dead".
Instead, they found explosive
filamentary jets shooting material
at tremendous velocities up to hundreds
of kilometers from the moon's surface.
Adding to the surprise, the jets
were seen at the moon's South Pole,
the last place they
expected such activity.
As reported by
space.com in 2005,
"The finding flipped everything scientists
knew about Enceladus on its head,
because what should have been a dead
moon appeared to be geologically active
and what was supposed to be the moon's coldest
region turned out to be its warmest."
Since their discovery, scientists have interpreted
the features as so-called "ice geysers"
which they view as a form of
cryovolcanism probably resulting
from Saturn's gravitational forces
producing tidal heating within the moon.
In 2008, Cassini's plasma
spectrometer discovered evidence
for electrical currents in the
plumes of water and dust.
In recent years, a number of
papers have been written
on the presence of negatively charged
dust grains in the so-called plumes.
And now, based on data from
the Cassini Langmuir probe,
a new scientific paper is providing evidence
that these dust grains have actually
"blocked the signal" of the powerful
electrical currents in the Enceladus' jets.
For a number of years,
Standard Theory has proposed
that electrically neutral water molecules
are ejected from the moon's surface
where UV rays from the Sun and interactions
with plasma in Saturn's magnetosphere
strips electrons from water molecules
forming positively charged water ions.
In theory, these ions are then
free to be "picked up" and merged
with co-rotating plasma supposedly
generating an electric current.
Cassini scientists had estimated the
strength of the jets' electric currents
based on disturbances to Cassini's
magnetometer instrument.
But as noted in a summary of
the new scientific paper
in the Journal of
Geophysical Research,
"...when Cassini flew
through the icy plume,
its instruments sent back
vastly different readings.
According to the craft's Langmuir
probe, which measures particle density,
there were enough ions present to
generate a current of 10 million amps.
The magnetometer indicated a current
more than 20 times weaker."
The authors provide
experimental evidence
that ions like those in
the Enceladus plume are,
"...attracted and trapped within the sheaths
of negatively charged dust grains."
They conclude that,
"Cassini's Langmuir probe is
measuring the entire ion population
(both free and trapped ions),
while the Cassini magnetometer detects
the magnetic perturbations associated
with pick up currents from the
smaller population of free ions,
with this distinction possibly
reconciling the ongoing debate
in the literature on the
ion density in the plume."
Simply put, the results are anomalous
for the standard "pick up ions model"
but they are expected if
the surface of Enceladus
is being etched by electrical
discharge machining.
As our chief science adviser Wal
Thornhill has always proposed,
electrical discharge machining works by stripping
electrons from high points on a surface.
In this process on Enceladus,
positive ions generated on the surface
are heated by electric discharge
and electrostatically attracted to
follow the electrons into space.
This would in fact explain the
high loading of positive ions
that the Langmuir probe measured.
And as we reported in great
detail in a recent Space News,
the notion that the gravitational influences
of the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn
produces tidal heating at their respective
moons, resulting in cryovolcanism,
has never been more questionable
in light of new discoveries.
As we noted, in 2013,
scientists reported that the locations
of the so-called volcanic plumes on Io
are completely incompatible with the
moon's internal heat signatures.
A finding which, according to
lead author Christopher Hamilton,
"...can't be reconciled with any existing
solid body tidal heating models."
Likewise, on Enceladus in 2016,
scientists were amazed to discover
that when the so-called geysers on the
moon are producing the most water and dust,
the accompanying gas output
was anomalously low.
As reported by space.com,
"The researchers expected
quite a lot more gas
expelled at the far part
of Enceladus's orbit,
to help explain the
outpouring of dust,
but they found the gas output had bumped
up by just 20%, far less than expected."
The leader of the study
said of the findings,
"We had thought the amount of
water vapor in the overall plume,
across the whole
south polar area,
was being strongly affected
by tidal forces from Saturn.
Instead, we find that the small-scaled
jets are what's changing."
Both scientists' new
insights into the strength
of the electric currents
in the Enceladus plumes
and the failure of the tidal heating
models to explain discovery,
are stunning victories for the electrical
interpretation of the phenomenon.
Of course, given scientists'
difficulties in accurately measuring
the electric currents
at Enceladus,
this naturally emphasizes the present
technical and observational constraints
on quantifying the electromagnetic
energies at the vastest cosmic scales.
However, as we've reported
in many recent episodes,
the evidence for cosmic
scale electric currents
is being more and more routinely presented
in mainstream scientific literature.
One of the most spectacular
electromagnetic phenomena in space
is the many light-years long collimated
jets produced at active galactic nuclei.
Today, standard astrophysics offers
no explanation for the phenomena
that does not involve a hypothetical black
hole producing tremendous magnetism.
However, with increasing regularity,
mainstream scientific literature
has proposed that the jets are
composed of powerful electric currents.
From radio astronomers estimating the
current in an extra galactic jet,
supposedly the equivalent of a
trillion bolts of lightning,
to more recent scientific papers
which describe a "battery mechanism"
close to the hypothetical black
hole producing electric currents.
As a recent paper by
Gabuzda et all states,
"...astrophysical jets are fundamentally
electromagnetic structures."
Nevertheless, in every case
astrophysicists can only envision colossal
gravity producing magnetic fields
which are somehow primary in the creation
of the spectacular "cosmic lightning".
A recent Phys.org report
describes new findings
that can only confound the standard
interpretation of so-called black hole jets,
"As matter is broken down
around a black hole,
jets of electrons are launched
by the magnetic field
from either pole of the black hole
at almost the speed of light.
Astronomers have long been
flummoxed by these jets."
But this view is not supported by new
research into the magnetic fields
surrounding a "black hole" that is
believed to be in our own Milky Way,
within a micro quasar in
the constellation Cygnus.
The phys.org report
summarizes the findings,
"The team observed the magnetic field
of a black hole within our own galaxy
from multiple wavelengths
for the first time...
They discovered that magnetic fields are
much weaker than previously understood,
a puzzling finding that calls into question
previous models of black hole components.
The research shows a deep
need for continued studies
on some of the most mysterious
entities in space."
However, the real deep need may be for
astrophysicists to finally consider
actual theoretical alternatives
to the black hole's existence.
As stated many times by
physicist Wal Thornhill,
what these increasingly
problematic discoveries highlight,
is the problem of over
specialization in the sciences.
Far removed from the
spotlight of popular science,
for decades, plasma cosmologists
have presented experimental
evidence that the spectacular
electromagnetic phenomena
that space scientists
attribute to black holes,
is in fact a high-density energy storage
phenomenon demonstrated in laboratories,
called a plasmoid.
In several episodes, we have
briefly described how a plasmoid
is a kind of load in a
galactic electrical circuit
concentrating and storing energy.
When a plasmoid reaches a threshold
density, it will discharge,
usually along a galaxy spin axis,
producing the stupendous galactic
jets whose electric currents
are now increasingly recognized in
mainstream scientific literature.
All astrophysicists who seek an answer
to the mystery of cosmic jets,
should be acquainted with
the experimental research
into the plasmoid's applicability
to cosmic phenomena.
We encourage viewers to consider the
landmark research of the scientific pioneer,
the late physicist and MIT
scientist Winston H. Bostick,
whose experimental
research on the plasmoid
led to the development of the
dense plasma focus device.
Bostick simulated many astrophysical phenomena
through plasma physics experiments
including galaxy formation
and spectacular cosmic jets.
The jets' collimation over
tremendous cosmic distances,
the knotted structure
seen in many jets,
their nearly light
speed velocity,
their emissions of
synchrotron radiation
and now the inferred measurements
of electric currents in the jets,
are all the predictable features
of a discharging galactic plasmoid.
Since the plasmoid's jets are part of
a vastly larger electrical circuit,
this can also resolve an enduring
intractable problem for astrophysicists
which is the mysterious source of the energy
to the most distant parts of the cosmic jets,
sometimes over many hundreds
of thousands of light years.
Occam's razor states, the simplest
explanation is the most likely.
Standard astrophysics tells us that
electric currents in space are the product
of extremely complex and strange
gravitational and magnetic processes.
The Electric Universe states
that electric currents
flow through the conductive
medium of plasma
which composes more than 99%
of the visible universe.
Celestial bodies moving in electrified
environments, are electromagnetically connected
and will discharge electrically when
experiencing dramatic voltage spikes.
As we see on our own planet in the
form of spectacular blue jets,
elves and red sprites above the
clouds reaching toward space.
Electric currents in space
mean only one thing,
we live in an Electric Universe.

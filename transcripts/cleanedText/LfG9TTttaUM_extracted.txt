You've just entered the
theater of an alien sky.
If the words and images seem strange
to you there's a reason for this.
Our world was once a
vastly different place.
To experience this won't hurt you
and there is nothing to fear.
Discourses on an Alien Sky
With David Talbott
The Myth of the Heavenly Twins
In recent episodes of this series, we've
reviewed the mythic ship of heaven,
a vehicle of the
ancient sun god.
Close to the Earth, a crescent on the
face of the immense planet Saturn,
turned in the polar sky, brightening
and dimming in an archaic daily cycle.
Ancient words and symbols for
this cycle invariably reflect
the symmetrical opposition of the
crescent, in it's contrasting phases.
A phase of growing bright
and a phase of growing dim.
Crescent to the left and
crescent to the right.
Crescent above or below, all in
explicit connection to a daily cycle
with no counterpart in any
celestial behavior observed today.
This unique behavior,
by it's specificity,
gives us an ideal opening to the
ancient Myth of the Heavenly Twins.
It seems that every well-documented culture
preserved memories of the primeval twins,
but few researchers appear to have noticed
the underlying unity of this theme.
The closer we can get to the more
archaic cultural expressions,
the more clearly the improbable
unity will stand out.
Some of the particulars
are long familiar.
Astrologically, the cosmic twins find their most
popular expression in the constellation of Gemini.
Of course, this story itself
is never explained ...
and the constellation is just one of numerous
echoes of the global archetype in later times.
But what inspired
the original idea?
In our reconstruction
of the ancient sky,
the answer comes from the fundamental
role of the rotating crescent,
reflected in the strategic placement and
unique gestures of the cosmic twins
around a central figure and
we see the same geometry
in the two faces of the
ancient god himself.
Two contexts of the
mirror images standout.
The first points back to the
crescent above and below,
and the second to the same crescent in it's
positions to the left and right in the daily cycle.
By far the most data comes
from the Egyptian symbolism,
expressing the mirror-like aspects of the
crescent in the concept of the symbolic Ka,
usually translated as a double.
But why was the Ka hieroglyph
simply a pair of arms?
Our explanation is that the crescent-form,
when seen behind the polar column
that is so fundamental
to this reconstruction,
readily provoked an imaginative
interpretation as two arms or wings.
In fact, the Egyptian Ka symbol was the perfect
expression of the twin-like aspect of the crescent,
one position in the daily cycle appearing as
a mirror or "twin" of the opposite position.
Upright arms in the phase
of growing bright,
inverted arms in the
phase of dimming.
The concept of a "double" in the sense of a
mirror image could not be more appropriate.
The symbolism is abundantly evident in
iconography of the Phoenician goddess, Tanit.
In ancient Egypt, the concept also found
expression in the oppositely placed
twin goddesses
Isis and Nephthys,
in mirror positions to the left and
right of the central sun god Ra
or one of his mythic
counterparts.
This connection to the enclosing
crescent will explain
why the arms or hands
of the twin goddesses
so frequently displayed an enclosing
aspect in relationship to the king.
When paired as twins, divine figures represented
the two halves of the celestial kingdom,
marked out by a revolving
crescent in it's daily circuit.
In the Pyramid Texts, the king declares,
"Isis is before me, Nephthys is behind me".
Or, "The two mistresses of Buto
accompany you to the right and left".
Or alternatively, the king
declares that the goddess
"Neith is behind me, and
Selket is before me".
Again, nothing in natural experience today
will account for the pervasive imagery.
The twin aspects of the
giant sphere of Saturn
came to identify that sphere as
the vast womb of creation itself.
"Oh you two who conceived Ra,
you shall give birth to me...
The two great ladies (Isis
and Nephthys) bore you".
"My mother is Isis, my
nurse is Nephthys".
The king ascends upon the thighs of Isis, the
king climbs upon the thighs of Nephthys".
Elsewhere, in imitation of Ra,
the deceased king aspires to
"shine between the
two thighs of Nut".
Keep in mind, that these roles of goddess figures
placed into the service of crescent symbolism
must not be confused with the role of the
planet Venus, the prototypical goddess,
in our reconstruction, a quite
different topic discussed earlier,
with much more
discussion to follow.
Our point here is, that the cosmic
twins find a persuasive explanation
in the twin-like aspects
of the revolving crescent.
For example, the crescent as
the image of a cosmic ship.
See that connection, and the
identification of the sun god's boat
with the cosmic twins comes
as no surprise at all.
The twins, Isis and Nephthys,
were named the "two boats."
Or alternately, the Egyptians invoked
the two boats as Atet and Sektet.
Atet, the descending
boat of "growing strong"
was linked to the left side of the
primeval sun, as we would expect,
while the ascending Sektet boat, meaning
"growing weak" was linked to the right side.
These twin aspects of
the revolving crescent
give us a key to the larger
panorama of Egyptian symbolism.
For the Egyptians, the position
of the crescent above and below,
marked out two regions
called the two "Aterts".
Chapter 141 of the
Egyptian Book of the Dead
identifies the upper Atert
with inactivity or dimness,
usually mistranslated as the
region of the Night-ship,
but literally meaning the ship in it's
phase of dimming or growing weak,
at the top of it's circuit.
Conversely, the texts connect
the so-called "Day ship",
literally the ship of brightness with
the lower Atert, all in perfect harmony
with the symbolism we've already
noted in our previous Discourses.
Right and left, above and below are the
essential qualities of the cosmic twins.
For example, in Egypt we see
the aspects above and below
in the symbolic pairing of
the figures Nut and Geb.
The goddess, signified the upper
region and the male half,
the lower portion of this circuit,
was defined by the male power Geb
denoting also the twin peaks
of Akhet, the world mountain.
Together the two mythic images meant
the unity of the celestial domain,
considered as the prototype of Egypt:
the two lands, upper and lower,
seen as a copy on Earth of the Divine
Plan first displayed in the sky.
The idea was stated
emphatically by Henri Frankfort
in his groundbreaking book,
"Kingship and the Gods".
The so-called 'two lands of Egypt' he said,
"reflected the original order of creation itself".
"A state dualistically conceived must have appeared to the
Egyptian the manifestation of the order of creation."
Indeed, every primary interpretation of
the revolving crescent was, predictably,
linked to the dualities of above
and below, or left and right.
It was not just as a pair of outstretched arms
that we see the twin roles of the crescent,
upright in the phase of growing bright and
inverted in the phase of growing dim.
And not just in the symbolism
of the cosmic ship.
We've seen the same symbolism
of the archaic day and night
in oppositely (or symmetrically)
positioned horns.
And most incongruously, the upright
and inverted twin peaks of heaven.
In all instances, the
upright and inverted forms
express precisely the same connections
to the phases of the daily cycle.
The most fundamental fact about the cosmic
twins is that they are not just twins,
but they surround and enclose a venerated
god, or king, or central star.
Confirmed by simply observing how
the symmetrically placed arms,
or arms and wings, so frequently
enclose and protect the king.
Amongst the most famous of primeval
twins were the Greek Dioscuri
who, according to the
leading expert A.B. Cook,
represented two halves
of a celestial circuit.
Here we see the Dioscuri in a pose
directing us to ancient symbolism
of two enclosing arms about a central
orb, or star, or divine figure.
Since the cosmic twins are
mirror images of each other,
it's not surprising that the
Greeks retained the connection
by placing the central star and
the two Dioscuri on a mirror.
In mythic terms, the contrasting twin-like
positions of the illuminated crescent
were the two faces of the
primeval power Janus,
giving rise to the so-called
Janiform countenance.
Thus, Joannes the Lydian,
describes the ancient celebrants
honoring the god Janus on the
first day of January, his month,
"dressed up in a two-faced mask,
and people call him Saturnus,
identifying him with Kronos
(the Greek god of Saturn)."
Of course, the entire idea
can only appear absurd.
But from the vantage point
of our reconstruction,
it is the predictable, the
inescapable, astronomical connection.
And by this reasoning from ancient
facts, we acquire a starting point
for a new and radical
interpretation of the cosmic twins,
a subject to which we'll return
after laying further ground
on the visual dynamics of
the Polar Configuration.

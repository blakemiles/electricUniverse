Welcome to Space News from the Electric

The following presentation is an
adaptation of the Mel Acheson
picture of the day article, “Really?”
The link to the article may be found in the
description box of this video. What's
reality? For science, for the past century
or more it's “what's out
there”, “the given”. And we
get to know it by looking at it. I say
”looking” to mean all sensation. To get to
know it better, we need only to look
closer. To that end, we invent microscopes
and telescopes to magnify it. We
substitute electronic devices for our
eyes in order to “see” reality in radio
and X-ray wavelengths. Our
technologically enhanced senses have put
us more in touch with reality than at
any other time in the history of our
species. But we've known all along
that's not how knowing works. And if
that's not how we know, what we know
probably isn't what we think it is.
Reality may not be real. Looking only
produces a tingling in the nerves.
Sensation, as such, is meaningless. People
learn to make sense of their sensations
soon after birth, and by the time they
can talk, they've forgotten how they
learned and even that they did learn. But
when cataract surgery was first
perfected, it enabled many people who had
been blind from birth to see for the
first time. Marius von Senden wrote about
their experiences in Space and Sight. The
newly sighted people experienced patches
of color or brightness without meaning.
They had to learn to associate the
patches with concepts previously
associated with other sensations. This
may be the only episode in the history
of our species in which individuals
capable of communicating their response
experienced “pure observation”.
Nor do nerves transmit anything. One
nerve is stimulated to discharge its
tiny electrical spark, and this may
stimulate nearby nerves to discharge
theirs. There's no variation in amplitude,
no “gray tones”. It's either on or off.
When the chain of discharges reaches the
brain, the only way to distinguish one
spark from another is the relationship
with all other sparks. These
relationships can form into groups, and
the groups can become associated.
Associations of associations can
stimulate each other.
Hierarchies of associations can develop,
which can become “tangled” by associations
among higher- and lower-level
associations. In this way, a dynamic
classification system arises. It creates
the sensory order which is not so much a
one-to-one mapping of the real world as
a metaphor of it. For example, in the real
world, colors are part
of a linear arrangement
of increasing wavelengths. Beyond red is
infrared, and beyond violet is ultraviolet.
But in the sensory order, red and violet
join at purple to make a circle. There is
no purple wavelength in the real world.
So, looking can in no way be equated with
knowing. We need an idea to make sense of
sensation. That's what theories do. It's
also what fantasies do, and they're not
what we usually consider to be
knowledge. We're missing something.
What turns percepts and concepts, those
associations of nervous sparks,
into knowledge is judgment: answering the
question, “Is it true?” Either answer - yes or
no - does the trick. Douglas Allchin points
out in The Epistemology of Error, “The key
epistemological distinction ... is between
empirically unresolved questions, or
uncertainty, and resolved questions...”
between determinate and ambiguous. But
judgment, unlike diamonds, is seldom
forever. There can be new sensations, new
data, and new ideas, new theories. Old
sensations and ideas can be rearranged.
The question for judgment can be
recalled. The determinate can become
ambiguous again. The tangled hierarchies
of associations of associations of nerve
sparks are continually re-energizing
themselves and shifting their patterns.
Sometimes they reorganize themselves en
masse: There can be paradigm
shifts which shift reality.
How can reality shift if it's “what's out
there,” to be known by looking at it? Maybe
we started our march down Epistemology
Lane on the wrong foot. Notice that from
the beginning, we've unconsciously
assumed a dichotomy between a “real” “out
there” and what must therefore be an ”unreal”
“in here”. One of Piet Hein’s Grooks
is pertinent: “lines we neatly drew and
later neatly stumbled over.” A clue to
catching our balance is to notice that,
to me, your nerve sparks encompass each
other and can't be dichotomies. Notice
too that equating knowing with looking,
also equates reality with the
descriptions of that looking. This error
underlies much of modern physics:
Mathematical equations are symbolic
representations of the descriptions of
looking, so equating reality with the
descriptions, reduces reality to a set of
equations.
A vicious circle results: The equations
allow you to deduce reality and you no
longer need even to look. What began as
empiricism ends up as idealism. The
objective and the subjective become
confused. Cause and effect become
meaningless. The arrow of time becomes an
illusion, as in relativity, and existence
depends on measurement, as in quantum
mechanics. Our unconscious assumptions in
the beginning, have come back around to
bite us on the ankle. And in light of the
nerve sparks and sensory metaphors and
mutable judgments, an even more basic
unconscious and untenable assumption
comes to light: that reality is something
we start with. For science, for the
cognitive understanding of our
experiences,
reality is really what we end up with.

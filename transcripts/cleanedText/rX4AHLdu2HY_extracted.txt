It is well known that Ptolemy, in his 
attempt to establish Greek astronomy on
a sound scientific foundation, drew 
upon ancient observations made by
Babylonian sky watchers in order to
develop his models for predicting the
motions of the Sun, Moon and planets.
What was true in Ptolemy’s time remains
true today. In order to fine-tune their
theories on such fundamental matters as
the length of the day, or changes in the
Earth's rate of rotation, astronomers
analyzed ancient observations of the moon made by
ancient Babylonian, Chinese and Arabic astronomers.
In a recent book on the role of ancient
observations in modern astronomy, John
Steele underscored the point. Quote,
”Astronomy always has been and still is a
science that relies on the use of past observations.
Unlike most sciences, astronomy can never
be truly experimental: astronomers can only observe
the astronomical phenomena that present themselves...
Perhaps uniquely in the sciences,
astronomers therefore, are forced to rely
upon empirical data collected by their predecessors.”
End of quote. Yet, while modern astronomers regularly
employ ancient astronomical observations
recorded in Babylonian diary texts and
Chinese annals to test their measurements and 
formulate their theories, they typically pay little heed
to the innumerable ancient artworks
depicting the respective celestial
bodies. This decision represents a significant
oversight. Consider the example provided by the
so-called ‘Lamat’ sign, one of the most familiar
glyphs in the Mayan codices long believed to denote
the planet Venus. In the Dresden codices elsewhere,
the Lamat glyph is often coupled with the prefix
‘chak’, signifying red or great, and given 
the fact various Maya cultures denoted the
Morningstar by the name red, or great, star, the
phrase ‘chak ek’ is typically translated as Great Star
Venus. The Lamat sign is archaic in
nature, early exemplars appearing already
in pre-classic times circa 1,000 to 400 BCE.
Martha Macri emphasized the remarkable
continuity of these images and their
attendant symbolism over the millennia.
Quote, “The Venus star logograph is depicted
on portable objects from the Preclassic,
Classic and Postclassic periods into the 16th century.
This continuity of an image that is
graphically complex and semantically
consistent is evidence not of the
borrowing of a word or concept, but of
the transmission of a specific image
over an extensive geographic and
temporal range.” End of quote.
A number of recent studies have
questioned the glyphs direct link to
Venus with various scholars arguing that
Lamat sign serves as a generic term for
star, rather than signifying any particular planetary
body. That said, the general consensus among
Mayanists appears to be that the Lamat sign ’Red
ek’ is a logogram denoting quote, ‘star’, ‘planet’
’Venus’. End of quote. How then are we to
understand the great star of Mayan cosmology?
The first point to be made is that the
Great Red Star was almost certainly not
the planet Venus. Rather, it was the planet
Mars, or Mars and Venus in conjunction.
This identification is explicit among the Skidi
Pawnee, renowned for their astronomy-based
religious beliefs, who described the mythical
Morning Star as a powerful warrior and red in color.
According to the Skidi creation myth, a
grand conjunction between Mars and Venus
marked the origin of all living beings. Quote, ”The 
second god placed in the heavens was Evening star,
known to the white people as Venus...She was a
beautiful woman. By speaking and waving her hands she
could perform wonders. Through this star
and Morning Star all things were created.”
Analogous reports will be found among
other Amerindian tribes, although it
must be admitted that the evidence is often disjointed
in nature and open to alternative interpretations.
Among the Puget Indians of the northwest
coast, the Morning Star is not only
described as red, it is carefully
distinguished from the Evening star
which is described as white. So too, 
the Osage remember the Morning Star
as a red god; quote, “Great Star or Red Star,
a male being, is the Morning Star. "
The very same idea is common
to the Delaware Indians. Quote,
”The Delaware call Morning Star the 
Great Star or Red Star.” End of quote.
The recurring emphasis among Amerindian
cultures upon the red color of the Great
Star must command our attention. As 
the most prominent red star in the sky, it
stands to reason that ancient sky watchers would
have described Mars as red or ruddy in color.
Venus on the other hand, typically
presents a whitish color and is rarely,
if ever, denoted by a name signifying red.
Equally telling is the fact that in all
of the tribes referenced above,
the mythical Morning Star is always
described as a male warrior, exactly as in
Mesoamerican lore. Here too it is difficult, if not
impossible, to find an ethnographic
report describing the planet Venus as a
masculine warrior anywhere in the continent
apart from disputed examples from Mesoamerica.
Given the antiquity of these Amerindian
mythological traditions, not to mention
the likely common ancestry and
historical relation between the vast
majority of the indigenous tribes on the North American
continent, it stands to reason that the traditions
attached to the Morningstar and
Mesoamerican narratives and codices
belong to the same general belief system.
In short, whether it is the red color
ascribed to the Great Star, or its
masculine nature or intimate connection
to war, the preponderance of evidence
favors an identification with the planet
Mars, the Red Planet par excellence.
To return to the unique constellation
depicted in the Lamat glyph, if 
Mayanists are in agreement, the
Lamat glyph has something to do with stars and/
or Venus, exactly what the image represents
remains a matter of much conjecture.
If the four-rayed star represents a star
or Venus, what are we to make of the four
circular dots? Susan Milbrath, an anthropologist
specializing in ancient Mesoamerican
astronomy, suggested that the glyph has
reference to the four phases of Venus's
appearance and disappearance. Quote, “The
fact that there are four circles in a cross-shaped
frame, naturally suggests the four phases of
Venus associated with four different directions.”
End of quote. Although a great deal of ink has been
employed in discussing the possible
astronomical significance of the
Lamat's role in Mesoamerican symbolism,
precious little thought has been devoted
to the natural historical roots of the glyph 
itself. Most scholars, with Milbrath, have
concluded that the glyph is abstract
in nature and encodes some arcane
astronomical knowledge about Venus.
The possibility that the Lamat glyph
faithfully depicted an actual star
constellation of prehistoric sky has
never been entertained, to the best of my 
knowledge. Yet, there is much reason to believe
that this is exactly what the icon represents,
namely an accurate depiction of the Great
Star during a prehistoric period. The
fact that analogous pictographs we
found around the globe, offers compelling
evidence in support of this proposition.
A NUZ cylinder seal, purportedly dating
to the mid-second millennium BCE, depicts
a star surrounded by four dots. The 
resemblance between the Mesopotamian
and Mesoamerican glyphs is undeniable.
Not only is there a central four-rayed
star, but four circles or orbs are set 
in the corners, exactly as in the Lamat
sign. Not unlike the longevity of 
the Lamat glyph in Mesoamerican
iconography, the quadripartite star symbol
persisted for millennia in Mesopotamia.
The symbolic importance of the stellar
image is indicated by the fact that
Assyrian kings had it depicted on their royal 
garments. Other Mesopotamian cylinder seals
substitute a flower-like form or
cruciform structure for the central star.
One early cylinder seal represents a four- petaled
flower star with four circles or dots at its corners.
In another cylinder seal, a cruciform structure
is represented together with circular dots.
While the most common form of the
Lamat in Mesoamerica shows a central
four-rayed star, other early examples of the
glyph show a flower-like object or cross instead.
As we will discover, these variant forms, all 
familiar symbols of stars among Ameindian
cultures, offer a valuable clue as to
the celestial origins of the Lamat glyph.
What are we to make of this iconographic 
evidence? If nothing else, the presence of
analogous stellar images on opposite
sides of the Atlantic in very early
times, suggest the probability that such
artworks encode some readily observable
astronomical reality, be it a prominent
star or constellation. Yet the fact
remains that it is impossible to point
to an object in the present sky that
depicts a four-rayed star surrounded by
four dots. Hence the mystery presented by
these widespread anomalous stellar images.
I discussed the Lamat glyph and the
many faces of Venus and other works noting
its possible relationship to the planet Venus.
At the time I was operating under the
assumption that the image depicted a
conjunction of Mars and Venus in which
the red planet appeared in front of the
larger orb, but I had no idea how to explain the
four smaller dots surrounding the central star.
Upon discussing the matter with Anthony 
Peratt in 2002, he pointed out that the dots are
indicative of intense synchrotron radiation
produced by four parallel Birkeland
currents resulting from a high-current Z-pinch event.
According to Peratt, quote “...the only known
mechanism that produces synchrotron
radiation are electrons spiraling about
a magnetic field at nearly the speed of light.”
Indeed, in high-energy/density plasma
experiments conducted at the Los Alamos
Labs in the 1990s, Peratt himself had
generated very similar images.
In the image on the left one finds a
close analog to the classic Lamat sign
depicted in the first figure here, in
which a central star is surrounded by four small
circles. In the figure on the right, the central
star takes on a rosette-shaped image,
not unlike that depicted in other figures here.
I returned to the Lamat symbolism in
the Great Star published in 2002 and
once again reached out to Dr. Peratt for instruction
in clarifying the various structures in question.
In 2009 he wrote me as follows, quote, “Of
course this symbol is found all over the
place...It is indeed Venus and Mars in front
but the quincunx is yet in front of Mars.
See my Physica Scripta article that
purposely does not show everything yet.
Too early and I’ll have to find an 
alias to publish under.” End of quote.
Alas, in the intervening years, Tony has yet to
elaborate on his groundbreaking experimental findings.
Findings which help elucidate the
testimony provided by the ancient
pictographs and glyphs associated with the celestial
bodies. Yet one thing is certain, in the case of
the Lamat sign, a pictograph is indeed worth a thousand
words. In summary, the Lamat sign will never be
explained by reference to the present sky or 
to the familiar periodicities of the planet Venus.
Indeed it is our position that the
stellar image in question represents a
veritable smoking gun pointing to an
extraordinary planetary conjunction in
relatively recent prehistory,
likely during the neolithic period.
If so, and if in fact the Lamat sign
depicts a grand conjunction between Mars
and Venus during the brief period 
when the two planets were lined along a
shared polar axis, it follows that high-energy
discharge events characterize this conjunction, and
it must have been a memorable and likely
very dangerous period in Earth history.

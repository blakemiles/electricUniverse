Previously, in playing with new thinking,
the first episode of this seven arc
series, I talked about how the new
discoveries of the space age were
changing the ways in which we thought about the 
cosmos. We're making observations that had been
undetectable by our biological senses.
They are now confronting us with
evidence that doesn't fit with the ways
of thinking that have become so familiar
that we take them for granted. The night
sky isn't dark and empty to electronic
sensors, but bright and full. There's no
precedence for this in all of human existence.
The universe of our senses is radically
changed, but it's still human minds who try to
make sense of it. Making sense is a
creative act and that works best when we
don't take it too seriously. In this episode
we'll be playing with historical thinking.
Knowledge tends to progress incrementally for long
periods, as popular theories are developed and
adjusted to fit each other and discrepant evidence. But
occasionally the inevitable contradictions and ad-hoc
additions become a hindrance to further progress.
Hatching the popular theories becomes
cumbersome and ugly. Entirely fresh
foundational ideas become necessary.
New metaphysical assumptions that
underlie any theory are required.
The worldview, the paradigm, changes.
For example Ptolemy's geocentric model
of planetary movements with perfect
circle epicycles, spinning on perfect
circle deferents, was geometrical,
no orbits, and kinematic, no force.
It was good enough for casting horo-
scopes, which was the goal at that time.
Its practitioners didn't worry about
the little inaccuracies relative to the
precision of the instruments they used,
but they did worry about the linear
element, the equant that corrected for the greater
inaccuracies. They presumed the heavens of the gods
were perfect and therefore operated only with perfect
circles. Copernicus's heliocentric model was not
that much of a cognitive revolution. He
kept the epicycles and deferents. He only
discovered that centering them on the Sun eliminated
the equant, thus making the system more perfect.
He revised the structure of the
Ptolemaic model, but not the way of
thinking on which it was founded. The 
physics changed, but the metaphysics didn't.
The cognitive revolution began with
Tycho Brahe building more precise
measuring instruments. Kepler then
realized that Brahe’s more precise
locations could be better matched 
with ellipses than with perfect circles.
But the perfect heaven's world view didn't allow
ellipses. At the same time Galileo's telescopic
observations confirmed the existence
of imperfections, spots on the Sun.
Other observations also contributed to
doubting the perfection of the heavens.
Newton's idea of a central force, gravity,
acting on orbiting masses, not only
allowed, but required ellipses. The
revolution was the replacement of a
kinematic and geometric way of thinking with a 
dynamic one. At first, people objected that Newton was
promoting an occult, spooky action at a distance. But
the accuracy of his results eclipsed the uneasiness.
Soon gravity displaced circles. The theories changed;
the math changed; calculus replaced geometry;
many of the assumptions changed; and 
the ancient world view changed with them.
But one underlying assumption of the
perfect heavens of the gods persisted.
Alexander Pope wrote, “Nature and nature's
laws lay hid in the night. God said, Let
Newton be! and all was light!”
The underlying attitude of belief in one
absolute perfect reality, independent 
of cognitive operations, persisted.
Perfect circles were replaced with perfect 
clockwork. A reified natural law, mistaking an
abstraction for a physical entity, became the 
new god. Metaphysics never changes 100 percent.
It's still human minds with their inertia
of prior beliefs, that make the new sense.
The progress of instrumentation wouldn't
reveal discrepancies between Newtonian
theory and evidence for a couple of centuries.
Even then, and still to today, the idea of
gravity was good enough for the
ballistic goals that the invention of
cannons and rockets had made more important
than the goals of casting horoscopes.
But in the 19th century Michelson and
Morley's observations of the invariance
of the speed of light, along with other
difficulties, generated a crisis for Newton's model.
Time was independent and absolute
in Newton's theory, but more precise
observations seemed to indicate that
it varied with velocity, especially as
velocity approached the speed of light.
Fast moving objects seemed both to weigh
more and to shrink, and their clocks ticked at
different rates. Einstein resolved the difficulties in
the next century by returning to geometry.
The non-Euclidean geometry of a curved
coordinate system made more accurate
sense of those new observations.
Celestial bodies were no longer
propelled along orbits by a distant
spooky force, but coasted along geodesics.
Yet still in this age of relativity, people
still talk about gravity as a force and
the speed of light is the new absolute.
Now, new instruments observe the heavens
in ways that have been inaccessible to
our biological senses. Radio waves,
infrared, ultraviolet, X- and gamma rays,
in-place measurements of bodies in 
space and of that space itself, orders of
magnitude more precise observations 
and data. The resulting evidence reveals
notions, forms and compositions that are
generating a crisis for the conventional models.
The night sky is no longer dark and
empty, but bright and full of plasma. And
the experimentally discovered behaviors
of electrically active plasma make more
accurate and direct sense of the evidence than
the predictions of the gravity and gas models.
For example, both Herbig-Haro stars 
and active galaxies exhibit thin, twisting
threads of plasma from their poles 
that extend many light years into space.
Condensations, or blobs, are often
scattered along them. They give off
synchrotron radiation from electrons
spiraling in strong magnetic fields.
These are impossible in a purely gravity
and gas universe, but are expected in an
electricity and plasma one. In the Standard Model,
plasma is often called an ionized gas and then the
discussion relapses into gravity and gas descriptions.
Million degree hot gas, shock waves, jets,
gravitationally collapsing clouds, but
plasma doesn't behave like a gas
and descriptions based on gas theory
fail to describe the matter accurately.
Any substance at a million degrees is fully
ionized and behaves as a plasma, not as a gas.
Even cold molecular clouds contain enough 
charged dust particles and ions to act like plasma.
Concepts of pressure and volume are supplanted
by the Bennett pinch and double layers.
Those particles and ions have extremely
low densities. If they were electrically
neutral, as assumed by the Standard Model,
they could travel long distances before
colliding with another particle. They
would be unlikely to generate a shock
wave with billiard-ball-like collisions.
But they are carrying an extensive
electromagnetic field. They constitute
plasma and display typical plasma
behavior. Filaments, cells, double layers and 
the like. Shock waves are the closest thing
astronomers can imagine to the electrical effects
they deny. If the threads of plasma spiraling out
of the poles of stars were jets, subject
to gas laws, they would soon dissipate in
the vacuum of space. But they remain coherent 
for long distances, spiraling around each other like,
well, like Birkeland currents.
Gravitational collapse in the Standard
Model itself is actually very difficult,
if not impossible to achieve.
Any rotational motion in the original
cloud will be amplified as the cloud
collapses, like spinning ice skaters drawing in
their arms. The centrifugal force will soon reach
equilibrium with the gravitational force and the
collapse will stop. Plasma, on the other hand, requires
collapse: Bennett pinch and spin, the
response of moving charged particles in
a magnetic field and those forces can be much stronger
than gravity. They can also repel, not just attract, as
with gravity, as seen in the long-range
attraction and short-range repulsion
that keeps Birkeland filaments twisting
around each other without merging.
To explain, or to explain away the new
evidence, the gravity and gas theories
have been patched with hypothetical,
unobservable and untestable phantoms-
collapsed matter, dark matter, dark energy-
the phantoms must be there to save the
theories from falsification and the need
to change deep-seated habits of thinking.
Theorists overlook that they have
inverted empirical methods, assumed that
their theories are the touchstone of
truth, and are judging the acceptability
of evidence by its conformity with their prior 
beliefs. But as the patches proliferate, the
stitches have begun to obscure the
theories and to weaken the underlying
metaphysics and empirical methods. The
Standard Model of the gravity-and-gas
paradigm, no longer provides a straightforward
explanatory structure, but has become a nuisance.
Gravity and gas don't allow for
electricity in space. Plasma requires it.
That's the fundamental distinction between
the Standard Model and the EU Model.
From a historical point of view, it's
time for another conceptual revolution.

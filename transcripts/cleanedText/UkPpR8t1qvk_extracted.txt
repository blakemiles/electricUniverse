A new scientific paper
provides stunning confirmation
of one of the most
striking predictions
of the Electric Universe/
catastrophist hypothesis.
The paper, published
in the journal Icarus,
reports that the water in
Saturn's moons and in its rings
is remarkably similar to
water on our own planet,
a completely unexpected finding
for planetary scientists.
The team of scientists made the
discovery by remotely measuring
the isotopic ratios of water and carbon
dioxide in the Saturnian system.
As reported by the
Phys.org the findings
"...mean we need to change models of
the formation of the Solar System
because the new results are in
conflict with existing models.
Models for the formation
of the Solar System
indicate that the
deuterium/hydrogen ratio
should be much higher in the
colder outer solar system
than in the hotter inner
system where the Earth formed.
Deuterium is more abundant
in cold molecular clouds.
Some models predict the
deuterium hydrogen ratio
should be 10 times higher for the
Saturn system than on Earth.
But the new measurements show this is not
the case for Saturn's rings and satellites
except Saturn's moon Phoebe.
Those who follow this
series understand
this is only the latest in a seemingly
endless string of 'surprises'
for the standard model of our solar
system's formation and history.
Discovery continues to offer no support at all
to the widely accepted nebular hypothesis
which states that planets formed
from accretion in a nebular cloud
that collapsed gravitationally
billions of years ago.
However, as unexpected as
the connection between
Saturn and our own planet is
for planetary scientists,
this connection was in
fact explicitly predicted
by one of the great scientific
heretics of the 20th century.
Nearly 3/4 of a century ago, Dr. Immanuel
Velikovsky proposed that within human memory,
a period of chaos reigned in
the inner solar system.
In this scenario, one of the
migrating planets was Saturn.
And it was Velikovsky's
seemingly outrageous thesis
that the water in Earth's
oceans came from the gas giant.
In part one of this
two-part presentation,
physicist Wal Thornhill outlines the
incredible and ongoing predictive success
of the Electric Universe/
catastrophist paradigm.
There has been a flood of
scientific reports recently,
supporting the Electric Universe model
and confirming its predictions.
But the most spectacular example of
predictive success occurred on December 3rd
when it was reported in phys.org
that the water in Saturn's rings and
satellites is like that on Earth!
Astonishingly, the water has the
same signature isotopic ratios
of deuterium to hydrogen or
heavy water to normal water.
It happened that the founder of mythohistorical
cosmology, Dr. Immanuel Velikovsky,
made the shocking claim based
on his research in the 1940's
that Earth's water
came from Saturn.
Of course, a single success is open to
the charge that it was a lucky guess,
no matter how well-documented
the research,
but Velikovsky went on to be the
only scholar before the Space Age
to successfully predict the extreme
surface temperature of Venus,
the remnant magnetism
of Moon rocks,
radio noises from Jupiter and many
other remarkable discoveries.
His thesis uncovered a period
within mythic human memory
of awe-inspiring chaos
in the planetary system
involving electrical discharges between
planets during close encounters,
the mythic thunderbolts
of the planetary gods.
The ancients were adamant, as
Heraclitus around 500 BC put it,
"...it is the thunderbolt
that steers the universe."
It was no earthly spark;
it took the strange involuted
corkscrew form of plasmoids
and was associated with stones or meteorites
falling from the sky, and global devastation.
It was Velikovsky who first threw down
the gauntlet to modern astronomers
to recognize
electricity in space.
They refused to pick it up and instead behaved
like the Inquisition against Galileo.
It seems, an unstable solar system
was against their religion.
To squash growing interest in his ideas
on campuses in America in the 70's,
the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, known as the AAAS,
organized the thinly disguised
ambush in San Francisco in 1974.
It became a rallying cry for dissident scholars
to attend the first international symposium
on Velikovsky and the recent
history of the solar system
in Hamilton Ontario later that
year where, incidentally,
I met Velikovsky and David
Talbott for the first time.
But nothing has changed in the following
decades despite the Space-Age discovery
that magnetism exists
throughout the universe.
It shows that astrophysics
is in the wrong hands
and should be passed to
electrical engineers.
Velikovsky's best-selling book 'Worlds
in Collision' published in 1950,
was the inspiration for
a number of scholars
which has lately resulted in a
truly interdisciplinary cosmology
based on human history and the electrical
nature of matter and matter interactions
including the forces of
magnetism and gravity.
The Electric Universe was developed in an effort
to explain the remarkable research results
of those inspired by Velikovsky's forensic
technique of investigating mythic history,
in particular the works of David
Talbott and Dwardu Cardona
concerning the worship and central
role of Saturn as our original Sun.
Electric Universe cosmology reestablishes
the successful classical physics
of the 18th and 19th centuries
and its extraordinary successful
space-age predictions
contrast markedly with the lack of
predictive success for the last century
of the purely
theoretical approach
which adopts mathematical
concepts and ideals
without regard for the principles of physics
or basic standards and definitions.
A classic case of the
'cart before the horse.'
The recent discovery of
the isotopic likeness
between the water of
Saturn's rings and the Earth
is documented in
the Icarus paper
'Isotopic Ratios of Saturn's
Rings and Satellites:
Implications for the Origin
of Water and Phoebe'.
The simplest interpretation
is that the long-held model of the
formation of the solar system is invalid.
The Phys.org reports,
"By developing a new method
for measuring isotopic ratios
of water and carbon
dioxide remotely,
scientists have found that the water
in Saturn's rings and satellites
is unexpectedly like
water on the Earth...
Adding a neutron to one hydrogen
atom, (that) then called deuterium,
increases the mass of a water molecule by
about 5%, in other words - heavy water,
and that small change results
in isotopic differences
in the formation of a
planet, moon or comet,
and changes the evaporation
of water after formation.
The deuterium to hydrogen ratio is a
fingerprint of the formation conditions,
including temperature and
evolution over time.
Evaporating water enriches deuterium
in the remaining surface.
Models for the formation of
the solar system indicate
that the deuterium to hydrogen
ratio should be much higher
in the colder outer Solar System than in the
hotter inner system where the Earth formed."
Planetary scientists faced a fundamental
problem to explain the presence of our oceans.
The hydrogen and oxygen required
would have been swept out of the
inner solar system by the early Sun.
So, they resorted to an ad hoc story
that countless comet collisions
from a hypothetical invisible cloud
of comets enclosing the solar system
deposited the Earth's
water eons ago.
This new discovery
discounts that hypothesis.
A simple hypothesis will connect
Saturn's rings' material with the Earth.
True the deuterium to hydrogen ratio is a
fingerprint of the water formation conditions
and it is more straightforward to
not assume evolution of the ratio
and to suggest that it is a fingerprint
of the origin of the water on Earth.
Given the success of Velikovsky's remarkable
prediction based on documented evidence,
we cannot simply assume the Earth
formed in the inner solar system.
This latest evidence clearly supports
Velikovsky's mytho-historical cosmology
which identifies a close association
between Saturn and the Earth
within human experience.
That means the comforting belief the Earth
has been circling the Sun like it does today
largely undisturbed for
billions of years,
has been as great an impediment
to scientific progress
as the centuries-long and
even more comforting belief
in a primordially
Earth-centered universe.
Of course, too shockingly
unexpected and related discovery
supporting an earlier
scientific claim,
raises the odds enormously
in favor of a hypothesis.
This was true of Immanuel
Velikovsky's later claim in 1950,
of the extreme surface
heat of Venus,
when everyone else believed
it will be similar to Earth
because the two planets are twins
according to conventional thinking.
But the gravitational model of the
formation of the solar system, eons ago,
has been shown to be fictional
now that we have discovered thousands of
exoplanetary systems that don't match it.
It persists only because it is the
foundation of our uniformitarian belief
in a safe, clockwork
solar system.
It is merely a soothing bedtime
story about the history of Earth
and our misunderstood and
forgotten ancestors.
De Santillana and von Dechend in
Hamlet's Mill, described our period as
'The Darwinian Period'
Where "the simple idea of evolution, which it
is no longer thought necessary to examine,
spreads like a tent over all those ages that
lead from primitivism into civilization.
Gradually, we are told, step by step,
men produced the arts-and-crafts,
this and that, until they emerged
into the light of history.
Those soporific words 'gradually' and
'step by step' repeated incessantly,
are aimed at covering an ignorance
which is both vast and surprising.
One should like to
inquire; which steps;
But then one is lulled, overwhelmed and
stupefied by the gradualness of it all,
which is at best a platitude,
only good for pacifying the mind,
since no one is willing to imagine that
civilization appeared in a thunderclap.
The use of the word 'thunderclap'
is remarkably appropriate.
And that is the crux
of the problem,
for Velikovsky's proposal
of a red-hot cometary Venus
as a motivation for the
sudden rise of civilization
challenged that comforting
Darwinian belief.
The result was a modern equivalent
to medieval book burning.
The textbook publisher Macmillan was
threatened by latter-day astronomer priests
who boasted they had not read the
book because it was obviously wrong;
it didn't obey Newton's laws;
and stopped the publication
of a best-seller.
Specialism and an instinctive
desire for celestial law and order
rendered them blind to the forensic mythohistorical
evidence Velikovsky had drawn together
to understand the creation
stories globally,
referred to almost unimaginably spectacular
and terrifying behavior of the planets.
Velikovsky claimed it was the origin
of our instinctive doomsday fear.
Creation originally referred to the
phases of the celestial spectacle
and not to the universe.
That makes sense.
Modern cosmologists bit off
more than they could chew
and they suppose they had to compete
with a universal creation story
that doesn't make sense.
So what does Venus got to do
with the water in Saturn's rings
and satellites being found
like that on Earth?
The answer lies in the inspiration generated
among a remarkable group of scholars
by Velikovsky's well-documented thesis that
early humanity witnessed Venus's birth
and early appearance as
the archetypal comet.
He wrote,
"In former times the planets played a decidedly
more important role in the imagination of peoples,
to which fact their
religions give testimony.
True, Sun and Moon were also
numbered among the planet gods,
but usually they were not
the most important ones.
Their enumeration among the seven planets
sometimes startles the modern scholar
because these two luminaries are so much
more conspicuous than the other planets.
The dominance of Saturn, Jupiter, Venus and
Mars must startle us even more as long
as we do not know what was displayed on the
celestial scene a few thousand years ago.
The mythologies of all peoples concern
themselves with the birth only of Venus,
not with that of
Jupiter, Mars or Saturn.
Venus experienced in quick succession its
birth and expulsion under violent conditions;
an existence as a comet on an ellipse
which approached the Sun closely;
two encounters with the Earth accompanied by
discharges of potentials between these two bodies
[that is, thunderbolts of
the planetary gods]...
Of course, as a pioneer,
Velikovsky made errors,
chief among them was his placement of
planetary chaos within historical times.
The events he describes were memories
at the times the pyramids were built
as evidenced by the
Pyramid Texts.
The plasma forms seen in the sky were chiseled
into rock in the form of petroglyphs.
It seems reasonable to suggest that
echoes of the prehistoric catastrophes
reverberated down
into historical times
and catalyzed descriptions in terms
of the remembered doomsday events.
As to the first cause of
havoc in the solar system,
Velikovsky made this
astounding intuitive leap.
"Some dark star, like Jupiter or
Saturn, may be in the path of the Sun
and may be attracted to the
system and cause havoc in it."
But of course
astronomers were right.
This mytho-historical
reconstruction was unique
and could not be explained
by the physics then or now.
With no experience of the events
of the myth-making epoch,
the questions never occurred.
It has taken lifelong dedication
by a number of scholars
with the courage to
pursue Velikovsky's leads
in the face of indifference
and hostility,
to understand his errors and to produce a
surprisingly detailed sequence of events
that demanded scientific
explanations.
It resulted in a truly interdisciplinary
Electric Universe cosmology
with profound scientific and cultural
significance for our future.
As evidence, in June 2004, just prior to
the Cassini spacecraft arriving at Saturn,
I published 'Cassini's
Homecoming'
which was to show again the
explanatory and predictive power
of this multidisciplinary
cosmology.
I wrote,
"...a scenario follows that is so alien to
any conventional theory of Saturn's history
that it should be easily tested against
information gained from the Cassini mission.
It shows striking connections between many
seemingly unrelated facts about certain planets."
It's an epic story
and it involves us.
In our next episode, Thornhill will outline
the successful predictions he offered in 2004
prior to the Cassini-Huygens
mission to Saturn.
Predictions based in part on the
mytho-historical reconstruction
which has revealed the
incredible yet forgotten role
that Saturn played in the
myth-making epoch in prehistory.

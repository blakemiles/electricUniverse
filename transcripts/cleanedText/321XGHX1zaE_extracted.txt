Introduction to Velikovsky's Ideas
Irving Wolfe
OK, are we set up, can you all hear me?
I'm getting an echo.
I have no slides, no equations,
no pictures, nothing.
All I have is my charming personality,
so I hope that will do.
I'm going to introduce you
to Velikovsky, but much more than that
I'm going to tell you why he's important
in terms of knowing what goes on in the
world and how you understand science.
So, first of all I have to explain that
there is a gradation in his ideas that
most people don't seem to understand.
I look at it in terms of primary, secondary
and tertiary, and Velikovsky's ideas can
be grouped into his primary theories,
which I think are extraordinarily
important, his secondary ideas where he
tries to fill it in and his tertiary
ideas where he tries to answer the
questions that he has himself raised.
I don't know how many people agree with
his answers, I don't even know if I
myself agree with all of his answers but,
what's most important are the questions
he raised, so here's the background.
Velikovsky wrote his most important book
'Worlds in Collision' during the 1940s; he
did his best to sell it to a publisher
between 1946 and 1950.
By 1950, Macmillan, one of the
largest publishers in America,
had agreed to publish the book.
That's when certain mistakes occurred
and that's when all hell broke loose.
Because a science writer called Eric
Larabee, who was very well-meaning and
admired Velikovsky, agreed to do a
condensation of Velikovsky's theories
for the magazine Harper's,
which every intelligent
person in America read.
And he did it and it was fairly
faithful except that it didn't contain
any of Velikovsky's evidence.
It merely gave his conclusions and it
appeared in Harper's at least four
months before the book was published.
But overnight, it became a sensation.
Now, a sensation in a negative sense.
If you look at what's going on now with a
Large Hadron Collider and CERN in Europe.
They were looking for what
they call the Higgs particle.
Now, some idiot newspapermen dubbed it
'the God particle'.
If I were an astronomer, I would
have been seriously embarrassed
by anyone calling the Higgs boson
the God particle.
It turns out that they may
or may not have discovered it. It turns
out that there may be five different
Higgs particles, but since they spent
billions of dollars on this enormous
Collider, they wanted to show that they
got something for their money and of
course what they want is for governments
to give them another ten, fifteen billion
dollars to build an even bigger Collider
and so they had to argue that they had
found 'the God particle' which is nonsense.
Now, the Larabee article in Harper's,
unfortunately picked up on one of
Velikovsky's theories which is how he
explains the story of Joshua in the
Bible where Joshua put up his arms and
the “Sun Stood Still.”
Now, we know that this isn't what
happened because the Sun
does not move, the Earth moves around the
Sun and therefore if something like that
was perceived, it had to have been a
retardation of the Earth's spinning on
its axis or a tilt of
the axis that made it look like the Sun
was not moving, but the Sun never moves.
However, people picked up on this phrase
'the day the Sun Stood Still' and the next
day it was a sensation across America.
Here is a scientist who can explain the
miracles in the Bible scientifically and
he explained how the Sun stood still.
So this was picked up all over the country
and it was picked up by mainstream big
science in America and it was picked up
in particular by an astronomer called
Harlow Shapley and the whole Velikovsky
story for the first 10 years is really a
battle between Velikovsky and Shapley.
Shapley was the head of the department
of astronomy at Harvard, he was also in
charge of the Harvard College
Observatory, he was the Dean of American
astronomers and he went ballistic when
he read about this.
Now normally, if someone comes up
with a, what you call a
crackpot theory that the world was
populated by little green men, most of
mainstream science will just ignore it.
But in this case, mainstream science
attacked Velikovsky with all guns firing
before the book had even been published.
Shapley organized a whole campaign, he
had his disciples who were also members
of the Harvard astronomical community,
he had them write articles, they
photocopied the articles and sent them
out all across the country, they asked
individuals in different departments,
"write letters attacking Velikovsky", they
tried to block the publication of the
book by Macmillan, and this went on
months before the book was published.
At the very last moment, the publisher of
Mac..., this is the Velikovsky affair, you
have to understand
that there was a Velikovsky affair.
It's very important that you understand why
it happened and what it means in the
long term for how you view modern science.
There was an enormous campaign
of name-calling, Velikovsky was called a
crank, he was called a crackpot, he was
called a pseudo scientist, he was called
a fraud, and mainly this was all carried
out by Harlow Shapley himself who
protested that he never did anything, he
never wrote letters to anybody but all
those letters are extant, and they tried to
block the publication of 'worlds in
Collision' as if it's some kind of poison.
And you cannot allow it to infect
people's minds.
Well, at the very last second,
the publisher at Macmillan had to
call in four more scientists to read
Velikovsky's book, to decide if it should
be published, they all agreed that it
should, the book was published, it became
an instantaneous bestseller and this was
the man who could prove why the Sun
Stood Still, a very unfortunate
bit of history.
Now within about six months,
Macmillan was blackmailed literally by
professors all over America who said, "if
you continue to publish Velikovsky, we
we will not order your textbooks at
our universities" and you have to
understand, if you have a very large
university, like Ohio State and you have
a couple of thousand kids in first year
and they're all taking astronomy and
they're all going to order Macmillan texts,
this involved a lot of money.
So Macmillan unwillingly had to give up the
book when it was number one on the New
York Times bestseller list.
And they transferred it to Doubleday
which did not have a textbook division.
Doubleday was quite happy to take it
over, they made a lot of money, it
continued to sell and this is a story
that everyone knows about because it was written
in all the newspapers, everybody said
"guess what's happening", it was a big
scandal, if you google Harlow Shapley,
they say quite openly that he led the
campaign against Velikovsky.
Now, you have to understand why
Shapley personally was
at war with Velikovsky.
Harlow Shapley became a major
astronomer at Harvard in
the early ‘20s but he had a very unhappy
career because at the same time
alongside him was Edwin Hubble.
And Hubble turned out to be a far more
important astronomer than Shapley and
the big battle between them, and it was a
vicious battle, was about the size of the universe.
Shapley wanted to keep
everything neat and clean.
What I mean by that is,
he wanted to describe the solar
system as the entire universe.
And he called it
'an island universe' and when
somebody said "what about all these dim
spots and so on," he said "these are merely
gas and so on, they're not important"
whereas Hubble said "no, these things are
individual galaxies on their own, they're
way outside the solar system and the
universe is much larger than Shapley
would allow" and Shapley and Hubble
fought it out and Hubble eventually
won and Shapley grudgingly had to
concede that Hubble was right, although
he never liked it and he called Hubble's
work “junk science” and so on, but that was
a tremendous disappointment
in Shapley's life.
Now also, he had been a bit of a
left-leaning communist before the war.
He had wanted America and Russia, which had
just become communist a decade or two
before, to be friends. He wanted everyone
to be friends and this reminds me of
when I was a little boy and I went out
on the street to play, remember those
were the days when
you could actually walk out and have
friends on the street.
Now you have to have your father
arrange a playdate, he
has to drive you 20 minutes away
and he has to organize it three weeks in
advance so you have a
playdate with your friend.
In those days, you just went out
on the street and you played.
Now, my mother used to tell me,
"make nice-nice", in
other words, get along with the people,
make nice-nice you see?
And Shapley wanted America
and the Russians, and so on,
to make nice-nice, but it didn't work
out and at the end of the war, another
war started between America and Russia
and this left him very unhappy.
Now, he also thought that America had the
atomic bomb in 1945 or 46 and no one
else had it so America became like the
public school principal.
When little boys are fighting
in the schoolyard at recess,
the principal goes out and says "now stop,"
and they have to stop because he has the
authority and America had the bomb and
they were like the school principal that
had the authority, but by 1948 or 49 the
Russians had acquired the atomic bomb so
that didn't work out for Shapley, he was
very disappointed but Shapley had one, I
don't know if it was a secret, one secret
obsession, one cherished idea and I found
out about this because I went to McGill
library in Montreal and I checked
through four successive editions of the
first year primer on astronomy that was
sold to Harvard students in astronomy 101.
And it went from the 30s, 40s into
the 50s, it was approved by Harlow
Shapley and there is a section there on
the solar system in which he argued that
the solar system is the most precise
organization of units in
the world, in the universe, and that
everything happens with absolute
precision down to almost
a portion of a second.
So the one place in the universe
that Shapley could cherish, because
everything else was going to hell.
On Earth there had been the Second World
War, there had been the rise of fascism,
there had been atomic bombs, anger
between different countries, he could not
bring order on the world, he probably
could not bring order in the distant
areas of the universe because there were
galaxies and I don't know if he knew, as
early as 1950, that when galaxies collide
or when super galaxies collide, it is the
largest form of violence in the universe,
but at least he could say it maybe all
hell down here and it may be all hell
way up there but in between there is
this marvelous system of absolute
unchanging serenity, it's been that way
for 3 and 1/2 billion years, it will
presumably continue for another
three-and-a-half billion years and this
is the solar system.
And Velikovsky comes along and says
"no no no no no, the solar
system is violent, it has experienced
major disruptions up until even - 1500
and - 700 which is 3,500 years ago" and
so Shapley was being attacked in the
last bastion of order that he could
believe in and this was too much and he
went into battle with all guns blazing.
So you must see this as a war....
Is it down, oh here we are, very modern
equipment I don't know how to handle
this I'm very old-fashioned, OK.
...a war between him and Velikovsky, because
it was all or nothing, he had to destroy
Velikovsky or he would be destroyed.
He had to go, it was a battle to the death
and so Shapley tried his best to destroy Velikovsky.
Now, if this had been 400
years earlier, Velikovsky physically
may have been destroyed.
Giordano Bruno, who was a major Medieval and
Renaissance thinker, disagreed with the
church about how many worlds there are
and so on. He was given time to
reconsider and see if he will recant,
meaning take back what he said; he didn't,
so the church condemned him to death.
And in the year 1600, you think of this as a
modern age but there they were on the
plaza in Rome in front of everybody,
he was burned to death, and you have to
understand what that means, they tie you
to a pillar and your feet are on fire
while you're still conscious and
it's a horrible long slow agonizing death.
Now, they couldn't do this to
Velikovsky in the year 1950 but they
could try and destroy his books just
like the Nazis burned books in the 1930s
and they could try and
destroy his reputation.
And so, the mudslinging and the
name-calling and everything else
that went on has clung to Velikovsky.
He should have become a major figure in
20th century thought, he should be one of
the names we think about.
He hasn't because of the Velikovsky affair.
Now, I want to say that I think Velikovsky is
one of the major intellectual figures of
the 20th century, someone you ought to
know about, he is what I would call a
revolutionary or a game-changer. You can think of the
phrase “Watershed,” meaning nothing was before
 as it was after. You think of certain individuals
like Pablo Picasso in painting
because of Picasso, painting was never the
same after him. You think of Einstein and
his theories, nothing was
the same after Einstein.
A friend of mine, a late friend
of mine who was a Olympic figure skater,
most of you have probably never heard of
him, his name was, my mind is gone blank,
Taller Cranston, he was Canadian Olympic
figure skating champion in the ‘70s and
an Olympic medal winner, he
transformed figure skating.
Up until then, figure skating had
merely been gymnastics on ice,
the skaters wore uniforms that
looked like military uniforms, they even,
some of them wore ties and they performed
exercises like a gymnastic competition.
When Taller came on, he was a wild crazy
man, he was flamboyant and he transformed
figure skating and made it into ballet on ice
and figure skating has never been the
same since then.
Velikovsky was that or
should have been that sort of person, but
the dirt that was flung at him because
of the Velikovsky affair clung to him
for many years.
Now, in terms of primary, secondary and
tertiary, I think it would have been much
better if Velikovsky had published a
much smaller and more innocent-looking
book called
'Earth in Upheaval.'
I would have preferred if I had been
there at that time to tell
him to publish 'Earth in Upheaval' which
some of you should read, it's a very easy
book, anyone who is intelligent and
open-minded, if you read it you would
probably have to agree
after hundreds of pages of evidence that
certain very huge cataclysmic things
happened to the Earth within the last
4,000 years.
And if he had put that book out saying,
look here's my evidence, it
looks like this is what it implies, what do
you think about it?
That would have been a better way
to handle it, particularly
because the last chapter of the book
talks about cataclysmic evolution where
he destroys Darwin.
Now, Darwin needed destroying,
I will point out that in a moment,
but if he had..., see, Velikovsky was a
trained psychologist, he had studied
under Wilhelm Stoeckl who was a pupil of
Freud, I think he actually knew Freud
himself, he worked for about 15 years as
a psychoanalyst before he came to
America and Velikovsky should have known
as much as anybody, that the difficulty
when you're trying to cure a patient is
not in finding out the cause of his
problems but in how you reveal
it to the patient.
Because if you don't do it right,
the patient is gonna be very angry and
will fight you and you will get nowhere.
He should have known this but what he
did is the opposite, he wrote 'Worlds in
Collision' where all his guns are set
forth; he didn't hold back the theory
about Venus which I would have preferred
him to do; he completely disobeyed all the
rules of how you communicate cure to a
patient and instead he published 'Worlds
in Collision' which was a direct slap in
the face to all of American big science.
I don't know if you're allowed to use
what I call foul language.
I checked with Dave,
maybe what I'm about to say he won't
invite me back again but, what Velikovsky
did by laying out 'Worlds in Collision'
foolhardy, a direct blow in the face of the
science, he told mainstream science
"you're full of shit" and he
made it quite plain.
Cheers, cheers, cheers!
I guess I'm okay, all right!
And so the war erupted because big
science had to either destroy him or he
would destroy them!
Now you have to ask yourself,
did he have a right to do this,
and I say yes, he did,
because Newton and Darwin needed destroying.
Now, imagine I'm a man
from Mars and I've just arrived on Earth
and I meet an earthling and I say okay,
show me your culture, what are the
important things?
So the earthling would say,
"we are Western culture and we
produce science; all the other cultures,
Islamic culture, Hindu culture and so on
they deal with mythology and gods and
stories and fairy tales, we tell it like it is."
And so I would ask this earthling
"who are your icons," and he would say
"Newton and Darwin", every schoolchild in
1950 would have said "we believe explicitly
in Newton and Darwin."
So I'm going to prove to you
that there was no reason for that.
in Newton and Darwin."
So I'm going to prove to you
that there was no reason for that.
Aristotle proposed a cosmology
and the Western world, which is supposed
to be rational, believed in and bought
Aristotle's cosmology for 2,000 years.
Now I, as the cynical man from
Mars would say to my earthling companion,
"let's look at what Aristotle was selling,
why did they buy it for 2,000 years?"
Because I would say, Aristotle was in
effect a religion, it was a secular
religion but it was a religion because
if you look at religion from a
utilitarian point of view, which I do,
what does religion offer?
Three things; it tells you how
the world works, it tells
you that the guy in charge is benevolent
and it tells you how you can connect to
the guy in charge meaning, you have friends in
high places, this is very comforting, you see?
Newman, Paul Newman made a film
in 1959 I think, it was called 'somebody
up there likes me,' you see, and there is a
famous Christian myth, 'what a friend we
have in Jesus.'
Well, what Aristotle was selling is,
what a friend we have in the prime mover
because Aristotle's cosmology was that
there were nested spheres and each one
was inside the other and they were all
moving at different rates and they
produced a beautiful music, this was the
music of the spheres, and it was all
governed by the prime mover who is
himself unmoved and the prime mover,
merely by the influence of his goodness,
makes the spheres revolve and the basic
message, you'll hear about this later on,
but the basic message that Aristotle was
selling was "don't worry," meaning there
may be horrible things happening on
Earth, giant earthquakes, tornadoes,
hurricanes, tsunamis, huge floods, drought,
pestilence, disease that kills off people,
it may look like the Earth is a very
dangerous place but the underlying
message is, don't worry!
Because there is this eternal stability
kept in motion by the prime mover and
the prime mover likes you.
So that's what Aristotle sold
and people bought it for
2,000 years approximately.
Now, around the year 1600, a
lot of discordant data began
to appear, troublemakers like Copernicus
and Tycho Brahe and others began to
show that, and Galileo, that the picture of
the universe that Aristotle
painted wasn't quite true and what
happened then was a process that Thomas
Kuhn in 1962 described in The Structure
of Scientific Revolutions.
What he said was, when an
old paradigm, the paradigm is
the overriding belief, is called into
question because there's a lot of data
that it can't account for, then a new
paradigm will be offered that does a better job.
And so what happened is that
Newton came along and said look, there's
this thing called gravity!
Now gravity begins with G,
God begins with G, they
simply replaced God with gravity and
Newton's theory became the accepted
belief of how the world works, Newton was
a deist meaning he believed that God had
created the universe and ordained the
natural laws and he had built the world
like a clockwork and that this clock
ran perfectly and the underlying message
there is the same as Aristotle; what was
Newton selling? The message is, don't worry.
Don't worry because, God who is
benevolent did not design the world so
it will destroy you, he designed the
world so it will keep running like a
perfect clock.
Now there are two different kinds of
deists, one group
believes that God
built the universe and then goes off to
play golf and allows the universe to
take care of itself, and the other is
more like Newton who says that every
once in a while God has to intervene and
tweak the world a little bit and get it
back online which implies that he may
not be a perfect clock maker but that's
the way it turned out.
Now Newton, in my opinion, is
simply Aristotle with numbers.
In other words, he fed people the same
fairy tale and the fairy tale is "don't
worry, the guy up there likes you and the
world will run perfectly forever."
So, Velikovsky had a right
to destroy Newton.
Now as for Darwin, the second pillar, the
second incorruptible everlasting pillar
of Western science, I think Darwin is on
far shakier ground, because what Darwin
said is, "new species are formed but it
takes about two million years" and
therefore he asks you to take it on
faith that a species acquires a slight
change and another change and another
change and over two million years it
becomes a different species which cannot
mate with the other species and
therefore it is a new species and that's
how speciation occurs.
But since none of us, or since
Darwin could not supply a
CCTV camera that covered an organism for
two million years to show how it became
a new organism, you have to take it on faith.
So Darwin; I can't, I don't
understand why anybody believed in
Darwin but the background to that which
you must understand and I'll explain it
now, is the battle between two concepts,
uniformitarianism and catastrophism.
Now, uniformitarianism, to put it very short,
says "nothing ever happened in the past
which is not seen to happen
today," the present is the key to the past.
And so, the essence of uniformitarianism
is called gradualism, everything is
gradual, just like my mummy said to me,
make it nice nice, everything happens in
a nice way.
Catastrophism, I don't know what the
antonym is, I suppose it's suddenism
which is the opposite of gradualism, I
don't know, but catastrophism says, things
happen abruptly and they happen
violently and these are two different
ways of looking at the world and the
Western world was obsessed with
uniformitarianism, not because it had
better proof but because it was comforting.
And so, these two beliefs,
Newton and Darwin were uniformitarianists,
everything happened slowly and gradually
and there's no violence.
Now I'm going to try and prove
to you why we should not believe in it.
The idea is this, I, as the
cynical man from Mars, I look at my
friend, my dear earthling, and I say to
him "can you not see that both of these
ideas did not come out of a vacuum, they
are not scientific in the sense of being
objective, they are products
of British culture!"
Have you ever thought of that?
They come out of the same culture.
Now, what does that mean?
Well, I'll tell you.
Barack Obama, one of the nicknames,
he was called 'no drama Obama,' you understand?
He didn't like drama and the British don't
like drama and one of the ways they
identify it is, they
are not crazy about sex.
There was a musical that appeared in
London which was called, ‘no sex please,
we're British!’
And it even played on Broadway for a
short while but it was a truism.
Now, if you conflate these two, it's 'no drama
please, we're British.'
In other words, the British like
everything to be orderly and regular,
regular means no catastrophes
and slow and peaceful.
Now I'm going to give you
scientific proof why this is not so.
Are any of you familiar
with the game of cricket?
This is sort of, form like baseball
but real cricket, original cricket, we
spent some time in England a few months
ago and we stayed for a while at the
house of one of our friends who lives in
a small village and to get to their
house we had to go past a certain
cricket field owned by the local Lord
who owned most of the buildings in the
area anyway and this was a real
old-fashioned cricket field.
Now the cricket field is green grass and all the
players wear white, in other words when a
young man says "I'm putting on my whites"
it means he's going to play cricket.
So all the young men wear white trousers
and white shirts; why, because that's the
way God wants it and they play cricket
in a certain way because that's the way
God wants it, even the umpire wears a
long white coat, like a lab coat and if
the Sun is shining and you have to
believe that sometimes the Sun does
shine in England, he wears a white hat.
So everybody is dressed in white against
the green and they play cricket in a
very gentlemanly way.
If you had gone in the year 1950
and watched a soccer game,
we call it soccer, the English call it
football, of course that's what it is,
because our football is played with
hands, you carry the ball with your hands,
you pass the ball with your hands, you
catch the ball with your hands, in
England they play soccer with their feet
and so then in England they call it football.
But if you were to go to watch
a game between working-class or
lower-class teams, I shouldn't use
that pejorative adjective, you would
hear all the people in the stands
drinking,
you would hear thirty thousand voices
singing together the songs that identify
the team and they would be yelling
things like "break his legs, break his
arms, kill a bastard," you see.
But if you went to a cricket match and somebody hit
the ball properly, you would get that.
If he really hit the ball well, you would
have, you see, that that is rabid
passionate support for cricket.
And what else, do you think,
happens in cricket?
At four o'clock they stop playing.
Do you know why?
They stop for tea!
Now here's how it works, the ladies don't play,
I mean, there are some women who play
cricket but God doesn't really want
women to play cricket so, the ladies watch.
Now there they are sitting there
in their dresses, summertime dresses,
which they call frocks and they're
wearing their hats which they call
bonnets, you have to remember, England and
America are two countries separated by a
common language, and they watch the match
and they applaud because a gentleman or
a gentlelady does not, you know, you have
to understand that the English decided
that they were the superior culture in
Europe, meaning in the world, because this
was Eurocentrism and it can't be the
Germans because all they do is want to
make war and slice each other with
sabers, it can't be the Italians because
they just sing opera and they kill each
other in vendettas, it can't be the
French because the French kiss their
girlfriends in the street, no Englishman
would ever do that, so it must be the
English who are the preferred nation of
God and the English are gentlemen,
everything is proper.
Now the ladies come out and they bring out food
but I have to describe the food.
Do any of you know what a cucumber sandwich is?
Now the two pieces of bread are thick,
the cucumber is sliced horizontally very
thin, if you held it up to the light you
could see through it and so you have
this little bit of cucumber between two
pieces of bread, you couldn't feed a
mosquito on a cucumber sandwich.
It's not really food but they bring out cucumber
sandwiches and that's what the players eat.
Now it goes further than that, they
serve tea, the tea is served in a tea
service which is either pure silver or
silver plate, and the players get their
tea in what, in bone china cups.
Bone china is so thin you can
almost see through it.
It's not like a beer mug, it's not
like some heavy piece of glass,
 it's bone china.
Now, how do they hold the cup?
Between the thumb and the forefinger
with your pinky up in the air and I ask
this, as some of my students in Montreal
are French Canadian, I say "how do the
British cricket players drink their tea?"
and they all did this because God wants
you to hold the cup daintily between
your thumb and forefinger and put your
pinky up in the air and that's the way
that God wants you to drink tea.
You have to understand so can you imagine an
American college football game played on
natural grass?
You remember, there used to be fields
with natural grass and it's
raining and it could be snowing in the
Northeast and there's mud on the field
and after five minutes all the players
are covered in mud, you can't even see
their numbers, the mud has gotten through
their face guard and they're all looking
like they're dressed for Halloween and
they're all covered in mud.
Can you imagine the ref blowing his whistle at
four o'clock and all these players stop for tea?
Can you imagine some defensive lineman
who's 6 foot 5 and 340 pounds and
covered in mud whose hands are as big as
a catcher's mitt,
taking his gloves off and picking up a
little cup of tea and taking a sip with
his finger up in the air?
Obviously, so the English know how
God wants it to be done.
A gentleman does things in
moderation and he does things in a
certain prescribed order.
So I, as the cynical Martian,
talked to my earthling
friend and I say, can you not see my good
fellow, that Aristotle and Darwin are
merely different forms of religion and
that they fulfil the function that
religion fulfills?
What I'm saying is that Newton
and Darwin deserved to be destroyed.
Now because I'm an English professor, I
can have the liberty of saying things
that I couldn't get away with if I were
a physicist, so there is my friend Wal
who has to protect his professional
integrity, I don't know if he would go so
far as to say that Darwin, sorry, gravity
does not exist.
I would because I have a
get-out-of-jail-free card.
Anybody says to me "why do you say that" I
say well, I don't know I'm just an
English professor.
I'm just, I'm just a humble
English professor, how would I
know, you see?
So I can go further but I would say
that in my opinion, in my
humble opinion, gravity doesn't exist.
There's no, you can't, it's not a force,
Einstein said it's not a force, you
cannot take a meter and stick it in the
way and measure the force and get a
reading, how does gravity propagate?
It's supposed to be gravitons, but nobody has
ever proved they exist, nobody's seen
them, are
gravitons merely a different form of
saying there's an ether because the
gravity has to move somewhere, there's no
gravitons, as for gravitational waves, the
speaker yesterday showed us that the
LIGO experiments, which said it had
detected gravitational waves, is nonsense,
they had fiddled with the numbers and
it's really a fraud.
So in effect, gravity is unprovable and I
would go so far as to say that it may
turn out to be wrong.
Therefore, if you imagine that
I am now a speaker on the
program 'the nightly Business Review' it's
some of you may watch on PBS.
They bring up people who are experts in the market
and they advise you which stocks to bet on.
Well, I would say to you, sell
gravity short; I would say, sell Darwin
completely short; because he's dead and
if you're gonna buy stocks, invest in
Lamarck, I haven't explained to you who
he is, but Lamarck was supposed to be
dead and he's coming back to life;
invest in Robert Shapiro and so on
because if you Google, as I did the other
day, 'criticisms of Darwin' they listed, to
start off, 76 names and I counted them
and most of them are prominent major
biologists, all of whom disagree partly
or completely with Darwin, and then at
the end they throw in, there's hundreds more.
So I think Darwin is completely
dead, he makes no sense whatever and I
think Velikovsky was perfectly within
his rights to deny Darwin and to deny
the theory of gravity.
Wal can tell you later if he is
really going to go on a limb
that far but of course he's a physicist
and I'm not, so I can go further out on a
limb than he can perhaps.
But my feeling is that,
I like Wal and I've known him
for a long time and I respect him, so I
go with people I like and if Wal says
gravity
ain't what it's supposed to be, I
believe that because I have what they call,
a smeller, the smeller means I can smell
crap, there's another word, you see.
I'll use it, a friend of mine in
Scotland calls it crap and I will say crap.
I remember when I was an
undergraduate and one of my friends said
look, they've discovered that the first
two forces are actually the same and I
laughed and I said well, of course they are.
Nature is not extravagant, and I said
they will probably find that the third
force is also the same and lo and behold,
ten or fifteen years later, they
discovered that they are all the same.
It didn't smell right to me that they
should be different.
Now when I stand on
a huge boulder in the middle of a forest,
as we did, and somebody tells me this
Boulder is sending out forces of gravity
which are mediated through gravitons
that doesn't smell right to me and I
follow my smeller, that's my standard of..
Now if I have to prove to you that
Britain is a country that wants
gradualism and quiet and order, I would
give you three scientific proofs.
These involve the theory which you may not
like, that British women are not sexually
arousable very quickly and that gives you
an idea of the character of the British.
So my first 'scientific proof' is this,
a Frenchman is in bed with an English
woman and suddenly he stops and he says
to her, Cherie, did I hurt you, and she
says hurt me, not at all, why do you ask?
Because, he answers, you moved!
Next 'scientific proof.'
After good sex, the Russian woman
says to her partner, you
are my god, my czar, the French woman
equally aroused says Cherie je t'aime, je t'adore,
the English woman says to her
partner, feeling better?
Now here is my
culminating 'scientific proof!'
Alfonse and Gaston are two French
fishermen coming down early in the
morning on the beach to go and get their
boat, then suddenly they see a body on
the sand and they come running up and
it's a woman and she looks dead.
So Gaston says to Alphonse, you stay with
the body, he will go and get the police
and bring them back.
When they come back on the beach,
they see that Alphonse is
on top of the woman trying
to have sex with her.
Now the French policeman runs up and
says, "Monsieur, Monsieur what are you
doing, can you not see this woman she is dead?
Dead, says Alphonse, sacre bleu!
I just thought she was English!
So now that I have proved to you 'scientifically'
beyond a shadow of a doubt what the
British culture is like, you will
understand why the British culture has
produced these theories and why I am
very suspicious because the apple does
not fall far from the tree.
The plant must reflect the soil
out of which it grows.
So Velikovsky was right in
attacking these two icons, they were, they
had feet of clay and it should have
happened 70 years ago, it didn't.
Maybe it's going to start happening now because I
see one of my purposes here is to repay
my debt to the old man.
I called him 'the old man' although
now I'm closer to his
ages than when I first met him, but I have to
repay my debt to him because I think
he's a very great man, I am honored and
respected
to have known him and worked with him, I
believe in what he says and I think it's
time that he had a fair hearing and I
think that people should start with
'Earth in Upheaval' which is a more
moderate self-restrained book.
People should read it and look into it and what
we really need is what I need and Bill
and everybody else, is three smart young
assistants who will do the work, go back
to the Velikovsky books, show how he's
been right and show how he deserves to
say the things he does, he had a right
to attack Darwin and he had a right to
attack Newton because they had, their
theories were weak and nonsensical.
Now, the dirt that has been flung on
Velikovsky still adheres to his name.
People take the time to attack
Velikovsky to establish their own
credentials among their colleagues and
it goes so far as, when was Shermer here?
In twenty fourteen or fifteen?
2015, OK, well that's just two years ago.
Shermer is a skeptic.
Now the point is that he calls himself a sniffer out of
pseudoscience but there is no way of
defining pseudoscience, you cannot take a
degree in pseudoscience, you cannot
become a specialist in pseudoscience, you
have to appoint yourself as a sniffer
out of pseudoscience, so people like
Shermer are self-appointed vigilantes
and they work on behalf of big science.
Now Shermer's report, I believe, was
published in Scientific American and we
all know that everything in Scientific
American must be true, that God stands
behind the Scientific American, so it
must be right.
And Shermer was here for half a day
and wrote a report, not because the
electric universe people are directly
Velikovskian but Velikovsky is behind
them because everybody here today who is
involved in this
owes a debt to Velikovsky whether it's
one, two, or three degrees of separation,
they all belong here, I mean they all are
connected because of the Old Man.
And so, Shermer's report, I just want to
read it because this is how it starts,
"Newton was wrong,
Einstein was wrong, black holes do not
exist, the Big Bang never happened,
dark energy and dark matter are
unsubstantiated conjectures, stars are
electrically charged plasma" and so on.
Now he's giving you this as a series of
beliefs that the EU offers, and of course
the whole point of it is, he's asking you
to laugh at them because everybody knows
that Newton was not wrong, and Einstein
was not wrong,
and black holes do exist and so on, but
if you paid attention to the second
speaker on Thursday night, I can't
remember his name at the moment (Jim Ryder) but he
was a physicist, he showed us that all of
the things that physicists believe in, as
part of the standard model,
they have never managed to find.
Now, maybe we can perform a short thought
experiment, Einstein loved them and I'm
going to do two with you now.
The first one will take us back 400 years, the next
one will take us ahead 200 years.
Imagine that 400 years ago there was a
conference in, let us say Rome, where a
group of rebels, iconoclasts, heretics,
just like the EU today, were assembling
to talk about Copernicus and so on and
the church did not like this, because
they believed in Aristotle so they sent
someone like Shermer, a pre-incarnation
of Shermer to go to Rome and report, he
would have said the same thing.
He would have said by starting in a
sneering way, the concentric circles do
not exist, the music of the spheres did
not exist, the prime mover does not exist,
and we are expected to laugh and say
well, we know they do exist, and it would
have been the same thing, so what Shermer
did was quite disgraceful.
He did not behave like a scientist, he did not look
at the ideas and say look at, this is
what people say, let's take a look at it,
I think they might be right or wrong in
the following ways; all he did is sneer
and laugh and put people down.
In fact, one of the people I forget who, he called
him a self-taught mathematician meaning
of course, he can't be right because he
wasn't trained at a university.
So I think, Shermer's reaction and his report
was disgraceful but typical of the
attacks on Velikovsky and because
they happened 60 years later, you can see
that the stigma is still attached to Velikovsky.
Now, another thought
experiment, 200 years years in the future.
We go to Cambridge through department of
the history of science, I spent a whole
semantical year there, I had convinced
my university that I had important
things to do on Shakespeare and I had to
be at Cambridge, but I went every day to
the Department of the history and
philosophy of science, I went there like
a mole, I didn't tell them who I was, I
went there like a spy to see what they
were doing and what they were thinking
and I met a number of young, bright young
people who were there to get a PhD from
Cambridge and I invited them out
individually for coffee and we talked
and so on and imagine that one of them
200 years from now, is being asked to
write a thesis on the state of physics
at the end of the 20th and beginning of
the 21st centuries.
Well he would do just what Shermer
did, only he would say black
holes and so on and he would list all
the idiotic things that physics believed
in in the year 2100 and how wrong
they were and how a new form of physics
has now appeared.
So you have to place Velikovsky
in that background.
Now very quickly because I don't know how much
time I have, I told Dave this morning
that I want the whole morning, 3 hours, he
says, you're not getting it!
But, how Velikovsky has impinged on me?
I began to see that the great works of art
carry a subconscious, unconscious story
and if you know how to decode it, if
you're familiar with Velikovsky you can
see what's going on.
So I wrote an article about Shakespeare's play 'Antony
and Cleopatra,' where I showed that the
action in the abstract can really be a
retelling of the Velikovsky story and I
developed a theory that in the great
works of art, we are allowed to revisit
the catastrophes in disguise
because we can never forget about them,
it's too horrible.
We revisit in disguise and we put in a happy ending so
that we can relax again but every once
in a while we have to go back and look
at the trauma again in code and then
give it a happy ending.
So I began to write articles about Shakespeare's plays,
I wrote articles about sport, about
politics, everything else, and this is
where Velikovsky left me, two
years ago in Toronto I presented two
papers, the first one was on baseball.
Now, I saw pictures of pharaohs, mainly
Tuthmose the third, and so on; photographs
taken of carvings on the walls where
Tuthmose is standing with a bat over
his sholder, how much time have I got Bill?
Five minutes, well it's five minutes
plus two hours but let's make it five minutes.
He's standing with a bat on his shoulder
and he says, I have driven off the evil
eye of Apophis.
Now what it means is this, they believed
that order, stability, orbit,
is carried on by the god Ra who travels in
a boat and when he completes the orbit,
the world is safe.
Now there is this villain who's called by different names
one of them is Apophis and he keeps
trying to destroy the path of the boat.
So the eye of Apophis is the force that
Apophis is sending to stop the boat of
Ra, and the Egyptian god knocks away
the eye to keep the boat safe on its journey.
Now you imagine a photograph of
Babe Ruth with a bat on his shoulder,
imagine W.G. Grace who was the major
British cricket batsman of the 19th
century, with a cricket bat on his
shoulder and then you have the drawings
that I showed with the Pharaoh and the
bat on the shoulder, you see that there
is a strong correlation between
Velikovsky and the game of baseball.
They don't know it, but I could see it because
I could decode baseball.
Now I also gave an article on the Nazi rallies in the
late 30s, the large stupendous rallies at
Nuremberg and I showed how, at one point,
the Nazis had gotten, they had a huge
stadium that held close to 400,000
people and they had surrounded it with
searchlights, they were anti-aircraft
searchlights but they brought them all
to the stadium, there was a hundred and
sixty of them, each one had a beam that
was five feet tall
and it went up about thirty thousand
feet, you can imagine that.
So when these beams, all the lights
were shut off, and these beams were lit,
then you had the whole stadium
surrounded by these pillars of light, but
then, they got all the beams to intersect
and where they intersected, there was an
enormous brilliant ball of light, up in
the sky about 20,000 feet and then the
beams came down.
Now, if you look at it from the opposite view, you have all
these lights flashing down, you have this
beam and then they all come crashing to
the ground and I look through this and I
said to myself, Hitler must have read
worlds in collision except it hasn't
come out but it was there,
you can imagine it.
Now, try and decode other things, let's take stock
car racing, I don't know if everybody
knows what it is.
Maybe the ladies aren't as interested as
the men, but if you have a stock car race,
there's a hell of a lot of violence, cars go
crashing into each other,
bouncing off, some of them burst into
flames, the driver is either injured or
not, there's a hell of a lot of wreckage
every once in a while, the race is
stopped, it goes under a yellow flag and
then it starts again and there's another
crash and there's yellow flag and so on.
But when the race is over, what happens?
The winning driver does a victory lap
and what he's showing is that the orbit
has been re-established peacefully again
and it's pure Velikovsky.
So if you train yourself as I have, to decode items of
popular culture, one can see that this is
where Velikovsky can lead you.
Let me give you one more example, one more.
About 25 years ago, this was a
conference and at the end we had a
dinner, just as we're going to have tomorrow
night here, and I was sitting at the
table with a number of people, I'm not
sure if Bill was there, and I mentioned
that I had heard that Velikovsky had
said that every 700 years a new major
world religion comes into being because
there's a fear about the end of the
world and if you develop a new religion,
God won't dump on you.
Now, aside from the fact that there
is a lot of debate about
the number of years and the absolute
dates, if we take every 700
as an interval without attaching
specific dates, you have at minus 1400 or
1450, you have Hebrew monotheism, at - 700
you have prophetic Judaism, at the Year
Zero you have Catholicism, at the Year
700, 750, you have Islam, at 1450, 1500, you
have Protestantism, and I remember
sitting at the table and saying where is
the next world religion, I don't see it,
I don't see any big religion.
Well 25 years later the thing has blown up right in
our faces.
It's Islamic extremism which is also
expecting the end of the world.
My time is up, OK, so Velikovsky is right on
that as well, what I'm trying to tell you
is if you take a long drink of
Velikovsky you will never be the same
again, OK?

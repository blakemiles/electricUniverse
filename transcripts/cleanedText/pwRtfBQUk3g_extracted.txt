Recent scientific reports highlight
increased scientific interest
in a long enduring
mystery on the Moon.
For well over half a century,
scientists on Earth have puzzled over the cause
of occasional mysterious flashes of light
seen on the lunar surface,
or what is called
Transient Lunar Phenomena.
Reports on the nature
of these light episodes
range from a temporary increase
in the brightness of a surface,
to an apparent reddening of a surface
with no accompanying brightness,
to other odd color changes
such as blue, green or violet,
and even an unaccounted
darkening of the lunar surface.
In fact, reports of these
mysterious light events on the Moon
date back at least
over 1,000 years.
But for several decades,
many astronomers were highly
skeptical of the phenomena's existence.
That is largely because the Moon has long
been believed to be long geologically dead
and no dramatic activity
should be seen today.
But in recent years, statistical analyses
have indicated that the phenomena
overwhelmingly
seem to be genuine.
Yet, there remains no consensus scientific
theory on the underlying mechanism.
To date, most astronomers
have believed
the phenomena either involves
meteoritic explosions or outgassing.
However, some mainstream
astronomers have also entertained
that the phenomenon is
electrical in nature.
As stated in a recent
Phys.org report,
"Such flashes could also occur when electrically
charged particles of the solar wind
react with moon dust."
Recently, a team of scientists from
the JMU University in Bavaria, Germany,
began operating a privately
built lunar telescope
to try to gain a better understanding
of Transient Lunar Phenomena.
The images the team obtains will be compared
with those of the European Space Agency
and may provide insights into the cause
of the mysterious lights and flashes.
From the Electric Universe perspective,
Transient Lunar Phenomena may be important
both in terms of the Moon and our solar
system's current electrical environment,
but also the stupendous electrical events
that may have shaped the Moon's surface.
Today, planetary
scientists do acknowledge
that dramatic electrostatic
events occur on the Moon,
even as the result of the Moon's
interaction with our own planet.
As noted by NASA
scientist Tim Stubbs,
"Earth's magnetotail extends well
beyond the orbit of the moon
and, once a month, the
moon orbits through it.
This can have consequences ranging from lunar
'dust storms' to electrostatic discharges."
In recent years, scientists have also entertained
that subsurface electrical sparking
in permanently shadowed regions may
cause the breakdown of lunar soil.
Nevertheless, the
outgassing hypothesis
remains the preferred explanation among
astronomers for Transient Lunar Phenomena.
But there are several important clues that
point to the phenomena's electrical nature.
If the light episodes are indeed
a form of electrical arcing,
then we expect to see them most
commonly in high points of terrain,
which electric arcs
are always drawn to.
In fact, many transient
lunar phenomena
are associated with the edges
of so called lunar maria
which planetary scientists believe
are the sites of ancient volcanism.
But an analog to the lunar phenomena may be
the bright plume seen flaring on comet nuclei,
which comet scientists also
routinely interpret as "outgassing".
Consider this close-up image of the
comet 67P, taken on July 3rd, 2016.
The plume appeared suddenly when the
comet was over 500 million km from the Sun,
a distance at which the sublimation
of water ice is not expected at all.
The lead author of a paper
on the phenomenon stated,
"We saw a bright plume of dust blowing
away from the surface like a fountain...
It lasted for roughly an hour, producing
around 18 kg of dust every second."
The team admitted they had no idea
what could have powered the plume.
The ESA website stated,
"Initially, scientists
thought that the plume
might have been surface ice
evaporating in the sunlight.
However, Rosetta's measurements showed there
had to be something more energetic going on
to fling that amount
of dust into space."
The Electric Universe
has always proposed
that comet activity is fundamentally
electrical discharge activity
caused as the comet moves through plasma
regions of varying electrical potential.
Again, it is not a coincidence
that the plumes seen in this image
appear to be focused at
the edge of a pit or crater
which we do expect if it's
a form of electrical arcing.
Another aspect of
Transient Lunar Phenomena
is the extraordinary events that
shaped the surface of the Moon itself.
For many decades, the Electric Universe has
proposed that the massive cratering on the Moon
was caused not by meteoritic
impacts over eons of time
but by high-energy
electrical discharge
in an epoch of planetary instability
in the inner solar system.
In fact, as far back
as the mid 1960s,
the amateur astronomer Brian J. Ford
performed plasma discharge experiments
which reproduced the rate of highly
circular crater formation seen on the Moon.
In the 1970s, the engineer Ralph
Juergens performed a rigorous analysis
which showed that
the lunar rills,
which consistently show no internal
debris from collapsed lava tubes,
which are improbably
wide at up to 7 km,
and which routinely become narrower
at their so-called outflow ends,
are not collapsed lava tubes as
standard theory has proposed for decades,
but they are the features
of electrical discharge.
The notion of the Moon as an
electrically scarred body was the basis
for an outrageous prediction offered by one
of the great heretics of the 20th century,
Dr. Immanuel Velikovsky.
Well before the
Apollo space missions,
Velikovsky predicted the discovery of
remanent magnetization of moon rocks,
a required lingering effect of
tremendous "lightning bolts" from space.
To the astonishment of planetary
scientists, the prediction was confirmed.
As stated in the 1971 paper, 'Determining the
origins of lunar remanent crustal magnetism,'
"The discovery of lunar magnetic
fields of crustal origin
was a major scientific surprise
of the Apollo program."
The electrical origins of
lunar geology enables us
to make predictions for the ongoing
study of lunar transient phenomena.
Since the Moon has no atmosphere, we
expect electrical discharges to be diffuse
with the glow seen
over large areas.
However, bright flashes will
typically occur at high points
due to a sudden concentration
of electrical discharge,
which we see on earth in
the form of St. Elmo's fire.
The pinched up rims of craters,
the craters' central peaks,
and any high points of terrain,
will be the consistent locations
of bright transient flashes.
The scarring events that formed these features
appear to make them ideal lightning rods
for much smaller scale
electrical activity today.
Like every other body
in the solar system,
the Moon is subject to the
electrical input of the Sun.
In fact, in recent years
astronomical papers have proposed
that the interactions of protons from the
solar wind with silicas in the lunar soil
may be the source of the
surprising abundance of lunar water,
and electrostatic dust
levitation on the Moon
as well as many other
airless bodies in space
is now routinely acknowledged
in astronomical literature.
So it is with great confidence, we predict
that future scientific investigations
into transient lunar phenomena
will point not toward outgassing nor any
other conventional geological process,
but rather, they will continue to affirm
the electrical nature of the phenomena
which predominate
the solar system
and the universe as a whole.

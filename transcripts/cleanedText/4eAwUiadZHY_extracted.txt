The parent star of planet Earth
holds a strange and special place in
countless ancient traditions
around the world.
The celestial body identified as
the sun in myth, religion, ancient
astronomies and rock art routinely bears
no resemblance at all to our familiar Sun.
One of the most common ancient
depictions of the Sun is an orb or star
within a crescent, an image with no
modern natural referent, and numerous
traditions depict the Sun as a
spectacular celestial wheel, with a
warrior hero appearing as
the axle of the wheel.
For decades, comparative
mythologist Ev Cochrane, as well as his
colleague David Talbott have worked to
reconstruct the natural events to
produce these extraordinary
mythical patterns.
It is their conclusion that in the
relatively recent past, in the era of
prehistory, a period of instability
reigned in the inner solar system,
bringing planets within
close proximity to Earth.
In this episode, Ev begins our
investigation into the question, did
ancient man observe
a different Sun?
It is important to underscore the
radical nature of our hypothesis.
We hold that the solar system
has only recently been
subject to wholesale
reordering that in fact, well
within the memory of mankind,
a different Sun prevailed.
Our hypothesis is fundamentally
a work of historical
reconstruction based upon
our mutual researches
in comparative mythology
and ancient religion.
The research of Dave and myself,
is distinguished from other
comparative mythologists in that we draw
upon and emphasize the message of
prehistoric rock art to illustrate our
findings from literary traditions.
To take but one example from hundreds that
might be offered, ancient paintings and
petroglyphs of the Sun depict
a wheel-like object
commonly 4- to 8-
spoked in structure.
Such artworks are
global in nature,
yet how is this fact
to be explained?
From the conventional
standpoint, such artworks
are interpreted as abstract or
metaphorical in nature.
Miranda Green for example,
in her otherwise
interesting book, The
Sun-Gods of Ancient Europe,
concludes, "The pictures
do not describe reality."
We beg to differ, it is our view
that the prehistoric paintings
accurately reflect the appearance of the
ancient sky and offer compelling
testimony with regards to an unfolding
catastrophic celestial event, in which
nearby planets dominated the
northern circumpolar heavens.
The mere fact that analogous
Sun petroglyphs will be found
around the globe, supports
this conclusion.
At the same time, ancient myth
offers corroborating testimony in this
regard, wherein a different Sun
dominated the sky in former times and
presented a wheel-like
appearance.
In this sense, as in countless other
examples, the testimony of ancient myth
and prehistoric rock art agrees at a
level of detail that is impossible to
explain by mere coincidence.
In the Thunderbolts of
the Gods, together with
a number of other recent
publications, Dave
and myself have presented a wealth of
evidence that the former Sun was the
focus of prodigious electrical activity
and the source of spectacular outbursts
of lightning, heaven-spanning storms,
and Aurora-like phenomena.
In ancient Mesopotamia for example,
the Sumerian word for Sun is Ud.
The same word is employed to
write storm or thundergod, a
startling extension of meaning.
Sumerian hymns invoking
the ancient Sun God,
likewise, describe it
as a source of storms.
So one hymn reads, "The Sun God
thunders over the mountains like a storm."
Another hymn reads, "As my king the Sun
God comes forth the heavens tremble
before him and the
earth shakes before him."
Now I ask, does this sound like a
realistic description of the modern
experience of sunrise?
In what sense is the Sun's appearance over
the eastern horizon ever accompanied by a
shaking of heaven and Earth
or great bouts of lightning?
What could the Sun have to do
with thunder and lightning?
In the present solar system,
of course, the answer is
nothing at all, yet the mere fact that
other ancient languages preserved this
very same semantic link between Sun and
lightning, confirms the fundamental
historical veracity
of the Sumerian
traditions and cries out
for an explanation.
Ancient Egypt, for example, offers
corroborating testimony in this regard.
In the Pyramid Texts from the 3rd
millennium BCE, the Sun God's thunderbolt
is specifically compared to
the lightnings of the Sun.
The word in question here
is mawt, m a w t, which has
cognates denoting lightning in
numerous other African languages.
Significantly however, the
very same word is used to
denote the spokes of a wheel.
In the present world
of course, lightning has
nothing whatsoever to do with the Sun or
wheels, hence the fundamental importance
of such terminology for
our historical reconstruction.
But we need not rely simply
on ancient language in myth alone.
Mesopotamian cylinder seals, together
with prehistoric rock art and other
early artworks, likewise depict
the Sun with lightning-
like structures emanating
from its core.
Students of comparative myth will
recognize the structure adorning the
face of the Sun here as the thunderbolt
wielded by the Thunder God.
So for example, thunder gods like Zeus or
the Semitic Hadad are routinely depicted
holding exactly this thunderbolt.
Properly understood, the evidence from
ancient language, like the testimony of
prehistoric rock art, represents an
enduring fossilized record of a
different solar system, much as the
discovery of a dinosaur bone harks back
to its former age, one radically different
from that which currently prevails.
It must be remembered here that
the denigration of myth is a relatively
recent development
basically originating
during the early decades
of the 20th century.
The science of comparative mythology,
like the complementary science of
comparative linguistics, grew out of the
19th century writings of world-class
scholars such as Max Mueller and
Adalbert Kuhn who rightly emphasized the
prominent role of the Sun and the
Thunder God in ancient myth and religion.
Yet the excesses of these schools
together with that of the Pan-
Babylonians led to a general backlash
against naturist or astronomical
interpretations of
myth and religion.
Current models of myths such as that
advanced by Georges Dumezil, which
dominates scholarship, emphasize
linguistic connections above all else
and are much more
narrow-minded in scope.
For example, Dumezil largely focuses
on Indo-European myth.
Most important perhaps is the
fact that current models
of myth always seek to
understand the ancient
traditions by reference
to the present sky.
But the ancient testimony is
impossible to square with the present
solar system and as a result, scholars
are left with empty slogans pointing to
figurative language, metaphor and such
statements as that of Green quoted
earlier, to the effect that the
pictures do not describe reality.
As Dave and I have documented
however, granted the fact
that the ancient traditions and prehistoric
rock art complement each other.
It therefore stands to reason that they
do indeed describe historical reality.
Confronted by these sun-wheels
for example, on ancient rock art, the
default position of so many modern
scholars is just to ascribe those
artworks to imagination or abstract
forms, completely overlooking
the fact that the same exact design
is found all over the world.
So, at that point you
need to ask yourself a
question, were ancient sky watchers on
every continent on the Earth imagining
the same fantastic structure in the sky,
which in this case is just a cross on
the face of the Sun or a lightning bolt
on the face of the Sun? But we could cite
a thousand other structures that we
could describe if we wanted to, we're
just trying to focus the discussion on
these particular structures at the moment.
But are we supposed to imagine
that all these sky watchers all around
the globe were imagining
the same thing?
That is not a logically
sound position.
It's much more rational to
assume that the ancient sky watchers
were trying to describe their personal
reality. They drew the picture of the Sun
that they saw, and that's why those
pictures agree all around the world.
Things that are imagined are not going
to agree unanimously around the world.
It's just that simple!

Preparing to the today's talk was a bit
of a challenge because we now have a
worldwide audience and many viewers
probably have never heard of the
Electric Sun Model or the SAFIRE
experiment. SAFIRE experiment is charged
with the task of exploring the theory
that our Sun, all stars, are electrically
powered. To do this we have a chamber
with a little ball in the middle,
this is our little Sun. Then we fill the
chamber with various gases, apply various
voltages and create an electric plasma
discharge. We then must design
experiments and collect data and that
data will be compared with the wealth of
NASA, the European Space Agency, other
agency, data and ideally SAFIRE
experiments will replicate the type of
measurements done of our Sun so that we
can have an apples to apples discussion
with their scientific cousins in these
organizations. And if I do my job well
we'll also be able to suggest new ways of
looking at the existing satellite data
that will highlight electrical aspects
of the Sun. Designing experiments to
prove scientific theories is difficult.
There is no instruction manual for how
to do it. I recall vividly my teachers
who studied with the generation of
Schroedinger and Durac trying to
impress upon us young physicists that
the data you collect in any experiment
can be interpreted in many ways. And if one
which is to create a new scientific
model, as they had helped to create
quantum mechanics, then you need to think
big. And they were clear to tell us, the
struggles you will end up facing will
not only be scientific. You will also
find yourself fighting political battles
and sometimes even religious
battles. To look at the difficulty of
verifying new scientific models we can
look at another instance in history
where they were disagreements about the
fundamental electrical nature of our
universe. A short story about the vision
of one scientist and the data he
collected.
In the late 1800's Kristian Birkeland
had an intuition that the Earth and the
Sun were electrically connected. Now this
was not the prevailing idea at the time.
The prevailing idea was that the Earth
and the Sun were electrically isolated
from each other. So we have two theories,
on the one hand the Earth and Sun
electrically connected, on the other, the
Earth and the Sun electrically isolated.
So how would you prove which theory is
correct?
Birkeland made many excursions into the
Arctic regions of Norway and with hand
held magnets he measured magnetic fields
on the ground while the Northern Lights
blazed over head. So on the left of this
figure we have Birkeland's theory that
the Sun and the Earth are electrically
connected, in the middle
a little schematic of a model, showing
electrical connection between the Sun
and the Earth and down the bottom there
you can see Birkeland walking around the
Arctic with his hand-held magnets. Now
the data he collected on the ground
actually matched his model and he took that
as support of his theory. Now on the right
hand side of this drawing you can see the
prevailing idea of the time, no
electrical connection between the Earth
and the Sun and a well-known
mathematician of the time
created an elegant theory to show that
all you needed was heat from the Sun and
that would generate local convection
currents above the Earth's poles and
this then would generate the same exact
compass measurements on the ground. And
that second theory is the one that won
out. Now the passage of a hundred years
has somewhat blunted the story for you
and me and we don't know anybody
personally connected with it, just an
anecdote in the history of science. But
it bothers me and I often think well
could those measurements taken beneath
the Blazing Northern Lights could they
really not tell us which theory was
correct and the answer is no, they could
not. As all too often happens the data
works equally well in both models and
one theory prevails
usually more for social or philosophical
reasons than scientific reasons and
Birkeland never got to see his ideas
accepted. The isolationists won out until
about the nineteen seventies when
satellite measurements were good enough
to actually show that there are indeed
electrical connections between the Earth
and the Sun. You saw this earlier, this is
one of the beautiful discharges from our
chamber, we'll call this one the flower
discharge and it's actually not
spherical it's more disc shaped and it's
not clear what the conditions are that
produced this. So we're now at a time
where there is the real possibility for
a paradigm change in astronomy, enough
data has been collected that probably
future astronomers will grow up studying
such concepts as electrical double
layers, electric potential over large
distances of space and cosmic Birkeland
currents. The study of the Sun is a
particularly fruitful area for studying
electricity in space. Here is a short
list of observations collected over many
years by many different people in the EU
community. Not to read them all, just to give
you an idea that t'was quite a bit and
with each within each one of these there
are actually thousands of papers and
conference proceedings so the good news
is there's a lot of material for us to
choose from.
Now for the point of view of where we're
at currently with SAFIRE here's a
short list that I will be talking about,
of specific areas to focus on. So I'll
talk about each one of these in course.
This is one of the,
lot of us have seen this one, of the very
confusing diagrams about the Sun, a plot
of the Sun's temperature as a function
of height above the sun's surface. So at 0
height on the left hand side there in the
photosphere about five thousand degrees
and as we move away from the Sun the
temperature increases in very specific
jumps as you move away and then at a
certain point the temperature shoots way
up very quickly through the transition
zone up to millions of degrees. Now with
this, if the SAFIRE experiment sees
something like this, in our Chamber,
that's a major win for the electrical
model of the Sun. And just to be clear, no one
has yet flown a thermometer into the Sun.
When you see statements about the sun's
temperature like these, those statements
are made by looking at light emitted
from the Sun. Some of the light
emitted from the Sun is in discrete
spectral lines and scientists can use
spectral lines to measure temperature.
For example we might be measuring just
one line from one element on the Sun, say
neon or measuring one color of neon
light from the Sun. And we can examine
the details of how that line changes as
you move away from the Sun so here's a
short diagram to say what I mean here.
You can imagine three different cases, in
the top diagram this one here, the width
of the line, the size of your spectral
line is broadest close to the Sun and
then it gets more narrow as you move
away from the Sun and you, if you do if
you're using line width to be a proxy or
an estimation of temperature you would
say, well things are cooling down as I
move away from the Sun,
sometimes that's called the campfire
model that things get colder as you move
away from the campfire. Now we can
imagine a different case, this middle one
here,
where the width of the line stays the
same as you move away from the Sun. Now
if we saw that then we would say well by
using line width as a measure of
temperature, it stays the same as you
move away from the Sun, OK, and then the
last example, one down here which is more
like our real Sun,
the line widths increase as you move away and so
again using this as a proxy for
temperature you say, things must be
getting hotter as we move away. So using
this as just one principle, just one of
the many principles we have at our
disposal, we can look at some movie of
some actual, the SAFIRE spectra which
you saw earlier but I like watching it
ok.
Real-time, this is what it looks like..
That's when all the USB ports blew up on
the computers. Now there is a wealth of
information as you could imagine
in this spectral data, we can just choose
one, one slice one snapshot from that and
we can just choose one of the lines in
one of the snapshots and we can look at
that line from different points in the
chamber so here's a picture of the
chamber and you can see the center glow
is the anode right this part
here and then down here do you see these
cylinders, those are fiber optics, that's
what's collecting the light, collecting
the light in the chamber and you can see
how they point in different directions
so one, you know, one we can point where we want,
one just grazed the anode, one of looked at
halfway out, maybe one looks towards the
cathode, so this is a way that we were
exploring that how, can we measure line
widths and other properties at different
points in the chamber. It actually was
not obvious when we started out if it was
even possible. So we can look at that again
just one line, one spectral line.
Here's a plot that shows just looking at,
actually this is more than one line, several
different lines and looking at their
widths, so all the ones over here these
are all red and these are blues. There are,
these are blue spectral lines in our
discharge and over here the reds like a
rainbow, over here are red spectral lines
in our discharge and you can see
that
here's like for example, you know, 12345
different points up here, they have more
width to them, so the vertical axis on
this graph is how wide the line is, so
this group here has more width to their
lines than this group down here. So that
was great so we verified yes, we can show
that we can distinguish different line
widths in different parts and then I went
back and I said, wait a minute which
which which groups are these, and this
whole group up here was all from fiber
optics looking at the anode or
close to the anode. Sorry, backwards, this
group down here was all looking at the
anode, close to the anode, this group here
was all looking away. So again, if we use
this as a proxy for temperature which,
I'll say it more later there's other
ways to look at it, then we've got
already here some kind of strange result
where it looks like, even in our chamber,
temperature might be might be higher as
you move away from the center. Now here
is, looking at one particular point, it's
not only there's no there's another way
that this we analyze the data it which
is the shape of a line, not only how wide
it is but the shape of it and it actually
tells us a fair amount about the physics
so for example if your line width, your
line shape is fit by Gaussian statistics
then you're probably looking more at
temperature and indications of temperature.
If your shape is fit more by a
different kind of statistics, Lorentzian
statistics, then you're probably looking
more at electron density in the chamber.
And so again, our job was to say well,
can we measure these differences and yes
we can measure these differences within
our Chamber. Alright, moving onto the next
item on the shortlist, coronal streamers.
It's gonna be a movie of SOHO,
ultraviolet data, so the Sun is in the
center there
these are coronal, called coronal streamers
flying off. Now people at the Catania
observatory in Italy, Ventura and Spadaro,
they looked at these coronal streamers
and they wanted to examine things like
temperature, how does the temperature
vary inside of these streamers. Ok so
that white line there shows you like an
example of where they were sampling data
and they found some pretty strange
results. Here's here's some of their data,
they were using line width, the width of
the spectral lines as a measure of
temperature. What they found unexpectedly
was that it depends upon what element
you're looking at and so all of these
upper plot points here these are all
from oxygen atoms inside the streamer
and as you move away from the Sun those
oxygen atoms get hotter and hotter and
hotter okay, these down here are all using
the same method, looking at line width as a
measure of temperature but for hydrogen.
Hydrogen is a hundred times colder, this
is a logarithmic plot. A hundred times
colder and it gets cooler as you move
away from the Sun. So, needless to say, there are
unexpected results, and it's not at all
clear what this, why this would come
about. It also makes me wonder if we
really can make such simple correlations
between line width and temperature. Cause one
person would say well clearly your
oxygen is hotter than your hydrogen.
Someone else might say well, you know what,
maybe we don't really understand the
connection between line width and
temperature. I would be one of those
people. It gets even better,
now they're gonna look at
that temperature profile as you cut
across a single-streamer ok, so that line
there shows slice perpendicular to the
streamer we're gonna look at the data
across that, look at that oxygen and
hydrogens again. So here's a plot of
the intensity as you cut across the
streamer and that makes sense, it's,
there's more intensity coming out of the
streamer in the middle, right. Quiet,
then it gets intense than it's quiet
again. Now let's look at what happens if
you look at the temperature of oxygen as
we cut across. Well it is hotter outside
the streamer, then it cools down in the
streamer, and then it gets hot again,
right. Look at hydrogen, just the opposite.
It's cooler outside the streamer, the
temperature goes up as you get inside
the streamer and then it's cold again as
you go on the other side. So these were
extremely strange results. Now I think
this is a, could be as a consequence of
electrical activity on the Sun but again
we have to design experiments that can
verify this. This is one particularly beautiful
discharge. So whether or not these
discharge structures that we see, whether
or not they correspond directly to
photosphere granules, whether they
correspond directly to coronal streamers
ok, all this is yet to be established but
the approach, again to emphasize, the
approach of SAFIRE is that we need to
mimic the types of measurements that are
done
of the Sun, OK. So we would use our fiber
optics to look inside of these
structures here, the same way that the
people in Catania used the STO data and
we'll see if we have measurements that
correspond.
Now we have the added benefit of having
additional instruments, like for example
a Langmuir probe which can measure the
plasma characteristics, voltage potential,
ion, electron temperatures, so we can take
that data then and then suggest back
to other people
new ways they can look at the existing
satellite data. So now given all this is
how we gonna go to Monty and I say, Monty
we need to be able to move the fiber
optics across the anode tufts, the anode tufts
are about two millimeters across, I need
a positional fiber-optic that's down to
about point O five millimeters, can you
do that for me? And as you heard earlier
today he comes back eventually and goes, yes I
can do that for you can do it. And I
asked Lowell, I say Lowell, do you think, can
you look at the Boltzmann equation for
our situation,
see what you think that the temperature,
the measured temperature of oxygen and
hydrogen would be, do you think we
would see the same sorts of things that
we see around the Sun? OK, under the
next item in the list, that was the first
ionization potential anomaly. The first
ionization potential anomaly is a well
known but unexplained observation of our
Sun and other stars and an analogy will
help a lot here so imagine that you are
throwing a very big party,
hundreds of guests there from all walks
of life some rich, some poor, some men,
some women, married, not married and
imagine that you notice a pattern, you
notice that there's always the same set
of 12 people that go outside and talk
outside for a while. And amongst those 12
it's a mix, some are young, some are old,
some are married or not and they're not
smoking, so what would they have in
common,
why do they go outside? So when you're
thinking that over, now we can switch to
the astronomical case, something happens
very similar to this party example, to
the chemical elements on the Sun and a
certain group of elements are much more
likely to be found outside the Sun than
on the surface of the Sun. So for example
on the photosphere we see about 35
magnesium
atoms for every million hydrogen atoms
but in the solar wind leaving the Sun
there are four times that many magnesium
atoms. Another example, we see about forty
seven iron atoms for every million
hydrogen atoms on the photosphere but a
solar flare might have a hundred times
that much iron and for helium it's
exactly the opposite,
there are fewer helium atoms in
energetic particle emissions from the
Sun than there are in the photosphere so
what makes these special, why do some of
them tend to be found outside the Sun,
why do some of the guests tend to go
outside the party. So it seems that it
all comes down to, how easy it is to pull
an electron off of that element. Now if
it's easy to pull an electron off of an
element then we find more of that
element outside the Sun like in solar
flares or the solar wind and physicists
have a name for how easy it is to pull
an electron off of an atom, it's called the
first ionization potential. So here's a
plot of various chemical elements, the
horizontal axis, horizontal axis here is
how easy it is to pull off an electron,
you can see over here on the left, about
four volts is what you need to pull off
the first electron off of potassium then
there's a progression and when you get
out to here like neon and helium it's
really hard to pull off an electron off of
those elements. And the vertical axis
here shows is how much more likely it is to
find that element outside the
photosphere so you can see the elements
on the left, the ones where it's easy to
pull an electron off. Those are the ones
that you find more abundant in emissions
from the Sun and elements on the right
with the higher ionization potential are
less likely to be found outside the Sun.
So going back to our analogy, we found a
property that tells us why, might tell us,
why these twelve people keep going
outside the party.
Now why this one property of first
ionization potential should lead to all
of this is not at all clear from the
standard model of the Sun where you only
get to use hot gases and magnetic fields.
It is explainable from the electric Sun
model but the main point is, we need to
design an experiment that will measure
it. So like NASA, we would use
spectroscopy to remotely deduce the
abundances of different elements close
to our anode and like NASA we would use
a mass spectrometer away from the anode
to measure the elements far from the anode.
So now I have more requests for
Monty, Monty can we coat the anode in
magnesium, magnesium has a low ionization
potential then Paul if I give you
fiber-optic data and mass spec data what
other factors do you need that will give
us good statistics on the DOE. So I
hope you can start to see the
flexibility of the SAFIRE chamber, that
we can ask such a wide variety of
questions and actually stand a good
chance of running experiments to look at
them in the laboratory. Next on the list.
So sometimes it's important to step back
and look at the forest, not the trees and
as many have heard here, one of the
outstanding features of the Sun is its
discrete layers and their very very
different properties. So here's a
combination, on the right there the
photosphere, we see a lot of that, then
just just a hair's breadth hair's
breadth above the photosphere is the
chromosphere which if you look at it
closely looks a lot like a fur coat with
clouds floating over it, very strange. And
then you move out a little bit more, the
lower Corona, that's where you see all this
incredible loops and x-ray emissions,
lot of dynamic activity, pulling back further
you see the upper Corona which again has
a very different properties, these wispy hairy
filaments that extend out for long long
distances. Then there seems to be a long
stretch where things don't change that
much in the solar atmosphere, until you
get to the heliosphere boundary and
right now the Voyager satellites, as we
know, are out there going through some
boundary of some kind what it is, is now
been thrown up into question, this is an
artist's rendering of the Voyager
satellites out of the boundary of the
solar system. Now these probes are
returning very interesting data, on the
left it shows a plot of Voyager measuring
the electron density as it's passing
through the boundary, on the right is a
plot of the density of positive ions as it's
going through this boundary and the main
point is these rapid fluctuations that
we see at the boundary. Are these rapid
fluctuations due to bow shocks and
supersonic flows or we all know that
these rapid fluctuations are actually
a quite natural consequence of electrical
double layers. So the Voyager data is
taking place far out from the Sun right,
so that's not us measuring close to our
anode that's measuring us far away
from the anode in our chamber. So again I
could ask Monty, I need a Langmuir probe,
it also has to have sub millimeter
resolution cause I need to see the
fluctuations in our chamber and compare
them to the data we're getting back from
Voyager and see if we see something
similar.
Next item
It's coronal, I call it the coronal jolt. So,
CME-s, coronal mass ejections, are
spectacular emissions off the surface of
the Sun, they're sometimes associated with
the solar flare, a solar flare is an
eruption that's very localized on the
Sun, very small spatial location solar
flare and one of the main unanswered
questions about CME-s is still, are they
large-scale events or are they
small-scale events.
Now the small scale camp says CMA-s start
from a solar flare, they start from a
very small part on the Sun which then
blasts out and fills space around the
Sun and goes away and that's how you get
your CME and they have some data that
supports their model. There is another
camp that says no CME's are actually a
large-scale event that the eruption that
we see is taking place over such a large
area there is no way that a single point
on the Sun can lead to all that and this
camp also has data to support their
theory. So now we're gonna look at, so this
is the Sun in UV extreme UV and I want
you to look at the lower right side of
it.
Pulse,
pulse, pulse can you see how that, the
outer atmosphere, can I draw on this, the
outer, we're looking here primarily
you'll see it here, the outer atmosphere
of the Sun and I want you to look for
pulse down pulse down.. So it, that may look
like not much going on but that is
billions of cubic miles of plasma that
is behaving all as a single unit over
about 40 minutes so that's actually a
very big unified action from the Sun,
the coronal mass ejection is taking
place on the far side of the Sun here, so
we don't see the coronal mass ejection.
We only see from the back side, we see
the whole atmosphere of the Sun pulsing
like that. So do we see something like
this in SAFIRE, and yes we do and
probably you've seen this a couple times
over this weekend,
this is our anode and then periodically
there's a buildup of energy close to the
anode, then it will release explosively
and then the anode is notably dimmer
afterwards ok, here's a little video
which you saw already but it doesn't hurt to
see it again,
buildup,
release and then dimmer.
So once again the commissioning phase of
SAFIRE exceeded our expectations, not
only can we resolve high-speed plasma
discharges from the anode but we already
have data indicating a direct
correlation with existing NASA data. And
lastly, comets. As many people in EU
community have said, there are many aspects
about comets that only make sense if
the electric Sun model is true. Here is a
couple of photos of 67 P, so in
conjunction with Franklin Anariba
SAFIRE group working out some very
specific experiments to examine the
electric comet hypothesis. You saw this
little while ago. This is one of the ways
we're gonna examine it is to place different
materials, possible materials on the end
of our probe and then send those
materials in various orbits around the
anode. So that blue line is tracing out
the orbit, just an example, sample orbit
that we could send something on inside
the chamber. This is one of the materials
we're going to start with, more of this is
again from Franklin's suggestions of type
of material to start with and so for
example, one set of experiments we could
run, see on the left there, I have a
column for what's the cometary feature
that we are mimicking and in this case
it's certain materials that we know are
on comets, of course there's a lot of
disagreement about how much of the
materials are on comets, whether comets
are ice, whether comets are primarily
rocky but on the left camp column there
you see various rocky elements that we'll
start with. And in the middle, it's kinda what
what's the SAFIRE example
of that, well it's it's a piece of rock,
like you can see there in the photograph,
and then what will what kind of
measurements will we make that will
mimic existing measurements of outer
space. And so for example, and there's a
lot of detail to this if you saw Franklin's
talk,
he'd predict to see the certain
gases, certain organic compounds coming
out of this, and in particular, you know, if we
see a increase concentration of water in
our chamber, as we're zipping this rock
around, then we know it's from
electrochemistry and not from a dirty
snowball. So that would be an example of
how we could mimic existing data with a
different model. Dustification. I think he
made up that word. Dustification of the
comet nucleus is also something we can
look at. Here's a picture of 67 P so the
fact that 67 P was rocky is not a
surprise to EU theorists but the presence
of dust, large amounts of dust, not so
obvious. So if 67 P was blasted off of
Mars, yes there would be a lot of dust
created right, but it's so small the
comet, would it really attract all of
that just back to itself, you know, I
don't think so.
So how would we explain something like
this where not only do we have a lot of
dust, these lanes of dust throughout the
comet, but if you blow that up it
actually looks like it's been a dust
landslide ok, so this begs the question,
maybe dust is being continuously created
on the comet, OK. So this is another thing
we can do, we can, over the course of time,
look for the type of dust if any that's
created. Franklin Anariba thinks
that the electric discharge will break
down the larger silicates structures
into smaller silicat dust but this
remains to be seen through an experiment.
And hopefully the folks at ESA will
publish some data about 67 P's dust
composition.
Another example of how we can look at
our situation to examine comets, we're
going to look at all the properties
around our little comets, electron
density, the temperature, elemental
analysis and so will you see here this
sketch on the, on the right here, this is
an analysis of the comet Hale-Bopp,
it was the Swan telescope in 1979 I think 97,
returned some UV images of Hale-Bopp and then
if you use a certain reasonable
assumptions about the nature of the coma
around the comet and you compare your
observed UV emissions to your model you
get this, these interesting set of
plots for the temperature. As you move
away from the comets, so here
according to this model,
the temperature should drop as you move
away from Hale-Bopp and then go up and
then drop and go up etcetera.
Now this is very reminiscent already of
measurements that we are collecting
inside the SAFIRE chamber, electrical
double layers have a lot of these kind
of oscillatory
qualities to them where something is,
like electron density, will go up and
down up and down as you move away.
And of course, the filaments. Here's a wonderful gallery,
I love this, of its different filaments
around 67P and I realized as I was
listening to my introduction that we
should, we should carve our little rocks
into the same shapes as various comets
and then see if we can replicate simply
the morphology of the discharge around
the comets.
Alright so that's the end of my
presentation, thank you very much for
sticking with me, couple of meaty ideas out
there, but it gives you a taste I think,
of the SAFIRE chamber and how
versatile it is. The number of different
questions we can ask and actually take
actual measurements to verify, so thank
you very much and wanna explicitly thank the
people who are making this experiment
possible.

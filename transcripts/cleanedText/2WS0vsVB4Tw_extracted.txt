According to consensus science, 
ancient cultures across the planet
with no communication between them,
independently and spontaneously invented
dragons. Remarkably, they all invented the
same physical description and modus operandi-
a fire-breathing serpent, origin in the sea,
havoc across the land and crazy weather.
Given the consistencies and global 
reach of this ancient archetype,
a rational thinker might consider some
significant global event is behind it,
common to each culture. Yet the 
consensus relegates this to coincidence,
or a spontaneous glitch in 
a collective consciousness,
their own science denies the existence of. Truth
is ancient man was intimate with an environment
more extreme than we have today and
understood it much better than we do.
The ancients left us tales, artwork and
structures that are more than just breadcrumbs.
They are bold, articulate statements about
the environment they lived in, and how
different it was from ours. This is 
Andrew Hall. I'm presenting Part 8
of my series: Eye of the Storm, 
where we've been examining dragons.
The features examined in this article
are proof of the dragon's passage,
not random and coincidental anomalies. They 
appear predictably, as expected of the circuit.
Reactive power is a two-way street. Energy is
both released and absorbed as current alternates,
spitting out and sucking back in. Chapter 7
showed the canyons and river channels arc-
blasted by reactive power from resonant 
discharges. That was an example of reactive power
spitting out. When it sucks back in,
reactive power creates a mountain,
not a canyon. This is where things get
really interesting. The resonant reactive
discharge that blasted the river apart, creating
a junction, also created mountains on reactive
inflow vectors. The inflow current is
backwards relative to reactive outflow.
And since there's a bias in the line current, the 
backwards direction of reactive inflow current
produces a different vector 
sum than the outflow.
The inflow current depletes a region of 
electrons. This breaks the bonds in crystalline
rock, tearing it apart, heating 
and dissolving it. Chemistry,
magnetism and the Coulomb force
compete to rearrange the landscape.
The depleted region forms a
mountain as atomic bonds recombine,
first forming a rock wall called a dike.
The dike forms where a filament of
current begins to steal electrons from the
surroundings, pulling material to the filament and
pinching it magnetically. After 
a discharge neutralizes the
current, the material recombines,
cools and solidifies into a wall of rock.
Wind then piles dust onto the
dike, aided by rarefaction from
shockwaves and electrostatic
attraction to the still depleted zone,
building a mountain. The effect can be seen in
this image of the Will Henry and its tributaries
where they branch from the Colorado River.
Adjacent to the capacitive discharge
there are linear mountains, shown 
in red lines, radiating away from
the crux of the river branching.
These are the reactive inflow currents,
where charge depletion made a dike on which
a mountain formed from wind-blown dust.
These are at angles that increase
between the second and third bifurcations
from 40 to 50 degrees with
respect to the outgoing
inductive current. Because these currents are
flowing backwards with respect to the line current
and the positive bias in line current
increases as reactive power is drawn
away in successive discharges,
which widens this angle.
Since there is an inductive reactive inflow
current, there must also be capacitive reactive
inflow currents, and indeed there are.
In the first image, the linear mountains
were inductive reactive inflow 
currents. The next image shows
linear mountains aligned parallel with supply
current just before these same junctions. The
parallel mountains are the capacitive reactive
inflow currents. Recall from part 7, these
junctions are caused by resonant frequency
that acts like a stopper in the current flow,
forcing it to squirt out sideways in a reactive
discharge. As the line current is slowed by the
rising frequency, charge builds in the nose of
the current channel, just like pressure behind a
bottleneck. A far-field positive charge
builds parallel and adjacent to the charge
building in the line due to capacitance.
This is known as stray capacitance
in the electronics world and is
generally something designed out of a
system because it creates unwanted harmonic
feedback. it's parallel to the supply current
because it's actually
making a capacitor at some
distance defined by the magnetic field,
which helps induce currents to build the
capacitor's charge. It's to the right of the
line current, because of the right hand rule
which says the magnetic field is
penetrating the ground at these places
and saturating it with induced currents.
These capacitors are filaments of
positive charge that build up before 
the line current explodes in a reactive
discharge. When the discharge occurs,
the capacitive reactive branch connects
with the capacitor filaments and drains
them, which has the effect of building a dike
and hence a mountain from a depleted charge 
zone. Once the connection is made in the
filament’s drain, the capacitive reactive
discharge current is free to turn its vector east
to align with the electric field.
In all, there are nine resonant
frequency bifurcations, marked in 
green on the accompanying image,
along the Colorado and its primary tributaries,
including Lake Powell, which is a staccato
series of resonant discharges. Each 
has the same crab claw shape, with
accompanying inflow current generating mountains,
inductive outflow currents that vector north,
and capacitive outflow currents that
vector east, parallel to the line current,
which is aligned to the electric field.
You may also note some of these
bifurcations are where dams are built,
including Hoover, Parker and Glen Canyon.
It's no coincidence that the bottleneck
of a resident reactive discharge
creates a bottleneck canyon,
with an arc-blasted basin behind,
perfectly suitable for damming. The 
rocky choke point is a result of induced
reactive inflow currents aimed at 
the crux of the resonant discharge.
The next image shows line current
and outflow reactants in blue,
and inflow reactants in red, for the major
resonant discharge bifurcations along the
southern portion of the Colorado and Gila rivers.
In some conditions mesas are created by
reactive inflow instead of mountains. This
occurs when the desaturated zones left by inflow
currents leave mesas behind, as 
landscape around is sputtered away.
In the next image of Lake Powell there
are inductive absorption currents 180
degrees opposed to the inductive reactive power
discharges. See my articles on Sputtering Canyons,
Part 1, 2 and 3 for some 
background on sputtering.
Note the fine tendrils running parallel
around and between the highlighted mesas.
These canyons are scars from tendrils 
of charge that shot through this area,
electrifying an aquifer or wet layer of deposits and
causing the land to sputter away from that layer,
leaving already desaturated areas behind,
like the mesas. Another example of this
is at the Green River branching.
South of the junction is an arcing
network of filamented canyons and 
mesas parallel to incoming line current,
just before the bifurcation. This is
another area where capacitive reactive
charge built parallel to line current prior
to the resonant discharge bifurcation.
Charge built in the ground and then was drawn
away by three large short circuiting filaments
which are the three canyons perpendicular to the
river at top center in the image, that shoot from
the line current orthogonally through the
arc, zigzagging to touch each filament.
This left depleted ground where the linear mesas are, 
while the canyons were excavated by sputtering.
There are two things that can be said
about these reactive discharges.
One, the current of electrons and negative
ions in the discharge of the dragon's blood
so to speak, is a destructive force that
excavates the land in explosive arc blast events.
The reactive inflow currents, however, are 
constructive and build mountains and mesas.
One is the inverse of the other. It's interesting
to see how complex-number math actually
displays itself in nature. Second, the 
reactive inflow currents are slow and cold.
They diffuse through the land, changing the
chemistry and reforming rock over some time,
not at the lightning pace of a spark.
Take another look at the Google Earth
image where the resonant discharges are highlighted
in green. There are other features marked with
yellow triangles and red circles. 
Let's take a look at those.
Refer to the yellow triangles on the image. Not all
junctions occur as a result of resonant frequency.
Some junctions occur as a result of sudden
grounding. As the main line current climbs the
plateau, it's encountering hot dry
deposits of sand over sheets of water.
Aquifers are layered below, left from past
tsunamis, rain or ancient lakes. The grounding of
the discharge happens when the supply line
current induces parallel current in the aquifer
and they connect, likely at a spring or
other feature that provides continuity
between the surface and the aquifer. The sudden
grounding creates a new current vector. As supply
line current encounters a conductive path
to the ground potential in the aquifer,
the supply line voltage is affected. The supply
line voltage vector remains straight and a new,
line-to-ground voltage vector branches 
away. It basically creates a kink in the
electric field expressed in two dimensions
on the plane of the earth's surface.
But it really results from an
interference pattern in three dimensions
multi-phase electromagnetic field. A line-to-
ground current splits away with this voltage
which is clocked 30 degrees counter-
clockwise to line voltage in a balanced
three-phase circuit. In a balanced three-phase
circuit the currents would form a star pattern,
with 120 degrees between each arm
forming what is called a grounded Y
connection. DC bias in a very 
dirty signal to the current
closes the current angle down to the 40
and 60 degree angle seen at the Green
and San Juan junctions. The vectors 
represent nature finding its own
balance. Another clue to its formation is
the fact supply line current vectors remain
straight, while the tributary 
forks away counterclockwise.
But there is no opposing 
capacitive reactive discharge
evident radiating from the center of the branch,
nor is there evidence of reactive inflow currents.
These junctions are not due to 
resonant frequency and reactive power,
but to an instability in the electric
field created by a sudden grounding.
The effect is to bifurcate the dragon; it takes
energy from the ground connection to clone itself
and the clone takes a new current vector.
Y connections are used for various
reasons in high voltage transmission, one 
being to join three-phase circuits with ground.
Grounding the connection allows certain
harmonic frequencies called third order
harmonics to bleed away without interfering
and unbalancing the primary phases.
In particular, lightning 
surges will pass to ground
without surging the primary circuits. Navajo 
Mountain sits next to the San Juan junction.
It is a fulgurite created by 
negative cloud-to-ground lightning.
It looks very suspicious, sitting next to the
bifurcation. But it's not yet apparent if it had a
role in creating the bifurcation, or if it was a
consequence. There are striations between the river
and the mountain running parallel to the river's
course, indicating capacitive stresses in this
region. One thing that's quite
obvious in the Canyonlands of Utah,
at the heart of the charged capacitor
dome, is that the rivers meander wildly,
yet they keep true to 
trajectories along the electric
field. Oscillations in current phase and magnetic 
fields cause the filaments to wobble and
curlicue. When the branches are in-phase,
they try to close together on a common transient
current vector, but then push apart when
out-of-phase and return to the original line current
vector. In the image below are
highlighted areas of extreme
current bending and inductive discharges that
flare from the bends in flame-like patterns,
creating fractal chaos between and around 
the Green and Colorado rivers near the junction.
Magnetic fields pulsate and wrestle 
the currents back and forth, create
ring currents like the amazing Upheaval Dome.
A ring current stuck in its own magnetic field
which created an induction 
coil. The induction coil
generated a tightly wound supersonic plasma 
tornado. The center of the ring current is a
clump of sharply pointed 
tetrahedrons aimed skyward from
shockwaves, where the coil's 
induction drew the central
supersonic updraft. The surrounding rim 
rock on the right side of the dome, is cut by
parallel triangular bites, adjacent to scalloped
walls on the opposing side of the canyon wall
farther to the right. This displays the channels
of multiple vortex wind where the tornado's inflow
bent into the central updraft of the induction 
coil. The triangular bites are from standing
shockwaves where the wind turned into the updraft
of the coil. The scallops display the eddy of
multiple vortex jet streams as they make this 
turn. Returning to the annotated image of the
Colorado system, there are two red ovals 
indicated. The ovals indicate massive downdraft
craters caused by the two main 
coronal loops on the Colorado plateau:
the San Rafael and Capitol Reef dome and
crater complex and the Monument Valley
San Juan dome and crater complex.
Recall from Eye of the Storm Part 3.
These dome and crater pairs were caused
by coronal storms which left immense
tetrahedral monoclines where 
the wind deflected abruptly,
creating shock waves. Winds deflection
was due to the magnetic field pinching
around the updrafts and the downdrafts.
The same magnetic field also redirected
the ground-to-ground line currents,
the dragon's blood so to speak,
due to the Hall Effect. The Hall Effect
basically says a magnetic field will either
push or pull a current's direction, depending on
polarity. You can see the effect in these diagrams
where an electric current shown 
in blue is either pushed away or
attracted to a magnet in close proximity.
Because these regions of high electric
flux generated strong magnetic fields around
them, especially at the interface of ground
and sky, it pushed the arc
around the negative craters
and drew it through positive domes.
You can see the San Juan river
bend around the downdraft crater, circled in red,
and shoot through the center of the updraft dome,
shown in green. Similarly the 
San Raphael updraft dome has
tributaries of the Green River shooting
through its center and the downdraft
crater is avoided by the arc of 
the Green River and its tributaries.
Another example of the Hall Effect is displayed
in these images of the famous Gila Bend
in the Gila River. Note how the river bends 
south and then returns to its original trajectory.
It's as if it is detouring around an
obstacle, and it actually is. The current is
detouring around the Sentinel
Arlington volcanic field, the magnetic
field of which pushes the current around
due to the Hall Effect. A similar effect
happens in the Grand Canyon as well, but in this
case the river detours to the south twice below
the Uinkaret Volcanic Field.
There is a distinct straight
segment between the two detours.
The bar in the center is possibly a
function of the frequency of the
alternating current and the discharge
velocity as it advances. In other 
words, the current is pushed
away from the volcano while in 
opposing phase and pulled back
towards the volcano as phase rotates,
then pushed away again, as its phase
completes a rotation. Or it could be an artifact
of the way the circuit connects with the volcano
subsurface where it can't be seen,
producing an effect similar to the diagram
shown. The final feature to examine is
related to the resonant discharge we
discussed in the beginning of this chapter,
only this type of discharge occurs in
the middle of the line current.
In other words, the resonant
discharges we previously discussed
were at the head of the dragon,
as it searched its way along the electric field.
These reactive discharges shot out of
the body of the dragon, due to 
pulsations in the flow of current.
The dragon at this point is a thousand miles 
long. The longest recorded lightning strike is
only 200 miles in length. So this is 
very big lightning; as discharge occurs,
pulses of energy and bolides 
of densely charged matter
shoot up and down the line current. When two
waves of charge density collide, they interfere,
causing a momentary spike in
energy similar to a rogue wave or
the pressure waves in water pipes
that cause hammer and cavitation.
A reactive discharge results,
creating box canyons to either side,
rotated roughly 90 degrees to the line
current and forming a cross. The reactive
discharges are always a proper 180 degrees
opposed and occasionally one of the tendrils
will continue to be induced, generally
north to form a longer canyon. The
Grand Canyon especially exhibits 
these types of reactive discharge.
In Part 9 we will complete
the description of the parallel
RLC circuit that created the Colorado River,
and then describe circuits beneath the
crust from which the dragon emerged.

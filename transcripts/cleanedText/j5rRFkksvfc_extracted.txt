Welcome to Space News from
the Electric Universe,
brought to you by The
Thunderbolts Projectâ„¢

In the first three parts
of this presentation,
Thunderbolts contributor Andrew Hall has
explored the electrical nature of wind
and powerful storms on planets throughout
the solar system including Earth.
Of course, mainstream geology tells
us that wind plays a significant role
in shaping the
landscape of our planet,
supposedly incrementally
over countless eons of time.
But, as Andrew has proposed
in numerous past videos,
the Earth's wind sheared
landscape reveals unique patterns
which may have been produced by ionized
shock waves in primordial electric storms.
In part four of
this 10-part series,
Andrew argues for a new perspective
on wind in Earth geology,
not as a slow erosional force
but a short-lived and violent one.
If you study Earth's surface
and look at details in its form,
there are obvious patterns:
arcing patterns of mountain
ranges and island chains,
strange swirls and looping
cracks on the ocean floor,
and on close inspection there's harmony
in the shape of mountains and other terrain.
Sometimes it's geometric with
triangles, arcs, and star patterns.
But usually it's more
fluid, like a crazy paisley.
Consensus thought is, this is a
result of a series of unrelated events
that occurred over
billions of years,
driven by the slow churn of Earth's
crust subducting the continental plates
and the constant wear of erosion.
EU thinks it didn't
happen that way.
We think it was
caused by electricity
and the patterns we see make more sense
if viewed in the context of our theory.
The face of the Earth was
shaped by three primary means:
volcanic eruption,
lightning, and wind.
It occurred in primordial storms
which ionized the atmosphere,
charged the ground
like a battery,
and discharged energy
the same way we see today:
earthquakes, volcanoes and storms.
Only these storms
were beyond biblical.
They occurred before man arrived.
What we are talking about today
are the storms of creation,
which shaped the
face of the planet.
Because wind played the biggest role in
laying and piling the sediments we live on,
its effects are most visible.
The evidence is in supersonic
shockwaves imprinted on the land.
Once you start recognizing the
characteristics of wind-formed topography,
it becomes almost
impossible to ignore.
To identify wind direction,
look at mountains.
Mountains, not volcanoes,
are all essentially
wind blown dunes.
With exceptions for
shifting wind conditions,
a mountain's shape will show a
windward and leeward side like a dune.
The leeward side is generally
steep and slab-sided
and the windward side
dips at a shallower slope.
The windward side actually portrays
the shape of the wind itself,
as pressure waves undulate across
moveable sands and mold them.
If the wind reaches Mach speeds,
standing shock waves reflect from
any protrusion in the wind's path
causing a sharp change
in wind direction.
Distinct patterns form at this
crease called shock diamonds,
where the wind direction
changes abruptly.
The reflected standing shock wave
forms a fan-shaped interference pattern
of compression and rarefaction.
This pattern can be found on most mountain
forms, including Cordillera mountain arcs,
continental divides, lone 
inselbergs, and basin and range.
Dust-laden supersonic winds
deposit their heavy cargo
where the crease
in the wind forms.
A tetrahedron-shaped zone of
rarefaction, or low pressure,
develops at the root
of the standing wave,
it's called a "separation bubble."
Wind-born dust collects in this bubble as
the wind deflects upward with a shock wave.
As material deposits
in the separation bubble,
it forms a new barrier
to deflect the wind,
which moves the standing shock
reflection backwards into the wind.
The separation bubble migrates
into the wind with the shock wave,
causing new dust to
overlay the old in layers
that stack into the
direction of the wind.
The shock wave is a discontinuity in
density, temperature, and ionization.
Remember, we're talking
about a primordial storm
where much of the
atmosphere ionized.
So, standing shock waves reflected
from the ground back into the clouds
providing a path for discharge.
The separation bubble is not only a
pressure sink, which collects heavy matter,
it is also a current sink,
being the lowest potential region
connected to the high potential current
in the reflected shock wave.
It, therefore, draws current to bake,
compress, and fuse the deposited dust.
It creates a distinct
pattern on the windward side.
Dragon's teeth --
triangular buttresses, or
sometimes called flat-irons,
formed by the sonic, ionized
shockwaves of supersonic winds.
They rise and fall in
amplitude and wavelength,
and display harmonic frequency shifts,
as well as many, many other features
which can only be produced by the
sonic effects of supersonic winds --
please see the "Arc Blast" and "Monocline"
articles previously published, for more details.
Understanding how winds
form these shock patterns
and examining the result on the
landscape reveals a wealth of information.
Let's consider this very
simple dune, called El Guaje,
in the Sierra Oriental
mountains of central Mexico.
The shock patterns of triangles is
very apparent on its windward side.
This next image is
annotated to show El Guaje
highlighting the four consecutively
formed pressure ridges that are visible.
The first is
highlighted in green
and it's almost buried
by later deposition,
so only the tops of its
buttresses are exposed.
The second is marked in yellow
and is another small ridge caused
by a period of weaker winds.
It's also partially buried by
the third, and the largest ridge
which obviously deposited
much more material.
Large triangular buttresses
at one end of the large ridge
shrink in amplitude with geometric
progression until they almost vanish.
This indicates the jet-
stream velocity transitioned
from supersonic to near subsonic velocity
along the wind-front of this dune.
The faster jet-stream region
advanced the growth of the dune,
depositing material faster and
pushing the shock-wave into the wind.
It advanced the ridge line at
the top of the page into the wind,
shown by the violet arc,
and built this portion of
the mountain thicker, taller,
and with larger amplitude
reflected shocks
forming bigger
triangular buttresses.
Each layer of the buttresses is
formed by a new shock front
from winds impinging
on the last layer.
New shock fronts formed as the wind
gusted, piling new layers on the old.
A final diminishing wind
created a final fourth shock front
which deposited a small pressure ridge,
shown in purple, on the foot of the mountain.
The highlights obscure
natural features
so please contrast
the annotated image
with the first, naked image,
to see the buttresses better.
The winds that created these
ridges were like any storm,
just quite a bit more violent.
They stiffened as the storm
grew, reached a crescendo
with electrically charged,
gusting blasts at Mach speeds,
and then ebbed away.
Their formation precludes any notion
that the winds that created them
were caused by a meteor or comet.
A large impact might produce
supersonic, dust-laden winds,
but they would crest
with the first shock wave
and then dissipate,
not slowly build to a crescendo
as these mountain ridges do.
Take a look at the surroundings
of El Guaje ridge,
and it becomes even more
apparent how it was made.
It's part of a
larger structure --
an oblong crater, it's 200 feet deeper
in the center than outside the rim.
The pressure ridges, including El
Guaje, form the rim of the crater.
It wasn't made by
an oblong meteor.
This is the result
of a down-burst wind.
The pressure ridges are
the rims of the crater,
with triangular buttresses showing the
wind direction as it blasted the Earth
like a blowtorch,
and blew out radially, depositing dust
along the standing shock waves it created.
The outward blast is
interfered at the top end
by two, round mountains
formed by lightning discharge
which altered the
wind flow around them
and disrupted the
symmetry of the crater.
Taking another step back in altitude reveals
this entire mountain region in Mexico
is shaped by a turbulent
shear zone in the wind.
These mountains were formed by uni-polar
electric winds screaming from the south,
and mixing into plasma
storms along the shear zone
with an opposite polarity wind
screaming from the other direction.
It's eerily similar to the turbulent
shear zones adjacent to the Great Red Spot
on Jupiter,
creating kinked circulations
that have a crab-claw shape.
I call this mountain formation
in Mexico -- the Mexican Kink.
Turbulent winds fold back
and forth to make these kinks,
but they also fold up and
down and twist into tornadoes,
blowing and sucking at the land.
In turbulent zones, the
downdrafts form cyclones
that are often stretched out-of-round into
oval, polygonal, and U-shaped structures.
The winds are electric currents, so these
turbulent kinks are semi-steady-state
keep their form for a
long time, molding the land.
Downdraft turbulence also means
there is updraft turbulence.
So next to downdraft craters in Mexico
are mountains formed by updrafts.
An updraft wind will create a
dome or ridge of layered deposit
with a rim around it also,
but the inflow to the updraft leaves the
triangular buttresses from shockwaves
on the outside of the
mountain, pointing inward.
The updrafts deposit linear
and lobe shaped mountains
around and between
the downdraft craters.
The turbulence is
in a shear zone,
so deposits occur in narrow
lanes between conflicting winds.
Updraft deposits are composed
of more material than craters
and have the triangular patterns of
shock wave reflections on the flanks.
As it relates to
clouds on Jupiter,
a long, rising column, like the one highlighted
here, would create such linear mountains.
One can see the dark depths of the hole in the
clouds from which the updraft column rises.
The winds roll upward
from the ground
and curl over, leaving a broom-swept
linear ridge on the land below.
The turbulent kinks
are fractal forms,
so taking another
step back in altitude
reveals the fractal clab-claw
shape emerging at a larger scale.
The smaller feature with
the crater shown above
is nested within this larger repetition
of the wind pattern shown next,
aligned along the same axis.
Nested fractals are very evident
in Jupiter's clouds as well.
The similarity between Mexico's
mountains and Jupiter's clouds
is due to capacitance in
the planetary circuits.
The strongest winds are vertical
winds driven by the electric field.
Following is a sample of images taken
from the southern leg of storm centers
that molded South America,
Australia, Africa, and Eurasia.
The winds pushed and pulled on
the land with electric force,
literally molding it from wind action
above and volcanic action below.
The fluid shapes are a dead giveaway
for magneto-hydro-dynamic forces.
But deeper levels of
evidence are there,
in Mach speed sonic shock effects,
arcing effects, and sputtering effects
that provide a holistic electric
picture of everything that was happening.
Look close at the following images
and note patterns of stratification
and liquid deformation evident
from waves of heat and pressure.
Turbulent winds lifting off the land, arcing
across the sky, and returning in downdrafts
were filaments of plasma that varied
in charge density in cross-section too.
Take note how a tornado
is a coaxial circuit
with the outer wall of the tube being
the fastest, most dusty region,
and the inner core
often a clear draft.
The plasma filaments
of primordial storms
varied in dust content, charge density,
and velocity in cross-section as well.
The result is stratification
of mineral deposits vertically,
where the rock morphology
and mineral composition
discretely change from
the core of the feature,
to the walls of the feature and
then to the outer surroundings.
It's a coaxial arrangement.
The following images show where the
storm pulsed and ebbed with current,
stratifying these layers of dust with
different composition from the inside-out,
where the coaxial up-and-down draft
winds created domes and craters.
Layerings of varying mineral
composition are particularly evident
where winds abruptly changed direction, from
horizontal to vertical at the rim of craters
and the buttress
flanks of mountains.
There, charge densities
in the shockwaves
and the effects of magnetic
pinch were the greatest.
The stratification of species
within the electric winds of Jupiter
matches the pattern of stratification
in landforms here on earth.
They are coherently layered from the
inside-out of each turbulent kink, or vortex,
unmixed by the turbulence,
in accordance with charge densities in
currents that are primarily moving up and down.
That electromagnetic fields
sort species and recombine them
is predicted behavior in plasma.
We use a multitude of techniques
in manufacturing based on this fact.
Different materials respond
to magnetic fields differently.
The electric field responds
to charge density
so shapes itself around conductive
flows of material and vice-versa.
The result is stratification, and it's apparent
the stratification in Earth's landscapes
matches the stratification
in Jupiter's winds.
Some mountains do not conform
to the wind-blown dune shape,
exhibiting triangular buttresses
on both flanks of the mountain,
or not conforming to the
windward/leeward angle of slope.
This doesn't mean
they're not dunes,
but indicates they were formed
subject to shifting, or competing winds.
In some cases, mountains
formed as sastrugi,
or linear deposits
parallel to the wind
in the shear zone between channels
of wind of different velocity.
So, it's possible by looking at
the land to deduce wind patterns.
Following this method of
identifying wind direction
from triangular buttresses in the mountain
ranges and craters that are formed,
the next image shows
the Colorado Plateau
with wind formed pressure
ridges annotated by blue lines.
These are pressure ridges
formed perpendicular to the wind.
Each line is drawn parallel
to a pressure ridge,
and perpendicular hash marks
indicate the wind direction.
The red lines on the map indicate pressure
ridges formed parallel to the wind,
at shear zones between
the conflicting winds.
This map provides one layer
of dimension to the storm,
the dimension of
ground level winds.
But to add another layer, we can
look at the domes and craters
that formed by updraft
and downdraft winds.
The red areas on this map are
updrafts, the yellow are downdrafts,
and blue are
precipitation footprints.
Adding this layer of information
to the map of pressure ridges
produces a wind map of
the Colorado Plateau
and the Rocky Mountains
that looks like this.
Now to describe this storm.
There are two jet streams coming to
the Colorado Plateau from the north.
One poured through the Snake River
Valley, arcing east towards Yellowstone.
The other jet stream
swept into the Great Basin
rippling Nevada with rows
of windblown mountains.
There's an S-shaped range in central
Nevada that defines a center of rotation,
as this mesocyclone scraped the
ground like one incredible tornado.
It down-drafted into two streams.
One pressing down on the
Unita Valley in Utah,
and the other sweeping northern Arizona
forming much of the Mogollon Rim.
The Great Basin storm
also spun air south,
bypassing the rotation to help define
the Sierra Mountain arc,
and scoured the Owens,
Amorgosa, and Death Valley.
The Sierras were formed by winds from
the west (not shown here on the map)
which pressed against
the Great Basin rotation
as the winds bypass south.
From the south, winds collected and
then split, forming the Mexican Kink
and the El Guaje mountain.
They reformed in a ground-hugging
laminar flow near Four Corners,
sweeping across Colorado,
Utah, and northern Arizona,
laying the foundations
of the Colorado Plateau.
The southern wind fed a multi-
vortex cyclone over the plateau,
where it divided its path to
feed thunderstorm updrafts.
These winds threaded up and back down
through mesocyclone-cyclone pairs
in looping currents
like lacing a shoe.
The updrafts are defined
by San Rafael Swell in Utah
and Monument Valley and
Black Mesa in Arizona.
Winds from the south also circulated
to the east over the Great Plains
to be sucked into the
cyclone through thunderstorms
that built the eastern
face of the Rockies.
These down-drafted, forming
huge craters in the mountains,
like San Luis Valley in Colorado.
Each of these features -- the
Great Basin mesocyclone,
the multi-vortex cyclone
over the Colorado Plateau
with arching colonnades of
mesocyclone-cyclone pairs
can be identified in the
Great Red Spot on Jupiter.
It's because the shapes
and actions of the wind
are driven by the fractal process of
charge diffusion in the planetary circuit.
The difference in chemistry and
thermodynamics of Jupiter's atmosphere
compared to Earth's doesn't
make much difference,
because circuits are the
forcing mechanism of nature.
So this completes the view of
winds at the very eye of the storm.
The Colorado Plateau received the
hottest plasma torching in North America.
Surrounding areas were also ravaged
by storm but none so severely.
In fact, the whole Earth
was wrapped in storms.
So, we'll look closer at
some of those regions,
as well as more details on North
America in the next installment.
Thank you!

The Electric Universe
-- Why Should I Care? --
Many people today are asking,
what has happened to science?
Early in the space age, a
President inspired a nation
to put a man on the moon within
the span of a single decade.
"We choose to go to the moon in
this decade and do the other things..."
But where's that sense
of new frontiers today?
The passion for discovery?
For youngsters, it seems
science has lost its meaning.
Meaning comes from the
things that we value,
and what is the
value of discovery?
How could we lose
interest in that?
We've invited disinterest
in science by our claims
to already know the important
questions and their answers.
Just look at the picture given
in the scientific media.
All the great mysteries
have already been solved.
How the universe began.
How gravity drove everything
across billions of years,
the birth and death of stars,
our Sun emerging from
a gaseous cloud,
planets on predictable
courses for a billion years.
And a thousand other settled
questions, or so we're told.
Well, here's a surprise;
our universe is electric.
It's animated by charged
particles in motion.
The electrically sterile cosmos we
so long imagined does not exist.
The Electric Universe will
re-inspire education and science.
Electricity will open new
pathways of discovery,
a new picture of galaxies, and all the
stars in the sky, our Sun included.
Every organism will
come alive electrically,
and we will begin to remember
the electrical dramas
in the sky above our
early forebears.
Take the time to discover
this for yourself.
A profound scientific
revolution is already underway.

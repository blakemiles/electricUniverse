Standard geology tells us that the
Earth and the life that inhabits it
has changed incrementally over eons
of time, for many millions of years.
The process is thought to have shaped our
planet's landscape, our wind and water erosion,
volcanism, earthquakes and
random bombardments from space.
Of course, a guide that scientists use
to determine when a life form existed
and how it evolved is
the fossil record.
Conventional theory tells us that
the process of fossilization
takes no fewer
than 10,000 years.
But countless archaeological findings
suggest a "radical alternative",
that the remains of some
animals and other organisms
were fossilized not over eons
of time but instantaneously.
In part 1 of this two-part presentation,
Australian archaeologist Peter Mungo Jupp
will present his case for the instant
petrification of organisms on Earth
by powerful electrical
discharges.
Electric fossilization.
Now, living plants and animals
are petrified into solid rock
in a violent paroxism of nature.
Their ends... what, agonizing or instantaneous
as witnessed by their contorted forms.
Now let's look at some examples.
Now, we go to Lesbos and there's
huge trees turned to solid stone
while they still point
to the heavens.
Giant squid-like shell
ammonites glare up at us
through translucent limestone rock
where they lie entombed on a beach
along the Jurassic coast
in England, another example.
And then we go to Hot Springs, South
Dakota, there's gigantic mammoths
converted to limestone in a
huge bolus of flora and fauna.
And perhaps the strangest
of all, petrified crabs
centered in spherical
basalt bowl jars.
Washington state.
Now what do these petrified
fossils have in common?
Their end was dramatic
and instantaneous.
But the unanswered question,
what pungent force of nature
changed their chemical composition
in their death throws?
Now, conventional geology has
time as its slowly moving tool
that bleached their bodies and replaced
the carbon with silicon and calcium.
But the rapid decay
of biological matter
makes a nonsense of this theory,
what then is the answer?
Let's go outside the scientific
square to start with.
Let's track back to those who
observed something deeply dramatic
that may hold the key to
this fossil forming event.
Native American mythology
is being held up
as a witness to catastrophic
mass destruction in modern times
by the foundational paleontologist Georges
Cuvier, writing some 200 years ago.
He recorded much of their mythology
around the destruction of the megafauna
and used it as evidence of the many mass
extinctions that have occurred on Earth.
Importantly, American
writer Adrienne Mayor
recognized the similarity in this destructive
mythological war of the thundergods
against the sea monsters.
She advocates for the use of
the celestial thunderbolt
as the weapon of choice in
this megafaunal destruction.
Now, I'm going to read an
example from the Lakota Nation
and, as cited by . . . ,
just bear with me as I read it.
This is a quote from
their mythology:
"Their Creator sang the song of destruction,
and sent down fierce thunderbirds to wage
a great battle against the other
humans and giant animals.
Finally, at the
height of the battle,
the thunderbirds suddenly threw down their
most powerful thunderbolts all at once.
The fiery blasts shook the entire
world, toppling mountain ranges
and setting forests
and prairies ablaze.
The flames let up in the
sky in all directions.
The world's lakes boiled, and the
giant animals and evil people
burned up where they stood.
The Earth split open, sending great
torrents across the entire world.
The survivors found the bleached bones
of the giant animals buried in mud
and rock all over the world."
Now backing up these you've got
Hesiod and the ancient Greek
writing about the Gorgons and they are
specifically responsible for petrification.
OK now, so where do
we go from here?
If we're to believe these bizarre
tales we've recognized in many myths
as the cosmic thunderbolt, backed up
by plasma physicist Anthony Peratt
who's an advocate of giant plasma
discharges that shaped history
and as is Rens van der Sluijs
and his study in mythhology
for instance in his
thunderbolts of Zeus,
hitting down upon the
earth, and changing it,
but can these thunderbolts or plasma
discharges produce petrification,
turning living tissues to rock?
Now I just want to pause a second.
We've got a...
Notice the difference between
fossilization and petrification!
Fossilization is the preservation of
tissue, such occurs in fossils
buried in coal like in Antarctica,
Alaska and Siberia,
oil, such is La Brea Tar
Pits outside Los Angeles,
peat, for instance mammoths
buried in Snowmass, Colorado;
whereas petrification
is a subset,
where the original carbon rich
material is either replaced
or transmuted to different compounds
such as silicon or calcium.
In other words, rock.
Now while fossilization generally is
undoubtedly the result of cataclysmic events,
the burial of fauna and
flora in Alaska mud,
petrification would seem to magnify
the catastrophic event to actually
transmute elements
and compounds.
I suspect this is the result of
powerful electromagnetic forces
that happen to centralize
in a chosen area.
Not necessarily continent wide
as the catastrophism tells.
But I'm going into detail
of this in another episode.
But what evidence do we have
that electrical phenomena
can cause elements to transmute to
another form e.g. water to calcium?
What tool of nature fossilized these
once watery marine ammonites?
We have a powerful clue.
Now, this is a formational
study, done by Eric Milton.
He described examinations
of petrified tree trunk,
essentially water and
carbon, in Alberta, Canada.
And I'll quote him, "The piece (this is
the wood) was pure clear silica inside,
it was coated with a rougher opaque
crust of partially fused sand.
The tree, whose stump was petrified,
was alive five years ago!
After the tree was cut down to
accomodate the right of way for a new
power transmission line, an accidental
break allowed the live high-voltage wire
to contact several tree
stumps still in the ground.
The power was cut off
within hours of the break.
All of the tree roots which contacted
the broken wire were fossilized."
All these extremes of electricity
can metamorphize matter quickly.
As much as we stretch our
credibility to explain
fossilization and petrification
of watery living animals,
there is a bigger question:
What about the medium these
very animals are preserved in?
Let's examine a couple
of these cases.
Now, I went to Hotsprings in South
Dakota, talked to Dr. Larry Agenbroad.
He explained to me, the mammoths
themselves are barely distinguishable
from the medium
they're immersed in.
All calcium carbonate.
And this is huge bolus, which is
amazing to see, not just mammoths
but short-faced bear,
camels, all sorts of things
in this huge bolus about 100 feet
across, and about 90 feet deep.
This is a huge bolus and
this is all calcium,
and fascinatingly although Larry
himself believes the mammoths
fell into the water and
gradually were petrified.
In actual fact, when you
examine the digging, says,
thousands of little subsets
going right through the area,
these are layers and you wonder
what caused these layers,
is this perhaps an electrical efffect
and I suspect it probably is.
So that's one.
Was the water there possibly
turned to calcium carbonate?
You know, I've started
with the example of H₂0
which is 2 protons of hydrogen and 8
protons of oxygen making 10 in all.
Whereas calcium carbonate is
50 or 5 times that number.
Could some agency change so all
you need is additional neutrons.
And as we know from Russian studies,
whenever there's a major lightning strike,
neutrons are in abundance everywhere for
some strange reason we don't know why.

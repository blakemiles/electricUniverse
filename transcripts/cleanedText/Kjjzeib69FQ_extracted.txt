We have explored the current crisis in
cosmology and what it means to have a
revolutionary shift, or change in cosmology.
Now let's step back and explore why
cosmology matters in the first place.
Why does cosmology matter beyond science
and to non-scientists? And, how 
does cosmology impact everyday life?
We know that the study of the
universe is important to science, but
cosmology has impacts far beyond science
and has a significant cultural component.
Cosmology has impacted everything from
anthropology and art to philosophy,
morality, religion, and even politics.
Cosmology also impacts our worldview and
how we view ourselves in the world.
Historically, changes in cosmology have
precipitated tectonic cultural and
ideological shifts that have shaped, and
defined, the course of history. But 
the relationship between cosmology
and culture is not unidirectional. It is
far more nuanced than that. Cosmological
shifts are also a product of their time
and often grow out of, and/or reinforce
philosophical and socio-political
settings that benefit from, or exploit
the ideas promoted and reflected in a new cosmology.
Let's look at these points in greater detail.
Changes in cosmology can have tectonic
ripple effects that influence the course
of history. A classic example is Galileo
and the Copernican Revolution and the
shift from the geocentric to the
heliocentric model of cosmology.
This shift was so profound that it
sparked a Scientific Revolution. But it
also had profound consequences beyond
science, as the educational director of
the Italian consulate in the United
States explains.  Quote, “Galileo's ideas
not only sparked a scientific revolution,
they initiated a large-scale revolution
in human thinking. He changed the way
we see the world and, more importantly,
how we perceive ourselves
within it.” End quote.
The shift from an Earth-centric to a
Sun-centric view of the cosmos, created
an historic opportunity to unseat the
power of the church and eventually led
to what has been described as, quote, 
“...the most important idea in modern history...
The idea that any person, regardless 
of his or her individual characteristics,
can seek and find the truth.” This 
meant that the catholic church and
clergy were no longer the sole
investigators and arbiters of the truth.
Putting knowledge within reach of the
individual and human deduction was a
revolution in human thinking, one that landed
Galileo in deep trouble with the church.
However, the human mind as important and
worthy of contemplation is an idea that
predates Galileo, going back to Greek philosophy.
When Socrates spoke of the need to know
thyself, he shifted the emphasis of the
contemporary philosophy from nature to humans.
Promoting this type of thinking,
eventually got him executed for atheism.
Thus, Galileo fared far better than
his philosophical predecessors.
This may be due to the environment
in which Galileo's ideas emerged.
Galileo's discoveries were bolstered by,
and reinforced, renaissance humanism,
a philosophy that prioritizes 
and glorifies the potential of the
individual and the human mind, especially
in the areas of creativity and the arts.
Power structures tend to prop up, or
support, the cosmological trends and
tenets that serve larger pre-
existing notions and agendas.
While Galileo was condemned by the
church, he was also backed by certain
segments of the aristocracy.
Specifically, he had the patronage of
Lord del Monte, a nobleman and author
of several important works on mechanics.
The Scientific Revolution helped bring
the fruits of humanism into the realm of
politics. It shifted ultimate political
power from the church to the monarchy,
which was good news for monarchs and the
nobility who could now rule without the
blessing or approval of the church.
But the monarchy supremacy was
short-lived, as notions of human
importance and self-actualization led
individuals to question the absolute
dominance of monarchs and rise up
throughout history, most notably during
the Enlightenment in a manner that
eventually gave rise to republics, the nation-
state and modern-day concepts of democracy.
Overall, Galileo's ideas reinforced and
furthered, the tide of humanism and were
beneficial to opponents of the absolute
power of the church and later on, the
absolute power of monarchs.
Beyond politics, the technological
advancements of the Scientific
Revolution also shaped economics and
labor, moving the west from a feudal
system to economies that are or were
industrial and factory-based.
It has been noted that quote
“...the Scientific Revolution lit a path that,
centuries later, with the help of a lot
of steam and coal power, money, and labor,
led to the Industrial Revolution.” End quote.
This triggered the necessary
socio-cultural shift from a
predominantly rural population to an
increasingly urbanized one. Galileo's
impact also affected and reinforced trends in
the arts. His influence reaffirmed and expanded
upon, the work and focus of renaissance
artists of his time, who were obsessed
with representing man, and nature, as 
geometrically accurate and realistic as possible.
Despite the vast cultural and
technological impacts, for many,
the most profound impact of the scientific
revolution, was how it helped shape our
understanding of what it means to be human.
Implied in the Scientific Revolution is
the recognition that individuals matter
and can think for themselves. This
is arguably the underlying tenet of
the Enlightenment or Age of Reason,
that humankind is a rational thinking
being capable of arriving at truth and
therefore, enlightenment. Central 
to enlightenment thought were,
quote,”... the use and celebration of reason--
the power by which humans understand the
universe and improve their own condition.”
Implied in this belief is a view of the
universe as reasonable and understandable.
For, how can humans apply reason to
understand a universe that is not
reasonable or comprehensible?
Enlightenment thinkers in England, France
and throughout Europe, shared the common
enlightenment themes of rational questioning
and a belief in progress through dialogue.
One can imagine how these notions would
benefit and be bolstered by powerful or
influential individuals that favored
republics and parliamentary forms of
governance, since these are characterized
by dialogue and cooperation between and
among the people and/or their representatives.
This is an example of the nuanced
relationship between cosmology and
culture, which can be described as a
feedback loop, wherein sociocultural
powers tend to adopt, and then promote,
those parts of cosmology that can shape
and influence present and/or future
outcomes and behavior. Relativism 
is another modern-day example.
While much has been noted about
Einstein's Theory of Relativity and its
influence on relativism, relativism as an
idea, goes back to the ancient world.
Though it did not gain favor in ancient
times and was refuted by philosophers
such as Plato, arguments for relativism
have existed throughout history.
Moreover, there is presently no
philosophical consensus on what
Relativism actually means. Relativism 
as I use it here, refers to the doctrine
that knowledge, truth and
morality are not absolute. Known
respectively as epistemological, or 
cognitive relativism and moral relativism.
I believe that it was not until
contemporary powers and interests in
politics, academia and/or economics had a
need for, and could benefit from, moral
and cognitive relativism, that relativism was fully
promoted and normalized in the popular culture.
Einstein and his Special Theory of Relativity
provided a good opportunity and catalyst for this.
Reinforced by the Theory of Relativity,
relativism eventually impacted art,
philosophy and modern culture,
influencing an/or engendering
everything from abstract cubist art to
postmodern theory and identity politics.
As noted in an article in the Stanford
Encyclopedia of Philosophy quote,
”...the popularity of the very idea of
relativism in the 20th century owes
something to Einstein’s Special Theory
of Relativity, which was to be used both
as model and as well as a vindication for
various relativistic claims.” End quote.
that article points to Gilbert Harman as
one of the contemporary philosophers to
use Einsteinian relativity as a model
for philosophical versions of relativism.
Harman has stated that quote,
”According to Einstein’s Theory of
Relativity even an object's mass is
relative to a choice of spatio-temporal
framework.... I'm going to argue for a
similar claim about moral right and wrong....
I'm going to argue that moral right and wrong....
are always relative to a choice of moral framework.”
End quote. It is interesting to note that
Harman wrote this in 1996, which is several
decades after Einstein and curiously
only a few years before identity
politics began to gain serious and
ubiquitous momentum as well as the
support of the establishment in the West.
The 2000’s witnessed the rise of identity
politics which is grounded in
post-modern notions of relativism and
the replacement of traditional forms of
left-wing opposition with identity-based
movements which are often
sympathetic to the establishment.
Under identity politics, relativism is
exploited to fragment, dilute and/or
diffuse, political opposition 
and ultimately, to serve power.
Let's take a closer look at relativism.
Epistemological relativism espouses the
idea that there is no absolute truth to be
had, since all truth is relative. Similarly,
moral relativism holds that morality,
right and wrong, good and bad, is also
relative and varies from person to person.
Such notions fly in the face of the
Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment
era's emphasis on the ability of the
rational individual to seek and find Truth, with a
capital T. Prior to relativism, philosophers argued
that there was an absolute truth and an
absolute way of approaching various
aspects of life, especially with respect
to morality and moral obligations.
Moral relativism creates a philosophical
slippery slope that can arguably be
exploited, or abused, especially by those with
power. If there is no such thing as an absolute
right and wrong, then we are powerless
to point out and confront the wrongs of
those with power, since everything
is relative. In other words,
arguing that there is no such thing as
absolute right and wrong, alleviates
wrongdoers, big or small, from responsibility
and accountability for wrongdoing.
How convenient for the wrongdoer.
Einstein was not a moral relativist and
even recoiled at the misappropriation and
misapplication of his theory in the non-sciences.
As Einstein’s most prominent biographer has
observed, quote, ”In both his science and his moral
philosophy, Einstein was driven by a quest
for certainty and deterministic laws.
If his theory of relativity produced
ripples that unsettled the realms of
morality and culture, this was not caused
by what Einstein believed but by how he
was popularly interpreted.” End quote.
Similarly, the Stanford Encyclopedia of
Philosophy states, quote,
”It is...worth noting that Einstein did not
think that the Theory of Relativity
supported relativism in ethics or
epistemology because, although in his
model simultaneity and sameness of place
are relative to reference frames, the
physical laws expressing such relativity
are constant and universal and hence
in no sense relative.” End quote.
It seems that Einstein's Theory of
Relativity and by extension, contemporary
cosmology, was misappropriated and
misapplied in a manner that supports
moral and cognitive relativism and the
host of non-scientific or non-empirical
interests they could potentially serve. A
common criticism against epistemological
relativism is that semantically,
it contradicts or refutes itself.
The statement, “all is relative,” holds
itself to be absolute, therefore
contradicting its original
premise that all is relative.
Put another way, if the statement “all
is relative” is an absolute, then this
contradicts relativism. And if 
the statement is relative, then it
does not have to be, or cannot be, accepted 
as true. For this, many view relativism as a
paradox. I believe paradox may be a contemporary
motivation for the misapplication of Einstein.
In Western culture, paradox is 
increasingly presented as a good
thing and is even celebrated and
promoted in all areas of life, using
science and cosmology as a justification for such
arguments. For instance in a 2020 article entitled,
”Think Like Einstein: The Paradox Mindset”,
the author notes that Einstein was used
to conceiving and embracing opposite or
contradictory ideas and that many Nobel
prize-winning scientists are known to actively
conceive multiple opposites simultaneously.
Describing this as a paradox mindset, the
author encourages readers to do the same,
arguing that quote, “Embracing
contradictory ideas is one of the main
assets for raising creativity and
is a better way forward.” End quote.
The author concludes that strangeness is a good
thing which ought to be embraced in the workplace.
Similarly, in a 2020 BBC article on work
culture, the author argues that the
paradox mindset is the key to success
in the workforce stating that quote,
”Although paradoxes often trip us up,
embracing contradictory ideas may
actually be the secret to creativity
and leadership.” End quote.
And in a talk at the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences of the
United States of America, scholars argued
that the key to promoting peacemaking
and peaceful intervention overseas is
paradoxical thinking which they define as quote,
”...information that is inconsistent with held
beliefs, and raises the sense of absurdity.”
End quote. It is strange
and perhaps disheartening
to see paradox promoted as a good
thing in the world of politics and
peacekeeping. It is also odd to see
politics discussed at the National
Academy of Science. This 
brings us back to earlier
discussions about science and cosmology
being used to justify larger and or
pre-existing interests and agendas. It 
also harkens back to what Thomas Kuhn
implied about institutionalized science;
that it is hegemonic and functions much
like other institutions of power, such as
religion or politics or, in the service of power.
Promoting paradox and absurdity in
politics and political intervention may
be a way to disguise or preserve empire
and political hegemony. Not least by
framing inconsistency in absurdity
as positive political strategy.
Rhetoric about the benefits of paradox
in politics and the workplace is
somewhat evocative of that found in
media articles on contemporary cosmology,
which embrace and celebrate cosmological
weirdness and paradox rather than
problematizing it. As I note in a
previous show, the increasing focus in
mainstream media on the strange and
wacky universe presents cosmic weirdness
and contradiction as something that is
matter-of-fact and non-problematic.
Basically, the universe is a weird and
unknowable place and that's okay because
the universe does not have to make sense.
If that's the case, then contemporary
cosmology has failed us. For what good
are science and empirical observation
and analysis if they cannot give us answers?
Rather than admit the failure or inability
of contemporary cosmology to
provide answers and explanations,
mainstream science and mainstream media
increasingly blame the failure on, or
hide the failure behind, the strangeness of the
universe. This suggests that mainstream cosmology
is not actually interested in giving us answers.
It also confirms what Thomas Kuhn
believed about dominant or normal
science. That it is hegemonic, dogmatic,
and unyielding to falsification and change.
At the sociocultural level, the promotion
of a paradox mindset could be
interpreted as giving people permission
to act inconsistently, unpredictably,
contradictory and/or without integrity.
Rather than admit that systems or
policies may be failing or contradictory,
failure and contradiction can simply be
repackaged as normal and acceptable, just
as it is in cosmology. In terms of dominant
discourse, this potentially opens the door to and/or
justifies inconsistent, contradictory and
deceptive discourse and narratives.
As an aside, it is important to note that
the paradox rationale is a tool that can
only fully be exploited by those in a
position of power. For if the average
person on the street tried to argue in
court that the law is relative or could
be interpreted in a contradictory manner,
it probably would not go very well for them.
In closing, everything we discussed drives home
just how influential cosmology is beyond the
sciences, and how much it shapes and impacts
the broader culture and human thinking.
Cosmology and changes in cosmology have
shaped and or fostered everything from
the Scientific Revolution, to 
present-day forms of governance,
industry, philosophy, and morality.
With respect to the most recent sea
change in cosmology, that of Relativity
and the Big Bang, theories and
innovations in cosmology were
misappropriated and misapplied by
thinkers in the non-sciences in a manner
that gave rise to various notions of
relativism and eventually fostered a
culture and worldview that embraces,
celebrates, and promotes paradox,
contradiction, and absurdity.
This is a stark contrast to the Enlightenment's
obsession with reason and rational thinking.
We have been educated with clear
evidence that cosmology is presently in
a state of crisis and is inevitably
heading towards revolution.
Given that reality, our next logical
step will be to explore what a future
cosmology might look like, and how it will
impact the broader culture and human thinking.

As you can imagine
there's a lot to be said
about how do you form a
shish kebob of planets
and how do you capture
a star, a passing star.
So this is going to be
a race against time.
...the clicker
we have
now here it is, yep yep...
we have the new
less modest lectern
THE STAR 'PROTO-SATURN'
This is Saturn before it became a gas
giant planet in the solar system.
And this is a quote
from Roger Wescott,
the late Roger Wescott who
was a good friend and
used to come to the Kronia conferences
and actually spoke at one or two,
"Pre-history was a
dream turned nightmare.
Mankind forgot the dream
because it was too remote
and the nightmare because
it was too shocking.
The prehistory that we have confabulated,
however, is too bland to be believed."
He was a professor of anthropology
and linguistics at Drew University,
Madison, New Jersey.
What does the star
Proto-Saturn mean?
It means a star became the gas
giant we now call Saturn.
This claim is outrageous according
to present-day cosmology
and our understanding of stars
but it is supported by
lifetimes of forensic research
into the earliest recorded
memories of mankind
and it is confirmed by the recognition
of global prehistoric petroglyphs
as representations of the many
distinctive forms of plasma instability
seen in the highest energy
electrical discharges.
It has become crystal clear
that the legendary Thunderbolts
of the planetary gods were real
and they accompanied a major recent
disturbance of the solar system
but perhaps the greatest
puzzle for scholars
has been the references to
Saturn as the first Sun
and in my home in Australia
the original inhabitants
have legends of a time
when there were two suns,
a greater and a lesser Sun.
Details in their Dreamtime
Stories have no reference points
other than in high-energy
plasma experiments.
They were not dreaming!
My concern since I became
aware of this evidence
has been to make classical physics
sense of Saturn as a star
and to understand the
sequence of events
that led to the seemingly peaceful
solar system we see today.
So we have these big questions;
Do we really have a 4.6 billion
year old clockwork solar system?
How do planets form?
...I beg your pardon...
How do planets form?
How did the atmosphere
and ocean form?
Was the past like the present?
And I think from the
evidence that you've seen
that Dave Talbot and Ev
Cochran have provided,
it certainly wasn't
anything like the present.
So if Saturn was a star
within the memory of mankind,
it throws some big questions
into sharp relief
and in doing so it
throws a harsh light on
to our self-satisfying fictional story
of the earth and the solar system.
The Origin of the Solar System
Professor William McRae wrote;
It is impossible to discover
the origin of the solar system
by observing it now and working
steadily backwards in time
in order to infer the
whole of its past history.
The solar nebula model has no
successful predictions to its name!
That's a bit of a
sobering thought.
The... Here we go, yeah.
My meeting with Dr. Velikovsky
I visited him in 1979 at his
home in Princeton, New Jersey,
he very gracefully accepted
my family as well,
I've got photos of my daughters
with him but none with me,
I was rather shy of
asking him for a photo.
But the main question then was this
problem that he faced with astronomers.
What don't we know about gravity, there's
something really missing in our physics.
Velikovsky argued that planets
change orbits, exchange Thunderbolts
and quickly settle
into peaceful orbits.
Rapid settling following chaos defies our
understanding of gravitational systems
which for more than a two-body
system are chaotic as I said.
If one planet departs from its
normal orbit by a small amount,
it will affect the others and there's no
way of restoring the original situation,
the system flies apart.
Our understanding of gravity and solar
system mechanics is inadequate.
So we have a new cosmology.
A new forensic approach to old evidence
produced the recent history of the solar system
that requires a critical
examination of modern science
instead of dogmatic
rejection of evidence.
The result is an
entirely new cosmology,
the Electric Universe.
The history of this new
cosmological paradigm
goes back to 'Worlds
in Collision' in 1950.
In the last chapter Velikovsky referred
to Jupiter and Saturn as stars.
And I quote,
"There I wrote with respect to
the future that some dark star
like Jupiter or Saturn may
be in the path of the Sun
and may be attracted to the
system and cause havoc in it."
That was in chapter 9, The end.
Worlds in Collision comprises only
the last two acts of a cosmic drama,
wrote Velikovsky in Kronos
volume 5 number 1 in 1979.
That's the Kronos issue there.
And then we have David Talbott's
remarkable reconstruction
of the earlier acts in
our prehistoric skies
that was published in 1980.
Then in Aeon vol 5
number 5 in January 2000,
I first published my physical model of
Earth's relationship to the Dark Star
dubbed Proto-Saturn
in Stars in an Electric Universe.
It had appeared earlier
on my website as
Other Stars Other Worlds
Other Life in December 1999.
And then we have all the
books by Dwardu Cardona
and they're all there,
God Star published 2006,
Metamorphic Star 2008,
Primordial Star 2009,
Flare Star 2011.
So the evidential history is;
Earth and Mars were satellites
orbiting a brown dwarf star;
It was a very hospitable
environment for life;
Atmosphere, water and minerals
were deposited on the satellites;
The system changed spectacularly
on encountering the Sun;
The brown dwarf flared and
ejected a new satellite;
An axial column of
satellites was formed;
And intense plasma discharge
phenomena were observed.
The terms giant and dwarf
applied to stars are misleading.
That is calculated on the
standard model of the Sun
And the notion of a star's age based
on its appearance or spectrum
has no validity for
the same reason.
Stars on the main sequence
may be characterized
as self-regulating cosmic
power transformers,
as I spoke about this morning,
that focus diffuse galactic
electrical energy to catalyze fusion
in their photospheres to
provide radiant energy.
Like the Sun, such stars
derive their luminosity
from very bright anode tufts
in their plasma sheaths.
Moving diagonally upward to the
right, the current density increases.
Anode tufting becomes more crowded
and their mutual repulsion
forces the photosphere to
grow to accommodate them.
At the top right of the main
sequence the light from those Tufts
is electric blue of a true arc
and the stars appear
as blue giants,
intensely hot objects appearing
considerably larger than our Sun.
As you might expect, blue giants tend
to be concentrated on the central axes
of our galaxy's
spiral arm discharges.
Red stars must collect
more electrons
than the plasma can deliver
continuously to its surface.
So bright anode tufts
are unnecessary.
The anode expands instead by forming
a negative space charge sheath
and as that sheath expands its
electric field grows stronger.
Electrons caught up in the field are
accelerated to ever greater energies
and before long they become energetic
enough to excite neutral particles
they collide with in the outer sheath
to take on a uniform red glow.
A white dwarf is a star
whose discharge current
is satisfied by all the
approaching electrons,
drift electrons plus those those
randomly move towards the anode.
It has no anode tufting.
It is rather like moving a low-energy
corona of a main-sequence star
down into the atmosphere
of the white dwarf star.
That's why the star, that the dim star Sirius
B is brighter in X-rays than Sirius A
because the corona emits X-rays.
So what is a brown dwarf?
To summarize, a red or brown
dwarf can be characterized
as an independent gas
giant type object
under low electrical stress
from its galactic environment.
A main-sequence star is
electrically stressed
so it resorts to
becoming a tufted anode
which, as I said, regulates
the output of the star,
this is why most, all bright
stars appear to twinkle.
They don't change
from day to day.
Red Giants are normal stars under
low electrical stress.
White Dwarfs are stars with a low
luminosity coronal discharge only.
...was that at the same point...
Red Giant are normal stars and
allow additional stress... and White Dwarfs...
So, size matters.
Brown Dwarfs come with a major
drawback for astronomers,
their stellar radii are hard
to determine accurately.
In the Electric Universe, Brown
Dwarfs are not dwarf stars,
instead all red stars have a bloated glowing
anode sheath which expands and contracts
in order to collect the amount of
electrons required for that discharge.
As the anode sheath grows,
its electric field grows
which results in the prodigious and unexplained
stellar winds from cool red giants.
If the winds were due to the heat of the
corona, then this puts paid to that idea.
In a December 2008 NASA report, the brightness
of a brown dwarf at 17 light years distance
was twice that expected for a brown
dwarf with its particular temperature.
The solution?
The object must have twice
the surface area, they said.
It must be twins.
Such ad hocery is unnecessary
in the Electric Universe model.
A brown dwarf's photosphere
is much larger
than the standard model
of such stars predict.
The Cradle of Life
And this goes back to the idea of the
Garden of Eden period in man's memory.
If you are a satellite orbiting
within that anode glow,
and this is not an
outrageous idea
because astronomers have suggested
the same thing for red giants
that planets could actually
orbit within that star
because the atmosphere
is such low density.
In fact, we orbit in the sun's
atmosphere if you like
and it doesn't cause
us any trouble.
But within that glowing shell,
the radiant energy received from that
envelope is constant over the entire globe.
The light from the plasmasphere
is not reflected light,
it's a radiant energy.
Brown Dwarfs radiate blue
and ultraviolet light,
even though they are cool at
a temperature around 950 K.
This is further evidence that we are looking
at a mix of an electrical red anode glow
and coronal ultraviolet
blue end of the spectrum.
There are no seasons, no
tropics, and no ice caps.
A planet does not
have to rotate.
Its axis can point in any direction,
and its orbit can be eccentric,
and you'll still get this beautiful,
even temperature over the whole body.
The radiant energy
received by the planet
will be strongest at the blue
and red ends of the spectrum
so photosynthesis, which relies on
red light, would be very active.
The sky light would
be a pale purple,
which maybe is referred to by the
classical purple dawn of creation.
And I know that in Canberra we have
this new Arboretum, which is fantastic,
and all of the new trees that are being
planted are put in red plastic to start with.
And I asked the head of the
Arboretum why they did that,
and he said, the plants grow
much better in red light.
Water molecules dominate the
spectra of brown dwarfs.
So you want to know where the
Earth's water came from?
The light on Earth was dim and purplish
amid a continuous mist of water.
No other bodies in the
system were visible.
This is what Dave
mentioned yesterday.
This explains the abundant water on Earth and
many satellites of the gas giant planets
and the rings of Saturn.
And the red light, warmth and water
was ideally suited for giant ferns,
it explains the gigantic lush vegetation
found at the poles fossilized as coal.
Now the problem faced by life
on planets orbiting a red star,
I think you saw last
thing, last night,
which was this flaring red dwarf.
So this tendency to
flare up is a problem.
The reason for this
is that, as I said,
the red stars don't have the current
regulation afforded by the bright photosphere.
So the response of a red star to a sudden
electrical disturbance in their environment
is to shed charged
matter in a flare up.
They may also change
in apparent size
as the anode glow accommodates
to the electrical environment.
I think this would account for the
great dyings in the geological record,
and the episodic deposit of vast sediment
and mineral layers on the earth
and on other bodies too. Every body
that's been looked at is layered.
What's more, it explains for the first
time the oceans of salty water on Earth.
Comets cannot be responsible
because they have little or no water
and little or no sodium chloride.
To see how much of this I want to show
you because we saw this yesterday.
 
This is that, referring to that
superflare you saw yesterday
and you remember the
astrophysicists said,
anyone who was on a
planet orbiting that star
at the time would be
having a very bad day.
I think the Earth has had its bad days, and
they're reflected in the geological record.
 
Mass Extinctions
As I said, those flare-ups
can be so drastic
that it would practically
wipe out the life
on, any existing life on those
satellites of that dwarf star.
This raises an
interesting side issue,
and that is, ironically, intelligent
life can't communicate through
such a plasma shell
using radio waves.
So the lack of intelligible radio signals
in the SETI project is understandable.
In fact, denizens of such worlds would most
likely be unaware of the universe at large.
Now astronomers also submit
that orbiting a red dwarf
is possibly one of the best
places to look for life.
What they've never considered
is orbiting inside a red dwarf.
 
I don't think I'll
talk about this one,
this is a recent report
of a spotty brown dwarf
which suggests there are things
orbiting within that red anode sheath
causing a dimming of the red glow behind
where that satellite happens to be.
They're calling it weather
but of course if it's anode glow
it has nothing to do with weather.
 
So this is a picture of the
Brown Dwarf Proto-Saturn
as I see it. Now there would have been
many more bodies than you see there
but I've included Mars and
Earth and Proto-Saturn
because they're the main
players at this stage.
50% of red dwarfs have Earth-sized planets
in their conventional habitable zone.
This suggests there are a large number
hidden inside the red star's glow
and you can say that too
because our gas giants
all have large numbers of
satellites orbiting quite closely.
But you'll note there is
no Venus at this stage.
Gigantism
It wasn't just pterodactyls that
struggled to get up off the ground.
Scaling of muscle and
bone strengths shows that
dinosaurs could not have raised their
bodies off the ground in today's gravity.
For them to move about, Earth's gravity
needed to be about 1/3rd of today's.
Global extinction and
fossilization requires far more
(pardon me)
than a simple impact
Clearly, we have no understanding
of the cause of gravity.
Is Gravity Electrical?
Gigantism in the animal kingdom
...Sorry, beg your pardon.
The question is of fundamental
importance for cosmology
and our understanding
of the solar system.
And the answer should provide insights
into the demise of the dinosaurs;
the sky our ancestors saw and
why they feared 'doomsday'.
This is the crucial thing, this
is the thing I asked Velikovsky;
What don't we understand
about gravity?
And of course, we're getting confirmation
you'd ever sought from this comet visit
because all the measurements say it
has very low mass, it can't be rock
and I'm saying no, you
don't understand gravity,
it may appear to be of low
density but it's made of rock.
This is the kind of thing that
the Earth would have been,
a situation for the Earth when it was
orbiting Proto-Saturn presumably.
So we get to
Proto-Saturn's Capture.
Capture by the Sun is almost
impossible gravitationally
because there is no energy loss,
there's no way of losing energy,
a body coming in and swinging
around the Sun will depart again
because there's nothing to put the
brakes on and make it go around the Sun.
Electrical capture has a huge
cross-section by comparison.
Two stars will see each
other electrically
once their heliospheres or astrospheres,
as they call generically, touch.
Now the sun's heliosphere is 100
Astronomical Units (AU) in radius,
another star would be
something comparable,
so you're talking about
a huge cross-section.
So the chances of capture of an
object is far greater than gravity
would suggest.
I actually, I'll explain more about this
when I give my presentation on cosmology,
this change in
gravity and so on.
So Proto-Saturn changed
from being a star,
that is an anode in
interstellar space,
to becoming a cathode or cometary
body in the Sun's heliosphere
and, like all cathodes, surface
material is electrically ejected
and the body may fragment under
internal electrical stress.
And this is the kind of thing
which the ancients reported.
As you may expect in the electrical
model, a brown dwarf desert
has been identified close to
bright main sequence stars
because the brown dwarf switches
off, becomes a gas giant
and this is what is
seen by astronomers,
you won't find brown dwarfs
orbiting closely to bright stars.
So gravitational theory only
accommodates accretion disks.
Expulsion disks are
believed impossible
despite the copious evidence of
stars ejecting matter in jets,
even the Sun does it in a modest
coronal mass ejection kind of way.
It's also interesting to
note the large number
of close-orbiting gas
giants about nearby stars.
This fits the electrical fissioning argument
and not the nebular accretion model.
Gas giants have also been discovered
at distances from their stars
where they couldn't have formed
within the age of the star.
All of the impossible planets
and stars being discovered
are not impossible in the
Electric Universe model.
Instead, they are expected
based on that model.
I'll deal with this issue in
my presentation on cosmology.
So it explains why there
are so many hot Jupiters,
have been found closely
orbiting a star and
it explains the expulsion
rings and many satellites
of the gas giant planets
in our solar system.
And the fact that Saturn's
is the most spectacular
indicates that it was
the last or most recent
gas giant to flare
up and eject matter.
Right.
Axial Tilt Families
A simple method of identifying
related objects in the solar system
is to look at their axial tilts
because in the close relationship
between a gas giant or a brown dwarf
and its close orbiting satellites,
there will generally be phase-lock.
The satellites all have the same
face pointing towards the parent.
And as these close orbiting
satellites therefore
will have their rotation
axis aligned with the parent.
Having the same
degree of axial tilt
modified by precession
after disturbance
like the tearing apart
of the Saturnian system,
that tilt to the plane of
their orbits, of the ecliptic,
should be roughly
the same and we can,
this is one way of trying to
identify members of the same family
because the Sun has
an adopted family.
So when you look at the planets here,
you've got Mars and you've got Venus
and you've got Earth and you've
got Saturn, the main players
but Venus is the odd one out.
Because research shows with great certainty
that it was born from Proto-Saturn
in a massive flare up resulting
from the initial adjustment
to the present Sun's quite
different electrical environment
and this is why there were all
those radiating streamers
because it was born as a comet
from an already cometary body,
so the cometary body fissioned and
the resulting ejected body
went into, it was still
captured by its parent
but it too was busily
discharging frantically
trying to adjust to its
electrical environment.
So all the radiating streamers and
the colossal Venus Comet appearances
can be explained by this model.
Now, when Venus was ejecting
material it occurred equatorial,
we were sitting underneath
this chain of objects
and the streamers were coming
out radiating from Venus
and this is actually what
we see on Venus today,
the scars are wrapped
around the equator.
But also when these
bodies are ejected
the main body may be
spinning this way
and the material is
ejected in a stream,
it's given a backward
kick by its parent
and the result is that
the satellite initially,
at least, has a backward rotation
and this is what Venus has,
very slow backward rotation.
It had no time before the
system was totally disrupted
to achieve phase lock
with Proto-Saturn.
So we look at Saturn.
In June 2004, the Electric
Universe was the only model
to predict the surface features
of smog shrouded Titan.
Titan, being a huge moon which
would be classed as a planet
if it was separate from Saturn.
These surface features were predicted
before they were revealed in detail
by the Huygens probe from
the Cassini spacecraft.
In "Cassini's Homecoming" I wrote,
"A scenario follows that is so alien to any
conventional theory of Saturn's history
but should be easily tested against
information gained from the Cassini mission.
It shows striking connections between many
seemingly unrelated facts about certain planets."
That is something that conventional cosmogony
or cosmology has not been able to do.
Until recently, Saturn was an
independent brown dwarf star
with his own entourage of
close orbiting small planets
and Dave Talbott alluded
to those last night
with the circling
objects around the god,
the god Saturn.
The tilt of Saturn at 27 degrees to the
ecliptic plane is itself an enigma
unless it formed
independently from the Sun
and the axial tilts of Saturn,
Earth and Mars are very similar.
Are we on the same page?
No, let me catch up.
The Titan is very
important to study
because it may be a sibling
of the Earth, Mars and Venus.
It's an enigma, having a massive
atmosphere mainly of nitrogen
with the pressure of the surface 1.6
times that of Earth's air at sea level,
this is for a smaller body,
and anomalously high nitrogen 15 levels
in a 95% nitrogen 14 atmosphere.
It is not a body more
than 4 billion years old.
The Electric Universe was the only
model to predict the surface features
before Huygens descended
and photographed it
and that was based on the kind of electrical
sculpting seen on Venus, Mars and Earth.
The earliest reports from scientists
are usually the most revealing
before they have time to recover
from shock and make up stories.
So what was discovered in the
first close flyby of Titan?
In New Scientist of November
6, 2004, just after the event,
Titan images add to moon's
mystery wrote Stephen Battersby.
The world got its first peek at the
surface of Saturn's moon Titan last week.
The images were taken as Cassini's,
Cassini-Huygens spacecraft swept past the moon.
The images show a landscape that
is clearly still being shaped.
Where'd we heard that before?
We heard that about Venus.
Although Titan must have suffered
numerous meteor impacts in the past,
its surface today is
largely crater free.
Once again, just like Venus.
Somehow these scars must have
been eroded or filled in.
There's that operative
word "somehow".
We are seeing a place that is
alive geologically speaking
says Charles Elachi. This is
what they said about Venus,
it must have overturned the
entire surface recently.
That's precisely what was said about
Venus when the Magellan orbiter revealed
that planet's surface.
It is only supposition
that Titans surface
is still being shaped.
It is based on the belief that Titan must have
suffered numerous meteor impacts in the past
and therefore something must have occurred
from within the moon to fill the craters.
However, like Venus, there may have
been no impact craters to fill.
Some initial comments
by Cassini team members,
accompanying this picture
in that little insert there
of Titan from the
descending Huygens probe,
reflected on the Venus-like
appearance of features on Titan.
Now I'd predicted these
before the event.
"These remind me of what we have
observed in the past on Venus."
This is a quote. Another quote,
"We now have the key to understanding
what shapes Titan's landscape."
- said Dr. Martin Tomasco, principal
investigator for the descent imager.
He added, "Geological evidence for
precipitation, erosion, mechanical abrasion
and other fluvial activity says that
the physical processes shaping Titan
are much the same as
those shaping Earth."
Oh yeah
But nonpolar liquid methane
is not like liquid water
as Jerry Pollack
would tell anyone.
In the atmosphere such molecules
form smog, not heavy rain drops.
This demonstrates the problem
of interpreting evidence
when your thinking is limited to
flowing liquids to carve channels.
The channels on Titan bear the hallmarks
of lightning imprinted on the surface.
As I've done there, I've
inverted the black and white
and turned it up the other way to
make it look more like lightning.
The channels on Titan bear the hallmarks
of lightning imprinted on the surface.
And the lack of a methane
ocean was predicted
because Titan's atmosphere is not yet
in equilibrium, after recent events.
So a vast reservoir of methane is not
needed to make good the losses expected
over the 4.7 billion years
required by the solar nebula model.
Because the expectation was
that the Huygens Lander,
the Huygens probe,
would go through the clouds that it'd
photograph it on the way down
and then it would plop into a
methane or ethane ocean.
They never found it.
Titan's Enigmatic Atmosphere
Titan's atmosphere is
believed by many scientists
to be similar to Earth's early
atmosphere, billions of years ago.
This is the usual story, we're out there
to try and show how the earth was born.
Toby Owen, principal
scientist at JPL said,
"What we've got is a very
primitive atmosphere that
has been preserved for
4.6 billion years.
Titan gives us a chance
for cosmic time travel,
going back to the very earliest days of
Earth when it had a similar atmosphere.
All conjecture.
But in a sense Toby
Owens may be right.
Titan can give us insights about
the Proto-Saturnian environment
but just take off about five
zeros from that age figure.
The striking disparity in nitrogen
isotopes is telling us something
about the way planetary atmospheres are
formed rather than how they evolved.
Hannes Alfvén wrote in Evolution
of the Solar System, and I quote:
"The Laplacian concept of
a homogeneous gas disc
provides the general background
for most current speculations.
The advent of magnetohydrodynamics
about 25 years ago,
and experimental and theoretical progress in
solar and magnetic and magnetospheric physics
have made this concept obsolete
but this seems not yet
to be fully understood.
While acknowledging Alfvén's point,
it is possible to go a step further
and invoke several processes available
in the plasma discharge model
that would affect
Titan's atmosphere.
Was Titan captured or born
earlier by Proto-Saturn
in a major electrical event
in its recent history?
This is hinted at by
Titan's eccentric orbit
which cannot have persisted
for billions of years
and isotopes will separate in the
combined electric and magnetic fields
of a cosmic plasma discharge.
So this is where we get into the problem
of nitrogen in planetary atmospheres,
you've got Venus with it's heavy
carbon dioxide atmosphere.
How did these happen?
Why are these differences?
And it comes down to the electrical
effects on atmospheric molecules
which I don't think
I'll discuss here,
just, I've done so many,
I have so many slide preparations, I'm not
quite sure which things I've addressed.
Ah, here we go, yes.
We come to Venus.
Saturn's last-born
and a birth witnessed
by humanity.
The planet shows a
surprisingly young surface
that gave rise to ad hoc
theories of resurfacing events.
They're unnecessary.
Venus is a baby.
The Electric Universe account
explains its hellish temperature
having been born recently from the
interior of a brown dwarf star
and its thick 96% carbon dioxide
and 4% nitrogen atmosphere
was inherited from its
brown dwarf parent,
was subsequently modified
by cosmic discharges.
The amount of nitrogen in the Venusian
atmosphere is relatively small,
compared to the amount
of carbon dioxide,
but because the atmosphere is so
much thicker than that on Earth
its total nitrogen content is roughly
four times higher than the Earth's,
even though on Earth nitrogen makes
up about 78% of the atmosphere.
But Venus may have begun with
more nitrogen, more like the Earth.
Now nitrogen, and this isn't
understood by astrophysicists,
is catalyzed by hot iron
atoms to carbon monoxide,
the two molecules have very
little energy difference.
So if you get a catalytic
effect on a hot iron surface,
it will convert nitrogen
to carbon monoxide.
And the carbon monoxide and
water on a hot surface
gives you carbon
dioxide and hydrogen.
The hydrogen, being a very light
gas of course, escapes to space
and it's still escaping --
it's been shown.
The heavier deuterium
tends to be left behind
which might explain Venus's 10 times higher
ratio of deuterium to hydrogen than the Earth('s)
and solar UV light is
totally inadequate
as an explanation if we accept
the short history of Venus.
Now notably, if water is being consumed
at the surface and being converted
into carbon dioxide with the surface carbon
monoxide and the hydrogen is escaping,
it's very interesting that water
was found to mysteriously decrease
as the surface was approached
by the Venus landing craft.
In other words, that reaction
is still taking place today.
So here we see the
Venus's equatorial scars
were caused by spectacular
radial discharging
which was faithfully recorded
by the petroglyph artists.
The thicker the atmosphere the more
filamentary the surface lightning becomes
as you see.
Venus carried away significant
charge from its parent
so that it still has a
cometary magneto tail
which was detected
back in the 80's
and its mountains glow with plasma
discharges that reflect radar
and this puzzled the
scientists greatly:
Why are the mountains of Venus shiny
when we look at them in radar?
And I wrote at the time,
it's because they're all, got St.
Elmo's fire type discharges
at above a certain elevation
and that's why just the peaks
were glowing in the radar signal.
Battle-Scarred Mars
The devastated face of Mars shows the
colossal gash of Valles Marineris
stretching a third of the
way around the planet.
Carl Sagan in the Scientific
American of September 1975 wrote,
"The ultimate objective of comparative
planetology it might be said,
is something like a vast computer program
into which we insert a few input parameters,
perhaps the initial mass, composition
and angular momentum of a proto planet
and the population of neighboring
objects that strike it
and then derive the complete
evolution of the planet."
End of quote.
Sagan's statement, it epitomizes everything
that's wrong with modern science
based on computer generated
models of virtual-reality.
The first law of computing is,
and since I was in the computer
industry all my working life,
garbage in equals garbage out.
Planetologists have adopted
their story of the earth,
sorry, adapted their story of the Earth
to accommodate their findings on Mars.
So we now have eras called the Noachian,
the Hesperian and the Amazonian
based on crater counting.
But crater counting assumes the conventional
story of formation of the solar system
which, as I've shown, has no
real evidential support.
In fact, the evidence
is strongly against it.
In my next presentation,
which is later today,
I will talk about
the damage on Mars
but Mars was stripped of
atmosphere, water and rocks.
And the modern evidence,
we are still receiving
Mars rocks on Earth today!!
And the evidence of Mars' battles
with cosmic Thunderbolts
is written hugely
on its "scar-face".
That was the name given to Mars
by the North American Indians.
What can conventional planetologists
do with evidence like that?
And of course we have the MAVEN
mission that is going to tell us
how Mars atmosphere was stripped
off over 4 billion years.
So whatever that mission
was designed to do,
the question, initial question,
is irrelevant and wrong.
And this is the really
interesting thing.
Is Earth a former Saturnian?
And the first question is...
Why continents and
oceans of water?
There's no other body
in the solar system
with continents and oceanic
type basins like the Earth.
Each planet has its own
story of electrical birth
and the scars of interplanetary thunderbolts
in order to achieve orbitals' harmony.
This is where the battles these cosmic
battles with the Thunderbolts of the Gods
can scar the face of
a planet terribly
but also the birth process
itself can do the same.
Electrical sculpting of planetary
features is the most powerful concept
missing from planetary
scientists' toolkit.
The Earth's unique oceanic basins
with their mid-oceanic raised ridges
and orthogonal coronal pattern,
if you have a powerful discharge, high voltage
discharge you get coronal discharges
at right angles to the
main discharge channel.
And I would suggest that the Earth
probably suffered the massive
ocean basin carving as
a feature of its birth.
It was a pole to pole discharge.
Mountain ranges with their
electrically sculpted ridges and gullies
and backbones of intrusive
melted rock called granite
signify surface and subterranean telluric
currents unimagined by geologists.
Global tectonics is a failed
paradigm because it assumes
undisturbed evolution of the Earth
in place over millions of years.
Brown dwarfs flare and deposit minerals
and gases on their satellites.
The flare ejects stellar matter from the
brown dwarf equatorially or axially,
most usually equatorially.
The composition will vary depending on the
depth from which matter is dredged up
and the chance encounter between that
ejected matter and each satellite.
This I think explains the water and
mineral deposits on Earth largely.
So the rings of Saturn are a water
ice remnant of flaring activity.
Saturn was the source of the copious
amounts of surface water on the Earth
and probably the sodium and
the chlorine in particular
because it's hard to get
chlorine out of rocks.
Each planet has its own birth
drama and complex history,
this is why this solar system is a
complete fruit salad of objects
with all sorts of different
surfaces and characteristics,
axial tilts, rotation
rates and so on.
They are all
individuals, you know.
This explains why the Earth, Mars
and Venus appear so different
even though they may be
members of the same family.
There is no nebula gradation of
physical properties of the planets
and the ad-hoc suggestion of migration of
planets only serves to confuse the issue.
All the Electric Universe does is
work with the forensic evidence
about the most recent chapter
in solar system history.
So The Future?
Professor Wescott is right,
mankind's survival is astonishing.
Of course, there are reports
globally of dreadful heat and cold
while the Earth established this
new home in the solar system.
This is to be expected
on a cometary orbit.
It seems to me that part of
the answer for our survival
lay in the great heat
reservoirs of the oceans
but there was also the exchange of
electrical energy via the cometary discharge
which may have provided
some additional heat
while circularizing the
orbit of the Earth,
as I'll discuss later.
But as Roger Wescott makes clear,
we may have no future if we do not
understand our irrational behavior
trying to imitate the
power of the old gods
in our ability to destroy each
other and the environment.
Velikovsky as a psychoanalyst,
felt his most important legacy,
as he makes clear in
Mankind in Amnesia,
was to help us understand
our catastrophic past
and by so doing begin to heal
from those psychic wounds.
Fear is a great cattle prod.
But we are not cattle.
Thank you!

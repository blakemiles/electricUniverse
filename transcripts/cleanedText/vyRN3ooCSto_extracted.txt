The Greek writer Nikos
Kazantzakis once said,
"since we cannot change reality let us
change the eyes which see reality."
Today countless
thousands of inquirers
are looking at the world and the
universe beyond with changed eyes.
When one gazes at our
celestial neighborhood
the planets, moons, comets
and asteroids we see
defy the speculative history
we learned in school.
These bodies testify to events not
included in any geology textbook.
The evidence seems undeniable.
High-energy electromagnetic
events have indelibly scarred
and in some cases devastated the
rocky bodies in our solar system.
Today this seemingly outrageous theory
is being put to the test experimentally.
One of the most remarkable of these
experimentalists is Billy Yelverton
who has successfully replicated
countless planetary features
through experiments with electrical
discharges and electric fields.
Here we provide a brief overview and
introduction of Billy's research.
We begin with a discussion of an
especially fascinating experiment
to produce features resembling
cellular structures,
which are also seen on
some planetary surfaces.
It started with the two copper
conductors or two metal conductors,
the bottom plate was generally an
iron plate we use in our tests
and the upper plate happened
to be a copper sheet.
First time that we noticed them
and it is during the time
when we do the lifting effect
which raises these
columns of sand or clay
and if you look under the plate
after the discharge is over
we found is that there tends to be
some sort of condensation of moisture
that must be from the atmosphere or,
you know, the humidity in the air.
However, it tends to, you know, condense
in the sand and the clay there.
It causes it to harden up and it also causes
it to cake up on the bottom of the electrodes
in these same patterns that we see, you
know, cellular shape, fairy circle.
So it was pretty
incredible to see that.
To be honest my jaw fell open, really,
I really didn't know what to think.
I called Ben up he and I looked at the
pictures and what not and discussed it
and put it in the morning
news, the next morning.
Really, I mean, the first thing
that came to mind was cellular,
you know, some sort of, I mean, this is
a, I know we can't say it's biological
because it's not at all biological, but
nonetheless it had a biological appearance to it.
Central Africa has quite a bit
of those fairy circle features
and the Giant's Causeway in Northern
Ireland is where these columns,
hexagonal columns, appear to
be solidified in the rock.
If you imagine look
at them from above.
These hexagonal shapes
all bunched together.
That's what they look like, you
know, a cellular type feature
and we find them in soft
sediment and in a, you know,
as we just explained
hard sediment too.
Devil's Tower in Wyoming
is another example.
Dating back decades various
experimentalists have replicated
through electrical discharges
different types of craters
from those indistinguishable
from impact craters
to anomalous craters that continue
to puzzle planetary scientists.
In some instances an electrical
discharge may be the only process
capable of producing all of the
features of certain craters.
The first types of craters were
done with the dark mode discharge
with a single overhead anode, or cathode
actually it doesn't really matter
and those were done
again with dark mode
and then we've also created
several crater chains
and singular craters
through layered material
with the lightning bolt
with the arc mode.
We get all a lot of
the same features,
the rays that tend to scatter out quite a
distance from the center of the crater.
We created that quite a few
times too and the raised rim.
We literally can't tell the difference
between that and an impact.
In the Thunderbolts Project's documentary
film "The Lightning Scarred Planet Mars"
it is proposed that the towering
so-called shield volcano Olympus Mons
is in effect a lightning blister from
an enormous electrical discharge.
Has Billy achieved similar
features in his experiments?
We did a couple of tries there with
arc mode discharge on some clay
that I mixed up with
water beforehand
and almost like a mud peanut-butter texture
to it and those two produce, you know,
of course it's a gaseous effect, you
know, we're heating the liquid of,
turning it in back in the gas again
and it kind of creates like a blister
and then these do
resemble Olympus Mons.
They take on a concentric
type ridge pattern
as they like step up higher and
higher, as the center rises up
but again that could be, you
know, as a process of heat
and, you know, steam and pressure creates
what's similar to a volcano actually.
I mean in my opinion if you
look at this whole thing
overall volcanoes are
electric discharge.
This is the induction mechanism here, this is
what is causing the rock returned to lava,
the volcanoes all tend to
be this lifted mechanism
similar to the, you know, a blister or something
like that, you know, a raised feature.
It can be done with or without,
you know, the arc mode.
We've shown that too but
the long mountain ranges
I found that so far the best
reproduction that I've done on the table
is with the vibration which in,
you know, if we, you know,
if we look at this type of cataclysmic
event that may have actually happened
we'd have to associate some rather large
earthquakes with some of these events anyway
and what I found is that that most
earthquakes take place today between,
well, less than 1 Hertz up to
about 20 Hertz in frequency
and I played around with that a little
bit on the table with a vibrator,
you know, just an
offset counterweight
and I determined the frequency
by calculating the RPM
and at about 25 to 30 Hertz we begin to do
the exact same process as we see all over.
We get a little raised dendritic features,
raised mountain ranges with the featherback,
you know, formations and so that's
another road I want to travel down here
shortly is to integrate this earthquake
feature into our electric discharge
because, well, we know that the electricity
carries these type frequencies with them.
A lot of work that Ben Davidson
has done is, you know,
all but prove that electric discharge
is what creates earthquakes.
So, we'd have to assume sooner or later
that they are integrated together.
Given the proven ability
of electrical discharges
and electric fields to produce
familiar geological features
then much traditional
geology must be reassessed.
One intriguing example is the
production of sand dunes by ionic wind.
This opens the door to a new interpretation
of mysterious sand dunes found on Mars,
on the Saturnian moon Titan
and most stunningly
even on the comet 67/P.
Those are quite common actually
and if you watch this happen on a sheet of
acrylic or any type of a dielectric sheet,
yeah, I mean it's right they'd unfold
right before your eyes literally
and you can see
that's an ionic wind
that's created by the discharge,
that's doing this on the table,
and to see it perform almost the
same way we do in nature makes
you want a second, you know, opinion on
what actually causes the wind to blow
because the features are
identical, you know,
what we consider to be weather driven
wind forces by heat and pressure
if we can recreate the same duning effects
with nothing but electric discharge.
It is incredible and to find these
type features on the 67/P recently
that really speaks volumes, when you
know there's no atmosphere there.

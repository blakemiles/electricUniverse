Mainstream astronomers’ reliance on
gravity as the primal force shaping the
Universe, has restricted them to thinking
in terms of spherical explosions and
voids or bubbles, created by dying stars.
Around these supposed voids, gas
filaments can be seen arcing away. Our
Sun sits in the middle of an enormous
void called the ‘local bubble’. They 
say this contains million-degree
ionized hydrogen gas surrounded by a
wall of colder, denser neutral gas.
Within this hot bubble, gas density is much 
sparser. At first they thought that the local
bubble was an asymmetric cavity of 
330 to 490 light years in diameter. This
implied that two bubbles might have collided and
merged. The most important point to note is that
they believe the local bubble is deficient in
neutral gas. In all the literature they keep
describing it as ‘neutral gas deficient’, rather 
than simply stating that it is highly ionized.
Further mappings reveal that the
ionized pockets actually form a tunnel
that extends at least 820 light years
towards Ursa Major, suggesting that it
might connect at least a thousand
light years into the galactic halo.
As the research continues, it starts to
become clear that our ‘local bubble’ was
actually part of a larger cylindrical
cavity that pierces through the disk of
the galaxy, dubbed the ‘local chimney’.
So how do they explain the formation of
the bubbles, and how can they explain
the structure of the local chimney?
They believe supernova explosions are
responsible for creating these voids.
In the case of the local chimney, they
speculate that energetic supernova
explosions created fast-moving expanding bubbles
of hot gas that collided with surrounding cold gas
of the interstellar space, which in turn 
became compressed into thin shells.
Eventually these shells of cold gas meet
other expanding hot cavities and break
up, forming small tunnels or path-
ways between the expanding voids.
Towards the center of the local chimney
we find the Pleiades, and it is here that
astronomers search for the possible source of a
supernovae. A little further out from these are a
belt of stars, called the Gould belt. These
are massive hot OB-type stars. These
provide a clue as to what might be going on.
The supposed young stars appear to form
a ring, centered on the Pleiades and have
motions that appear to imply that they
are also orbiting around this point. Yet, there 
is not enough mass for this to be possible.
Let's just take a little step back here.
Are we surprised that our Sun sits in a
bubble of ionized hydrogen? No, this is exactly what we
would expect to find. Our Sun sits on a filament which
powers our star. The fact 
that this structure seems to
take on a cylindrical appearance,
should also not come as a surprise.
So what are we to make of the boundary layer
of cooler gas surrounding this structure?
Assuming that the filament takes on a
simple Birkeland Current structure, we
would expect recombination to occur.
Marklund identified this process and
showed that the elements will become preferentially
sorted according to their ionization energy.
This means that hydrogen and helium would always
be found towards the outer edge of the filament.
So comparing the density of hydrogen
inside the filament to the outer edges,
you should see a sharp increase in the
density, and the appearance of a wall.
If we examine this image, then we see
that the areas in white are low density,
probably hot, ionized gas. So in other words, 
plasma. The darker colored areas are thought to
be cold dense gas, possibly largely molecular in
nature. We can clearly see that many areas seem
to connect to each other, forming a sort of 
network. Now it is important to point out that
there is likely to be many smaller
filaments connecting and overlapping,
creating this blurred white part of the image.
From Jim Wenninger’s work on Arcturus, we
can see that the motion of the stars may
reveal parts of this structure nearby us,
with us circling around the local Arcturus filament.
Some astronomers have wondered if the
local bubble, or chimney system of
the interlocking gaseous cavities is
characteristic of the entire Milky Way.
Astronomers looking at an updated map of
cold local interstellar gas in the galactic
plane, see an inner empty region with
finger-like extensions or tunnels that
poke through the surrounding wall and
reach into the nearby regions of the
galaxy. These regions are known to
contain large amounts of hot, ionized,
low- density gas that can be detected at
radio and ultraviolet wavelengths.
Right next to our local bubble,
astronomers have identified a new bubble called the
Per-Tau shell. It is thought to extend for about 500
light years and spans two well-studied
molecular clouds, called Taurus and Perseus.
Using a special technique, they were able
to create three-dimensional maps of the
local cloud structures. If we examine the Chameleon
molecular cloud, we can see a series of filaments
that seem to connect via a hub-like structure.
With a void in the center, it is also physically
connected to the Musca dark cloud. The Taurus 
cloud extends between 131 and 168 parsecs.
When viewed from the top, you might 
be able to notice that it consists of two
layers, separated by about 10 to 15 parsecs.
This layering is consistent with several
previous studies. Musca is a clear example
of a filament on both the two-dimensional and
three-dimensional image. It is 
termed a dark cloud, meaning that
it contains a myriad of sub-micron sized
solid particles, often referred to as
intergalactic dust grains. They tend 
to block out visible light, making them
appear dark. They are thought to be
composed of largely molecular gas, rather
than containing ionized material.
Ultraviolet starlight is considered the
main source of ionization in H2 regions,
and in H1 regions it ionizes elements
with low ionization potentials.
This has led to the belief that it is
the only ionizer and that in dark
clouds, where starlight is absorbed, the
ionization may go down to zero. This 
is not necessarily correct, because
in many cases, most ionization of cosmic
plasma is produced by hydromagnetic
transfer of kinetic energy into
electrical currents which ionize.
One common theme that they identified,
was a point I touched on earlier - the
creation of the atomic hydrogen
envelopes around the molecular clouds.
They also discovered that the widths
between the outer and inner envelopes
had a consistent ratio of 3.4. When 
they identified the radial density
profiles, they found that it was
inconsistent with a filament driven only
by gravity, and was much better suited to
one where the filaments were magnetized.
Previous studies of the structures
of magnetic fields in the solar
neighborhood cloud, have found strong
coupling between the gas column density
and the magnetic field orientation;
which is consistent with the idea that
magnetic fields play an important role
in structuring the interstellar medium
in and around, the local molecular cloud.
Despite all of this, they still favor the
formation of bubbles through supernovae.
If the galaxy is composed of a network
of filaments that carry slow moving ions these form
magnetic fields that hold the structure together.
Hannes Alfven pointed out that these
structures are capable of transferring
energy over vast distances, and 
dissipating the energy across the
double layer with a voltage drop.
It is important to understand that the
current required to accomplish this, may 
very well consist of low energy particles.
The plasma and material in these areas is not
simply mixed together through random collisions.
Plasmas have a tendency to produce large
variations in the chemical composition.
One mechanism is due to the different
laws of motion of the non-ionized and
ionized components of a magnetized 
plasma. The condensation of non-volatile
substances to grains, constitutes another separation
mechanism. Any charged grains of dust, or ions, will
feel an attraction towards the filament.
As they move towards the filament, if
they gain enough speed, they can cause
non-ionized material to become ionized.
This is particularly so in areas where a pinch 
occurs. This can cause large areas of low
density to be created. At the same time Marklund
convection will sort material into radial shells.
Together, these could explain the network of
bubbles we see throughout our local neighborhood.

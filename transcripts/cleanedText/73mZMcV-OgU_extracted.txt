Welcome to Space News from the Electric
Universe brought to you by The
Thunderbolts Project at Thunderbolts.info.
Quantum experiments have long
demonstrated that subatomic particles
somehow know about each other instantly
and at great distances. Institutional
science utilizes terms such as "quantum
entanglement" and "spooky action" to
describe the phenomena. But the Electric
Universe theory offers a very different
perspective. The speed of light limit to
communication imposed by the Theory of
Relativity is not a universal speed
limit. Physicist  Wal Thornhill  describes
how this can be observed in our own
celestial neighborhood. He writes: "If
gravity traveled at the slow speed of
light, the Earth would be pulled to where
the Sun appears in the sky and not the
Sun's real position in space.
This would result in a slingshot effect
and toss planets out of the solar system
in short order. Observations of close
binary stars where the effect would be
extreme and quickly noticeable show that
gravity must operate at a speed in
excess of 20 billion times the speed of
light to prevent spiraling orbits. The
Sun and the Earth have instantaneous
information about their locations." In
this Space News episode Nicholas
Sykes elaborates the fundamental
differences in this regard between the
Electric Universe and standard cosmology.
In my Thunderbolts' Space News video, "Are
the Dominoes Falling?", it was argued that
since the gravitational attraction
between the Sun and the Earth must
operate almost instantaneously or else
the Earth and the other planets would be
slung out of their orbits. This fact was,
irreconcilable with the dictate of the
Theory of Relativity that the fastest
possible messenger between one point and
another was light or, to be more accurate,
the electromagnetic radiation of which
visible light might be a component. This
is because if the supposedly fastest
possible messenger between the Sun and
the Earth travels at the speed of light,
then the gravitational attraction that
exists between the Sun and the Earth
could not be messaged between them any
faster than light can travel between
them. Since it is known that light takes
8.3 minutes approximately to
travel from the Sun to the Earth, it
would have to be presumed that the
gravitational attraction is messaged from
the Sun to the Earth and vice versa
within a period of time
no shorter than 8.3
minutes also.
However, such a deduction must inevitably
bear with it the conclusion that the
Earth is actually being attracted to
some point in space that was the
location of the Sun's center of gravity
8.3 minutes of time in the past, rather
than where that center of gravity
actually is when the Earth experiences
the attraction. But that conclusion bears
with it a number of fatal contradictions.
Contradiction Number One:
let us regard the planetary orbits of
the solar system as circular, which we may
do without prejudice to the argument. A
centripetal force upon the orbiting
Earth must be orthogonal to the motion
of the planet.
However, the gravitational force
transmitted from the Sun to the Earth at
the speed of light will, when it reaches
the Earth, be displaced from the path it
would have taken if the force had
operated instantaneously. It is no longer
orthogonal to the Earth's orbit hence is
no longer centripetal and would
influence the planet over an
astronomically short time to leave the
orbit, yet this does not happen.
Contradiction Nmber Two: there is no
time lapse term in Copernicus' or
Kepler's equations for their observed
planetary orbits, which do not therefore
anticipate any time lapse such as
gravitational attraction functioning as
slowly as the speed of light would
necessitate. Neither is there a
time-lapse term in Newton's Third Law,
which we interpret as
"Action and reaction are equal and
opposite." In a Newtonian heliocentric
system, we understand the forces of
attraction that the primary and its
satellite exert upon one another to be
equal and opposite. A reaction that was
caused by an action 8.3 minutes
beforehand, in the case of the Earth and
the Sun, would no longer be the opposite
that the law describes. The effect of
this can be seen from my diagram of the
Sun as the reference point or frame of
reference for an orbiting Earth. The
issue is very well dealt with in the
Thunderbolts Forum of October the 22nd
2016, in which reference was made to work
by Tom Van Flandern, in which Sir Arthur
Eddington was quoted: "As having exposed,
by 1920, the issue in terms of the couple,
which a lightspeed gravity between Sun
and Earth would exert." This is the same
argument as I am using, employing a
slightly different viewpoint. I have not
actually read this work before my video
was produced. It is left to others to
account for the fact that Eddington
became a great proponent for Einsteinian
relativity, in spite of his work on this
issue. The connection then between the
Sun and the planets should be envisaged
as an ether tightrope. In the current EU
Model, the ether of space is understood
as Wal Thornhill describes it "to
consist of a plenum of neutrinos." In our
experience a rope may carrier a transverse
wave caused by moving one end of the
rope,
perhaps from one side to the other or
perhaps up and down. After some time that
transverse wave motion will reach the
other end of the rope.
However, if the rope is made of barely
extendable material and if one end is
tugged, that tug will be felt at the
other end, very much faster, almost by
comparison, of the time the tug is made.
This comparison may be likened to the
relationship between the transmission of
light
by transverse electromagnetic wave and
the very much faster gravitational
attraction between two massive bodies.
Electromagnetic radiation is by its
nature transverse but gravitational
attraction or, indeed if it is so
interpreted repulsion, is longitudinal.
Kepler's and Newton's laws may be
thought to assume any time factor to be
so vanishingly small that it can be
neglected
altogether. The EU Model of gravitation
requires an almost instantenaity
condition too, though that almost is not
claimed to be collapsed into absolute
instantenaity. There is, after all, the
possibility of a correction of planetary
orbits that start to go astray by extra
Newtonian electrical attractions and
repulsions for Newtonian physics does
not account for the orbital stability
that is observed or the small
corrections that are from, time to time,
manifest. Such corrections, however,
could not prevent the first-order steady
propulsion out of any orbit that a
lightspeed gravity would inevitably
produce. There are many other arguments
against Einsteinian relativity, some of
which declare that the great story of
the ether drift experiments of the last
century is commonly misreported. The
light exceeding speed of gravity by far
is but one more falling domino
collapsing a credible Theory of
Relativity.

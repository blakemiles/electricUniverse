Ideally a scientific theory of mythology
should be able to explain the genesis
and specific content of ancient myth.
Modern schools of myth, alas, have long
since abandoned any pretense of addressing
such questions. Much less of offering
comprehensive theories purporting to
explain more than a handful of isolated
mythological motifs from one particular 
culture. Stith Thompson's opinion is
representative of the skepticism 
that currently prevails in the field,
quote “The ultimate origin of nearly 
all folk tales and myths must remain
a mystery.” The theory advanced by 
Dave Talbott and myself, in contrast,
claims to offer a unifying explanation
of nearly every globally attested
mythological structure and thematic
pattern. Our theory is distinguished from
all other modern schools of myth
moreover, by the fact that it explains the
individual themes at a level of detail
rarely imagined by other scholars.
The archetypal myth of the Warrior 
Goddess offers a case study in this regard.
Among the earliest mythological
traditions of Mesopotamia are those
describing the planet Venus as the warrior
goddess Inanna. Indeed, a third millennium
kenning describes war itself as the dance 
of Inanna. In the following hymn Inanna is
described as raining fire and flood from 
the sky, quote “Loud- thundering storm.
Hierodule, who makes heavens 
tremble, who makes the earth quake,
who can soothe your heart? You who 
pour down firebrands over the earthly orb,
who flash like lightning over the highland...
Whose cry reaches heaven and earth, whose
roar is all-destructive... Your angry 
heart is a terrifying flood- wave.”
Now I ask, would anyone viewing Venus 
in the present sky ever be inspired to
describe it as a loud-thundering storm,
flashing, lightning and hurling firebrands?
Yet this very language is employed again
and again in the Sumerian text to describe
Inanna Venus. Quote “Like a dragon you have
deposited venom on the foreign lands... Raining
blazing fire down upon the land... You 
charge forward like a charging storm.
You roar with the roaring storm... Your 
rage cannot be cooled!” A recurring
theme places Inanna Venus at the center
of a destructive heaven-spanning storm,
described alternately as a tornado or a whirlwind.
In a hymn to Inanna for example, Inanna
is described as clothed in a furious
storm, a whirlwind. The word described as
whirlwind here is dal-amun denoting 
a tornado or dust cloud. Evident
in these archaic traditions is an 
image of a planet gone amok.
Its whirling tornado-like behavior
instantiating its terrible rage.
It is telling that analogous behavior is reported of
other great goddesses such as the Akkadian Ishtar,
the Canaanite Astarte, the Egyptian
Hathor Ugaritic Anat, and the Indian Kali.
Each of these warrior goddesses,
several of whom are explicitly identified
with the planet Venus, is associated with
a destructive rampage at the dawn of
time that brought the world to the very brink of
destruction. If Inanna was conceptualized as a
whirling storm, Ishtar was
represented as a whirling dancer.
Quote “Oh valiant Ishtar, shining torch of heaven
and earth... Furious and irresistible onslaught...
Fiery glow that blazes against the enemy, who wreaks
destruction on the fierce Dancing One, Ishtar.”
The epithet translated Dancing One here as
Gushea, literally, “the Whirling One.” Religious
rituals celebrating Ishtar Venus
featured frenzied dances in
which its celebrants whirled wildly. Benjamin
Foster in his commentary on these archaic rituals
observed, quote “The whirling dance or
mock combat the people perform is a
memorial to Ishtar, here etymologized
by the poet as the ’whirling dancer.’”
From the standpoint of modern astronomy needless
to say, there is no conceivable reason why the
planet Venus should be conceptualized as an agent
of storm, much less as a whirling tornado. Nor for
that matter, is there any obvious 
reason why that planet should be
described as a whirling dancer or fire-
spewing warrior. Hence the profound puzzle
presented by these widespread myths and 
rituals. How then is it possible to explain the
myth of the warrior goddess? In the historical
reconstruction offered by Talbott and myself,
the myth in question encodes
catastrophic natural events during which
Venus's atmosphere became hyper-charged and
disturbed, flaring dramatically in the northern
circumpolar heaven. The basic image
was that of a whirling comet-like
object, or hair star. Indeed, ancient
artworks from Mesopotamia, Old Europe and
the New World depict Venus as a whirling 
star. Such imagery is especially conspicuous
in the indigenous traditions 
associated with the Hindu goddess Kali.
According to the various accounts, the goddesse’s
frenzy dancing threatened to destroy the world.
Quote “The dread mother dances naked in the
battlefield, her lowling tongue burns like a red
flame of fire, her dark tresses
fly in the sky, sweeping away
sun and stars, red streams of blood
run from her cloud-black limbs, and the
entire world trembles and cracks under 
her tread.” A recurring theme in the
Hindu accounts of Kali's rampage is 
the goddess's wildly disheveled hair,
reputedly capable of raising a terrible
storm that blocks out the light of the Sun.
The goddess's hair, as noted by David Kinsley,
is a sign of her destructive nature, quote
”Kali's unbound hair may also have a broader, indeed
cosmic, significance, suggesting dissolution itself.
Considering Kali's identification with 
the cremation ground and death,
her loose hair may suggest the end of the world.
Her hair has come apart and flies about
every which way; order has come to
an end; all has returned to chaos.”
As we would understand this imagery,
Venus's swirling hair not only presented
the appearance of a giant comet or tornado
circling about the polar axis, it was
laden with lightning and fire and quite
literally constituted a storm that
blocked out the light of the primal Sun.
Hence the global myth of the giant comet
or dragon that swallowed the Sun and
threatening to destroy the world.
A Sumerian hymn from the second 
millennium BC captures this idea perfectly.
Quote “My hair will quarrel around in heaven
for you like a hurricane.” Students of myth will
remember that Kali's dance was not a solo
performance. She was joined by Shiva whose
dervish-like dancing added to 
the apocalyptic destruction.
Shiva is Mars, as I have documented in various
works. Analysis reveals that Mars features
prominently in nearly every aspect 
of the myth of the warrior goddess.
It was a tornado-like storm associated
with Venus in fact which vacuumed up
many miles of surface material from Mars,
leaving the red planet with a severely
flattened northern hemisphere.
Doubtlessly, immense dust clouds of recently
catastrophically excavated material
contributed much to Venus's archetypal
status as an agent of destruction and whirling
dust devil, not to mention her intimate association
with a vast horde of demonic beings. Despite 
her many repulsive attributes, Kali remains
India's most beloved goddess to this very day.
Artworks depicting the raging goddess
are ubiquitous, most emphasizing her disheveled
hair and grotesquely protruding tongue.
It is the goddess's tongue that remains the 
most iconic and lurid of all her ghastly features.
Quote ”Kali's tongue is a problem... It hangs.
It lolls. One cannot help noticing it.
In the famous temple of Kali in southern
Calcutta, the image of the goddess appears to be
nothing but a tongue... The history of Kali's
tongue, like the history of the goddess itself,
is a story rich in detail but poor in plot.” 
"We know a great deal about what the
tongue symbolized in specific texts at different
periods, but we know very little about how
why, or when the different meanings of the tongue
developed.” How then would we explain kali's
gigantic tongue? The fact that warrior goddesses
from the New World, likewise display a protruding
tongue, attest the archetypal
nature of the imagery in question.
As does the fact that cultures on both
sides of the Atlantic explicitly compare
the goddess's tongue to a dagger or 
knife. Here too it is our opinion that the
imagery encodes the unique relationship
prevailing between Mars and Venus during
a specific phase in the history of the polar
configuration in which Mars appeared to move below
Venus towards Earth, presenting the
appearance of a dagger-like tongue.
The fact that the red planet was
described as the knife star or sword
by sky watchers from Early Mesopotamia or
Egypt, is certainly germane to our hypothesis

Welcome to Space News. This is Andy Hall,
and over the course of the past year
I've been presenting a multi-part
series called Eye of the Storm.
Eye of the Storm presents a case study
for how electrical forces shaped the
Colorado Plateau and its surroundings.
In this tenth and final chapter, there
are a few things to conclude and review in 
summary. What we've done in these chapters is
reverse engineer the Earth, starting 
with outside layers and peeling inward,
following the patterns of electrical scarring.
We logically assumed circuitry is the
fundamental structure of the planet
since that is the very structure of life,
energy and the cosmos in general. Abstract
theories for cause and effect aren't needed,
when the patterns of nature are laid bare for
us to see, repeating at every scale and every
structure in the universe. We merely need
to recognize what makes the patterns.
In the case of geology, it's not just
gravity, the mist of time or coincidence,
it's the diffusion of charge in an
environment of extreme electrical stress.
Meaning, in the case of the Colorado
Plateau, a huge potential difference
between the Earth and something else.
Charge diffusion means there is a circuit.
Whether an element of charge
finds a bond in atomic structure,
or drifts in patterns formed by fields, it has 
to move. And that motion is subject to a myriad
of emergent influences; but it is always patterned
in the most fundamental way by the coherent
influence of electrical circuitry. Whether a
chemical reaction or a thermodynamic cycle,
dissect it down to the quantum level.
And it's all electromagnetic circuitry and as a
result we can look at the planets
and stars in the solar system
and see the same effects at play over and over. If a
planet has dead circuits, like Mercury or the moon,
facing a high potential, it responds to
static charge buildup on its surface
with explosive discharges that leave
it pockmarked with craters and rilles.
The evidence is overwhelming, as 
anyone who reads Thunderbolts knows.
Then there are planets that used to be alive and
are now dead, like Mars or those in the process of
birth or death, like Venus. And 
there's a bunch of debris from
planet formation and electrical interactions
orbiting the Sun. But if a planet is alive,
with an atmospheric crust enveloped
in a self-amplifying magnetosphere,
and sustained resonant feedback with the solar
system, it must have energy flowing through that
crust and atmosphere, storing inside
it, making it a spherical capacitor.
Weather and geology is driven by this capacitance.
That is pure logic and physics, once it's
recognized that Earth and the solar system are
circuits. Correlations can be drawn because
circuitry acts the same regardless of what planet
it's on, depending on type. Hence, we can see
Jupiter's storms being motivated by circuitry
and correlate actions of turbulent wind
with geologic patterns on Earth, and 
draw conclusions about the common cause.
We don't have to theorize, we just apply
known science. Mountain structures,
shaped by sonic shock waves, provide the
biggest evidence of all the Electric Earth
theories presented in the Eye of the Storm.
If tetrahedrons and other features
produced by shockwaves in a wind tunnel,
precisely match what we see in geology,
and if there is no other demonstrable
process that can produce the same features,
that is astonishing evidence that
supersonic plasma winds built mountains. If
supersonic plasma winds are acknowledged,
then the planet's voltage rise and other
circumstances required to create them
have to be acknowledged as well.
And that brings all the other electrical
processes described in Eye of the Storm
into play, because they are inevitable
consequences of charge diffusion
under those circumstances.
Consensus science has decided
tetrahedrons result from a combination of faulting,
uplift, water erosion, and huge spans of time.
They have no empirical proof;
they have no proof whatsoever
that water erosion can produce repeating
harmonic and nearly perfect geometric
forms, like these shown here, and many 
others presented in earlier chapters.
Water erosion simply cannot be that consistent.
And the earth scientists merely have an
unverified hypothesis they represent as
fact confirmed by consensus. And they
ignore the patterns. Ignoring the
obvious is scientific malpractice.
These forms are without doubt from sonic 
shockwaves. Tetrahedrons are formed in the
separation bubble of a reflected shock wave.
it's a region where a tetrahedral zone
of low pressure forms. This low-pressure
zone attracts neutral and ionized dust,
like a vacuum cleaner equipped
with an electrostatic precipitator.
The separation bubble is electrically and
pressure-polarized from the incoming plasma winds,
causing static electric attraction of ionic 
dust. There are also magnetic fields to
attract ferrous materials in
identifiable bands and sheets
that conform to the shock patterns. On an 
Electric Earth, the means and mechanisms
are all there to form mountains. Wind, water,
dust and electrical bonding. Wind, water,
earth and fire. Mountain features match
shock wave forms in excruciating detail,
far beyond the unambiguous tetrahedral
shape of the saturation bubble.
There are harmonic frequencies, unstable
waveforms, subsurface reflections,
constructive and destructive interference
patterns, and expansion fans found in geology.
Not once or twice, coincidentally,
but over and over and over again.
All are empirical proofs, because the same
features have been produced in supersonic wind
tunnels for decades. That said, 
exploring mountains and
researching the Electric Earth,
is like an Easter egg hunt,
with surprising evidence around every bend.
Sometimes the evidence is so cool, so
unexpected and so hidden in plain
sight, that it knocks even my socks off.
So in this final chapter of Eye of the Storm,
I'd like to share my three favorite easter eggs.
This is a photo of the Dragoon 
Mountains in Southern Arizona.
Historically, the Dragoons are
famous for Cochise Stronghold,
a maze of rocky defiles where Chiricahua Apache
raiding parties eluded capture from United States
soldiers during the Apache wars.
The Chiricahua chief Cochise
was a recognized genius at guerrilla warfare, and
he used the Southern Arizona terrain strategically
to stage raids and then vanish. He's
supposedly buried somewhere in those
rocks above the Stronghold. If you 
look at these ragged pinnacles
and sheets of rock, stacked together like triangular
dominoes, you might be tempted to agree with
geologists and say, ’Gee, it must 
have taken millions of years’.
But I can show you it happened pretty 
quickly. The evidence is in this monolithic
granite tetrahedron. The 
tetrahedron has a drip on it. A drip,
meaning the tetrahedron was deposited as a
viscous mass, like candle wax, or hot fudge.
The drips are highlighted in the next image.
Directly above the drips are pillow-like rocks,
capping the crown of the tetrahedron. The 
pillow rock, above the drip at far left, is broken.
It's not a volcanic lava flow. These
rocks are granite and must bake
under pressure deep underground for
immense time, according to science.
These fluid forms have been exposed to
atmosphere since they were made,
because you can't have free flow
under tons of overburden pressure.
It's not that it's unusual to see
fluid shapes in granite boulders.
Granite rocks show fluid puddling,
settling in drop configurations all the time,
even drips. But they are always 
broken and hard to discern with a photo.
But this one, this one is huge and so obvious.
At the base of this drip there's fluting,
where the falling, sheet-flow of fluid solidified
in motion, like the mineral deposits from sheet flow
on cavern walls. Below the end 
of the drip are splatters and drops
that fell free and landed on the rock face 
below. A boulder with a runny nose makes no
sense in consensus geology. So they 
ignore such a thing or insist it's not fair.
But it is. It is one minor confirmation of Electric
Earth theory. It also presents loads of information
about how it happened in the
environment on Earth at the time.
The elongated pillow rocks are
at the tip of the tetrahedron
and therefore they constitute some of the
last matter deposited into this separation
bubble. This matter was deposited in a fluid
state and it cooled into a crystalline matrix
of granite from the outside in.
Like candle wax, it formed a skin
that retained heat inside it,
keeping the inside molten for longer.
They are also at the top of the
tetrahedron and stayed hot longest,
because they had the massive rock
below them radiating through.
It likely took years for this rock mass to cool
down. The pillows hang over the leeward side
of the tetrahedron, so the wind was from
behind, pushing them over the edge,
elongating their shape like water balloons. The 
separations between rock is where shockwaves
charged with current, evaporated material away,
or prevented it from depositing, leaving gaps.
Shock waves in this environment were not
only from the winds shearing and deflecting,
but also explosive lightning
strikes and reverberating thunder.
They tend to electromagnetically align
parallel and orthogonal, since the winds
themselves were aligned with electric
fields and the shock waves carried current.
The rock shrank as it cooled, creating 
the pillow shapes. The largest pillow drop
burst, leaving a broken pillow and its
content spilled out in a stringy drip.
In fact, the top of the broken pillow displays
lightning scars that likely caused the
pillow to break and drip its viscous
guts before it completely solidified.
Other pillars squeezed out their fluid like
toothpaste. I show this example because it
illustrates the kind of confusing geologic detail
Electric Earth theory can explain with ease,
proving it's not really confusing at all. It just
takes breaking through the matrix of false paradigm
and looking with fresh eyes. It also
gives a sense for the way matter was
flying through the atmosphere.
There was a fire hose of hot silicon in
the plasma wind that formed the Dragoon mountains.
It formed like Jell-O in a mold as ions
recombined in the suction of separation bubbles.
To be clear, this mountain building event
occurred in Earth's primordial paths
near the end of a period when the
continents were forming.
There are mountains chockfull of
fossilized dinosaurs and sea life and strata
of this age. But no evidence of man. There were
severe plasma storms in human history,
but not filled with a fire hose of molten silica.
Ancient people did experience coronal
storms due to some planetary conflict in
the solar system. Ancient myth is pretty clear
about that. They must have been less powerful
however, than what's been described here,
yet still carried much more punch than
they do today. And this next 
Easter egg tells that [Music] story.

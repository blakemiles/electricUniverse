Welcome to Space News 
from the Electric Universe,

In Part One of this presentation, physicist 
Wal Thornhill introduced evidence for the
extraordinary recent origins of 
our planetary neighbor Venus.
In myth and folklore around the entire globe,
Venus was remembered as the great comet,
as a dragon-like serpent 
breathing fire about the heavens,
and as a goddess with majestic, flowing hair.
As noted previously, based on Venus's
mythic identities, Dr. Immanuel Velikovsky
was the only individual to correctly predict
that Venus would be superhot. An even
more outrageous prediction by Velikovsky
was that the planet Saturn was the
source of water in Earth's oceans.
As we reported in 2018, this prediction
received astonishing support
when scientists wrote in the journal Icarus
that water in Saturn's rings and satellites
is remarkably like water on Earth. We 
asked Wal to continue to explain his
own reconstruction of our solar system's
recent catastrophic history, and to reflect on
the significance of recent science discoveries
on this reconstruction. First, I think I
need to give a warning. The Electric Universe
identifies fundamental errors in science which have
held back progress for more than a century.
So what follows is entirely off the map
of accepted science today. I mentioned earlier
that we were a satellite of a brown dwarf star,
Proto-Saturn. So, the answer to Velikovsky's
prediction of Saturnian water on Earth
requires a fundamental rethink about both nuclear
physics and the century-old model of what stars are.
Stars are not controlled thermonuclear explosions.
Their steady light signals a simple control process.
The Electric Universe model of
stars was verified experimentally
in 2019 by the SAFIRE project and
proved stable and controllable. It
proved that most of the Sun's radiant
energy comes from the transmutation of
light elements in the bright photosphere
right in front of our eyes. Power like the Sun
by thermonuclear fusion, has been 
a colossally expensive pipe dream.
It demonstrates the tunnel vision of experts.
As for particle physics, a number of
leading researchers have declared 
the standard particle model is in crisis.
But the Titanic steams on, ignoring the
low energy nuclear icebergs that are
being produced in laboratories now.
Brown dwarfs are low-energy electric stars
inside a bloated red anode glowing 
shell. To give some idea. If Jupiter's
magnetosphere were to be lit up, it 
would appear at opposition the size
of the full moon in our sky. Jupiter's large
moons would orbit inside that glowing red sheath.
Inside that huge bubble is the most
hospitable environment for life,
because the radiant energy received 
by each satellite is evenly distributed
over its entire globe. There are no
seasons, no tropics, and no ice caps.
The radiant energy from the plasma
sheath of a brown dwarf star
is strongest at the blue and red ends of the
spectrum. L-type brown dwarfs have water as a
dominant molecule in their spectra, along with
many other biologically important molecules
and elements. Satellites, like the Earth,
would accumulate atmospheres from such a
brown dwarf and water would mist down 
continually, regardless of its spin and axial tilt. A
satellite orbiting inside the 
plasma sheath of a brown dwarf
could experience an 
ideal environment for life.
However, the brown dwarf Garden
of Eden comes with a caveat.
Stars off the main sequence, without a bright
photosphere, do not have the self-regulating
photospheric discharge to smooth out variations in
electrical power input. Consequently, brown dwarfs
are subject to sudden outbursts or flaring,
when they encounter a surge in the circuit that
powers them. These flares will dump minerals and
gases on the satellites orbiting inside the sheath.
It sculpts their surfaces electrically
and causes sudden extinction events,
vast fallout deposits and 
instant electrical fossilization.
The last dramatic flaring event, “Let there 
be Light,” signaled the breakup of the
Proto-Saturnian system and 
traumatized our prehistoric ancestors,
giving rise to all of our creation myths and
existential post-traumatic stress disorder.
It was that dying gasp of Proto-Saturn
that gave rise to a stream of material
orbiting Saturn, described as the
Ouroboros, or snake swallowing its tail.
The matter piled up to form the radiant planet
Venus. Saturn's icy rings are the bright
remnant of that matter. The Earth, being 
a much older satellite of Proto-Saturn,
explains the origin of our amazing abundance
of water and likely its saltiness, according to
Velikovsky. Nitrogen on Earth
and Titan are predominant
in their atmospheres. This suggests very
strongly that the natal atmosphere of Venus
contained a lot of nitrogen. So 
why is Venus's atmosphere today
predominantly carbon dioxide? The 
answer comes from the nitrogen being
consumed at the surface and 
converted to carbon monoxide.
This reaction was observed by the leading
French scientist Louis Kervran when he found
welders being poisoned with carbon monoxide,
yet there was none in the air. He found that
the red hot surface of iron that they were
welding was energizing the nitrogen molecules
which were then breathed in, and on the
substrate of the lung the energy was converted
to carbon monoxide. In other words
the nitrogen molecule, the nitrogen
nuclei, joined to become two different nuclei, 
carbon and oxygen. Two nitrogen gives
carbon and oxygen. So, this was demonstrated
experimentally by professor Louis Kervran.
So, now we have on the surface of Venus 
carbon monoxide being formed from the nitrogen.
On Venus, the high surface temperature
and the water in the atmosphere,
(remembering that we must have 
had a considerable amount of
water also in the atmosphere),
come together in a well-known
industrial reaction to form carbon dioxide 
and hydrogen. The lighter hydrogen
is being lost and has been detected in 
space. Now to confirm this model, the early
Venus landers discovered that water 
vapor was present in the atmosphere, but
decreased strangely on approach to the 
surface. This fits the suggested model.
But most importantly, the latest
discovery of the decrease in nitrogen as
we approach the surface of Venus, offers further
support, because there we have the welder's
hot surface energizing the nitrogen and
converting it into carbon and oxygen, or
carbon monoxide. Earlier, I 
mentioned the entire planet is
said to have been resurfaced by some unknown
process. The far simpler explanation that
Venus is an infant, simply 
doesn't occur. As for the network
of filamentary scars, they 
encircle the planet in the low
latitudes. Venus was remembered by the 
ancients as a radiant star. The reconstruction of
events show Venus with a variable number
of distinct streamers radiating outwards,
like the petals of a cosmic flower. This 
pattern is seen, looking down the barrel
of certain plasma discharge experiments here
on Earth. The filamentary pattern around the
equator of Venus is to be expected 
under these conditions, since
an electrical discharge in the very
dense atmosphere of Venus will switch
from being diffuse in space to
becoming very narrow lightning channels
under these conditions. The extreme
energy of the cosmic lightning is
sufficient to sculpt the arachnoid
features and bizarre pancake domes.
In the case of Titan I proposed that it was also
a relatively young satellite of our brown dwarf.
I wrote in 2004, “That Titan may be 
young as hinted at by its eccentric orbit,
which cannot have persisted for billions of 
years... Like Venus, surface temperatures are
globally uniform on Titan within a few degrees.
It is thought that there is a greenhouse
effect operating on Titan. However, 
the heat of Venus is due to its
origin and has nothing to do with the greenhouse
effect. The same will likely be true for Titan.”
Like Venus, Titan seems not to have a magnetic
field and yet it has a distinct magneto-tail.
Titan's electrical plasma interactions 
may be like those of Venus.
Titan also shines on the dayside 
in ultraviolet light too brightly
to be explained by solar radiation.”
To sum up, the best possible indication
we could have that our reconstruction of
events is real and accurate, is the novelty
and specificity of our successful predictions.
Having a good model allows better
questions and experiments in future. It allows
us to halt the terrible waste today in education,
manpower and massive public 
funds on misguided experiments
on big science. The Electric Universe 
is inspiring participation by the public,
by garage experimenters who are
reproducing features on planetary
surfaces using electric discharges.
Science is a cultural activity and
should be open to all to participate. The 
modern cult of the narrowly trained expert must
end. The world is far more complex than
any of our pet theories can deal with.
Only the broadest perspective
can reveal the interconnectedness
of our Electric Universe and guide 
us to the science of the future.

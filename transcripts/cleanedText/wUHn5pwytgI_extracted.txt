[Host, Michael] Welcome to the
Thunderbolts.info Podcast for February 12, 2016.
If you're one of the many
people around the world
who's begun exploring the
Electric Universe Theory,
then you've probably become aware
of some very different ideas
about how the universe
actually works.
This is a universe where nothing really
lives in isolation from anything else.
There is a conductive medium, called plasma,
that pervades the physical universe
and electric currents flowing through
plasma connect and influence
separate bodies over
vast cosmic distances.
And in our own solar system we
see this principle demonstrated
in the electromagnetic relationship
between the Earth and the Sun.
And scientists have actually known
for many decades that the Sun
is the cause of
auroras on Earth.
This was a confirmation of the hypothesis
of the experimentalist Kristian Birkeland
and in recent years the evidence for
the Earth-Sun electrical connection
has grown more and more powerful.
So the question is if the Earth and the
Sun are electromagnetically connected
and if the Sun's influence on the Earth
is not merely limited to radiation
and thermal heating and kinetic
collisions of particles.
And maybe, if the Earth
itself is a charged body
that can be thought of
as a kind of capacitor,
then it seems inevitable that our basic
understanding of the Earth's climate and weather
needs to be dramatically
reassessed.
Do we really understand what it is that
creates and drives weather phenomena?
Now, under Thunderbolts YouTube channel
we've occasionally addressed the issue
of global warming or
so-called climate change
and in fact we've even explored
the recent discoveries
of mysterious climate change on
other planets as well as our own.
Well, today we're gonna be exploring
this question from a very unique angle.
Our guest is a gentleman by
the name of Richard Moore
and Richard was a
featured speaker
at the Thunderbolts conference
EU 2015, in June of last year.
I was recently able to watch
the video of Richard's talk
which was called "The Pulsating
Universe and Planet Earth"
and I really felt that it was one of the
memorable highlights of the conference.
Richard has explored the
electrical theory of stars
and the electrical environment
of our own Milky Way galaxy
and he's applying those principles
to a thesis that could provide
an explanation for natural
climate change here on Earth.
And Richard's thesis is an example
of how there really is not one set
or dogmatic, kind of, electric
universe hypothesis.
There are different people
coming into the community
and they have their own unique insights
and unique takes on all things electrical.
And so Richard, whenever I'm
interviewing someone for the first time
who's coming into the electric universe
community, I'm always interested in asking them
how they first became introduced to
the Electric Universe hypothesis
and I'm wondering this whole
question of climate change,
is that an issue that you
were exploring first
or did you find the
Electric Universe and see
its applicability and relevance to
the whole climate change debate?
[Richard] Well actually, I
was interested in climate
long before I heard of the
Electric Universe model.
Like everyone else, I was aware,
of course, of all the publicity
and concern and activism around what
they originally called global warming
and now they call climate change.
But then, every once in a while,
I would read an article
that had a lot of a
scientific clout behind it
and presented what looked
like strong evidence
that the global warming
hypothesis wasn't valid.
And so I didn't, I really
didn't know what to believe
and I'm not somebody who likes
to just let things go like that
so I decided that what I was
going to do is actually download
look for the climate data on...
official climate data on the web and
download it and look at it myself.
So it didn't take very
long to find the NOAA, what it is,
the National Oceanographic aeronautics,
or whatever, administration,
and I found the ice core data for Greenland
and for Vostok, which is in Antarctica.
So I had the Arctic ice core record
and the Antarctic ice core record
which seems to be the most accurate and
reliable long-term record of climate,
record of diverse temperatures.
And I started looking at that
and it became
apparent, very quickly,
that there isn't really anything unusual
going on with respect to climate
so, just to give an overall picture
of what climate variation has been;
if you look at the record
for the last 400,000 years,
which is what the
Vostok record shows,
see that the Earth is almost always
in what's, in what we call, an ice age.
And it's only every 100,000
years approximately
that there's a sudden
spike in temperature,
a very sudden spike and a
very short-lived spike.
So we have about, something like 10,000 years
of what we have now, an interglacial period,
and then the temperature falls rapidly
again, down to the next ice age.
So it's good just to have an overall
pattern of what, what happens on the Earth.
Then it's interesting,
the kind of pattern,
there's those spikes every
100,000 years, like I said,
but if you look at the graph, there's
another set of smaller spikes
that occur about
every 10,000 years.
So basically, what the climate record
is, is spikes on different scales
and the spikes occur with an
approximately regular frequency,
so it's a fractal pattern.
All I knew is that this was
what, these were natural things,
this is all looking before
there was any industrial age.
And I didn't have any idea
what might be causing it
but I said well, this
is the natural pattern
and we better know about
the natural pattern
if you want to start talking
about something being unnatural.
So then I looked at, just the tail end, just
the last 10,000 years or so, of the graph,
and, lo and behold, you get
another series of spikes
only ... there about
every 1,000 years.
And then within that, there's
even smaller spikes.
So, in other words, it's spikes all the
way down. Different frequencies.
Now, the one for the
last 10,000 years,
what you can see,
and now I'm looking at the Greenland
record, the northern hemisphere.
Well, you see the spikes that
go up at the beginning
and then flatten out and
then they go down at the end.
So basically there's a
spike at about -1000,
a spike at the Year Zero,
spike at the year 1000,
and then it goes down to about an 1800,
about 1800 goes down to a minimum
and, lo and behold, what they call
global warming is one more spike
occurring just about when you would
expect it to occur, to year 2000.
And then I, you know, I found
that very interesting.
I said well, yeah, there's been
200 years of global warming
and it follows the
natural pattern.
And, according to that natural
pattern, it should turn around
and start down
around the year 2000.
So I did some research looking
for different articles
and, lo and behold, there were about 5
different kinds of ways of measuring,
all of which showed that the global
warming rise stopped about the year 2000.
So I found that very interesting
but I still hadn't heard,
but I didn't have any reason to
think I had any theory about why
we had this spiky pattern and
why it was now going down.
And then, I forget how
I heard about it,
but I heard about the Electric Universe
and I bought the book The Electric Sky
and read that
and it was just, I mean the...
it's just so obviously
that it had to be true
because what you see
in the cosmos are...
you know, these beautiful images like
from the Hubble Telescope and everything,
they all look like the kind of plasma discharges
that you can create in the laboratory.
And we know that the
universe is 99% plasma.
So, if what we have is the plasma
universe and what we see are
what looked like plasma discharges
then it makes a whole lot of sense
to assume they are
plasma discharge.
[Michael] Right, it's way to common
sense approach to tell, Richard!
So, then I looked, sorry,
then I put the two
things together.
What I noticed about all these
spikes being a record
and the fact that the universe
is filled with electric currents
and we know by looking
at graphs, as I talk
and I think you're gonna be able to
put some of those up with our podcast,
one of the graphs
shows the current,
there's a current that comes
in to the Sun at both poles.
That's what powers the
Sun, that's what makes it shine.
But most of the current, it
goes around the chromosphere,
you know, around the corona and
then goes out over the equator,
that's what's called the
equatorial current sheet.
So that current is coming out across,
over the plane of the equator of the Sun,
and so it goes to
all the planets.
So there's a current that goes
from the Sun to the Earth
and again, just as with the Sun, the current
comes in at the North and South Poles
and it goes through
the ionosphere mostly,
some of it comes down as
lightning and weather events,
just like some of the current goes
into the Sun and causes it to shine.
Some also comes into the Earth but most
of it goes around through the ionosphere
and then goes out over the
equatorial plane of the Earth
and rejoins the current that's
flowing away from the Sun.
So that current that comes into
the Earth, that's what's visible
as the aurora, the northern
and southern lights.
Now, nobody's going to get sunburned
from standing under the aurora
so it's not obvious how, the fact that an
electrical current comes in to the Earth,
how that might cause heating.
That isn't, it still isn't
obvious how that happens.
But, the fact is that what else,
besides an electric current,
can cause spikes of energy
on all different scales?
Like the standard
theory for the ice ages
is that the Earth gets closer and
farther from the Sun, you know,
but if there were an orbital
variation of any kind
it would be exactly regular,
wouldn't be approximately regular.
An electric current
can carry any charge,
I mean, can carry any
amount of current.
Like, that's why you have spike
protectors on your computer power supply
cause it could suddenly be a
spike coming over the current.
So and if, like I, one thing
I did just, kind of, for fun
is, I recorded some music and
then looked at the graph
and what you see is something that looks
almost exactly like the climate record,
it's all spikes at
all different scales.
So the point is that an electric current
is capable of carrying a fractal pattern
that goes over a very,
very wide range of scales.
And electric.. you know, and
they're usually cyclical,
you know, they're usually
some kind of, discharges' circuits
tend to have cyclical
patterns in them.
[Michael] That's an
interesting point to raise
because our most viewed Space News to date
was on a, so-called, impossible neutron star.
Scientists, they observed what appeared
to be a pulsar with the brightness of,
I think t'was 10 million Suns,
and so that was a big problem
but we, I hear from apologists
for the mainstream viewpoint
and they say well, it's the
periodicity of a pulsar,
it has to be created by this kind of
mechanical spinning lighthouse effect.
It couldn't be
something electrical
because then you wouldn't get this
kind of regular pulsing signal.
What are your thoughts on that?
Well, you can create discharges
in the laboratory that pulse,
I mean, electrical circuits
do pulse, you know,
it's, that's how radio works, you have a
capacitor and a resistor and a power supply
and depending on how they're set you can
decide what frequency you're getting,
that is how you tune a radio.
So that's standard
behavior for circuits.
So, in other words, I had
this hypothesis that
the Earth's temperature record and the fact
that we're connected to an electrical circuit
could be...
so it could be an electrical
thing that causes climate change.
But I didn't have any...
I didn't have any empirical
verification of that at first.
Then, when I went to the Electrical
Universe conference in June,
I gave my talk,
there was another talk, but he
showed that the sunspot cycle,
which is the sunspot,
the number of sunspots basically is
measuring the electrical input to the Sun,
the more sunspots, the more electrical
energy coming into the Sun
which means the more electrical
energy that reaches the Earth.
Because, you know, it's
going to be proportional.
Double the energy into the Sun, you're
gonna double the energy into the Earth.
Well, there was a
minimum of temperature
around...
somewhere in the 1650,
1700, around in there,
if you look at the temperature
record for Greenland,
and it turns out
there was a minimum,
there was a very clear minimum of
sunspots at the exact same time.
So, what that, and then,
since then there's,
the sunspots have been increasing
and temperature has been increasing.
So there is a very
definite, strong,
not a slight, no one of these
things that points 1%, but
there's a very strong linear correlation
between electrical input and temperature.
Sort of, it's a strong
verification of the hypothesis
that it is electrical input to the Earth
which is causing climate variations.
[Michael] Ok, now what
might you say to a critic
who rejects the very notion of
an electrically powered Sun
or even an electromagnetic connection
between the, the Earth and the Sun,
when for instance, the
auroras here on Earth,
science now recognizes that the
Sun is the cause of the auroras
but they're still thinking
in terms of collisions.
So, what do you believe is
some of the best evidence
that the Sun actually is
an electrical phenomenon?
[Richard] Well, I
mean, that's really,
that's really a problem for the
whole electric universe community,
how do we get people
to look at the data?
I mean if you...
The Thunderbolts.info website, I
think, does a very, very good job.
It's not that we don't
have the arguments,
it's not that we don't
present them well,
it's not that we don't have data,
it's that mainstream cosmologists
and institution astronomers,
they were just not
tempted to look at it.
If someone told them, oh there's
an electric model of the universe,
they say; geez, well, there's also
sites to talk about UFOs, right?
You know,
I mean, they just
dismiss the idea.
If we could get them to actually look at
what is on the Thunderbolts.info website,
I think that works!
You know...
I don't think there's any failure
in our presentation abilities.
[Michael] Well, on the
climate change debate,
and most of the so-called
debates that I've seen,
we don't see an alternative
view of the Sun
or the Earth-Sun connection
really being presented.
A lot of the discussions
are political
and there's also debate
over the question of CO₂
and a question of the cause and effect
relationship between CO₂ and warming.
So what are your
thoughts on that?
Is there a correlation between CO₂ and
warming or is it the other way around
or do you think the whole issue
is horribly overinflated?
[Richard] Well, the thing is that,
if you look at the what the
articles they are publishing,
they always say things like, first year
on records since records have been kept.
Well, the thing is they didn't start
keeping records until into the 1800s
and there has been 200 years
of warming since 1800,
there's no doubt about that.
It's just that that matches 200 years
of warming we've had in the year -1,000,
in the year 0 and in the year 1000
and so now we're having a peak in 2000.
So there was an accidental in correlation between
the beginning of the Industrial Revolution
and a natural temperature rise
that was going to occur anyway.
Now why the, so-called, climate scientists
aren't looking at the long-term record,
that's, I think, a
political question.
I think there's political reasons for that,
which is really a different subject.
But the fact is that, if you
look at the long-term record,
you can see that this correlation between
carbon dioxide of the Industrial Revolution
and 200 years of warming has
been a complete coincidence.
And it turns out that...
let's see, we have one graph here from John
Christy of the Earth System Science Center
and what it shows is,
it shows a red line
which is what the...
what that CO₂ models say is going
to happen with temperature
and then they have a green and a blue line
which would show the actual measured temperature
from satellites
and other sources.
Up until 1995, or so, they
were tracking each other.
The so-called CO₂ models
were tracking temperature.
But beginning, you know,
just before the year 2000,
the CO₂ models are now going
way up into the stratosphere
and the actual real temperatures are
flattening out and beginning to decline.
So that really tells the story.
It's been an
accidental correlation
and now the correlation is
breaking down because nature is...
and the other thing is that the rate of increase
of heating was not any higher than normal.
In other words, there could have been
both CO₂ warming and natural warming,
that would have been possible,
but then the spike would have
gone up at a steeper rate.
But it's not,
it's going up at exactly the same rate
that it went up the previous 3 spikes.
So there's no evidence whatsoever
of any influence from CO₂.
If you actually study the...
I mean, I've seen studies of
greenhouse gas effect, okay?
And so, I mean, you can study CO₂ as
a greenhouse gas in a test tube
or in a beaker or, you
know, in the laboratory.
And what you find is that
it's a logarithmic thing
where, when you, if you,
start off with no CO₂
and put some in, then you get a
very rapid rise in temperature.
But as you begin to get
a certain level of CO₂,
then the effect of it drops
off to almost nothing.
So, by the time you get to
about 265 parts per million,
you're not getting any effect
at all of adding more CO₂.
So, in other words,
we already had experienced the maximum
that CO₂ can contribute to warming
before the Industrial
Age even came along.

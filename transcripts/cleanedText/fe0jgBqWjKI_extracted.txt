In recent years, a profound development
has been unfolding in astrophysics,
the inevitable acknowledgement
of tremendous electric currents
at the largest cosmic scales.
One of the most stupendous
electromagnetic cosmic phenomena
is the collimated, light years long,
jets produced at active galactic nuclei.
Recently, the obvious
electrical nature of these jets
has been explored in scientific papers
published in peer-reviewed journals.
One such paper entitled
"The jets of active galactic nuclei
as giant coaxial cables" summarizes,
"...our results have now yielded firm
evidence that many ― possibly all ―
active galactic nuclei jets have
inward currents along their axes
and outward currents in a more extended
region surrounding the jets....
It also indicates that astrophysical jets are
fundamentally electromagnetic structures..."
Another paper entitled "Electric
Currents along Astrophysical Jets"
also argues for cosmic-scale
electric currents
though also doing so from the
framework of gravitational theory.
The author states, "Several researchers
have reported direct evidence
for large-scale electric
currents along astrophysical jets.
Quite unexpectedly, their directions are
not random as would have been the case
if the magnetic field were generated
by a magnetohydrodynamic dynamo.
Instead, in all
kiloparsec-scale detections,
the inferred electric currents are found
to flow away from the galactic nucleus.
This unexpected break of symmetry
suggests that a battery mechanism
is operating around the
central black hole."
And here we see emphasized the fundamental
differences between Standard Astrophysical Theory
and Plasma Cosmology and
the Electric Universe.
Astrophysicists can only imagine
colossal gravity, a black hole,
producing tremendous magnetism which then
produces the stupendous electric currents.
In this episode, retired professor of
electrical engineering, Donald Scott,
offers the Electric
Universe interpretation,
first addressing a basic
problem in cosmology:
what is the real source
of magnetism in space?
We have to realize that magnetic fields are
caused by one thing and one thing only.
That's the movement of charge, in
other words, electric currents.
Electric currents create magnetic fields and
when magnetic fields collide with conductors,
then currents will be induced, that is to
say initiated, created in those conductors.
You can't have one
without the other.
But anyway, they've been very reluctant
to mention electric currents until
very, very recently, when they do,
indeed, mention electric currents.
So, one was "Electric Currents along
Astrophysical Jets" by Ioannis Contopoulos.
When I saw this, I went,
"Wow, electric currents and jets, that
sounds just like Birkeland currents!"
Until you begin to
read the article,
and I do admit they do mention
electric currents, so that's,
that's two points to
remember and that's good.
But I think it's the first
sentence in the article,
"Astrophysical black holes and
their surrounding accretion disks
are believed to be threaded by grand
design helical magnetic fields.
There is strong
theoretical evidence."
Now, I don't know what "strong
theoretical evidence" means.
There's either strong observational
evidence or a well-believed theory
but there's no such thing as
"strong theoretical evidence."
"But the main driver of their winds
and jets is the Lorentz force
generated by these fields and their
associated electric currents."
That's good.
The Lorentz forces certainly are
at play in Birkeland currents.
Then they go on and said, "Several
researchers have reported
direct evidence for large-scale electric
currents along astrophysical jets."
Good!
"Quite unexpectedly, their directions are
not random as would have been the case
if the magnetic field were generated
by a magnetohydrodynamic dynamo."
Oh, oh, there we
go again, dynamos.
If you look up the definition
of dynamo in Wikipedia,
and I did it just to
be sure I was right.
The dynamo is an electrical generator
that produces direct current.
In other words, it's
a DC generator.
It's a way Edison made DC current
in Chicago, I think it was.
But that has nothing to do, really,
with what's going on in space.
I don't think we really have any use for
dynamos and what they use this word,
almost like a magic Shibboleth
that it's a dynamo caused it.
Anyway, "Magnetic fields are
an important constituent
of cosmic plasmas at all
astrophysical scales.
They are thought to be produced by 'seed'
fields generated by random currents
that are amplified by dynamo action
in planetary and stellar interiors,
accretion disks and generally
rotating astrophysical plasmas."
I mean, other than the fact that
they mentioned astrophysical plasma,
everything there is
wrong or non-existent.
There's no such thing as accretion
disk, they like to think about.
It's well-known that Tony Peratt said
that in the Los Alamos laboratory,
they would try to simulate an accretion
disk and totally failed, miserably.
They couldn't do it and if they mixed
plasma in with their simulation
and allowed for Maxwell's
equations to be used as well,
then yes, you could get
the thing to accrete.
But without plasma,
without electricity,
there's no such thing as a
magnetic accretion disk.
But anyway, there's another paper
which I think is less obviously wrong
in many of its points but still
has some things to worry about.
That one is "The jets of AGMs (active
galactic nuclei) as giant coaxial cables."
This paper was written by Denise C.
Gabuzda and her associate authors
Nagle and Roche in the Department of Physics
at the University College Cork, Ireland.
And the first sentence
in that paper is,
"Active galactic nuclei (AGNs)
release vast amounts of energy,
whose ultimate source is a supermassive
black hole in the galactic nucleus.
In so-called radio-loud AGNs..."
Remember that radio-loud,
that's important.
"Radio loud AGNs, two relativistic jets
of plasma emanate from the nucleus,
presumably along the rotational
axis of the black hole."
In other words, they can't let go of black
holes and gravity and all this other nonsense,
when the evidence is right
in front of their face!
She says, radio-loud AGNs.
What makes loud radio noise?
Answer ― double layers.
That's been well known for decades since
Hannes Alfven won the Nobel Prize in 1970.
Let me just conclude by saying, in
the end of that paper by Gabuzda,
her Figure 2 is almost
an identical figure
to one that I published in my paper
in "Progress In Physics" in 2015.
It's a cross section of
the Birkeland current.
It shows counter-rotating currents and
magnetic fields and that's indeed true.
So if she gets it that right, why can't she
let go of the supermassive black holes?
There's no excuse for anyone with any claim
to being an investigator of cosmic phenomena
as not to know about the
seminal prizable work
of people like C.E.R. Bruce, Ralph
Juergens, Earl Milton, Wal Thornhill,
Tony Peratt, Hannes Alfven,
Birkeland, and many others.
These people have staked out
their rightful claims years ago
and it's shameful that their work is
being ignored as if they never had lived
and worked for years to
promote these concepts.

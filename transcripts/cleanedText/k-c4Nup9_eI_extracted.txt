Let me give a brief hypothesis: fundamentally that the Earth
has been influenced by electrical discharge. It's not the only
thing it's been influenced by, but how can we
quantify that? So with that background I'll have to
talk about the geological effects of running water,
an important component of our past and it still is
measured today. Electric discharges on dielectric
media is something we can do in the lab and as
you've seen in the past few talks, electric discharges
are scalable. The fundamental aspect of these studies
is that what we do in the lab, if we have a source for it, at
the galactic scale or at the earth scale, it can occur and we
can measure it. You can't do that with water.
That's the only drawback to water, you can only
scale it a few orders of magnitude in the laboratory.
And the fractal analysis is a tool which we'll use
to measure these items. So, I'll take you through how I
measured some of these landforms and compare them to existing
electric discharges. So, really what is water?
Water flows all over the earth, you can find many
pictures of it, we can measure it, we can measure what it
actually does on the earth. Electrical discharges however, are
a little bit different. They have fractal patterns, they're
somewhat chaotic, but also ordered in their discharge patterns.
I'll show a few other pictures from captured lightning.
They do a lot of great work with these Lichtenberg
patterns in polyacrylic-type resins and you get these
beautiful dendritic patterns. So, we can actually measure
these items in the lab and we'll talk about that a
little bit more. So, let's be honest. Many of you flew
here, looked over the earth and saw some pretty perplexing
landscapes. And now we can view that on our laptops,
and we can measure things on our laptops. Okay.
As a chemist - I'm a chemist, I'm not a geologist, but I
understand the concepts behind some geology - I was
wondering if the current geological paradigm is missing
something. As I flew over the earth, I saw these tremendous
dendritic patterns and cratering and mountain tops right
next to floodplains and other different topological
features. So, I was wondering, we can talk
all we want about other mechanisms, but if we don't have
a quantitative way to measure that, no one will hear us.
So is there a quantitative relationship to the various
topological aspects of the earth? And I believe there is,
and that's what fractal analysis will tell us.
I'm from New Jersey, Northern New Jersey.
It is more than Newark Airport, there are some beautiful
regions in New Jersey. Where I live there are a lot of
granite outcrops, a lot of very strange hogbacks that
run from the north to the west or north northwest.
Beautiful Lake Region. So that's about 10 square miles there
on Google Terrain. As we back out an order of magnitude, we see
some interesting aspects to the topology. We see our
Appalachian Mountains here. Folded patterns. Supposedly
these are ancient mountains that have been eroded
away. But right up, buttoned against them, are
dendritic patterns and caverns, extensive canyons
in central Pennsylvania, formed by water presumably.
This butts up against the coast which is thought to be a
flood plain, and there's beautiful Newark down there. If
you back out more on the East Coast, it then comes up to the
flood plains of the Mississippi region. Ozarks are down here.
New Hampshire, the granite state. Granite outcrops
everywhere. Fairly high mountains up there. But again,
the Appalachians stretch down throughout Virginia.
And you have your Chesapeake Bay there.
So, in terms of scaling - when we back out from our small
10 square mile aspect - we see some very unique features at
different scales. We've already seen in the past number of
presentations - there haven't been that many already - that we
can assume, at least for the hypothesis, that the earth
was bathed in equilibration of electrical energy. From the
Sun? From the galaxy? From other bodies? We
don't know. That was the past. That is an
’origins’ question. That is a different conversation.
But what we can do, is we can measure
what's left over, and we can see if we can draw any
conclusions from that. So, in that sense - this is a slide
borrowed from Wal Thornhill - if the current is coming
in on our galaxy. We are just a very small subset
of this. Again, it goes back to scale - Michael Claridge showed
that so well - it goes back to scale. We are just a very,
very small speck of dust on one of these arms.
If there is electric current flowing through these arms,
it is reasonable to assume that we've been influenced by
that in the past. Again, from Wal's presentation, this is
just a local hypothesized environment of the plasma solar
system. And where our incoming charge is coming from. From our
plasma pinch currents. Again, look at the scale. The sun
is still but a small speck on this overall space of things.
And then from a size scale from a NASA view, our little blue
dot of earth here, we are very small compared to the sun. So,
it's reasonable to expect that large changes in the
sun's output could influence us dramatically, now that we
know we're tied electrically to it. We know that in the
late 1850s, a tremendous corona affected telegraph lines,
blew out many of them. If such a corona would
happen these days, we'd be in loads of trouble.
But we also have to realize that electrical effects are
not the only effect. Many years of very hard work by very
smart people have established certain aspects of fluvial
erosion. Erosion by glaciers. It does occur. We can't deny
that. But on what scale? What is the order
of magnitude of a fluvial erosion versus
a massive electric thunderbolt brought about
by discharge across the earth's atmosphere?
So, these discharges across dielectrics do
exhibit fractal type patterns. What is a fractal?
Many of you might be familiar with the Mandelbrot
set. It's a very fun whirlwind through YouTube.
If you zoom in and it goes and then repeats to infinity no
matter where you increase your magnification on this set.
That's a fractal. It is the same as it is near as it
is from far. So, discharges across dielectrics - a
dielectric being some sort of insulator - exhibit these kind
of fractal characteristics. The ‘capture lightning’ folks do
this marvelously. This is a discharge across
polycarbonate and as you zoom in to infinity, you
could theorize that it extends down to a single electron path
in these dendritic patterns. Now, interestingly enough, when
fractal analysis started coming about (Mandelbrot
pioneered this in the early 70s and 80s, published a book)
shorelines were the first to be analyzed [because]
they did exhibit some sort of fractal characteristics.
In this case it's Chesapeake Bay. We see our dendritic pattern
here, and also some could be brought about by flow of the
rivers, from rainfall, from constant season changes. But
what are the main effects? How much of an effect does the
fluvial erosion of a riverbed have versus
an electrical origin? Can we quantify that?
So that's what we'll explore. If you go walking down
a street or on a muddy path and it rains, the rain
is going to fill in the path. It's that simple. We can see
that every day. So the hypothesis is, what if the earth
did experience these discharges which had a
profound effect on the topology of the earth?
But now we're under the influence of a [steady] state
of rain and snow erosion. Could these processes that had
already sculpted the earth, influence what we see in
the rivers today? Now, we do know that fluvial erosion
happens. We can measure it. We've seen it in the earth.
These are pictures from Alaska where you see the snowfall
actually freezing and then melting and carving river channels.
And then you have what's called alluvial fans towards the
bottom. As the water decreases its energy and dissipates
its energy, it spreads out. So this can be measured.
But there are other places where it does not happen
so clearly. Especially on Mars, when you look at craters.
At the last electric conference we had a wonderful tour
of the Mars geology. And the big discrepancy here is that
these alluvial fans actually go downhill. So it's
the wrong direction. So, there is a problem.
This is the edge of the Victoria crater. We would expect
these alluvial fans to actually increase as the fluids
run down to the bottom of the crater, but that does
not happen. There must be another mechanism in place,
because it does not account for fluvial creation of these
dendritic patterns. Fluvial patterns we know happen. Again,
Google Earth. Thank you! So, you can increase
your magnification. This is Canyon Lake down
in Texas. They had a lake dam breach and you
can see what happened to the limestone, the
surrounding limestone region. You can then pixelate
that and visualize that and do some measurements on it.
It's fairly linear, goes straight downhill
to the river where it feeds into the river.
We know it's a fluvial pattern. In the same
way you can do that on the great Mississippi.
I'm sorry, this is Mount St. Helens. I'll get to the
Mississippi on another slide. The Mount St. Helens eruption
happened. The pyroclastic flow flowed down to the
lowest region. You can also quantify that, pixelate it
and look at the flow of where it occurred. It also 
had some side channels here that I forgot to put in.
Now we get on to fluvial patterns.
This is like Armistad down in Texas.
This has been dammed, so this has restricted
the flow of the river over the course of time.
And what we see, in stark contrast to an
existing river flow, is a dendritic pattern occurring.
Why does this occur? Because you're changing the base level.
The base level is an important fundamental aspect of
geology that says water is going to flow to the
lowest level. And if there's an erosive layer there,
it's going to eventually erode it away and create a new base
level. If there is a level there that cannot be eroded away,
that will be your base level. So my question is,
if this is an existing base level and this is the river,
how did these existing dendritic patterns form? If you
increase your base level, it's going to fill into what was
already there. But those should have already flowed
from somewhere else into the base level of the river.
So it's kind of like a cat chasing its tail now, and we're
trying to figure out how to deconfound these factors.
In the same way you can look at the Mississippi
flood plain. This is a part of the Mississippi River here,
in terrain mode, and you see extensive arrays of dendritic
channels, especially in the Ozark region, rolling channels. If
you ever driven through Missouri, it's just constant
up and down. The problem here is, if these were all
fluvial as a result of flooding, they would also
have this similar drainage pattern to a base level.
But they do not. In the same way if this had a base level,
we would see the same dendritic patterns brought about by
constant flooding of the Mississippi in
the near past, but we don't see that.
These dendritic patterns further do not drain
to anywhere; they are there on their own.
So this begs the question, what brought about these
dendritic patterns, and how can we measure them in the
differences between them and effluvial patterns?
As I mentioned, this concept of base level.
Reading through some of the basic textbooks on geology written
by Tarbuk. Say if you've taken an introductory geology course
Over and over he says, “Running water is the single
most important agent sculpting the Earth's land surface.”
That is a constant mantra of current geology.
And that's to be said, because they have
come up with the hypothesis as to how this water erodes,
and some models that are validated by experimental research.
The major factors include slope, bed, suspended
loads, the types of materials, depth, width,
physical barriers rainfall. These can all be
measured and modeled. This introduces the concept of
”design of experiments.” You have factors which you can
control, or at least monitor. And then you have your responses
including sedimentation; what's being brought down
this slope by rainfall or some sort of flood that gets
deposited on this new bedrock layer; the river flow; the flow
rate; the erosion rate - how fast the sedimentary layer is
deposited in the new area. So all these factors
can be measured and you can come up with models.
This in particular is from the Department of Agriculture,
a general technical report that people can use to
measure stream characteristics. And because of these
extensive stream characteristics, and also rivers - this
applies to rivers as well, but there are not as many
classifications, because it's pretty difficult to
classify larger systems. But you can see that the larger slopes
lead to straighter channels, in a very fundamental sense.
Lower slopes lead to what's called meandering and stream
capture, so these guys can capture over here and then you
can form other circular regions and that happens all the
time along the flood plains and also deltas, where the river
runs out to its current ocean and base level. So, we have
these pictures and we also can study what kind of erosion
rates happen with different types of gravel or base material.
But again, it all goes back to a certain base level; it all
has to eventually flow to the lowest point where it 
can get to. So right now 47 plus streams - I think the
the classification of rivers is around 30. What 
does that do for us for electrical discharges?
So now on to discharges simplified in one 
slide. So the charge buildup here. We have
two plates powered by an electrical source. We have an
electric field that builds up across the dielectric - the blue
being a dielectric, whether it be solid, liquid 
or gas. Eventually it's going to discharge if
you get enough charge built up. That's why capacitors
eventually break. The charge equilibrates by discharging
across the path. The factors: again we go back
to the ’design of experiments’ and monitoring
what we know in the system. Many things can influence
how this discharges your electrode materials; the
type of dielectric; the potential of electricity there; 
the surface topology of these two electrodes;
surface morphology; etc., etc. - small points
will increase the local electric field there.
Now the response is what you get out when this occurs.
Much like a lightning bolt, you get magnetic fields around the
current flow. You get a full spectrum of
light, anywhere from X-rays to visible light.
You get heat, manifested in heating up the local
surroundings; and possible nuclear interactions if it's strong
enough and you have a pinch effect. That's a very, very
simplified version of discharges. But it enables us to measure
things in the laboratory so we can monitor our factors,
we can measure our responses and build models from them.
And because electricity is scalable, we can assume that
things scale up. Now a lot of work has been done on
fractal analysis of dielectric discharges, because
this is very important for the wire and cable industry,
for those who make transformers and power supplies.
You can see, as early as 1990 to 1984, people have
been doing work on the fractal dimensions of dielectric
discharges, and fundamentally what they found is
that they all possess a certain fractal dimension
that's characteristic of the material. This is
actually an internet picture of a discharge across a
transformer and to the insulator, but these are from
the papers that I studied. From Kudo’s paper where
he measured the fractal properties of those items.
Typically, they were performed in high- voltage
discharges across solid plastic or a gaseous medium.
So now it's quiz time. Some of you
have seen this already, so don't cheat.
So I'm going to tell you there are three pictures here
that I've pixelated and turned into a binary picture to
illustrate the scalability of electricity assuming
that the Grand Canyon was formed by an electric
discharge - probably not the only thing that was going on.
But let's just for the moment assume a certain part of it is.
Try to match each letter with the particular
 picture. I'll give you a minute here.
So we have orders of magnitude scale here: centimeters
from a polycarbonate discharge to meters of a discharge on
cement, and then kilometers for the canyon.
So everyone got their choices? All right.
I heard some awe’s. How many people got it. Be proud of
yourselves how many people got it right? Just for curiosity.
All right. Okay. It's not that easy, when things 
are pixelated and you normalize everything.
So what you're doing is you're normalizing all of your
particular topography, only that which you can see
in terms of what was formed by the discharge.
And we'll come back to that in just a moment.
So you can see here that scalability is an effect.
So, I thought about how rivers are formed,
how discharges could affect the surface of the earth,
and I kind of dug it down to the main effects here. This is
called a Cause-Effect (Ishikawa) diagram. We use this a lot
to identify problems in industry or whatever we're working
with. On the left here is ‘riverbed’. How do they form?
Well, we know they're formed somewhat by fluvial
events. But they could also be formed by
electrical discharges. Ignore the [characterization
part] for the moment. Technically, you're not supposed to have
characterization tools in with this diagram. But I wanted to
share this to run parallel with these. So the fluvial
factors - again the factors that influence the fluvial
erosion of rivers - include the following. You have age
consistency, sufficient rainfall, et cetera. You can
read through these: high slopes, low slopes, tectonics,
dissolved flow, suspended load, all these factors. And
then what I did, is I kind of assigned categories - colored
categories - to those that are measurable and testable by
what we can do in the lab or in the field. Also red, which is
not testable, it fails requirements to be a scientific study.
You cannot repeatably measure it. And also historical
accounts, because there are a lot of historical accounts of
certain electrical plasma discharge phenomena which
we now know. So, in terms of the rivers, I don't know
if this color is going to show up enough, but 
really what I saw (and we can talk about this
afterwards if you disagree), but really
tectonics and pre-existing geology are
the assumptions. They're not testable. But nearly everything
for fluvial, existing rivers can be measured, but you
can't measure that which has happened in the past.
So that automatically eliminates some aspects of this.
For electrical discharge, we have a few different items here.
Either a large solar outburst, or close-to-earth encounters,
with various items. You could probably come up with some
other factors here. But for the most part, we now know
that there is evidence of current in space.
Right? We've talked about that a few times.
Even in the popular press, I shouldn't say
popular, but academic press, there is
measurement of electric current and [large] scale
jets coming from galaxies. So it does occur in space.
We can now use that as part of our toolbox. To say,
electric current is scalable. We know what happens at the
galactic scale. ”For one component of
this jet we obtain for the first time a
determination of galactic-scale electric current and its
direction...” This is in the Astrophysics Journal. Okay, so
that's encouraging. So from a factor we know
that compositional changes can affect how
electric discharge occurs. So, you can see that all these
things add in to electrical discharge, making it somewhat
of a feasible phenomenon. We have some historical sources
from the ancients and interplanetary distances being less than
they [are] in the present. It could be debated,
but I do believe we have some historical accounts of that.
But anything that's [stated] without drawing on any
references, is inferred. Breakdown of the atmosphere.
Thomas Gold and some others have said that you need a magnetic
flux of greater than about 20 Gauss to have that discharge
occur across the Earth. So it could have happened in the past.
Now for characterization. The only things we're missing here,
anything that draws on the past geologic time scales
and is non-measured (or kind of the present is key
to the past). Because we don't know if that riverbed was
flowing as fast as it is now. Especially if we can't find a
sediment load that it left over. That's an important 
aspect. So that's one way we can break down the
problem, and trying to visualize it as to what factors are
most important. I mentioned measurement methods here.
So now we're going to get into what I looked at.
A fractal is a self-similar pattern. In other words, it's
”the same from near as they are from far.” Very few
things are perfectly self-similar in nature. That
means if you increase your magnification all the way,
they look the same as you back out. Most of the time
they're known as self-affine. In other words, they're 
scaled by different amounts in certain directions.
That's more the case with riverbeds. But [some] of them
are known to be self-similar, and there's some separate
tests you can do that I have not done yet. Now it's 
interesting in all the research with riverbeds, it's
really only confined river networks that exhibit
self-affinity, as well as some self-similarity.
Regular flowing networks of rivers such as the Mississippi
and other large river networks do not exhibit that.
So already we're looking at the landform confounding our
analysis of this. So the landform is dictating how the river
flows. So, we tested the dissimilarity between these
measured fractal dimensions of electric discharges on
what we know in the lab with landforms that we
know on the earth. Taking it back to the picture.
Think about the picture. You can think about any
picture here that has a hole and then rain or some
sort of flow rate moving in. It's going to be 
captured. Measuring the fractal analysis of the
earth. As I mentioned, Mandelbrot did a little bit of 
this in his book. It's a great book; I think a trendsetter.
He did a lot of analysis of the coasts and now people
are taking that into three dimensions and measuring some
aspects of geomorphology. Most recently, I came across a 
paper that I think is very powerful in that it studied ‘isolines’ at
varying altitudes, and I'll show you what I mean by that
in just a moment. So basically, they're taking fractal
dimensions at varying altitudes on the whole
earth's surface because they have data for that.
I'll read you a little bit of this, “The quantitative analysis
of natural relief represents an objective form of aiding
in the visual interpretation of landscapes, as studies 
on coastlines river networks and global topography
have shown. Still, an open question is whether a clear
relationships between the quantitative properties of
landscapes and the dominant geomorphologic processes
(rain, wind, water) that originate them can be established.
In this contribution, we show that the geometry of
topographic isolines is an appropriate observable to
help disentangle such a relationship.” Not totally disentangle
it, but they're getting there. Really the conclusion though I
found is kind of surprising. ”A more detailed
inspection points to a relationship between the observed
features and the geological processes that shape the
planetary surface. We suggest that the erosive action of a
solid or viscous phase, the erosion of a flowing liquid phase 
or its action through wave breaking, and tectonics, are
geological agents which work towards increasing roughness
in the landscape. On the other hand, agents causing
sediment deposition, formation and pronounced smooth
slopes, or erosion through hydrostatic pressure (glacial)
caused by large masses of liquid or ice, represent
smoothing agents able to decrease the characteristic fractal
dimension.” The rougher you are, the higher
the fractal dimension. The smoother you
are, the lower the fractal dimension. The
problem I have with this is that they're
referring to water as doing the same thing. That's how I
interpret that. So typically what they get on a map is a
function of fractal dimension D as you can see that
1.8 from 1.0, and you can see that mountains obviously
are the highest fractal dimension. Okay. .....?
drawn by the coastlines which are fairly
smooth due to wave action and sediments on
the layer and then your intercontinental,
I guess, sea floors and your trenches,
they also were able to resolve. I'll go and
draw some conclusions from this with the 
next graph. But really a study of isoline. So,
basically what they're doing is, they're 
measuring a box-counting relationship. So the
measurement of your fractal dimension d is a
logarithmic relationship with the number of boxes
that they can fill into a certain area that's
scaled, and the scaling factor being eta.
So, on this map of New Jersey, another beautiful
region in the Congleton Preserve, you can fill in an
area at a thousand meters say, in height. You can fill in that
isoline with a certain number of boxes and count them. You
then do the same thing with a larger box, larger area for a
different isoline. For larger area you'll have a different
number of boxes. You can then get a plot. So this 
is from Baldassari’s paper which I just showed you.
You can see that at different elevations, you have an
increasing d-level as you increase your elevation up
to about 4,500 meters. That D-level is the slope 
of this line, and interestingly, below the sea and
right at sea level you have very low fractal
dimensions brought about by fluvial erosion.
So again, the fractal dimension increases with
increasing height, in elevation. I think that says
something about the mechanism of how these
mountains were formed. So what did I do?
In my spare time I took ImageJ, which is a microscopy analysis
software, a little bit wordy chart here. I apologize, but
I took the fractal dimension by the box counting
method, typically between 1.0 and 2.0.
The area of each image was between 500 and 1000 
miles squared. I was able to get a resolution of about
one pixel per 1/25th of a mile. So you may say, okay well,
these are three dimensional figures, how can you project
them in 2D? In some of the electrical studies they said
that this is valid as long as this projection on a 2D plane
has D values of 1.7 [or less]. So, the color-
coded data sets are from fluvial, which are
blue, known electrical events from the laboratorium from
literature papers, and then unknown structures from terrain
load captures. The image processing you can
accomplish fairly readily. It requires a little bit of
footwork to get rid of some of the roads and
whatnot on Google Earth. You grayscale it, and then
you binary it, and you get this binary pattern,
which you can then do your analysis on.
But furthermore, I skeletonized it because I knew
we were dealing with different elevations. So
the pattern that this follows can be a validation of about
600 meters from the center of this channel up to the side.
A way to kind of normalize your overall
patterning and distribute it to only the branched
pattern, is to skeletonize that. You can do that with your
software. So eventually, what you're getting is only a
skeletonized pixelated version of only the pattern.
And then you can measure your box counting map
method for your fractal dimension. So here's a 
picture of Mississippi that I was talking about.
Numerous flood plains here, from the pixelated binary
you get a D value of 1.3. This is up in Newfoundland.
You're getting a value of about 1.7 even
just with the standard binary image.
A lightning bolt: again we're projecting this onto a 2D
which is valid. Again about 1.3 and again this is limited
resolution. This is far away. You can't get all
the little dendrites that are coming off this.
So that's one aspect that I think the electrical analysis
is missing. In that we can't resolve all those fine
dendrites, except with some of the laboratory 
tests that I took. So a little bit of statistics here.
You all remember your Students t-test? 95 confidence 
interval. I'm confident that this is different than that.
What this is doing is, because I have different values of
population sets, it's a different kind of Students t-test.
So, when I did that with just a straight pixelated version,
nothing was different. And with the skeletonized version, some
differences did appear, namely when you skeletonize the
landforms you don't have that drastic of a drop in D-value, as
opposed from your river values. And indeed you
get a very big significant difference with that
skeletonized value, because you're normalizing all
the elevations. And what happens here is the fluvial
value decreases to about the same value that Baldassari 
found in all the fluvial erosion studies: between 1.0 and 1.2.
The unknown structures that I measured on the
earth, are equivalent to electrical structures.
So, statistically speaking, the unknowns are more
statistically dissimilar to fluvial events than they
are from electrical events in the laboratory. So, really what
that skeletonized value is doing is it's normalizing the depth.
Okay. And we can say that these structures are self-defined.
These D-values are fairly high, enough to be self-defined.
So, really in conclusion the present data set is limited
right now to only 33 counts. I'm working on getting more.
I think electrical patterns are better matched
towards our landforms and the fluvial patterns.
But we have to realize that other data includes fluvial
erosion, because rivers have been flowing for some time. So, we
have to account for that. We have to know the systems that
we're measuring very well, to account for the fact that some
fluvial erosion may have occurred.
So it's consistent with the literature trend.
There's a lot to do, there always is. But really, what 
effects do such discharges have on an environment?
I'm interested in shock-induced changes. That's 
something I do all the time. What does that do to rock and
what does that do to populations of organisms around that,
if it did occur? Does that account for many mysterious
losses of populations of ancient cultures? Was that due
to temperature? Also radioactive decay that was already
mentioned earlier. Some profound implications on
geological sciences here that we have to explore more.
So again, hopefully the further augmented data set,
with more analysis [will give us] a better picture of what's
going on. I'd like to acknowledge Michael Steinbacher
and Montgomery Childs also for their discussions.
I got a copyrighted copy of Google Earth,
so we won't get sued. And if anyone wants to
contact me, there's my contact information.
I'll be happy to take any questions. Thanks.

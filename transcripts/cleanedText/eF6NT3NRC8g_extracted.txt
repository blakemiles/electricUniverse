NASA's New Horizons mission
to the dwarf planet Pluto
has provided scientists on Earth with
countless puzzles and mysteries.
From impossible sand dunes,
which were never expected on the
tiny planet's frozen surface;
to equally unexpected
giant mountains;
to surprising absence of
so-called "impact craters"
and selective regional cratering
with highly circular craters
not to be expected on
any Kuiper Belt object.
The Plutonian moons have proved equally
surprising, such as the moon Charon
with it's puzzling troughs and trenches
stretching for hundreds of miles.
And now, a team working with
the Chandra X-ray Observatory
has reported perhaps the greatest
surprise about Pluto to date,
the discovery of the emission
of X-rays from Pluto.
The team is also reporting that
Pluto has a giant comet-like tail,
which the scientists believe maybe as
much as 1,000 times the radius of Pluto.
The scientists say of
Pluto's surprising X-rays:
"We have just detected, for the first time,
X-rays coming from an object in our Kuiper Belt,
and learned that Pluto is
interacting with the solar wind
in an unexpected and
energetic fashion.
We can expect other large Kuiper
Belt objects to be doing the same.
Before our observations, scientists
thought it was highly unlikely
that we'd detect
X-rays from Pluto."
Today, physicist Eugene Bagshov begins
the first in a four-part series,
offering his analysis of the most compelling
scientific data from the Plutonian system.
In the recent months, we have seen
more and more data being released
and analyses being made in the
wake of the historical Pluto flyby
of the New Horizons space probe.
Let us briefly review the available
data in some of the publications
to see if they might provide a noble
outlook on this warped planet
and maybe even clues relevant to
the Electric Universe agenda.
First, I would like to discuss
the visual part of the planet,
and what is happening
on its surface.
When you look at Pluto, probably the
first thing that catches your eye
is its incredible diversity.
We might see quite complex and strange
land forms as well as more regular ones:
craters, mountains, rills,
valleys, smooth plains,
"pitted uplands, bladed
terrain, snakeskin terrain,"
and even something that resembles sand or
snow dunes and other things like that.
So, from the first look it doesn't
appear to belong in the place
where it is situated
right now in our system.
Rather it looks more similar to
our terrestrial planet family
or maybe Saturn's moon Titan.
In previous Space News
episodes about Pluto,
we've already touched on
that subject and discussed
the possible origins of this dwarf
planet as a captured object,
possibly former moon
of a giant planet.
So the diversity of its surface
seems to support this idea,
which is consistent with the EU
scenario of planetary chaos.
Probably the most distinctive
feature on the whole planet,
or at least the part that we've been able to
observe, is the so-called Tombaugh Regio,
a bright feature sitting slightly to the right of
center of the New Horizon's encountered hemisphere
and on the opposite side of the planet, with
respect to the prime meridian of Pluto.
The prime meridian is counted from the spot
above which the biggest moon Charon hovers.
So, this mentioned region
cannot be seen from Charon.
The brightest part of Tombaugh Regio
is called the Sputnik Planum,
and in a lot of ways it's very different
from all the other visible regions.
According to the spectroscopical
data, Sputnik Planum terrain
is mostly composed of nitrogen,
carbon monoxide, and methane ices.
We might see very bizarre
cellular patterns on its surface.
From the visual data available, they
seem to be a slightly convex features
separated by shallow troughs
about 100 meters deep.
It is thought that this might
be caused by convection,
since the mentioned ices are somewhat
soft in the present conditions
and might flow almost like a very viscous
liquid, creating these convective polygons.
The heat source for this
convection is unknown.
Basically a few
versions were proposed.
The remainder of the internal heat left
from the epic of planetary formation,
the heat from radioactive
elements in the deeper layers,
or maybe there were freezings of the
hypothesized subsurface oceans,
which would also liberate a
significant amount of latent heat.
Aside from those
cellular structures,
the Sputnik Planum demonstrates
another remarkable feature,
the complete absence of craters.
So, whatever it is that shapes the surface
of this region, it should do it fast
and strong enough to erase the possible
cratering that could have been present.
Aside from the
convective resurfacing,
another acting force could
be the atmospheric erosion,
mainly the sublimation and subsequent re-freezing
of those ices on a daily and seasonal basis.
It is also supposed that the mixture of
those 3 ices might non-trivially interact
with water ice and could possibly
flow into the nearby regions,
causing some geological surface changes,
pretty much like glaciers do on Earth.
I'd also like to note here that
electrical erosion, of course,
might also cause the material
removal and deposition,
and it is unknown whether it
might play a role today or not.
At this point, we have
no idea about how strong
is the electric field
in Pluto's atmosphere.
But as we'll see later, we
have some other evidence
that might suggest
it is present there.
I'd like to venture now
into some more speculation
and discuss the possible nature of the
Tombaugh Regio and Sputnik Planum.
It seems likely indeed that,
as the scientists suggest,
this is the planetary scale reservoir of
nitrogen, methane and carbon monoxide ices.
But why does it occupy
this particular place?
If the atmospheric dynamics of Pluto
is mostly governed by sublimation
and refreezing of ices, then they
might end up anywhere on the planet.
It is actually known that the atmospheric
characteristics are pretty homogeneous there,
pretty much the same all
over the Pluto's globe.
So, one might expect more or less
homogeneous distribution of ices,
at least over the strips
of the same latitude,
and indeed we see those
ices in various places
but not anywhere near
that kind of quantity.
So, this leads to the question of
the formation of this feature.
Maybe initially there was a
significant terrain slope
and a huge basin in this
part of the Planum.
Actually, the New Horizons team seems
to think the same thing, I quote:
"Sputnik Planum is mostly bordered
by locally higher terrain,
which suggests that it fills
a topographic basin."
And later this basin could have
been filled with volatiles
since the temperature on
Pluto rises with altitude.
So, the terrain depressions act
like refrigerators, of sorts.
NASA scientists seem to consider
that some large impact event
as being the reason for
Sputnik Planum formation.
Yet the two recent papers
that model the ice convection
do not consider the depth of this reservoir
to be more than around 10 kilometers.
But what if it's not formed by an impact,
what if it's significantly deeper?
Just as a wild speculation, I'd like
to note that this region is located
wide at the equator
of the dwarf planet,
where the orbit of Charon
and other moons lie.
And it has roughly the same diameter as
Charon, a bit more than 1,000 kilometers.
Could it possibly be the very
place of Charon's birth?
Maybe it was somehow torn out of Pluto
or perhaps the material was just
excavated electrically during one of the
chaotic events in the Pluto's past.
The same event could have led to
the rich volatile loading on Pluto
and birth of its
other satellites,
which have later settled closer
to their current resonant orbits.
There've probably been
dozens of other satellites,
which had had too unstable
orbits to survive.
Although, as I mentioned earlier, the
actual point above which Charon hovers
is located right on the opposite side of
Pluto with respect to the Sputnik Planum.
So, if this version of
their origins is correct,
there should have also been a certain
period of stabilization of orbits,
possibly including strong
mechanical and maybe
even electrical stresses
to the respectful bodies
during which Charon eventually migrated
to the opposite side of the planet
at the same time significantly
slowing down Pluto's rotation.

Well, what is that strange extraterrestrial-looking
figure, rising above the horizon of Easter Island?
It's actually an electric discharge formation. It was pointed
out to me by 
Tony Peratt, about 12 to 13 years ago, when he was one of the most
distinguished plasma scientists on the
planet. And when people come to The
Thunderbolts channel on YouTube, sometimes they're
looking for information on aliens and UFOs and so on.
And they hit upon “Symbols of an Alien
Sky” and they get something much different.
All right. So, to pose the question, ”Has our sky
changed completely in the last few thousand years?”
We're addicted to projecting our sky on the past,
but the truth of the matter is that the sky has changed
dramatically, and these changes had a huge impact on
the early cultures. And this is a testable claim. The
formation seen in the ancient sky can actually be
reconstructed by a systematic use of a protocol. A
protocol for extracting reliable conclusions
from global witnesses, despite the fact that
the witnesses, individually and locally, are not reliable.
This has to do with the convergence of global testimony on
highly unique details, where the convergence would not
be possible in the absence of an extraordinary globally
witnessed provocation. So, I hope everyone can kind of
come to grips with the inherent logic of a historical detective
adventure, where patterns lead you into an
entirely new world of ancient experience.
It happened just a few thousand years ago,
when we lived in the presence of the gods.
Planetary powers ruled the celestial
theater in the lost age of gods and wonders.

Planets gathered in close congregation as
if alive, engaging each other electrically.

But then the gods grew violent and they went to war, driving
human witnesses to take shelter in caves and rocky enclosures.
[Music]
Humans left to remember. To remember the powers of the
gods. Formations and cosmic events not to be forgotten.
Well, I have to take you back to the inspiration for a
life's work that came to me from Immanuel Velikovsky and
his book “Worlds In Collision” published in 1950.
In 1972, I began publishing a series on Velikovsky.
It culminated in ten issues that achieved a great deal
of scientific interest around the world. And it was the
number one best seller on more than one college
campus. And this series on “Immanuel Velikovsky
Reconsidered” led directly to a confrontation
between Velikovsky and Carl Sagan in 1974,
in February, in San Francisco. And this taught
me a lot about the power of institutions to
frame narratives. “The question that science forgot to
ask” was never addressed. And that question is, “Have
planets always moved on their present courses?”
Now, Velikovsky has the centerpiece of his
presentation in “Worlds and collision.” He said, the planet
Venus appeared in the ancient sky to people around the world,
as an earth-threatening comet. What a preposterous
idea. But he didn't pull that out of thin air.
He based that on global testimony that
identified Venus as a comet, wearing all of the
symbols and hieroglyphs and all of the stories that were
attached to comets in the different cultures. You cannot ignore
the power of that kind of convergence.
Well, here's the toughest question, and that's
the meaning of myth. Is there a meaning to myth that is
completely obscure, completely forgotten in our time?
And the answer is, absolutely so. The myths were born out
of a myth-making epoch. Human imagination responding to
extraordinary natural events. And that's where
archetypes come in. Because it's the global patterns
that actually point you in the direction of an ancient
experience around the world. And we have these different
archetypal themes - the fall from heaven of a celestial power.
That's a global idea. It has no roots in any experience
that we can identify today, and the
idea of a cosmic catastrophe, a deluge,
a rain-of-fire. The doomsday event giving rise
to universal doomsday anxiety. And why is it
that a little wisp of gas comes into
view as a comet, we begin thinking of the
end of the world? That's the power of the
archetypal theme on human imagination.
And the story, occurring around the world,
of a dying god; and the story of an ensuing cloud of
chaos that overwhelmed the world.
Clouds of chaos, armies of darkness in
the sky, throwing the world into confusion.
And then there is this incredible
archetypal theme of the mother goddess. And why would it
be of five visible planets that goddess is universally
identified as Venus. There are patterns that must have an
explanation. And the greatest surprise will come when we see
that these patterns are inseparably connected
to each other. And this includes the dark aspect,
the terrifying aspect of the mother goddess herself,
her terrible aspect. Now here's a theme that
you'll find around the world and it probably involves
the most active archetypal figure in all of world
mythology - the cosmic warrior. And why did it
happen that astronomers in different lands, when
they looked out at the planets, consistently identified
the planet Mars as a great warrior in an ancestral time?
And of course the warrior is intimately
connected with other themes. And that includes
the defeat of a dragon, a ludicrous monster said to
have attacked the world, and threatened to destroy
the entire world. And then we have,
very closely connected with the dragon
of chaos, we have a serpent figure that is so completely
preposterous, there's no conceivable basis for the inspiration
of the same features around the world.
That's a huge mystery. Feathered serpent,
long-haired serpent, fiery serpent, fire- spitting
serpent, these are all ludicrous ideas. And yet,
there is one theme that I don't believe anyone has
noticed in the conventional study of cultural themes
globally. And that is the association of that
serpent or dragon with a 'Stairway to Heaven'.
And this actually is an incredibly inspiring theme and
the details can be pieced together through the points of
agreement from the ancient cultures. And what you
will find is a direct convergence with the story that
plasma science can give - highest energy plasma discharge
producing the very forms that connect a serpentine upward
spiraling form to a stack of toruses. A stack of toruses
being exactly what was anciently identified as the stairway
of heaven. So, why a dragon figure? Why a serpent figure,
globally associated with a ladder or steps to the sky?
Now this is where Tony Peratt's work (which many
of you are familiar with) comes directly in to
verify the sequence of events that is involved
in this. In terms of the common human memories,
perhaps the most common is the ’tower of heaven’, the
scaling heaven - that was the ‘tower of Babel’ I suspect most
people here know that. And then the theme that just caught
my imagination, and caused me to live off of adrenaline
for two or three years. Until I realized that it
is possible to reconstruct a completely different
story - Saturn as the founder of a primeval paradise,
for example. And Saturn, enigmatically as the primeval
Sun. Now many people here may not even know
this that that the name ‘Helios’, the Greek ‘Helios’,
was archaically a name for Saturn. The Latin ‘sol’
was archaically a name for Saturn. Well, these
acknowledged connections have one thing in
common, and that is that they are all preposterous.
Not one finds an explanation in anything
in our natural world, anything occurring
in our time. And that includes this power,
Saturn - founder of the golden age -
becoming the devourer of its own children.
Now, I just want to acknowledge that my
interest in Saturn began with an outline I received
of a hypothesis that Immanuel Velikovsky had
developed - unpublished - relating to a
prior age of the planet Saturn. A very
unusual idea and one that he wanted to develop more
completely. But I grabbed ahold of that and two
or three years later, I got a contract with Doubleday
when it was the largest publisher in the world, for my
book “The Saturn Myth”. There are people here today
who were very much inspired by “The Saturn Myth”. That
reconstruction was just a narrow snapshot of a
particular configuration, and then my explanation for the
configuration changed as well and this is
the centerpiece that I will draw upon, to
establish a reference point - to go backwards and to
go forward in time. Because this is a complex dynamic
configuration in the sky, involving planets very
close to the earth, and putting this configuration in
three-dimensional space, is the key to testing
the implications of the model. The sizes of
the different planets, their colors, their relative motions
to each other, and most significantly, the appearance
of a bright crescent on the great sphere of Saturn. This is a
polar configuration. Standing at the pole, means that the axis
of the earth was aligned - in effect ran right
through - the hearts of those bodies. Now,
you cannot entertain that configuration
without including the rotation of that crescent
with the cycle of day and night. And that is a very profound
implication, or prediction of the model. Because the
daily cycle - particularly in early cultures,
and most particularly in Egyptian cultures - was
the heart of their sacred rites, celebrating a daily
cycle which is supposedly of the Sun. And here is a
model that is saying that that crescent revolved with the cycle
of day and night; there must have been a huge echo of that
into Egypt with its daily cycle celebrations.
”The Great Conjunction of Primeval Times”
takes you to the ancient imagery of the sun wheels.
‘The Great Conjunction’, I've used that phrase a lot, but
that principle of conjunction - a line running right through
the hearts of the planets - that actually is part of the
remembered tradition. Again, a ludicrous idea and what, in
the motions of planets today that never stand in perfect line,
what would have provoked that idea of a perfect
conjunction? And we have these engravings on stone
that only accentuate the improbability of all of this.
Cultures around the world presenting the same,
unrecognizable form? The only response has been to call these
drawings of the Sun. But if you actually examine these images,
globally, you find they have nothing in common with the Sun.
And more than that, as I intend to make clear here at
this conference, these images involve cultures,
naming the particular planets producing the images.
Now, follow the ‘Sun wheel’ and you'll
get to certain stylized images. These
stylized images - if you're going back through cultural
history, you'd still be after the rock art carvings -
there's a stylization that occurs in which concepts
begin to influence, because the apparition itself is no
longer present. But this stylized image of the Great
Wheel of Shamash, the “Sun God”, is very telling.
We have to ask ourselves, does the Sun and our sky look
like this? And this is actually requiring, I think, a
brutal honesty and that honesty can be helped along
by explicit statements of the astronomical texts -
”Shamash is the planet Saturn”. The story of
mythology is in fact the story of what happened to
these bodies. And there's too much specificity
in this, to think that you could just
toy with different ideas and make something up that
would work. Make something up and it would be refuted in
five minutes. The players in this configuration are
named. Saturn as primeval Unity, creator, central
sun, when heaven was close to the earth. Venus as star of
glory, mother goddess and in the removal, the unraveling of
that configuration becoming the great comet. And Mars,
the universally celebrated warrior-hero, warrior-king, and
the essential identity of the cosmic thunderbolt.
What I want to draw attention to
always, is specificity and utter uniqueness. There is
not an archetypal theme on the planet, to the best of my
knowledge, that would ever be expected by anything we ever
experienced. How does it happen that the world presents to us
hundreds of archetypes, and they are connected
inseparably to each other? Each archetype being
illuminated by the network of archetypes and each
helping to illuminate the others. We're using then a
a body of evidence that reaches beyond the historical
testimony, into perspective from earth. Three-dimensional
perspective is incredibly demanding. Physical analogies
in the laboratory where exotic configurations are proposed
in plasma events between planets. And then we discover
that those are exotic, highly specific, forms that are in fact
available in the laboratory. And yes,
consistency. Contradiction is the
signature of a mistake. If there's a
mistake, it will show up in the inconsistency
between those levels of evidence. Now, I want to talk
about a convergence of myth and science which has already
been acknowledged by David Novak. And this
occurred primarily when in the mid-1990s, I
had the privilege of meeting Wal Thornhill
and he stated to me how electric phenomena
would create the forms that I had reconstructed. That led,
just a few years later, to a convergence in 2000 with Tony
Peratt, again a leading plasma scientist in his time, and this
meeting with Tony Peratt was an astounding juncture for us.
He had identified ”the Christmas tree”.
[interruption]
[interruption]
What he called the Christmas tree, I identified as the
chain of arrows, and that set in motion one of the most
memorable conversations in my life. He asked me how that
configuration evolved and I described the filament up
the polar axis that divided into a stack of toruses.
First, conic embedded cones form, and
then flat toruses that were seen as the “tower
or ladder of the sky”. When Tony returned
to Los Alamos, he asked me to send him the
rock art. Instead of sending him hundreds
of rock art images, I just sent him this one.
Now, the reason I sent him just one was that I
was certain that that eye-mask form (that's
what we call it - it's a a global image), I was
certain that it was a plasma form and the “ladder of
Heaven” I had identified as toruses and he had said
that's the evolution of the Peratt instability
in the laboratory, an intimate connection
with the chain of arrows or the Christmas tree form.
So, I was confident that when he saw that, he
would recognize it as a plasma form, and he even identified
the parts there. And then he sent me this very unique
plasma form and that is the eye-mask form that I just
referred to. The eye-mask will be found on virtually every
continent. It has no meaning, no explanation in any
conventional terms. And yet, it is the explanation for the
owl-eyed form of the mother goddess, and for the owl-eyed
or eye-mask form carved on stone around the world, and
enigmatically connected to the ‘stairway to the sky’. That
eye-mask beneath those toroidal forms of the Kayenta pictograph
is just a variation on this. And incidentally,
there's no up and down in this configuration.
This is actually a phase of wandering. It's not a polar
configuration. That eye- mask form was seen in Easter Island.
It had a lot of aquatic elements attached
to it because it just rolls right up out
of the surrounding sea.
So, thank you all very much.

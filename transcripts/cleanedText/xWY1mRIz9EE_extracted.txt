Congratulations to all the technologists who are responsible
for the spectacular success of the development and
deployment of the Webb Space Telescope. Notably it has
not been matched by successful predictions from the
scientists involved. The sharp images of the
Webb Space Telescope’s first deep-field image
reminded me of the aphorism of the Scottsman, Sir
 Walter Scott: ”Oh what a tangled Webb we weave, when
first we practice to deceive!” Modern science practice or
training is driven by our industrialized education systems.
Simply follow the fire hose of money to universities
from the military, governments, and corporations.
We train specialist technologists, not 
broadly educated natural philosophers.
And as Leonard Peikoff wrote, “It is the inductive science
of philosophy that teaches the ‘hard’ scientists how to be
scientific.” Unsurprisingly, our “whatever works” 
technology has rapidly advanced, to the detriment
of life on this planet. And some top scientists
are now declaring particle physics and cosmology
to be in crisis based on discoveries from their new
technology. Otherwise the many successes of Electric
Universe science would demand their attention. The demand
by technocrats to ‘follow the science’ has no substance.
In 2021 I devoted three episodes to the Webb Space Telescope
prior to its launch in which I discussed Webb's significance
in the context of Electric Universe cosmology
issues, and made several predictions of what the
Webb Space Telescope would reveal. This is the first of
several episodes that will report on success in relation
to those predictions. In September 2021, I said the James
Webb telescope, when successfully deployed, will allow us to
see finer and fainter detail in the
stardust regions of dense molecular
clouds, where stars and Gas Giant planets 
are born. The twisting and turning, glowing red
filaments of constant width are like those in a novelty
plasma ball. They are rotating Birkeland Currents threading
the gestating stars in those clouds. The stars grow in
mass until they are born by a slingshot effect as the
filament twists away. The mystery of the
upper limit of star mass is simply answered.
The James Webb Telescope should put this explanation
beyond any doubt, because gravity alone cannot produce such
twisting and turning filamentary structures. It is hard to
overstate the importance of evidence of helically twisted
filament pairs and braids. The Electric Universe
position has always been that the Universe is one
giant web of rotating electric currents that flow as fila-
ments of helically twisted pairs and braids and manifesting
that morphology at all scales. That stars
are born in an intense magnetic pinching
of a galactic Birkeland Current. That
every star is connected to the galactic
circuit by a coaxial Birkeland Current.
That every galaxy is connected to a
larger intergalactic circuit by coaxial intergalactic
Birkeland Currents. It is often very difficult to remotely
observe an electric current in plasma dark mode,
passing through the diffuse interplanetary, interstellar or
intergalactic medium. For example, the discovery 
of interplanetary electric currents has only
occurred when space probes have made unexpected
in-situ measurements. Nevertheless, it is often possible to
remotely observe such electric currents
because for example, dust is aggregated
to the current via Marklund convection, or
because the density of neutral atoms in
the local plasma and the current density is sufficiently
high for the generation of electromagnetic radiation in
different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.
As, I have often noted, “Radio astronomy is
of particular importance because Birkeland Currents
typically emit synchrotron radiation in the radio
spectrum.” End of quote. Sheets of moving
plasma tend to break into parallel filaments.
This can occur whether the plasma sheets are
planar, cylindrical, or spheroidal in shape.
The parallel filaments are electric currents. Such parallel
electric currents generate a self-constricting magnetic
field. They exhibit long-range attraction
and short-range repulsion that causes
pairs of filaments to come together and twist about one
another helically. In short, they tend to form helically
twisted filament pairs and braids. Eric Lerner has provided
an accessible physical explanation for this process in his
his book, “The Big Bang Never Happened”. Winston Bostick was
one of the preeminent plasma physicists of the 20th century.
He was the first scientist to conduct a
systematic investigation of the physics
of the dense plasma-focused device and the extraordinary
plasma structures they produce, for which he coined the term
”plasmoid”. Writing in 1986, Bostick stated,
”...my experimental work in plasma physics
for the last 36 years has shown that under many different
circumstances plasmas containing non-relativistic or
relativistic electrons can spontaneously organize themselves
into force-free, minimum-free-energy vortex filaments of
a Beltrami morphology.” Eugenio Beltrami
was an 18th century Italian mathematician
who developed a partial differential equation that
could be used to mathematically describe the morphology
of helically twisted filament pairs, like 
that in DNA; like that in Birkeland Currents.
It is a matter that has been confirmed
repeatedly by plasma researchers
including Hannes Alfven and Anthony Peratt.
An example of the tendency for helically
twisted filaments to form when a current passes through a
low density plasma is afforded by images from the Plasma
Crystal Experiment aboard the International Space 
Station. Mainstream plasma researchers also
confirmed the tendency for electric currents flowing
in low-density plasmas, like the plasmas that pervade
interplanetary, interstellar and intergalactic
space, to form helically twisted pairs.
For example, in 2012 UCLA's professor
Walter Gekelman, who headed the team that
designed and operated the 18-meter large
plasma device, presented a paper with
Bart Van Compernolle to the American Physical Society,
reporting on experiments that created magnetic flux
ropes in a low density plasma. With the abstract recording
and I quote, ”Magnetic flux ropes are due to helical
currents and form a dense carpet of arches
on the surface of the Sun. Occasionally one
tears loose as a coronal mass ejection and its rope
structure is detected by satellites close to the earth.
Current sheets can tear into filaments,
and these are nothing other than flux ropes.
Ropes are not static; they exert mutual
electromagnetic (J x B) forces causing
them to twist about each other and merge.” End 
of quote. In 2014, the journal Plasma Physics and
Controlled Fusion published a cross-disciplinary special
issue on ”Self-organization in magnetic flux ropes.”
The guest editor, V. S. Lukin, then of the
U.S. Naval Observatory and subsequently a
program head at the National Science
Foundation wrote and I quote,
”...the ingredient common to all magnetic
flux ropes is that the magnetic field
lines that thread nearby plasma elements
at one location along the flux rope must
wind around and not diverge away from each other 
over a sufficiently long distance to look like a piece of
ordinary rope. In a way, it is similar to turbulence
- you know it when you see it.” End of quote.
Lukin was there describing helically twisted filaments
and braids, you know it when you see it. Precisely.
In short, if we see the morphology of helically twisted
filament pairs and braids traversing images, this is
unanswerable evidence that we are looking at electric
currents. In September 2021, I made a specific prediction,
and I quote, “I predict that the James Webb Space Telescope
with its vast improvement in sensitivity and resolution,
will reveal the existence of the connecting network of
helically twisted filament pairs and braids even more
clearly. We will discover helically twisted filament
pairs and braids everywhere we look.” End of quote.
That prediction was spectacularly
confirmed in the first Webb Space
Telescope deep-field science images on July 11, 2022.
We start with the so-called ‘cosmic cliffs’
in the Carina Nebula. Here's an image of the
cosmic cliffs taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.
There are tantalizing hints of helically twisted morphology
at several places in that image, but the visual evidence is
not compelling. Certainly, there is no
clear evidence of widespread twisted
filament pair and braid morphology.
Now here is part of the Webb Space
Telescope image showing the same region depicted in the
Hubble image. It shows that this region is dominated
by helically twisted filament pairs and braids. And here is
the whole Webb Space Telescope image of the cosmic cliffs.
If we pan over the whole of the image, we see helically
twisted filament pairs and braids almost everywhere we look.
This image shows that the entire structure in the cosmic
cliffs image is dominated by helically twisted filament
pairs and braids. The whole structure is an
interconnected Webb of electric currents.
And these are electric currents on the scale of light years.
The cosmic cliffs are some seven light years in height.
Next is Stephan’s Quintet. Here's a portion of a
Hubble image of Stephan’s Quintet showing NGC 7319.
There's a suggestion of helically twisted filaments in
the dark dust clouds along the left-hand edge of the
main body of the galaxy. Again, the visual evidence
is debatable. Now, here's the equivalent region from
the Webb Space Telescope's MIRI and NEARCAM
composite image of Stephan’s Quintet.
It shows the entire body of the galaxy NGC 7319 is
dominated by helically twisted filaments that were not
discernible as such in Hubble's images of the same 
galaxy. The differences are apparent when the
images are compared side by side. The 
Webb Space Telescope image of Stephan’s
Quintet is proof that electric currents
flow throughout the galaxy on a scale in
the order of 50,000 light years, and with an
overall morphology that has biological overtones.
The galaxy center, threaded by an axial umbilicus.
Not only that, as we pan down in the Webb
Space Telescope image, it shows that NGC 7319 is connected
to NGC 7318 a and b by helically twisted filaments. This is
compelling evidence that these galaxies are
connected to each other by vast electric currents.
Look at the light year scale on the compass 
image. These electric currents connecting the
galaxies are in the order of one hundred thousand
light years. Again, these were effectively invisible
in the Hubble image. In short, as I predicted, the Webb 
Space Telescope Stephan’s Quintet images, and I quote,
“... reveal the existence of the connecting network
of helically twisted filamentary pairs and braids...”
End quote. Both within, and between galaxies, in Stephan’s
Quintet, that were not evident in previous images.
In September 2021, I emphasized that and I
quote, ”It is hard to overstate the importance
of evidence of helically twisted filament pairs and
braids.” End quote. Let me explain that a little further.
The US National Research Council's 1986 report of the Panel
on Gravitation, Cosmology, and Cosmic-Ray Physics records
the fact that, and I quote,”...the ratio
of the electrostatic to the gravitational
force between an electron and a proton is
about 10 to the 39th power.” End quote.
It's uncontroversial that the electric force is 39 powers
of 10 times more powerful than the gravitational force.
That is a 1 followed by 39 zeros or 1,000 billion,
billion, billion, billion, times more powerful.
You don't need much charge separation to occur before
the electrical force will overwhelm the force of gravity.
Standard Model astrophysics and cosmology gives the
electric force no organizing role at the macro scale.
In Standard Model astrophysics and cosmology, gravity is
the fundamental organizing force in the universe at the
macro scale. If there are electric currents
flowing in space on the scale indicated in these
images, then the Standard Model's gravity-
dominated worldview simply cannot be correct.
A fundamental feature of the universe has 
been ignored. What's contended is first,
that the force of gravity remains a
mystery to astrophysicists and secondly,
that gravity takes a backseat to electric currents, magnetic
pinches, double layers and various plasma instabilities.
It is, as Hannes Alfven put it, “Gravitational
systems are the ashes of prior electrical systems.”
The Electric Universe assigns a fundamental role 
to gravity, which manifests in the inertial and
gravitational mass of all matter. Isaac Newton 
was right. As I have noted, electric currents
flow in the low density plasma of interplanetary
interstellar and intergalactic space, routinely
self-organize as helically twisted pairs and braids.
As I stated in 2021 and I quote, “...there is
no tool, or combination of tools in the
Standard Model toolkit that can produce
helically twisted filament pairs and braids,
other than by development of the physics
of magnetic flux tubes which are, after all,
merely an effect of electric currents.” End of quote.
Evidence of helically twisted filaments
and braids of the kind provided by the
Webb Space Telescope's images of the cosmic cliffs and
Stephan’s Quintet is proof positive of electric currents
flowing in space at the macro scale, and thus proof
that Standard Model astrophysics and cosmology is
fundamentally flawed. It is yet another verification,
and I'm confident the first of many from the Webb
Space Telescope, of the illuminating and
predictive power of Electric Universe cosmology

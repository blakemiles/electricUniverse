Star clusters are large groups of stars.
Globular clusters are tightly bound together and
can consist of hundreds of millions of stars.
Open clusters are more loosely clustered
groups of stars, generally containing
as little as only a few hundred stars.
The Hyades is our nearest open star cluster - it
is located about 153 light years away from the Sun.
It is roughly spherical in shape and consists
of hundreds of stars that appear to be
of a similar type, age, and composition and they
all have the same proper motion through space.
You can observe this cluster by
looking at the Taurus constellation,
where the brightest star forms a V-shape
along with a still brighter Alpha Tauri star.
Alpha Tauri is actually not part of this cluster.
It just sits in the line-of-sight of the cluster.
Astronomers estimate that the age of the Hyades
Cluster is about 625 million years. The core of the
cluster has a radius of nearly
9 lightyears. The stars in this cluster
are more enriched in the
heavier elements than our Sun
and the other stars in our neighborhood.
This puts these stars in a different
stellar group to our Sun. Their age, metallicity
and proper motions coincide with those of the larger
and more distant Beehive Cluster, which is
situated about 600 lightyears away from Earth.
In a new study, astronomers think an invisible
force is tearing apart the Hyades Cluster.
They think that the culprit for this may
well be a dark matter substructure.
This would contain the mass of 10 million
suns and yet be totally invisible to us. Using
the data from ESAâ€™s Gaia satellite, they were able
to create a new map of the Hyades Cluster. In this
data they identified a massive bump in this 
cluster. They believe that the gravitational
forces that target the cluster, have,
over the eons, sculpted two structures
known as tidal tails, that sweep out in
front and behind the central hub of stars.
They believe that something is pulling apart one
of these tails. Scientists initially produced a
simulation of the cluster in order to
attempt to predict the current positions
and velocities of the stars over time. When they
then compared this to the actual data from Gaia,
a discrepancy appeared. The 
trailing tail in the real data had
far fewer stars compared to their model.
In order to explain this, they postulated
a close encounter with a massive galactic lump.
The problem was that this would need to
be incredibly massive and yet there was no trace
of it. Their solution was to suggest that it was
being caused by dark matter, the invisible force
that all too often is used to explain phenomena
that don't match their models.
Let's just take a little step back here.
The first question to ponder on is that of the tidal
tails. We see these on different scales. Stellar
tidal tails are thought to form as a
result of the rotation of the star
cluster around the galactic center. As the 
center of the clusters are highly populated,
some stars can gain enough velocity to escape 
the cluster. These escapees will tend to leave via
two points, but continue to orbit the cluster.
Over time the cluster becomes more smeared
out over these points. It should 
be noted that we have not
actually observed this happening. We only
see the various states of these clusters.
Do we see these tails elsewhere? Yes, we
see many of these examples in galaxies.
These are thought to be galaxies
that are in the process of merging.
As one passes close enough to the other,
it disrupts the stars in the outer area
and smears them out creating a tail.
But do we know that these galaxies are
actually in the process of merging?
Well, the short answer is no.
it is inferred from what they observe in the still
images. Halton Arp had a very different view of
these so-called mergers. His view 
was that new matter was being
created in the center of galaxies and pushed
outwards. This could form lumps of gas which might
turn into quasars that would continue to move
away, and would eventually form a companion galaxy.
He felt that these so-called
mergers were in fact the opposite.
A prime example of this is Arp 105. This is 
considered to be a merger of two galaxies,
when in fact the obvious conclusion is
that of a proto-galaxy being ejected
jet-like, from an active elliptical galaxy.
Exactly opposite this is the counter-jet,
a magnificent straight plume, punching 
through a disrupted spiral. Very
close to this ejector galaxy, we also find
the telltale signs of a high redshift quasar.
When you examine the redshift of most
of the companions around this galaxy,
they were all positively red-shifted
with respect to the dominant galaxy.
If these companions were falling
in or orbiting the dominant galaxy,
you would expect to find as many relatively
positive, as minus velocities. The fact that they
were not, clearly indicated they were all
moving away from the central dominant galaxy.
In other words, they had been 
ejected. Another example that is worth
considering is ESO 161 IG 24. Here, a 
galaxy seems to have developed a clustering of
material along its arms, possibly showing this
ejection process can also follow out along the arms.
And this is probably a more classical
image showing these tidal arms.
So what is the difference between this
galaxy and a barred spiral galaxy then?
Essentially they both have arms protruding,
one just has longer ones. Astronomers will tell
you that the bars form when stellar
orbits in a spiral galaxy become
unstable and deviate from a circular path.
These grow over time and are eventually
locked into place making a bar. In the Electric
Universe, these spiral arms are formed by
filaments that twist their way
back to the central plasmoid,
which powers the galaxy. This will form a loop-back
much further out. In the case of the tidal arm
in this galaxy, are we not just looking at an
arm where the filaments in the arm have been
pulled much further outwards?
Returning to the star cluster, the first
obvious point to discuss is the shape of the whole
cluster. It is interpreted as a central cluster with
two tidal tails. If we examine this structure,
you might see something a little different.
If we ignore the idea that this was
originally a spherical cluster,
and instead focus on the shape, we 
see something rather more obvious.
The stars are all located within a narrow
band that twists towards the center,
and then flows out on the opposite side. We also
know that these stars are of a similar composition
and of the same proper motions as the Beehive
Cluster. Is it possible these two are connected
along a stellar filament? Could the reason 
we see such a high density of stars
around this point, be due to the formation of a
pinching in this area, leading to an instability
in the filament, causing the shape we see and
also the much higher number of stars in this area?
The difference between one side and the
other, would be accounted for by the
pinching being less restrictive
on one side, compared to the other.
We know that open clusters are
confined to the galactic plane
and are almost always found within the spiral 
arms. This is exactly where we would expect to
see filament structures. One other 
example of an open cluster is the Pleiades,
which we have previously speculated sits at
the center of the filament we are also part of.
and passes up through the galactic
plane, creating the structure we see,
called the local chimney. This we speculated
was created in a massive pinching effect.
So the open clusters therefore show
us an area that has experienced
an intense pinching effect, causing 
the rapid formation of many stars
in a very confined area. Could these clusters,
instead help us to map out some of these
larger filament structures running all
along the spiral arms of the galaxy?

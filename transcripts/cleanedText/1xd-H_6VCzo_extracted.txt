Welcome to Space News from

On this series, we've explored the
significance of common forms and shapes
seen throughout the cosmos.
Plasma, the fourth state of matter,
pervades all of the universe
and the unique structures
produced in plasma laboratories
are clearly seen at
all scales in space.
From the filamentations seen
everywhere in the universe,
from the giant snake-like filaments
reaching from the surface of the Sun
to the dark cores of sunspots,
to the networks of long thin
filaments along which stars form
like pearls on a string,
to the hourglass
shapes of nebulae
and the similar double-lobed form that appears
to be the common shape of comet nuclei,
a form reliably produced by the
electromagnetic z-pinch effect in plasma,
and even the spiraling structures achieved
by parallel currents in the laboratory
uncannily matching the
form of the spiral galaxy.
Plasma particle beams also produce
distinct geometric shapes
that can prove difficult or even impossible
to explain through non-plasma processes
when seen in nature.
One such shape is the
hexagon or polygon
which is a generally straight-
edged closed-plane form.
The hexagonal craters commonly
observed on planets and moons
challenge planetary scientists
since kinetic impact experiments
do not produce such craters.
However, as seen in these
experiments by Jacob Gable,
it is a form routinely produced by
electrical discharge to a solid surface.
Another hexagon in nature has puzzled
astronomers since its discovery decades ago.
As far back as 1988, scientists
studying data from the Voyager mission
found evidence for a hexagonal atmospheric
structure at the North Pole of Saturn.
Decades later, NASA's Cassini-Huygens
spacecraft shared with the world
the first complete images
of the bizarre cloud pattern.
Planetary scientists have
struggled for an explanation
since the form is not seen in
any other planetary atmosphere.
But in recent years, simple
fluidic experiments on Earth
have succeeded in producing
a hexagonal structure
providing an explanation that planetary
scientists have heretofore favored.
However, Thunderbolts picture of the
day managing editor Stephen Smith
outlines just some of the problems
with this theory in a recent article.
He writes,
"The fluid dynamic experiment seems
to provide a plausible description
of what is happening on Saturn
if several factors are ignored.
First, there are concentric
rings around the hexagon,
each with different
temperatures.
Second, Saturn's North and South Poles
are hotter than theories predict.
Third, there are
aurorae at the poles.
Fourth, there are powerful
currents of electric charge
entering and leaving
Saturn's poles,
connecting it to its
family of moons.
As previous Picture of
the Day articles argue,
the plumes of Enceladus,
for instance,
demonstrate that charge exchange
between it and Saturn."
Recently, scientific reports
have pointed definitively
toward a non-fluid
dynamics explanation.
As reported on September 6
2018 on sciencealert.com
"There's something strange
over Saturn's north pole.
A tremendous structure
towering high above the clouds
indicates that the planet's
peculiar hexagonal formation
is much, much bigger than
was initially apparent."
In 2014, scientists using Cassini's
composite infrared spectrometer
had begun studying Saturn's
northern stratosphere,
a region hundreds of kilometers
above the atmospheric hexagon.
The shocking discovery came
when they began observing a vortex
far above the famous hexagon.
One of the investigators
says of their discovery,
"As the polar vortex became more and more
visible, we noticed it had hexagonal edges,
and realized that we were
seeing the pre-existing hexagon
at much higher altitudes
than previously thought."
As acknowledged in the
Science Alert article,
"...since wind conditions change
dramatically with altitude,
the fact that the hexagon shape persists
so much higher than the cloud tops
is a baffling conundrum."
The Electric Universe
position has always been
that the key to understanding
Saturn's hexagon
is the planet's electrical
connection to the Sun.
The so-called magnetic ropes
that have been discovered
stretching the nearly 900 million
miles from the Sun to Saturn,
are one clue to this connection.
The Sun is primarily an
electrical phenomenon
at the focus of a galactic
"glow discharge"
and electric currents flowing
from the Sun to planets
has implications for many
atmospheric phenomena
including the tremendous
winds of gas giant planets
and also jet streams and
weather patterns on Earth.
Based on this perspective, in 2005,
physicist Wal Thornhill made a prediction
that could only seem preposterous
from a conventional viewpoint.
Thornhill analyzed the mysterious hotspot
in the vortex at Saturn's South Pole.
The hotspot puzzled
planetary scientists
because, as described by
the Keck Observatory,
"...both the distinct boundary of a warm
polar vortex some 30 degrees latitude
from the southern pole and a
very hot 'tip' right at the pole
were completely unexpected."
Thornhill wrote of this feature,
"Its compactness is due to the
electromagnetic pinch effect
where it enters
Saturn's atmosphere."
He then stated,
"The Electric Universe also
predicts, experimentum crucis,
that BOTH poles should be hot,
not one hot and the other cold."
In 2008, the Cassini spacecraft
confirmed the astonishing prediction.
Astonishing because the
freezing cold North Pole
had been deprived of sunlight
for more than 12 years.
Thornhill explained,
"The polar hot spot and the
long-lived hexagonal feature
result from a continuous
electric current
flowing from the Sun into
the pole of Saturn."
On the peculiar hexagonal form, consider
the side-by-side images on your screen.
On the left are vortices of an electron
beam etched onto a carbon witness plate.
On the right are vortices of an electron
beam photographed on a fluorescent screen.
The hexagonal form is a distinct feature
of a well-documented plasma phenomenon
called 'The Diocotron Instability'
and the phenomenon observed in the
laboratory is remarkably scalable.
As noted by Dr. Anthony Peratt in
'Physics of the Plasma Universe',
"The vortices of the diocotron
instability are found to occur
over 12 orders of magnitude
in beam current.
This mechanism was first introduced to
explain auroral curtains by Hannes Alfvén."
The persistence of the hexagonal feature, hundreds
of kilometers above the Saturnian clouds,
is the clearest possible indication it
is being driven by energy from above
and cannot be explained
by simple fluid dynamics.
But the basic concept of electric
currents flowing from the Sun
interacting dynamically with
electrically charged bodies,
remains a road to new
theoretical pathways
that planetary scientists
have yet to follow.

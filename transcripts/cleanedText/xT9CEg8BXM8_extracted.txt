Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought
to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info
For more than a decade, among the
individuals exploring the concepts of
the Electric Universe Theory, a community
has arisen which is specifically devoted
to exploring the surface of our planet.
The geological processes in an Electric
Universe go well beyond the theoretical
toolkit of standard geology. Laboratory
experiments involving electrical
discharge to solid surfaces, reveal
familiar features seen on every rocky
body in the solar system, including our
own planet. For a number of years, a
variety of independent investigators
have participated in regular group
expeditions in the American Southwest,
gathering evidence and developing
analyses based on their observations. One
contributor to the Electric Geology
Group is Robert Hawthorne Jr., who
exhibited at the Thunderbolts Project’s
EU 2017 conference, “Future Science” in
Phoenix, Arizona. In part 1 of this
two-part presentation, Robert offers his
analysis on what may be one of the best
candidates for an electrical scarring
feature on planet Earth: Upheaval
Dome in Canyonlands National
Park in Utah. The link to the Electric
Geology Facebook page may be found in
the description box of this video.
I would like to first take this
opportunity to thank the Thunderbolts
staff for giving me this opportunity to
speak with you on my paper entitled:
”Electric Discharge - Not an Impact Caused
Formation of Upheaval Dome,
Canyonlands National Park, Utah.” In March
of this year, I was given the opportunity
to present this paper at the
International Multi-Conference on
Complexity, Informatics and Cybernetics
in Orlando, Florida, and also I going to be
receiving a publication from this paper.
Upheaval Dome is a crater in Canyonlands
National Park, about five and a half
kilometers across the outer rim, and it's
about five hundred meters deep. And
currently there are two theories
on a placard outside the
dome and the first one suggests that
it was a meteor impact and there was
actually a lot of work done by
Dr. Shoemaker, who I actually
visited the site with, and did some work
with him on this when he was still
around. The second theory is a salt dome
that pushed up all the way through, like
a lava lamp, because its less dense
initiative surface then completely
eroded away. And this theory
is losing support, in fact quickly,
since they found shocked quartz in the
area, suggesting the impact theory.
So in 1996, a sample of what
was thought to be a tektite was
presented to Dr. Eugene Shoemaker and
several other authorities on Upheaval
Dome. The scientists were baffled as to
what secondary processing could have
caused this mineral known as analcime,
which is a hydrated sodium aluminum
silicate, to be in this form below.
So, the objectives of this episode of the
Thunderbolts Project, is to explain that
electrical discharges can form large
craters and eject material.
I'm going to try to show that these
same temperatures and pressures that
are needed to shock quartz crystals from
impacts, can be generated through
electrical discharge. And also, that
electrical discharges can vitrify,
or turn to glass material struck by
these discharges. And a new form of the
mineral analcime will also be shown as
proof. And it's also to provide an
argument that perhaps another mechanism
can be applied to the formation
of the planet’s many craters.
So, these illustrations here show
mantle gravity anomalies on the planet.
So, the mantle gravity anomalies in
this illustration here show that, if the
currents were to come in from the Sun at
the planet, they would take the path of
least resistance. And since we know that
current generates heat, we can see that
on these fault lines here where the
thermal imaging shows it it's probably
the most likely place with these
currents are traveling in towards the
core. And we're going to focus on the
Eastern Pacific rise as our primary
current here. And if you can see in this
little pink circle on the mantle gravity
anomaly illustration, that's where our
primary focus is going to be. Now inside
that circle, there is a magnetic anomaly
that's been titled the Farallon Hyper
Volcano by Quinn. And you can
see here that it's rather large.
The peak of the anomaly, if it were to
be a hyper volcano, you can see that the
city of Las Vegas is almost centered
right at the top and it expands all the
way up past Ensenada, Mexico with the
base of the volcano extending out into
the Pacific Ocean. So, this is a rather
large anomaly and if it were to have an
incident kind of like mount St. Helens, where
the volcano collapsed in on itself, it
would be evident that the patterns of
the river formations there, in the United
States, would in fact basically be the
electrical discharge and the forensic
evidence of that discharge. And here,
we actually see we're getting closer to
Upheaval Dome. Now these are pictures
that were taken of the area of Southern
Utah. You can see highway 70 at the
top of the illustration and the second
flag on the left-hand side, the down,
is called Three Fingers Canyon and
Upheaval Dome is on towards the bottom of
the screen. The second to lowest flag is
Upheaval Dome. You can see from Three
Fingers Canyon is a canyon that opens
out to the west. It extends west to
east with walls, sheer walls basically,
extending on the north and south sides
up several hundred feet, with it opening
out on the east side. So, if anybody were
in this area to see like an electrical
disturbance in the sky, they would easily
be able to see what was happening off to
the east and if it was over to the
south they could easily look over their
shoulder and be able to describe on to
the stones what they saw in the sky
happening over Upheaval Dome.
And that's exactly where you find the
petroglyph that's on the side here.
And if you can see it, this actually
highly suggests that there was possibly
a polar configuration and even possibly
some twin comets that were in this area.
And now we're going to get into some
electrical cratering theory. Jacob Gable
on the YouTube channel Electro
Terravision, gave an interview with
me on the Electric View, demonstrating
electrical cratering in a low-pressure
chamber with an anode and cathode and
some dirt from the outside of his house.
And also you can see here that it wouldn't
take a five and a half kilometer wide
electrical strike, to create the crater.
As you can see from these pictures here,
it’s just a thin filament of electricity
that's dancing around, in a kind
of a circular motion; a bit of a
spiral action coming. But as the current
was intensified, you can just see this
focuses on one spot basically, so it's
cooking right through the crater itself.
I also wanted to find some actual
evidence of electrical cratering on the
planet prior to this event, just to prove
that the actual lightning can create
craters. And on October 30th, 2019 a
lightning bolt struck outside a parking
lot of a gas station in Fort Worth Texas.
The fire department spokesman, Mike
Drivdahl, was quoted saying: “When it's
15 by 15 feet, in concrete six inches
thick, that's a pretty massive explosion.”
And I think that's at least pretty
much right there - that's a rather
massive explosion. Now on the shocked
quartz subject, electric discharge
machining versus impact. Shocked quartz has
recently been used as a standard to
discern whether the impact event has
occurred. And regarding Upheaval Dome,
shocked quartz samples were discovered by
Shoemaker’s team in 1999. However, in
2015, a geology team from the University of
Pennsylvania demonstrated in simulation,
where an arc of lightning struck a
simulated granite substance. The
calculated pressure from the strike
exceeded 70,000 atmospheres, well within
the range of creating shocked quartz. And
this was from Reto Gieré’s paper in 2015.
Matthew Pasek, a geochemist from
University of South Florida, Tampa, who
wasn't involved in the study was quoted
saying, “The result could cast
further doubt on claims of asteroid
impacts in Argentina and Australia that
relied on observations of shocked quartz.
The analysis should serve as a warning
to geologists not to rely only on that
line of evidence. This definitely shows
that geologists need to consider the
geological context of their samples.” And
now I would like to talk about some
fulgurites and the “Obsession Stone.”
When it comes to fulgurites, lightning is
highly energetic and it's capable
of delivering a billion joules of
energy, and also temperatures exceeding
2,000 Kelvin. Any material that’s struck
usually becomes vitrified or turns
into glass, or into a glassy substance.
These items are called fulgurites. Now, back
in 1996 the discoverer of the Obsession
Stone, James Wesley Hill of Moab, Utah
and my father, Robert Hawthorne Sr.
presented a strange rock to local
geologists for identification. After local
scientists from BYU and University
of Utah could not identify the mineral,
they turned to other authorities of
meteorites. We went to Dr. William
Cassidy from the University of
Pittsburgh, who is a recipient of the
Behringer award and after he had taken
it to the Smithsonian, his graduate
student returned us this letter. And
in this letter, it states a few things and
i'm just going to quote
a few parts of it.
”Preliminary observations are that
it consists principally of irregular
shaped, colorless grains of isotropic
material, accompanied by rare rounded
isotropic grains. Both the irregular and
rounded isotropic grains are probably
glass. They are cemented with calcite.
By association with the nearby Upheaval
Dome structure, it seems possible that
the glass grains had an impact origin
and were deposited at a site where
chemical precipitation of calcium
carbonate was occurring.” And he also
goes on to say later on, “Therefore, while
it seems possible that this material is
of impact origin, one would have to
suggest the likelihood that it has
undergone some type of secondary
processing or/and sorting, to remove
associated nickel-iron inclusions before
lithification. Pending further chemical
analysis of the individual grains, we cannot
commit ourselves further to it's
possible impact origin.” At the request of
Dr. Cassidy, we sent our samples to NASA,
to Mike Zolensky, who's the NASA curator.
An X-ray diffraction was performed on
two samples with the results showing
that, “The samples are a combination
of a analcime and calcite. I am afraid that
these secondary minerals have completely
replaced the original mineralogy of the
samples, so there is just no telling what
they originally were. The gross
petrography does resemble
devitrified glass, but this could have been
a volcanic glass. I'm afraid I can do no
more with these samples, because they
have been so altered from their original
mineralogy.” So, after two attempts to try
to prove that this was a meteorite and
both of them failed, basically we were
left at a loss and for ten years I left
this rock sit in our yard. And it wasn't
until I saw a Thunderbolts podcast from
Barry Setterfield, that I actually took a
picture of one of my samples and sent it
to the Thunderbolts project and within
half an hour I was invited to the
Electric Universe 2017 conference in
Phoenix, where I met Wal Thornhill and a lot
of people and that was a great experience.

Welcome to Space News 
from the Electric Universe,
brought to you by the Thunderbolts

Since the dawn of the space age, perhaps
no celestial body in the solar system
has proved more surprising to
astronomers than the planet
Venus. Before the arrival of the earliest space
probes, some noted scientists believe that Venus
would be Earth-like, with water clouds,
 oceans and abundant vegetation.
However, well known to those
who have followed this series,
it was Dr. Immanuel Velikovsky who 
made the outrageous prediction
that Venus would be superhot, based 
on his hypothesis of the planet's recent
cometary origins. Today, countless
Venusian phenomena continue to puzzle
planetary scientists, including 
the planet's super-fast winds;
its odd, slow backward spin; its 
vast magneto tail; and even the
recent discover by the ESA's Venus Express
spacecraft of a surprisingly powerful
electric field. In recent decades, Wal 
Thornhill, the Chief Science Advisor
to the Thunderbolts Project, has outlined
his own reconstruction of Venus' role
in the recent, extraordinary 
history of the solar system.
In Part One of this two-part presentation,
Thornhill begins by recounting this
history, which he offered in his 
2004 article, Cassini's Homecoming,
which he wrote prior to the arrival of the 
Cassini-Huygens spacecraft at Saturn.
As Thornhill explains, while astronomers to this
day refer to Venus as Earth's twin, the most
likely Venusian sibling may be found 
in the Saturnian system - that is,
the moon Titan. I must explain that
Cassini's Homecoming was published
just before the arrival of the
Cassini-Huygens spacecraft at Saturn.
It's perhaps one of my most important 
articles. My analysis and predictions were the
result of applying Electric Universe
principles to the remarkable forensic
research of David Talbot and Dwardu Cardona 
into the global mythic history of the solar system.
Naturally we like to believe the 
solar system is boringly predictable,
with no recent catastrophes. We ignore
the fact that prehistoric astronomers
obsessively recorded the motion of the stars
and planets. Yet those forgotten people built
monumental pyramids and
monolithic stone observatories,
carefully aligned to the heavens
which we couldn't reproduce today
with modern technology. So the question is, 
what motivated them to such monumental efforts?
Why were the tiny specks of light, the planets 
worshipped as apocalyptic thunderbolt-
wielding gods? hy was the planet Venus
globally described as female with long
flowing hair? Why was the planet Mars globally
described as the sword-wielding red god of war?
Why was the ringed planet Saturn
globally remembered as our first Sun,
our best Sun? This makes no sense
according to our modern myth
of a mostly safe, eon's-old, clockwork solar 
system. In Cassini's Homecoming, I wrote “Until
recently Saturn was an independent 
brown dwarf star with its own entourage of
close-orbiting small planets. As a 
small star approaching the Sun,
Saturn flickered like a faulty electric
light when the two stellar magnetospheres
or, that is plasma sheaths, touched
together.” Saturn's electrical power was then
usurped by the Sun, and its 
appearance changed dramatically.
Such rapid variability in the
appearance of stars is well documented.
”Before dimming forever, Saturn would have
flared up to relieve the stresses caused
by the sudden change in its electrical 
environment. Saturn still radiates more than
twice the heat it receives from the Sun.
We also have a simple explanation for
the origin of Saturn's mysterious
short-lived rings.” Chet Raymo,
the physicist, noted writer,
educator and naturalist, once wrote,
as if responding to that deep primeval memory, 
”Nothing so evokes gasps of delight of
Saturn's ring. The reason I think, is a 
collision of the expected and the improbable.
A ringed sphere is the 
archetypal planet of our childhood,
familiar from a thousand 
comic strips, coloring books,
classroom poster boards, stickers, rubber 
stamps, birthday cards - you name it.
So, when we see Saturn, there 
is a kind of instant recognition,
like meeting a relative one knows
only from the family photo album.
But there is also the shock of reality, a 
sense of ’Oh my God, it actually exists!”
In the year 2000 a pivotal meeting was
held in Portland, Oregon of key figures
in the Electric Universe, including 
Anthony Peratt, where it became
clear that petroglyphs are an enduring record
of the frightening collapse of a former
cosmos. Where are Saturn's children
now? As I explain in some detail
in my April 2006 report, ”Venus 
isn't our twin! The only common
features are their size and relative
closeness in the inner solar system.
In every other way they
could not be more different.”
Thornhill's writings on Venus have
included an expansive picture of the
solar system's recent history. In this 
picture, Venus was born recently
by its parent proto-Saturn, and 
the Saturnian moon Titan was a
member of the same family.
Based on this radical hypothesis,
Thornhill has made remarkably
accurate predictions about Titan,
including its surface features and atmosphere.
You just summarized the conclusions of
many lifetimes of work, principally 
by Talbot and Cardona into
the detailed sequence of events
surrounding the entry into the solar system
by the body we now call Saturn. But 
the inspiration for all of us came initially
from the scholar Immanuel Velikovsky.
In 1950, years before the space age,
he concluded from his extensive
interdisciplinary research
that the planet Venus was remembered from
the time of the dawn of the modern era
as a brilliant newborn cometary body.
He concluded in his best-selling book,
”Worlds in Collision”, that the night-side
of Venus radiates heat because Venus is hot.
Here we have two theorist’s
beliefs being demolished at once;
that something the size of a planet 
could be a comet, and that Venus recently
had a different orbit. Typically, 
later findings from space
probes supported his conclusion, but 
made no difference to consensus opinion.
Astronomers minimized the importance
of Velikovsky's remarkable claim,
or simply dismissed it as a lucky guess.
Although one noted scholar
acknowledged at the time that Velikovsky had
a remarkable record of successful predictions
and no failures. The discovery that Venus
was almost red-hot made it imperative for
scientists to invent an explanation.
The result was the fictitious enhanced
or runaway greenhouse effect. All 
the space-age data shows Venus is
not a twin of the earth at all.
Its magnetospheric tail has been
described as cometary; the entire
planet is said to have been resurfaced.
Of course, the idea that Venus 
is an infant simply doesn't occur.
If the view about twinship is mistaken, then the
belief in a common origin is without foundation.
What's more, climate scientists have
allowed themselves to be misled into
thinking that the hellish conditions on
Venus awaits us due to a runaway greenhouse
effect, if we don't mend our ways.
Ignorance is infectious. So much for twins.
Now for Venus' sibling, Saturn's moon Titan.
I wrote “What can we expect Cassini to find,
based on this dramatic recent history of Saturn?
We should expect to see family traits
amongst the members of the Saturnian family-
including the departed Earth, Mars and Venus.
For example, the moon Titan, which 
is larger than the planet Mercury,
seems to be a close sibling of Venus...”
”So we should be alert to similarities
between Titan and Venus. It is 
already known that Titan has the
densest atmosphere of any terrestrial planet,
after Venus. That is a huge puzzle for scientists.”
The New Scientist of November 6, 2004:
”Titan images add to the moon's mystery.”
Stephen Battersby reported, “The 
world got its first peak at the surface of
Saturn's moon Titan last week. The 
images were taken as Nasa's Cassini-
Huygens spacecraft swept past the moon.
The images show a landscape that is
clearly still being shaped.
Although Titan must have suffered
numerous meteor impacts in the past, its surface
today is largely crater-free. Somehow these
scars must have been eroded or filled in.” But
that's precisely what we said about Venus when the
Magellan orbiter revealed that planet's surface.
I also wrote, “Titan has a global layered
haze like Venus... We may expect to find that
Titan's atmosphere has some of the smell of
Venus about it. Both Venus and 
Titan's atmospheres, being very young,
will not yet be in equilibrium. So calculations 
about atmospheric constituents that
assume equilibrium as a starting point will be
wrong.” ”The methane found in Titan's atmosphere
is quickly destroyed by sunlight so it 
has to be replenished. That has led
to the suggestion that Titan must 
have a hydrocarbon ocean for
the methane to have lasted for the
conventional age of the solar system.
However, radar, infrared and 
radio observations of Titan
have not found signs of a hydrocarbon ocean.
In fact one radar return was, and I quote
’of a type that we should expect to get back
from Venus.’” End of quote. Titan is most likely
a baby brother of Venus. Six 
months after writing Cassini's
Homecoming, I wrote another article,
”Titan a Rosetta stone for early Earth?”
There I wrote the Electric Universe
conceptual model can claim a number of
successful predictions. Most 
importantly it was the only model
to predict the surface features
of smog- shrouded Titan
before they were 
revealed in detail by Huygens

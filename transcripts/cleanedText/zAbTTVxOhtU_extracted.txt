The French author Marcel
Proust once stated,
"The real voyage of discovery consists
not in seeking new landscapes
but in having new eyes."
In 2017, the journey of space
discovery demands new eyes
and indeed an entirely new way
of perceiving our universe.
In our own celestial
neighborhood in our solar system
no type of object consistently provokes greater
surprise and perplexity than the comet.
As we've reported in
recent episodes,
no reasonable debate can remain
that the more than half century old
dirty snowball hypothesis
of comets is falsified.
Every comet mission to date has
refuted the consensus belief
that comets are fluffy
aggregates of ice and dust
that condensed or accreted
billions of years ago
out in the "Siberia"
of the solar system.
Comet nuclei are
not icy or snowy.
They are desiccated, rocky
bodies that appear virtually
indistinguishable from asteroids.
Comet activity, including powerful jets and
the production of the cometary tail and coma,
cannot be the result of sublimating
volatiles and outgassing,
a fact that only grows more
evident with each new discovery.
A new image released in the last week by
the European Space Agency's Rosetta team
underscores the desperate need for new
theoretical pathways in comet science.
Here we see one of the clearest,
perhaps undeniable, images to date
of an electrical discharge
on a comet nucleus.
The image was taken on July 3rd, 2016, by
the Rosetta spacecraft at comet 67P.
At the time, the comet was at a distance of
about 500 million kilometers from the Sun,
a distance at which astronomers
do not expect sublimation
of invisible
hypothetical water ice.
The lead author of a new scientific
paper on the observation states,
"We saw a bright plume of dust, blowing
away from the surface like a fountain...
It lasted for roughly an hour,
producing around 18 kg
of dust every second."
The team admits they have no idea what
mechanism could have actually powered
the so-called plume.
The ESA's website states,
"Initially, scientists thought that the plume might
have been surface ice evaporating in the sunlight.
However, Rosetta's measurements showed there
had to be something more energetic going on
to fling that amount
of dust into space."
The lead author states,
"Energy must have been released from
beneath the surface to power it.
There are evidently processes in comets
that we do not yet fully understand."
The understatement of this
comment cannot be overemphasized.
As we see in this
side-by-side image comparison,
the structure of the so-called
plume has its ideal analog
in the form of an electrical
discharge in the laboratory.
The electrical nature of this
type of cometary phenomena
has been self-evident since
long before the Rosetta mission.
In 2004, when the Stardust spacecraft
arrived at the comet Wild 2,
scientists were astonished
by the comet's explosive jets
some of which emanated from the dark
unheated side of the asteroid-like nucleus.
Principal investigator
Donald Brownlee said in 2004,
"We thought comet Wild 2 would be
like a dirty, black, fluffy snowball.
Instead, it was mind-boggling to see the diverse
landscape in the first pictures from Stardust,
including spires, pits and craters, which
must be supported by a cohesive surface."
Nothing in the behavior of the comet's
jets fit investigators' expectations.
Stardust investigator Dr.
Benton Clark stated,
"Another big surprise was the abundance
and behavior of jets of particles
shooting up from the
comet's surface.
We expected a couple of jets,
but saw more than two dozen
in the brief flyby."
A June 17, 2004, NASA report
described the conundrum,
"The team predicted the jets would
shoot up for a short distance,
and then be dispersed into
a halo around Wild 2.
Instead, some super-speedy
jets remained intact,
like blasts of water from
a powerful garden hose."
Of course, a garden hose is a
completely inappropriate analogy
for such explosive jets
in the "vacuum of space".
As we've discussed in
many recent episodes,
astronomers have sometimes
used the same terminology
in their attempts to explain light-years
long stellar and galactic jets.
The question is,
what mechanism confines the jets
and prevents their dispersal?
On 67P, the merging filaments within the
collimated jets reveal a vital clue,
as seen in the side-by-side comparison
with a plasma discharge in the laboratory.
Radio astronomers have now measured the
electric currents in galactic jets
which produce
tremendous velocities
and confine the jetted material up to
many hundreds of thousands of light-years.
If comet jets and plumes are also
electrical discharge phenomena,
as the Electric Universe
model has always predicted,
the mystery of the velocity and
confinement of the jets is resolved.
Another problem for comet scientists
is that the hypothetical apertures,
required for the collimation of material
that is supposedly outgassed from a comet
or the "nozzle" from which a hypothetical
garden hose would release its stream,
have not been seen
on comet nuclei.
This problem is
acknowledged in the paper
"Cometary Jet Collimation
Without Physical Confinement"
published in the 2012 fall meeting
of the American Geophysical Union.
It states,
"Contemporary models postulate
that these jets collimate
when the expanding gases and dust pass
through a physical aperture or nozzle.
However, recent high-resolution
spacecraft observations
fail to detect such apertures
on cometary surfaces.
Recent high-resolution images of comet
nuclei reveal that the gas and dust
expelled by the comet is organized
into narrow plumes or jets..."
"Furthermore, these models do
not explain why cometary jets
appear to be directed normal to
the local gravitational potential.
This is especially puzzling
because the jet velocity,
typically 300 m/sec
far from the comet,
greatly exceeds the escape
velocity of only about 1 m/sec."
As we've also recently reported,
it could not be more clear
that dramatic comet activity has
nothing to do with sublimating ices.
Scientists using NASA's
Hubble Telescope
have detected unprecedented
activity from the comet C/2017 K2
at a billion and a half
miles from the Sun
or 16 astronomical units (AU).
Comet water-ice ceases to
sublimate beyond just a few AU.
The scientists can only propose that
the comet must have been recently
"gravitationally kicked
out of the Oort cloud"
and is therefore covered
with pristine hyper-volatiles,
surface ices of methane, carbon
monoxide and/or nitrogen
that might sublimate
at such a distance.
Such attempts to cling
to discredited theory
grow more disturbing
with each new discovery.
The electric theory of comets
has successfully predicted
the extraordinary
geology of comet nuclei
and the completely unexpected
findings of comet activity
at great varieties of
distances from the Sun.
The bright, so-called, plume on 67P can
be seen as an electrical discharge
resulting from an explosive redistribution
of charge on the comet nucleus.
Neither an imaginary
reservoir of subsurface ice
nor theoretical nozzles from which outgassing
supposedly sprays like a garden hose
will ever account for this type of
remarkable cometary phenomena.
The Rosetta mission and other
spectacular voyages in space discovery
represent remarkable technical
achievements and yet, tragically,
they are also enormous
missed opportunities.
Before seeking out new
landscapes to explore
comet scientist must see with new eyes
which might perceive a self-evident truth,
comets and the universe in
which they exist are electric.

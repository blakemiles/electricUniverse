Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought

The geological features of our planet
tell an astonishing story, a story
that defies explanation based on
standard theoretical processes.
In this series of videos,
Thunderbolts contributor Andrew Hall, has
explored theoretical pathways which draw
analogs between Earth geology and some
of the most powerful atmospheric
phenomena seen in the solar system. As
Andrew explains in Part Six of his ten-part
series, the key to understanding this
analog, can be found in the properties
and nature of water. In Part Five of this
series, we looked at “boot print” craters
and found there are cyclones raging on
Jupiter right now that can explain them.
Shock wave patterns in the crater rims
provided confirming evidence. We also
looked at California's mountain and valley
structures and correlated those with a
storm on Jupiter that displays in great
detail the very same features. The
examples we've looked at point to one
significant observation: that fractal
forms associated with the process of
charge diffusion, can be found in both
geology and weather. Why geology and
weather should match really isn't hard
to understand. Capacitance between Earth
and sky are responsible for that,
forcing charge to diffuse through each
layer in mirror image. And that should
suffice for an answer if our atmosphere
were considered a plasma; charged
particles responding to Earth's
spherical capacitance would make sense.
But Earth's atmosphere isn't considered
a plasma. Neither is Jupiter's for that matter.
Where are all the charge carriers? The
answer isn't in particle physics. It's in
the molecule of water. Water is the
charge carrier - the electric wires of
the circuit. Water is bi-polar and so
adopts polarity in an electric
field. This produces something called
”bound current”. Unlike a current of free
electrons and ions, a bound current is
carried by a bulk material that can be
polarized or magnetized. An example is a
ferromagnetic fluid that takes
structural form in response to magnetic
fields. Water is an example of bound
current due to polarization of the water
molecule. Water also changes phase: from
vapor to droplet to ice crystal, all in
the course of a weather cycle, which
changes its electrical properties. And
it's self-ionizing, readily shedding
electrons to generate plasma. A cold
plasma is only partly ionized, a few free
electrons and ions floating about. But
magnetic fields are created with any
moving charge and magnetic fields
influence their motion, and water follows
because it polarizes and acts like a big,
fat charged particle, making clouds into
conduits of current generating stronger
magnetic field. Star-like filaments and
concentric rings form in thin cirrus of
the upper atmosphere. Condensate
filaments make turns and shoot tendrils
at 90 degrees, crossing other filament
paths and interfering in herringbone
patterns. These are drift currents,
responding to the pull of far-field
potential within that layer of strata.
Closer to the ground fat water clouds
form cellular structures often in
tetrahedron shapes which amplifies water’s
polarity to a macro scale. Watch puffy
cumulus gather for a storm, ultimately
knotting into a torus around up-welling
winds to birth a mesocyclone,
and you are seeing a fractal
electromagnetic structure of Nature at
work. Airborne dust, pollen, aerosols and
dander cloud the air close to the ground
and react between surface and sky to
form a charged sheath, polar-opposite to
the water clouds.
Higher up, where ice forms, wispy cirrus
change polarity again. The result is
multiple layers of charged, cold plasma
between the ionosphere and Earth's
surface. The sky is electric
but consensus science doesn't seem to
recognize that. They will say there is no
evidence of charge densities high enough
for plasma. That distances are too large
to create double layers and develop
capacitance. What they don't recognize
water's role, and frankly I don't think
they're looking. They are looking for
answers to their preconceived notions
about carbon’s minor role in all this and
aren't even asking the right questions.
Just look at the clouds and what you see
is an electric field, writ large across
the sky. It really couldn't be more
obvious. Just ignore the scientists and
use your own noggin. It's better if
you're not institutionally taught to ask
the wrong question. Then take a look at
Google Earth and compare to NASA's
images of Jupiter. You will see all the
patterns of Jupiter's storm clouds
reflected in Earth's geology. Mountain
ranges and desert dunes carry the shape
of the winds that formed them. Rising
columns, violent downbursts, precipitation,
whirlwinds, and lightning brushed the land
like a painter and left indelible
brushstrokes. The similarity of shapes
and weather comes from internal
circuitry of the planets. This means that
Jupiter and Earth are very
similar in that regard.
Repeating fractal forms at different
scales is one proof of a fractal process.
Fractals emerge naturally in chemistry,
fluid dynamics and biology, but the
process that defines them all - the common
denominator - is the process of charge
diffusion in an electromagnetic field. It
manifests not only at the particle scale,
but the atomic, molecular, and cellular
scale, and produces fractal forms at the
macro-scale because they are made
coherent with electromagnetic fields.
Now let's raise the voltage a bit on
Earth and see what happens. A correlation
between the Colorado Plateau and the
Great Red Spot (GRS) on Jupiter has
similarities of such complexity in
detail that it seems absolutely surreal.
Inflow to the GRS appears in two sinuous
lanes of rolling winds that correlate
with the mountain ranges
in the Pacific Northwest.
These snaking flows of wind feed a giant
thunderhead that occupies the lower
third of the image of the GRS, where white
anvil clouds obscure what’s below. Such
a mesocyclone careened over the Great
Basin, extending its entire rotating wall
cloud clear to the ground. The Great
Basin was formed by rippling waves of
dust-laden winds spun beneath a 100 mile
wide funnel, lashed by torrents of rain.
The parallel rows of basin and range
mountains, that march like rippling dunes
across Nevada, were laid transverse to the
wind. In the annotated image, wind fronts
are denoted by dark blue lines, and
there's an S-shaped range at the
inflection point where the in-flow winds
bent to the rotating updraft. The blue and
violet lines denote the wind direction,
exiting east at high altitude over Provo,
Utah where it made no mark on the land -
until it water-fell on the other side of
the shear zone that formed the Wasatch
Range, spilling a violent downdraft into
the Uintah Basin. Another, large flanking
downdraft flows south over the Wasatch
shear zone and spills down to form the
Mogollon Rim, the southern extension of
the Colorado Plateau arcing south-east
from roughly, the Kaibab rim of the Grand
Canyon to the Gila River in New Mexico.
The wind formed rim is intermixed with
volcanoes. This was a wet, rotating
mesocyclone, carrying considerable
moisture which precipitated out and
evaporated, forming salt basins behind
ranges and culminating in a rain
curtain over what is now the Great Salt
Lake and Bonneville Salt Flats. The long,
linear mountain ranges of the Great
Basin are in many cases windswept dirt.
Hard rock, which indicates heat and
recombination of ionic matter is absent,
or minimal in many cases, which indicates
low-density lightning in this
region. The triangular faces of shock
wave reflections earmark the wind
direction. Often, no triangular shock
features are present, indicating subsonic
flow, so many hills take a recognizable
sand-dune shape. Where the storm down-
drafted to the northeast, it landed
in the Uintah Valley and joined the
ground winds of another rotation.
Actually, it's two primary rotations that
sucked wind from the north, to form
enormous pressure ridges perpendicular
to the wind direction: the wind river and
Uinta Mountains. The mountain ranges
formed as lightning arced to ground and
charged diffused across the land and
channeled currents which form dikes.
Dikes are walls of rock formed from the
country-rock fused together, and often
display troughs alongside where material
sucked to the current. An example is the
Tetons, where Grand Teton itself is a
lightning generated fulgurite surrounded
by smaller fulgurites, blanketed with
wind driven dunes. The Teton fulgurite
extended a dike to the south which
collected dust against it, which drew
more lightning to it creating a mountain
lobe. Wind piled material against dikes to
build a mountain lobe and leave one flank
patterned with the sonic shock of the wind.
Winds deflecting horizontal to vertical
left ruler-straight ridge lines of
tetrahedrons where shock reflections
patterned diamond-shaped regions of
expansion and
compression. The wind was pulled by twin
whirlwinds created by a grounded
current loop. Its footprint is a dome and
crater pair. Dome and crater pairs are
created by what I call a coronal loop,
because, electrically, it's the same as a
prominence on the Sun. It's a ring
current couple to the land and wind
sucks up one side in a mesocyclone
that leaves a dome, walled by inward-
pointing shockwave tetrahedrons. The wind
loops from the thunderhead anvil to feed
the center of a down-drafting cyclone,
the footprint of which is a crater with
outward-pointing tetrahedrons. This pair
is squished into almost polygonal shapes
because it's pressed between larger
rotations. The Wyoming vortex is the
smallest of three primary vortices of
the larger multi-vortex storm in the GRS.
It isn’t apparent in Jupiter's clouds,
but I suspect it's there underneath the
anvils. From the South, hot dry winds
scorched across Mexico and the American
Southwest with counterflowing winds.
Along the turbulent shear zone between,
kinks appear in the Sierra Madre
Oriental, where north-flowing jet streams
mixed with a south-flowing stream that
formed the Sierra Occidental and the
alto-plano in between. The kinks in
Mexico's Cordilleras match remarkably
well the kinks of turbulence where inflow
and outflow winds mix adjacent to the
GRS. That's probably an understatement.
There are details here to fill a book,
but take a close look on Google Earth at
these kinks to see some amazing wind and
shockwave features. We looked in an
earlier episode at the overall
morphology of winds in the very eye of the
GRS and the Colorado Plateau. So, now
let's take an even closer look. The eye
is a multiple vortex cyclone, which
displays a complex system of coronal
loops that twist the wind into a
crocheted doily pattern. There are
several paired updraft domes and
downdraft craters centered on the
Colorado Plateau and Rocky Mountains. The
most distinctive is the San Rafael Swell
in central Utah. The swell is ringed by
explosively charged, dense region of
recombination and magnetic pinch known
as the San Rafael Reef, where its rows of
dragon's teeth - tetrahedral monoliths of
hard, fused sandstone - provide evidence of
a shock wave at the boundary of the
updraft. The reef is the rim of an
updraft dome formed beneath an intense
coronal loop that raged electrical havoc
on the land at the sharp end of the
storm. The dome behind is shaped like one
lens of an eye glass, the other lens an
inverse copy, made by the downdraft of
the same coronal loop. The downdraft
crater has a central peak of lightning-
struck mountains where a material drew
up in winds generated by the return
stroke of the lightning. The rim of the
crater forms Capitol Reef, were more
monolithic tetrahedrons display wind
direction and Mach angles pointing
outwards. Another example of an updraft
dome is Monument Valley, Arizona. Its
shark’s teeth rim is formed by inflow winds
expressed in the triangular sandstone
layers of Comb Ridge. The interior of the
dome is the sputtered remnants of
lightning-diffused mesas and pinnacles,
preferentially left behind as the
landscape around lifted away in the most
intense electric field in the eye of the
storm. The downdraft leg of the Monument Valley
ring current lies in the bend of the San
Juan River, as it passes through the Four
Corners region. Annotated to distinguish
the features, the same eyeglass shape is
evident where this Corona loop connects
with Earth, but the shape is skewed to
the ambient counter-clockwise rotation of
the entire storm system. The downdraft
lies at 90 degrees to the op draft because
of fractal symmetry - something we'll discuss
more later - and the ambient rotation of the eye.
Once again, the crater has a central peak
of lightning-fused mountains, but its
crater rim has largely been swept away
and its face flattened by the pressing
rotation of winds. This is “ground zero”
for the eye of the storm. Note, the San
Juan River arcs around the downdraft
after it passes through the center of
the updraft, just as the tributary of the
Green River wrapped around the Capitol
Reef downdraft crater and then shot
through the heart of the San Rafael Dome.
These are the fractal forms of surface
conductive discharges, or “arc blast” and
the rivers are part of it, which we'll
also discuss in future articles. A shear
zone separates the Wyoming vortex from
the eye rotation over the Plateau. At
this shear zone, like others, mountains
formed beneath upwelling updrafts. In this
case, nestled against the powerful
updrafts of the San Rafael Swell and
surrounding cyclones, it formed in the
shape of an oxbow. Here we see one of the
wonders of fractal forms. The “oxbow” on
Jupiter is a distorted image of the
”oxbow” on Earth, with the bows curving in
opposite arcs. It seems odd, but nature is
kind of dyslexic. Fractals display
rotational and translational symmetries,
meaning a shape can be in any of several
orientations - rotated at 90, or 180
degrees,  or flipped about one axis in
mirror image, or translated “back-assward”.
When this happens, it doesn't change the
overall structure it's a part of and the
energy balance remains the same. Harmonic
repetitions also appear. The most
striking example lies smack between the
updraft dome and the downdraft crater of
the San Rafael coronal storm loop.
Watch this fractal expression expand in
scale. Images are taken along a “z” axis in
space from a single point on the ground
at varying altitudes. The fractal repeats
but the center point of each fractal
expression stays in place. It morphs in
form with emergent effects, but the
fundamental circuit relationship remain
solidly displayed. They are the same
weather patterns we have today, but of a
super-Olympian scale, as told in
countless ancient accounts. We need to
start listening to the ancients because
they knew things that we don't.
Eye of the storm has presented an aerial
view of the coupling of Earth's
atmosphere to its surface, so far. Next
episode, it's time to switch and talk
about the other side of the mirror - the
dark side of the mirror. Below Earth’s
crust lie dragons and demons. Thank you.

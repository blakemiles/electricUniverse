Exposing the Myths of Settled Science
subtitled - A Guide for the Perplexed -
And I do understand that the
NPA members are not perplexed,
but I ask people here today.
How many believe that the foundational
assumptions of the theoretical sciences
deserve to be called
settled science?
That they are fully secure?
How did I know that?
Not even close I heard.
Just a few observations, 'The myths of
settled science rely upon public confusion'.
I think everyone here understands that
that's true to one degree or another.
In every field people are confused because
they don't know what or whom to believe.
They think the issues are too deep to be
grasped by outsiders or by us plebeians.
Imagination is trapped in the
myths of settled science...
without realizing how
these myths arose.
It's incredible to discover how a couple of
core assumptions, foundational assumptions
filtered into the entire domain, the
entire edifice of theoretical science.
The two assumptions are:
● Gravity alone rules the cosmos.
● Gravity's behavior must be interpreted
through the lens of relativity theory.
And I'm just going to concentrate on
the first one because I do understand
that the second one gets a lot of
attention by members of the NPA.
Just a quick outline here of the innumerable
domains of specialized investigation
that depend ultimately upon the
foundational idea that gravity is king.
There is no other force doing real
work across cosmic distances.
I presume everybody
can see the type,
I tried to make the type
deliberately large here.
And yet, a new vantage
point is emerging today,
and that vantage point
is highlighting
the newly discovered roles of
electricity across the cosmos.
Now, there's no sound playing,
obviously, there is on my system
and that's not gonna
mean a lot, but...
We always thought that the
earth was the unique location
of electrical activity
at energies of this sort.
And yet, now we know that the electric force
is active from microcosm to macrocosm.
And how many people here
would want to defend the idea that
spectacular structures in space
of this sort can be reconstructed
through Newton's
gravitational equation?
We honors pioneers such as Kristian
Birkeland and Hannes Alfvén
experimental pioneers in the
role of electricity in space,
and dozens of others
could be mentioned.
The key components of an
Electric Universe paradigm
are first, electric current
across cosmic distances,
that's across interstellar
and intergalactic distances;
electric galaxy formation;
electric star formation;
electric sun and
electrified heliosphere;
electrical scarring
of planets and moons;
electric comets, that's comets
plunging through the electric field
of the Sun to discharge
electrically;
electricity of life, a huge new domain
of investigation within the
Electric Universe community today;
the quantum role of
the electric force.
I know many people in the
NPA are exploring this
and the connection to the
underpinnings of gravity itself;
and the electrified ancient sky,
that's my own field of
concentrated study for decades
and I'm really not going to even
touch that field here today,
other than to say it does bring
the Electric Universe with it.
Now, I formulated what I call a core
prediction of the Electric Universe
based simply on observation of what's in the science news these days.
When we examine energetic events
in space, we will always find
electromagnetic intensities far beyond the
ability of prior theory to explain them.
And this has been born out to the
most extraordinary degree
and this incidentally
is why we called our
conference earlier this
year 'The Tipping Point'.
It's not a reference to a
psychological / cultural phenomenon
this phenomenon hasn't entered into
popular consciousness at all yet.
It hasn't found its way even any clear and
meaningful way into the scientific media,
but the facts as we say, 'discovery
by discovery one surprise at a time',
taking the entire field of inquiry into
the Electric Universe unannounced.
And the admonition is
question all theoretical assumptions
when they stopped working.
The big picture of space
we say is broken,
broken in more ways than
one, it's not working
and it's broken
in the sense that
the picture of the cosmos is
one of isolated islands.
An isolated island means that to
discover what's going on dynamically
you can only find the answer
by looking inside the island,
the larger context of surrounding space has
nothing to contribute by way of an answer.
Thanks to the explosion of
technology in recent decades
we have the opportunity
to see objects in space
across the entire
electromagnetic spectrum
Well, this is the ideal for anyone
pursuing the Electric Universe paradigm.
Here was galaxy M87, just
before the space-age.
Now, M87 courtesy of
Hubble Telescope
and a structure spreading thousands of light
years across the deep vacuum of space.
X-ray emissions concentrated
along this jet,
remembering that this
jet is across a vacuum
greater than we can produce
and any laboratory.
It is entirely enigmatic in an
electrically neutral Cosmos.
At the core of M87 we see emissions
in radio and X-ray wavelengths,
but actually across
the entire spectrum
and that's the signature
of synchrotron radiation,
the highest magnitude radiation
known to science today.
And synchrotron radiation was first
predicted by Nobel Laureate,
father of modern plasma
science, Hannes Alfvén.
But what does standard theory see?
Standard theory sees this
speck that is identified,
theoretically, as the
irresistible attractor.
But what is it doing?
It is shooting charged particles away
from the black hole at the center of M87.
It's important for everyone considering
an Electric Universe paradigm
to wrap their minds
as best they can
around the distance involved
in this stupendous jets.
How far does light
travel in a second?
186,000 miles
How far does it
travel in a year?
It's something like
5.88 trillion miles
and that is a light
year of course.
These distances are typically
counted in parsecs.
A parsec is 3.26 light-years.
This jet is 50,000 parsecs,
and now it's measured
electrically.
Measurement of the Electric
Current in a Kpc-Scale Jet.
"We obtained for the first time a direct determination
of a galactic-scale electric current (~3 x 10^18 A)."
It's just unfathomable
what is occurring across
this unimaginable distance
of vacuum in space,
"Our analysis strongly supports a model where
the jet energy flow is mainly electromagnetic."
There are no islands in space.
Just imagine having to
defend the idea that
infinitesimal speck inside that glow to the
lower left is producing all of this.
The truth is that if you
had an electron microscope
to look at this image at this scale,
you would not see the black hole.
And if the image that you
did see was brought up
and you had another electron microscope to
look, you still wouldn't see the black hole.
How did it happen that we became
so confined theoretically
that we are required to look
inside that galactic core
and ignore the charged particles
that constitute a sea of plasma
feeling this unbelievable
volume of space
and it really is impossible to
wrap our minds around that.
Galaxies are immersed in the
surrounding electromagnetic emissions.
There's the galaxy.
And again, why would we ignore
the power of charged particles
in that immense volume of space
that constitutes the context
of this galaxies appearance?
And now we know that magnetic
fields pervade the universe,
and we see this as science coming to the
Electric Universe through the back door.
It is not possible in the vacuum of
space to create a magnetic field
or to sustain a magnetic field in
the absence of electric currents.
We're talking about converging
evidence, and we can bring the focus
down to our own cosmic
neighborhood and explore the sun
and ask ourselves now the question
that has never been ask in
70 years of solar physics.
Is the Sun truly
an island in space
with no electrical connection to
billions of stars in the sea of plasma
that constitute the Milky Way?
Interestingly, we now see,
courtesy of the new technologies,
the new telescopes and so on,
we see star formation along concentrated
plasma filaments or current filaments
and the expression 'Beads on a String' is
coming into the popular scientific lexicon.
"Beads on a String"
Well, that's the very phrasing used by
Hannes Alfvén and such plasma scientists
as Anthony Peratt who we
got to know quite well.
"Beads on a String"
Now, does gravity
create filamentation?
Can gravity act on a filamentation to create
a concentration of matter in a sphere?
That concentration into a star forming
region and the birth of a sun or star
is the language of the
plasma cosmologist.
And here's an amazing fact,
we didn't do this graph here:
the width of those filaments has
now been measured in infrared,
and they are
strikingly consistent.
This is from the Herschel
telescope, and you can see
the region on the
electromagnetic spectrum
where they are able
to actually measure
the widths of these
filaments quite precisely.
And again, that is a prediction
of plasma cosmology.
"This consistency of the widths
demands an explanation."
"...Herschel has shown that newly-born stars
are often found in the densest parts of them."
That's a prediction of
plasma cosmology.
Then, to explore the heliospheric
boundary, we resorted to the IBEX mission.
The Interstellar
Boundary Explorer
It was funded on the basis of 30
predictions, and every prediction failed!
The thing that's really shocking is
this ribbon of energetic neutral atoms.
Why in the deep vacuum of space
would atoms ever be energized
or gather into a ribbon?
This is what happens in an electrical
interpretation of the heliospheric boundary.
Voyager's out there now, and it's left
them all scratching their heads.
I'm not the one to
argue a point here
but I can tell you if you will follow
Wal Thornhill's predictions
with respect to what is found
at the heliosphere boundary,
you will see a remarkable accord.
And nothing that was anticipated
by conventional theory,
which imagined the heliosphere
moving to neutral space,
kinda like a comet that’s warping the
magnetosphere into kind of comet-like tail,
it's not there.
"It's a huge surprise. In some sense we have
touched the intergalactic medium,
but we're still inside
the sun's house."
"The models that have been thought to predict
what should happen are all incorrect."
This is not a small thing.
So, we come right to the
Sun itself and ask,
well, we know its big and round,
but do we really know much
more about it accurately.
It's been on the table for decades
the idea that the Sun
could be a glow discharge
responding to an
electrified environment.
Geissler tubes, Crookes
tubes, neon tubes
and all those exquisite
cultural expressions.
Controlled Fusion?
It is time to actually raise the
thermonuclear Sun model to doubt,
to serious questioning.
We know thermonuclear fusion occurs;
we've seen it out of control.
But we were so confident in the
thermonuclear core of the Sun
that we have spent hundreds
of billions of dollars
believing we could replicate
that within 20 years.
The 20-year timetable
was announced in 1950,
and we're still seeing
the 20-year timetable.
This is a tokamak.
"In any useful fusion device, the energy
output must exceed the energy required
to confine and heat the plasma."
It has never happened!
Is it possible for us to begin
wondering if our assumption
about what was possible and what is
occurring in the Sun is actually incorrect.
This then forces on us a
question of logic and reasoning
on the basis of
things we now know.
How many attributes of the Sun follow from
the assumption of a thermonuclear core?
It's incredible,
not a single one.
This will drive some people crazy, and
they'll immediately challenges us on this,
but I believe it's
absolutely true.
One question can be formulated
in these different ways,
and do gases just boil off the
surface of the Sun as "wind"
as that last question is posed?
Are surface features driven
entirely from below?
Are sunspot penumbra the "convection
cells" we assume them to be?
Now, I believe that the answer
to all of these questions is
not just no, but a definitive
- No - in the sense that
when all the evidence bearing on
the question, once you ask it,
it is not a coincidence that it's
always pointing to the negative answer.
So, "The Neutrino Problem"
that was the phrase
from solar physics
when they examined the
neutrino production of the Sun
and they found it was just one-third of
what was predicted by their model.
Since then, there's been a lot of
rationalization as to what's happening
to neutrinos on their course from the Sun
and that's not something for me to get into.
But I can tell you, that in electrical terms,
there is an answer to the neutrino issue
that comes from a completely
different way of seen everything.
When a coronal mass ejection, a particularly
strong coronal mass ejection occurs,
the neutrino count goes up.
Now, a coronal mass
ejection is a surface event.
Once we see that a surface
event is creating neutrinos
thermonuclear reactions are
occurring at the surface.
How can we ignore the simple
fact that the surface of the Sun
is incomparably greater then the focal
point of a coronal mass ejection.
Could we redirect scientific investigation,
at least long enough, to determine
if the Sun is dynamically
presenting behavior consistent with
thermonuclear reactions
at the surface?
There was on Wikipedia a
very well presented page
on surface thermonuclear
reactions on the Sun,
and you can imagine
what happened to it.
A year and a half or two
years ago it was taken down.
Solar Constancy
&
Solar Variability
I see the issue of constancy on the one
hand and variability on the other hand
as posing questions that are
simply not been asked.
We can pose them from
interdisciplinary vantage point
just looking at issues
of logic and reasoning.
In visible light the Sun does not
vary more than one-tenth of 1%
over the entire solar cycle.
That's the general rule.
At higher frequencies, which are
not coincidentally at higher elevations
the variability grows profound.
Here's the variability
in ultraviolet light.
And in X-rays through one solar cycle,
the Sun virtually blinks out.
Additionally, you have in X-rays this
equally profound regional variation.
And we have to reflect on how could
it happen that a thermonuclear core
would produce by heat transferred
outward a uniquely stable photosphere.
And then as you rise
into a higher elevations,
you get profound
variability of emissions.
What is causing
that variability?
Well, here is something that bears
directly on that kind of question.
And the line you see
there is a voltage curve
that was initially
produced by Ralph Juergens,
a brilliant engineer, who as you might say
the father of the electric sun hypothesis,
this goes back four
or five decades.
What that curve is, is a
curve of the glow discharge,
the voltage curve of
the glow discharge.
Wal Thornhill then has worked with this, and
Don Scott has worked with this curve
to explore how a voltage curve could
relate to the known layers of the Sun.
A breakthrough occurred with Don
Scott when he looked at that curve
and he said, that is the configuration,
that's the profile of a transistor.
And this gave rise then to a breakthrough
concept of a transistor action on the Sun.
And if you look at that curve that is
stable across the photosphere
just the slightest elevation
or depression of that curve,
if it's a transistor, would be
regulating to a much greater degree
other activity of the Sun,
just as a transistor does.
I am not qualified to evaluate the
transistor effect in the Sun,
but I have asked several
electric engineers,
one is here today,
in fact - Hi Roger,
and everyone has said,
it makes perfect sense.
The spicules of the Sun have to be
investigated from a new vantage point
and so much of this has to do with the
inter-facial dynamics of different plasma regions
and charged particles being launched
into higher regions and so on.
And to both Don Scott
and Wal Thornhill
place a great emphasis on the
study of the spicule dynamics.
Solar Wind
Certain aspects of the
Sun are so clear-cut
in demonstrating that the sun
has this electrical underpinning.
But we hear from NASA that:
"[The solar wind] defies a complete
description by any one theory."
They say, "It's hotter than expected,
for one, and no one has yet agreed
which of several theories
offers the best explanation..."
But these statements are made
because there's no acknowledgment
that an electric sun hypothesis
deserves consideration.
And I believe that this chart is
the single most important chart
that has come out
the electric sun concept
because it is showing you charged particles
doing what only an electric field can do.
You see down at the Sun's
surface into the lower corona
and into the upper corona
spectacular acceleration.
And then, across interplanetary
space 96 million miles
these charged particles are slowly,
mile by mile, being accelerated,
very slowly and immeasurably
at any particular point
but, this is published fact, accelerated
across interplanetary distances
and they are not
little rocket ships.
Something is acting on
these charged particles,
and that something as demonstrated
in the laboratory for centuries,
that something is
an electric field.
It's always good when there's an issue
of principle or dynamic activity
with a model behind it,
take it to the extremes.
And the transistor effect would in fact allow
for the solar wind to completely stop
because it's being regulated by a superior
regulator, which is across the photosphere.
And in January 2005, a coronal mass
ejection reach the earth in 30 minutes.
It was traveling a quarter the speed of
light by the time it reached the Earth.
So, it's not a small matter
to simply acknowledge
that an electric field is
self-evidently present.
There is nothing known to science
which could accomplish that extreme
other than any electric field.
Photosphere
It's imagery of this sort that has convinced
folks that through the convective zone
temperatures plasma are
bubbling upward
to form granulation or
cellular structures.
But we have to ask the question,
"Are all energetic events on the Sun being
driven by forces acting from below?"
That's the bedrock of standard theory:
everything is energized from below.
Is there no evidence for
electrical action from above?
The evidence appears to be everywhere
if we'll just ask the question.
Here's the idea of the magnetic
flux-injection hypothesis
if you look at these
twisted magnetic fields,
which looks suspiciously
like Birkeland Currents,
they are all being pushed
up from below in this model.
It's called the flux-
injection hypothesis.
I spent a lot of time
just asking myself,
well, if the Sun is electrical
that hypothesis won't stand up.
And so I looked into the literature,
and I found an article by Peter Shuck
this is the best article I
found, honestly, on the subject
quite apart from my preference
at finding such a thing.
it is the best article I could find in
terms of systematic evaluation
and he says in that article in
no uncertain terms,
the flux-injection
hypothesis does not work.
The budget of energy that must be present
in the lower region is not available.
Shuck determined that the flux injection hypothesis
doesn't work and must be dropped.
What he found instead was...
What he found instead was a sudden explosion
triggered from above more like lightning.
And that takes you right back to the
worker of Charles Bruce in England,
again decades ago a real
pioneer who noticed
that the signature spectroscopically
of this energetic activity on the Sun
is the signature of lightning;
this is an electrified surface.
Sunspots
&
Convection
We can take this whole issue
further by looking at sunspots
you have a spotless sun
and a more normal sun.
And when we look into the sunspot what
we see is the cooler subsurface region.
But if it is millions of
degrees rushing upward
through the convective zone, how does it
happen that we cannot find in the center
of any sunspot any indication of
subsurface super temperatures?
So, sunspots are
like an acid test
because you see these penumbral
filaments on the margin
and they can only be one thing
under the standard model.
They are convection cells.
You have to have convection,
the heat has to get out somewhere
and they think they see it
and they talk about
overturning convection
but when you pull back
up into the chromosphere
it's not quite what they were expecting and
you see everything is actually dominated
and confided contained
by magnetic fields.
It's charged particles moving
along the filamentary pathways.
What does this have to
do with temperature?
Well, they decided that this was
overturning convection.
It depends how you diagnose
something like this.
Wow, that looks like the
stuff is just pouring out.
But this is actually quite deceptive
because what you're seeing
actually is material moving
outward and show you more closely.
The stuff around the
penumbra is moving outward
and that's what you're
seeing in that image
but the penumbra, the stuff is
pouring into the sunspot.
And Wal Thornhill has such an
elementary explanation.
He says, this is like
tornadoes touching down.
It's an electrical phenomena,
and the discharging
you actually watch this
overtime and you can see,
and in other NASA animations,
you can see how
what Wal Thornhill would predict,
which is an explosive glow
at a particular point that
comes and goes but at the tips
they're dipping down, it's a
tornado touching down
I don't think any anyone ever in the
history of the electric's sun hypothesis
before Wal Thornhill proposed that
these twisting, helical filaments
where actually tornado-like
electrically-driven filaments.
Where's the
Convection
But then again there's the
overturning convection hypothesis.
And for years now solar physicists have been
seeking to find overturning convection and verify,
through temperature profiles and so on, that
it's superheated material rising surface
they've been looking to the filaments
of the penumbra and suggesting,
well, maybe the temperature is being siphoned
up through the center the penumbra.
Where is the convection?
Well, again you can find an article
'searching for overturning convection'
by Professor Rubio of
Italy and company
"Despite the excellent
quality of the data set,
we do not detect downflows that could be associated
with overturning convection in deep layers."
"The lack of a clear detection of
overturning downflows may simply indicate
that they do not exist."
Well, that would be
news because you
if you have no convection,
you have no nuclear furnace.
Well, they did an "MRI" of the Sun,
they were so confident in convection,
that means they could look into
the deeper layers of the Sun
through magnetic resonance imaging,
and they were quite confident that
that's how they would confirm
that the motion of those charged
particles convected upwards
would explain the magnetic
field of the Sun.
At best they found 1% of the
convection they needed.
And notice this, "The result...
upends our understanding
of how heat is transported
outwards by the Sun..."
See, it upends our understanding
of what we know is happening.
They don't question whether what they
think they know is actually known,
is actually true.
Same here, "...and challenges existing
explanations of the formation of sunspots
and magnetic field generation".
But no fundamental questioning
of the nuclear core hypothesis
even though it requires something
that is clearly not happening.
Coronal
Heating
Corona heating, this is discussed
so much within our circle,
I'm not gonna make a
big deal out of this.
I just like the humor
astronomer Jay Pasachoff
saying that it's been solved
a dozen times.
And since he said that it's been
solved another dozen times.
And they continue to solve it,
and what they get lasts
only weeks or months.
I'm gonna give a ridiculously
elementary example of coronal heating
from a radically
different vantage point,
the vantage point that would
emphasize inter-facial boundaries
between two domains, both of which
are contributing to a dynamic event.
Here's a candle; where's the
heat, the maximum heat?
It's not down at the fuel supply.
It's in the interface of the fuel
supply and the surrounding oxygen.
In 1996, I was caught in a ridiculous
debate with some people on it
all talk I will call
talk origins, and I said
you know if you put
a candle in space
so that you didn't have gravity
and you didn't have convection,
you'd get a spherical flame, and you
would see that the maximum energies
are at the boundary of that
fuel and the surrounding oxygen.
And it just happened that a couple years ago
that in the International Space Station
they put a candle, and that's
exactly what you do get here.
That is an example of inter-facial dynamics
that can be applied to the Electric Sun
where you do not get to ignore the surrounding
contribution of the plasma environment
through the heat of the Sun and all of
the electromagnetic emissions of the Sun
and all of the layers
of the Sun's atmosphere
with such a different levels of
constancy and variability.
Polar Jets
I'd gonna make sure that I
get to this presentation.
Polar jets that they help to complete
the image of solar sized magnet here
but this is not new, I mean, Birkeland's
experiment gave you polar jets
and essentially gave you the core or
the focal point of the hourglass form
that has been hypothesized by
the Electric Sun proponents.
And you see in such nebula
as in the Butterfly Nebula.
Torus
The torus that Birkeland produced in
his lab is such a beautiful example of
the relationship between
experimentation and theory.
Forget the math until you have got a
basis in observation and experiment
to direct the mathematicians.
Discharging from the
torus to the sphere,
the magnetized sphere of his terella,
you see the polar jets there.
And, by golly, the sun has a torus
also projected into an axial view.
And notice this.
How does it occur that the
equatorial atmosphere rotates
36 times for every 25 times
of the circumpolar rotation?
How would something...
How would something
driving the Sun from within
produce super-rotation at the
outer layer and at the equator.
I mean, actually you're looking here at
two levels of differential rotation
because it's not just the equatorial
atmosphere that is rotating fast,
it's rotating faster
than the surface below.
Now, Wal Thornhill got me to thinking about
something, this is a number of years back,
he said, the sunspot appears to be,
if you follow Birkeland's experiment,
the location of a discharge moving right
through the visible layer the Sun's atmosphere.
I was looking at this and I
thought well this is interesting
it looks to me as if that discharge is
parting the waves, you might say,
and anchoring to a slower-moving
subsurface layer.
And for that reason, it is
resisting being moved along
by the super-rotating equatorial
atmosphere of the Sun.
I just think things
of this sort would...
These stand in such total and
self-evident defiance of a standard model
that you have to begin looking from
an interdisciplinary vantage point,
complemented by increasingly
specialized research.
You have to begin looking at a new
picture of the Sun from the ground up
because what we were given 70
years ago has failed every test.
Earth-Sun
Connection
Perfect example, again, of
the experimental approach
and its impact on the future of science
was the work of Kristian Birkeland
who said, our earth aurora is being
produced by charged particles from the Sun
entering the upper
atmosphere of our Earth.
Sydney Chapman, a mathematician and
Dean of the Earth-Sun Relationship Studies,
said the Earth was insulated,
insulated by its magnetosphere,
and charged particles could not enter the
upper atmosphere of the earth directly.
And then in the 70's, we discovered
that charged particles from the Sun
were indeed entering the
Earth's upper atmosphere.
And now we call those
particle streams
Birkeland Currents in honor
of the experimentalist.
We have look closely enough to see that the
currents are moving in cylindrical forms
and ironically Don Scott has
produced a recent paper,
which I hope people will have a chance
to access in the next few months,
that gives the
mathematical bases
for this cylindrical or embedded
cylindrical form of the auroras of Earth.
There are no islands in space!
And certainly anyone who has followed the
evidence for the Earth-Sun connection,
the circuitry
connecting both bodies,
would have to agree that
you're not looking at islands.
Question all theoretical
assumptions!
And that concludes my talk.
Thank you.

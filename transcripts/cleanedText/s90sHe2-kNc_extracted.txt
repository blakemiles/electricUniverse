We concluded the previous episode 
with an overview of the vast evidence,
accumulated by Halton Arp and others,
and indicated by the initial images of the
James Webb Space Telescope, that
cosmological redshift is intrinsic, which
thus falsifies the foundational axiom of
Big Bang cosmology. I turn now to deal
with the Webb first deep field, unveiled
during a White House event on the 11th
of July 2022. NASA's associated news
release states, “Thousands of galaxies -
including the faintest objects ever
observed in the infrared - have appeared
in Webb's View for the first time. This slice of the
vast universe is approximately the size of a grain of
sand held at arm's length by someone 
on the ground. This deep field, taken by
Webb's near infrared camera (NIRCam), is 
a composite made from images at different
wavelengths, totaling 12.5 hours - achieving depths at
infrared wavelengths beyond the Hubble Space Telescope
deepest fields, which took weeks.” In order to make sense
of this image, we must take account of several matters.
First, we know from the study of galaxies
in our local universe that they come in
a range of shapes, sizes, luminosities 
and colors. At similar distances, some
galaxies are smaller and some are larger.
Some galaxies, especially dusty galaxies,
appear redder, while others appear bluer. For a given
size, some are more luminous and others less luminous.
Astrophysicists expect variability among distant
galaxies at every point in the Hubble flow.
Secondly, the Webb first deep field is
centered on a massive galaxy cluster
surrounded by stretched-out, curved
objects. In the Standard Model, these
curved objects are distant galaxies that
are gravitationally lensed, making them
appear larger and brighter than they
would be in the absence of that lensing.
Of course, in the Electric Universe that
effect is due to refraction through the
neutrino-sea ether that is denser around
that massive galaxy cluster than elsewhere.
Thirdly, humans cannot see the
wavelengths of infrared light that were
used to construct the image. Instead,
colors in the visible range that we can
see, were assigned to the different filters and
then combined to produce the composite image.
The specified filters are circled in the assigned
colors in the NASA graphic that you see on the screen.
You can see that there is broad coverage
in the range from 0.6 to 5 microns.
Visible light extends down to about 0.7 microns. 
As you would expect, NASA's image
processing team assigned blue to the
shortest or bluest wavelengths, green for
still longer wavelengths, orange for even
longer wavelengths, and finally red for
the longest wavelengths in the image.
Fourthly, for some of the small faint
galaxies in the Webb first deep field
image, or in the deep images released by
the CEERS project, we do not necessarily
know whether that small size in the
image is due to the galaxy being physically
smaller and closer, or larger and further away.
Now, assigning a value to the distance of
the galaxy or quasar, can be confusing.
In the Standard Model, space has been
continually expanding since the Big Bang,
and the brief period of exponential
expansion, referred to as inflation.
That means that the distance traveled by
light emitted from an object, increases
due to the expansion of space, while the 
light is traveling on its path to the observer.
Moreover, the space already traversed by
that light continues to expand, while the
light continues to the observer. So, a galaxy that is
one billion light years distant from Earth at the time its
light is emitted, will be further away 
by the time that light arrives at the
telescope. The lookback time, or distance
at the time the light was emitted, plus
that additional distance arising from
the expansion of space during the light’s
travel time, is referred to as the quote
’co-moving radial distance’ - the dotted
line, marked ‘distance now’ on the graph,
and can give a distance in light years
that exceeds the age of the universe - 
the horizontal blue line on the graph.
The time that has elapsed since the
light was emitted, is referred to as the
lookback time, or light travel time, and
is the value that is most commonly used
to describe the distance of high- redshift objects.
That is what is shown on the y-axis of the
graph. Notice the declining slope of
the ‘distance then’ line in this graph
beyond a redshift of about three.
In everyday life, we're used to the
intuitive idea that the apparent size of
objects - what astronomers refer to as
their angular diameter – decreases, as 
the distance to those objects increases.
An object looks smaller as the distance to that
object increases. In Standard Model cosmology,
that relationship only holds until redshift reaches
about Z=2. It's uncontroversial that in the expanding
universe of the Big Bang, there's an
optical effect that beyond a redshift of
about Z=2 causes the apparent
size of galaxies to increase with
increasing redshift and distance. This
effect is totally counter-intuitive, but
is an inevitable consequence of Big Bang
Theory. This effect occurs because in an
expanding universe, the light we see from
high-redshift galaxies, was emitted many
billions of years ago, when the universe
was much smaller and the emitting galaxy
was much closer. In the time that the
light has taken to travel the distance
to our telescope, the space through
which the light has traveled had
continued to expand, reddening that light and
reducing the amount that arrives per unit time.
This leads to the counter-intuitive
result that beyond a redshift of about
Z=2, galaxies of the same size will appear larger,
redder, and fainter as their redshift increases.
Moreover, as several Japanese scientists
have shown, some red spiral galaxies with
a redshift in the range of Z=1 to 3 can
imitate galaxies with a much higher redshift.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it
is essential to recognize that the Webb
first deep field is not claiming to depict redshift.
Redshift values for objects across the
image are not yet publicly available.
Nevertheless, given the way that colors
are assigned in the image, averaged over
the whole image, the colors in the image
are a reasonable proxy for redshift.
So, if the Big Bang Theory is correct
then, averaged over the whole of the 
Webb deep-field images, and putting aside
obviously lensed objects, the faintest objects
should be the reddest objects in the image.
Further, the faintest and reddest galaxies should
appear larger than less faint and less red galaxies.
But this is not what the Webb's first
deep field and the CEERS images show.
Instead, it is plain on even a casual
analysis of those images that, averaged
over the whole image, the faintest
objects are the smallest objects and
that a large proportion of the faintest
objects are rendered in blue.
We're going to look at a portion of the
image indicated by the white rectangle.
The arrows point to examples of faint
objects that have been rendered in blue.
As we zoom and pan across the image,
note that a clear majority of the faintest
objects, all of them galaxies, are rendered 
in blue. This is prima facie, a stunning
contradiction of the Big Bang's foundational 
premise. In the Electric Universe, space is not
expanding. The universe is of unknown 
age and unknown extent, possibly infinite.
Following the observations and insights
of Halton Arp, one way new galaxies are
formed, is by ejection from active galactic
nuclei [AGN], commencing life as very
highly redshifted quasars that progress
through quantized decreases in redshift,
such that high redshift is an indication
of the youthfulness of a galaxy.
In the Electric Universe, we expect 
to see galaxies that get smaller and
fainter - some bluer, some redder - to the
limits of the telescope's observational
power. That is exactly what Webb's first
deep field shows. I predict that deeper
Webb images will further confirm that fact.
In particular, I predict that when very
deep Webb images are obtained with 
many days or weeks of observation, the
detection of additional faint galaxies
will simply show more of the same.
And it only gets worse for the Standard Model 
theorists. According to Big Bang Theory, the
earliest galaxies are the least evolved
galaxies. They have not had time to
evolve and grow by accreting further gas
and dust from the intergalactic medium
or through collisions, mergers, or 
the cannibalizing of smaller galaxies.
Overall, and putting aside the so-called
’lensed’ objects for a moment, the reddest
objects visible in the image should
generally exhibit the least amount of
smoothness and symmetric structure. Once 
again, that is not what we see in this image.
Instead, overall we repeatedly see
smoothness and symmetric structure in
the reddest objects, including especially
the curved, so-called ‘lensed’, galaxies. The
arrows in the image on the screen point
to a selection of the reddest objects in
this portion of the image that bear out that 
contention. This fact is evident across the whole
image. As for the red so-called ‘distant
lensed galaxies’ of the Einstein Cross type,
Halton Arp explains in an article on
his official website titled, “Origins of
Quasars and Galaxy Clusters”, that 
two higher-redshift galaxies are found
almost perfectly aligned across a lower- redshift galaxy
on either side of it. He wrote, “This of course is the
quintessential pattern of AGN’s ejected
from a larger galaxy (often interpreted
as gravitational lensing).” We see the red
so-called ‘lensed objects’ with so much
visible structure in them, because they are recently
born and close to their low redshift parent. The
universe that the Galileo of Palomar
observed has biological overtones.
We see families of galaxies and clusters in
a small part of a universe of unknown size.
Arp concluded that to prevent collapse
in a non-expanding universe, gravity must
be a repulsive force between celestial 
bodies. Collisions are in fact avoided.
I have explained elsewhere the electrical nature
of repulsive gravity between celestial bodies.
The infinities, beloved of mathematicians,
disappear when the distance between the
centers-of-mass of two bodies on a
collision course, approaches zero.
Nature must be explained by physics.
Mathematics might describes the result.
There are no collapsed-matter objects in
the universe. No white dwarfs. No neutron
stars, and definitely, no black holes. The 
phenomena can only be understood in
a balanced Electric Universe.
It is impossible to overstate the
significance of these facts. Facts that are plain for 
anyone to see on the face of the image. In short,
this one image, Webb's first deep
field, falsifies the Big Bang. And
given that the Webb Space Telescope
has a vastly improved spectroscopic
performance, we can expect the spectra
of high-redshift objects will not match
those expected from the story of heavy
element production by successive
generations of stars since a Big Bang.
So-called ‘lensed galaxies’ - that is
galaxies that do not appear as a result
of refraction through a denser neutrino
sea - are newborn high-redshift quasars.
They are the infants of nearby galaxies.
Their faintness would not allow us 
to see them, much less their internal
structure at cosmological distances.
Being nearby, they will show anomalous
super-luminal motion when viewed
conventionally, billions of light years away.

Today, physicist Eugene
Bagashov continues his analysis
of the scientific missions to the
asteroids Bennu and Ryugu respectively.
As Eugene explained in
the previous episode,
one of the hypotheses scientists have proposed
to explain a number of asteroid anomalies
is that many asteroids are
essentially "rubble piles."
In fact, when asteroids have
occasionally displayed dramatic
and completely unexpected
comet-like tails,
the explanation astronomers have offered
is that the so called rubble piles
simply began spinning faster and
faster, hurling material into space.
However, as Eugene explains as
he continues his discussion,
the latest scientific data offers little support
for the rubble-pile asteroid hypothesis.
Let us now talk about the other issue,
that is the spin of these asteroids.
Currently, Ryugu has a spin period of
7.63 hours and Bennu of 4.29 hours.
But here the interesting
stuff begins.
One thing that the researchers from
Hayabusa2 Mission keep referring to
is the hypothetical long-term trend
in slowing down of the spin of Ryugu.
In that way they are able to, more or less,
explain on the basis of the rubble pile model,
the surface slopes of the asteroid and also
the distribution of boulders on its surface.
And they attribute this hypothetical
spinning down to the so called
Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Razdievskii-Paddack
effect or YORP.
This effect basically implies that
the irregular form of the asteroid
leads to the imbalance in its thermal
emission in different directions,
which in turn causes the object to
experience some very small torque,
and on long timescales it might alter
the rotational period quite a bit,
introduce tilting of the spin axis,
wobbling and other things like that.
Well ok, perhaps,
but let us look at Bennu now.
Here we see not the hypothetical but actually
observed spinning up of the asteroid.
It has been derived from a series
of ground- based observations,
the earliest one being made in 1999,
and now confirmed by the OSIRIS-REx data.
Bennu is spinning
faster and faster,
losing about a second of
spin period each century.
That would mean that the doubling of the spin
rate would happen in only 1.5 million years
and the rubble-pile model used by
the researchers in OSIRIS-REx team
predicts that it would be incompatible
with the stability of the asteroid.
At this rate of spinning up,
it should have been torn apart by
centrifugal forces very long time ago.
Perhaps the reasonable conclusion
that should follow from that
is that the body should be much
younger than even ten million years
but the researchers are obviously
not happy with that conclusion,
so to somehow cope with this, they invoke
additional and not very plausible assumptions
such as some unexplained long-term cycles
of spinning up and spinning down etc.
But that's not even
the real problem.
The problem is that they're trying to
explain the observed spinning up of Bennu,
with the same YORP effect
that Hayabusa2 team
is using to explain the hypothetical
spinning down of asteroid Ryugu.
It starts to make really
little sense from that point.
Now, it is true that theoretically,
and I repeat ― theoretically,
YORP might indeed lead to both
spinning up and spinning down
and that would depend mostly on the
shape and orientation of the object,
but the thing is that Bennu and Ryugu
have almost exactly the same shape.
More than that, they have
almost the same orientation
Take a look at this
picture for example.
Here I've plotted the orbits of
inner solar system planets, that is;
Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.
On the next picture, I've added
Bennu's orbit in darker blue
and on the third picture,
I've also added Ryugu's orbit in red.
So if I now add here the
orientations of their spin axes,
you'd immediately
understand what I mean.
Numerically speaking, their spin
axes differ less than 8 degrees
so they're pointing almost
in the same spot in the sky.
Note also that they are both
spinning backwards, just like Venus,
here I've plotted all the
other planets' spin axes.
So from that I conclude that if YORP is
indeed acting upon both of these asteroids,
it should follow that it would have
the same effect on both of them
and therefore either Hayabusa2 or OSIRIS-REx
team is wrong in interpreting their data
or maybe even both of them,
but since we're already
looking at orbital diagrams,
which I personally enjoy doing,
let me note another thing that
might not be immediately evident.
Both these asteroids
essentially,
at some point of their orbits,
cross the orbit of Earth.
I have indicated these
crossings with purple circles.
In fact, both these asteroids might potentially
impact Earth in the next couple of centuries,
and I'm only mentioning this
to support my next statement
that in my opinion,
the orbits of these objects
might indicate that they actually originate
from this area of the solar system
and they're not some intruders
from the inner asteroid belt.
It would only seem logical that if they
both originated from the catastrophes
that involved, for example, planet
Earth and Mars, or maybe Venus too,
they wouldn't stray too far from the
area where this catastrophe occurred.
That would potentially explain
why both these asteroids
move roughly between
Earth and Mars,
even more so if one looks at the exact
arrangement of the orbit of Ryugu,
another fascinating
thing would surface,
that its perihelion is really
well aligned with Earth's,
if one discards the difference
in orbital inclination.
The coincidence is
quite incredible,
both Earth's and Ryugu's ecliptic
longitude of perihelion is 102 degrees.
Here I've shown the perihelia
positions with thin black lines.
Yes, potentially it is
possible to explain all of that
through some long-term
gravitational interactions,
tidal forces and resonances,
and things like that,
but remember that first we need
to somehow drag these objects here
from the inner asteroid belt
without them being destroyed
or thrown away into the outer system
by these gravitational interactions.
So maybe it would be reasonable
to assume that these alignments
are the result of these asteroids being
born from some catastrophic processes
involving the inner
planets in the first place,
maybe not even the Earth
but the Moon for example,
as I've noted that the spin
axes of Bennu and Ryugu
are almost exactly opposite
to the Lunar spin axis
depicted with grey
arrow in this picture.
There's only 4 to 5 degrees
difference between them.
OK, let's now return to the
issue of the spin rate change.
What are the options from the
standpoint of electrical excavation
of these bodies from
planetary crusts?
Of course, theoretically here
YORP effect might also play a role
so that explanation is possible,
but at the same time I wish to repeat
the points made in the previous video
following from that paper
with liquid droplets,
that perhaps these objects continue to
very slowly relax to a more spherical shape
after being squashed by electrical
forces during the time of their birth.
In this case, as more and more
matter moves closer to the spin axis,
the angular momentum conservation would dictate
that the body should spin faster and faster.
If that is true, theoretically if
we'd observe the objects long enough,
we would see the very slow
shrinking of their equatorial radii
in favor of higher
latitudes radii.
Unfortunately however, we haven't
been able to determine their shape
with good enough
precision previously.
The mean value of ground-based radar observations
gives a diameter of Bennu of 492 meters,
while OSIRIS-REx shows a
490 meters of diameter,
so one could say that indeed
the Equator is shrinking,
but the error bars of the
first measurement are so big
that they include the second
value as possible too.
And finally, at the moment
I wouldn't even discount
possible electromagnetic effects
of spinning up the asteroid,
especially if it's at
least slightly magnetized.
Its interaction with the solar wind
plasma might potentially induce a torque
that would spin it up or down
depending on the field configuration.
Now, let's discuss the surface
properties of these asteroids.
One thing that both Hayabusa2
and OSIRIS-REx teams indicate
is the noticeable
lack of small craters.
They assume that it is the consequence of
either the dynamic reshaping of the surface
or of the presence of regolith, that
is dust, that would quickly bury them.
The problem with that however,
is that both Ryugu and Bennu
demonstrate some craters even
in the equatorial region,
which suggests that
their equatorial bulges
appeared before subsequent
alteration of their surfaces
and the surface hasn't
completely relaxed ever since.
But researchers
themselves acknowledge,
especially in case of Ryugu with
its hypothetical spinning down,
that the equatorial bulges
should be really old
so why didn't they also reshape during all
these supposed hundreds of millions of years?
Large craters also did not relax to
the overall shape of their surroundings
and their depth to diameter
ratios of about 0.16
are consistent with other
asteroids such as Eros and Vesta
which have this parameter of about 0.15
but not in any way represent rubble piles.
That seems not really consistent
with a rubble pile hypothesis
and perhaps indicates a higher internal
strength of the underlying material
than what is assumed
by the researchers.
Conversely, in the electrical
scenario, some of the craters
might have appeared due to
plasma discharges on the surface
as it was rebalancing its electric potential
after the initial catastrophic event
that has led to the
formation of the body.
So perhaps the deficit of small
craters might be explained
if one assumes that the strength
of the surface is underestimated
so that only really energetic
processes would leave craters.
And it doesn't really matter if we're
talking about discharges or impacts here.
It's quite peculiar that asteroid
Ryugu has twice more large boulders
than asteroid Itokawa per unit of
area, but the same number of craters,
and in the case of Bennu, the
researchers themselves admit
that these boulders
and their complexity
"...imply energetic events that
far exceed what Bennu can support."
The researchers actually sometimes start
contradicting themselves and state that,
"Evidence for structural strength
includes Bennuis nonhydrostatic shape,
the high-standing longitudinal ridges, the long
linear grooves, and apparent mass wasting.
A fluid-like
hydrostatic shape ...
with Bennu's density and
rotation rate is not stable."
So how then is, this supposedly
rubble-pile object exists?
Maybe it's not a
rubble pile after all?
With regards to the
regolith, I should note that
it seems that there is much less
of it than what was assumed.
For example, MASCOT lander has found no regolith
where it landed on the surface of Ryugu
and the same seems true for the
photos from other two landers.
It's definitely very rocky out
there but also not very dusty.
In fact, OSIRIS-REx team has been
complaining in some of the papers
that the abundance of rock and the
deficit of pristine flat dusty areas
might compromise the success of
the mission, since initially they,
"...hypothesized that, over time, gravel
migration had built up the equatorial ridge
that was apparent in
the radar shape model.
Even though the equatorial
region is the geopotential low,
it is in fact dominated by
large concentrations of boulders
with little apparent
fine-grained regolith.
Bennu does not contain the extensive
patches of fine-grained regolith
according to which we
designed the mission."
Other fascinating find is a relatively
low values of thermal inertia,
on average 350 for Bennu
and 200 to 500 for Ryugu,
where the units are joules,
divided by meters squared,
divided by Kelvin, divided
by square root of a second.
Compare that to some other
similar objects' thermal inertia,
for example asteroid
Itokawa has 750
and the lowest thermal inertia
documented in a meteorite is 770
in the meteorite Cold Bokkeveld.
Basically, thermal inertia is a measure of how
hard it is to heat up or cool down a body,
so in my opinion, low values of thermal
inertia of asteroids Bennu and Ryugu
would imply a relatively
good heat conduction
and therefore a relatively strong internal
structure, at least in the near surface layer
that would allow the heat to be quickly
transferred to and from the asteroids.
Now, this is not a definite
evidence for that per se,
as the properties of boulders and even small
amounts of dust covering the surface
would also play a huge role in the
measured value of thermal inertia,
but coupled to some other
hints that I've mentioned,
in my opinion it provides a
more or less coherent picture.
Speaking of boulders,
Hayabusa2 team
acknowledges that they seem
to be internally strong.
I quote, "The shallower slope
in the small size range suggests
a non-negligible mechanical strength of
individual boulders/pebbles on Ryugu."
And also I quote,
"...the boulders on Ryugu have survived impact
processes during catastrophic disruption,
the re-accumulation process and
more recent impacts on Ryugu;
they are not dust balls
with little cohesion."
So if these boulders are supposed to
represent some primordial material
and they demonstrate
significant internal strength,
why is the rest of these asteroids
considered to be so weak?
Maybe they aren't after all.
We'll examine some more evidence
for that in the next video
and also talk about the recent finding
of dust grains in space around Bennu.

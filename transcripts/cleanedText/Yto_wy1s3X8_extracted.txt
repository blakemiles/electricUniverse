Mars in Ancient
Myths and Religion
All right, so we've got the
planet Mars up on the screen
and I think most of
us here know that
the modern name for Mars comes
from the latin, God of War
and so let's take a
peek at him real quick.
Mars was known as a
furious warrior,
as a God who brings pestilence,
as a wolf God,
and as a god of the spring.
So those are probably four
of his primary attributes.
And the leading scholar of Roman
religion is a guy named Georges Dumezil
and his masterwork is called
Archaic Roman Religion
and it's his ideas that kind
of dominate the modern field.
And so, he believes that
Latin religion is based upon
three different structures of society
in early Indo-Eropean culture
and that Mars represents
the warrior class.
So Mars is the God who presides over
the exercise of physical prowess.
He's the god of
warriors and soldiers.
Mircea Eliade, who we've
cited many times,
congratulates Dumezil's showing that only
by deciphering the basic ideological system
underlying the social and
religious institutions
can a particular divine figure, myth
or ritual be correctly understood.
And another leading scholar
calls Dumezil's achievement
among the (most) foremost scholarly
achievements of our time.
And so, Dumezil is without
question a world-class scholar.
The guy was a master of
dozens of languages,
produced countless
books and manuscripts.
He is indeed an imposing figure.
But here is his
ultimate conclusion
that the Latin God Mars
represents the warrior class,
strictly a social metaphor,
and that Mars does not have
a naturalistic aspect.
His area of influence, the place of
his signs is not the atmosphere.
Another leading modern scholar,
after acknowledging that
Dumezil is the top expert,
asks the question
whether a pattern uniting the apparently
incoherent details of Mars's cult
can be discovered.
For a possible guide
to this question
we would turn to leads from
Babylonian astronomical traditions
which obviously predate
Rome by a while.
And so if you look at how Mars is
represented in ancient Babylonian texts;
he's described as a
furious warrior,
as a bringer of pestilence,
and as a wolf star.
Now, that's kind
of a coincidence.
So in one of these
astronomical texts that says,
"Mars is said to bring pestilence or
deaths in an astrological report...
Mars is said to have
caused a fever..."
But this is exactly the way the
Latin God Mars is described
in the very earliest Latin
passages that we have.
So they said, "Mars confers
blessings but is prone to anger.
He sends harvest failures
and cattle plagues."
A very famous Latin ritual
was called the Arvale Carmen
and their Mars is invoked as a wild
and potentially destructive power
who can afflict
crops with disease.
So there's almost a
one-to-one correspondence
between the way the Latin God Mars is
described as an agent of pestilence
and the way the
Babylonian planet is.
So now if we turn to the
Mesopotamian cult of the god Nergal,
who was widely acknowledged
to be the planet Mars,
we find him described
as a raging warrior,
as an agent of pestilence.
He's a raging storm God and
a ruler of the underworld.
So one ancient text
from about 2000 BC
says, "Warrior! Raging storm-tide,
who flattens lands in upheaval.
Warrior! Lord of
the underworld."
He's consistently described
as a furiously raging storm
but a constant adjective is at
the bottom he's called 'hus'
which means the fiery
red, furious or rage.
So we're gonna see this
motif again and again
and in descriptions of these
ancient warriors or warrior gods
they're always going
to be a fiery red
and they're going to be
described as raging.
But of course, the Mesopotamian scholars
have no idea where Nergal comes from either.
He's just a complete mystery.
So this is arguably the top guy
in Sumerian studies and he says,
"To take an absolutely fundamental
question, who or what is Nergal?"
Well, this is an early
description of Nergal.
The vanguard whose
strength is sublime...
whose divine splendor
is sublime in heaven.
Star ever shining.
Sublime of features.
It sounds like they're
describing a star, maybe.
So at the bottom it says,
Nergal warrior of the gods... Who takes
his place in the height of heaven...
Whose features ever
glow in heaven.
I mean, anybody that can read can understand
that they're describing something in heaven.
Whether it's the planet Mars, as
the scribes themselves maintained,
remains open to
question I suppose.
But there can't be any question that
they're describing a celestial power.
So back to Dumezil again.
Here's the way he describes the
warrior god Mars in Latin cult.
"The ambiguous character of Mars, when
he breaks loose on the field of battle,
accounts for the epithet caecus,
blind, given to him by the poets.
At a certain stage of furor he
abandons himself to his nature,
destroying friend
as well as foe."
So this indiscriminate
slaughter associated with Mars
is going to be a recurring theme
and it's found around the world.
So in Arab texts
it just so happens that the planet
Mars was described as the blind one.
And so it says, "They give to Mars the name
Mara-Samya, which means the blind lord,
and they call him blind because
of (its) his extreme violence
and because in his rage he
strikes without regard."
So here you have almost the exact same
description as we found in the Latin God Mars.
This is a recent book talking about
literature and it just says,
"The battle fury of warriors...
is traditionally the quintessential
subject matter of heroic verse.
The wrath or furor (of warrior) of heroic
warriors is, as Milton acknowledges,
the salient theme of both
the Iliad and the Aeneid.
So to take Achilles for example.
This is the top, one of the top scholars
of Greek myth is a guy named Gregory Nagy.
So here's the way he
describes Achilles.
"Achilles himself, in his
climatic moments of rage,
and Bill Mullen will confirm, the
first word in the Iliad is rage,
by the way, describing Achilles.
But it says Achilles himself, in
his climactic moments of rage,
is described as equal to Ares.
Ares is the God of War
but he is also more specifically
the God of martial fury.
In war, a warrior who is
possessed by the God Ares
experiences this kind of martial
fury which is typically bestial.
The Greek word for this martial fury
is lussa, meaning 'wolfish rage'
and of course we know Ares was represented
as a wolf just like the Latin God was.
To experience such a martial
rage is to be beside oneself,
and to be beside oneself is to be
possessed - possessed by Ares."
So there's a recent book
on Germanic warrior types.
It's just a fascinating book
and it discusses these early warrior
societies where young men would,
would drive themselves to ecstatic
prowess and they'd just head off
looking for the nearest war.
And it says, "Warrior styles have much to
offer to our understanding of history.
They tell us how long ago,
when war was still welcome,
fighting men reached the state of ecstasy
that led them to do astounding things.
They lead us into the heart of Vedic, Indian,
Homeric, Celtic and Germanic civilizations,
where fighting prowess was
still the measure of a man."
And again, this is obviously that tradition
went on for many thousands of years.
Here's how Macrobius describes
the Latin God Mars,
"And to the glowing heat by which
the spirit is kindled and roused,
sometimes to anger, sometimes to deeds
of valor, to a temporary madness...
to this property men have
given the name Mars."
Pretty much the exact same description that
George Dumezil gave to the blind warrior.
As those of you will know
who have read my books,
it just turns out that
cultures all around the world
said that they imitated the planet
Mars when they went into battle.
They were trying to incorporate his
rage or to emulate his rage or fury
when they took to
the battlefield.
So this is a quote from the leading ritual
of the Pawnee Indians in North America.
So it says, "This is the way I do when
I am imitating him, the planet Mars,
when I become angry, when
I am imitating him."
Move to South America,
"At times of battle, the planet Mars had to
endow the Toba warriors with fighting spirit."
As a Polynesian god of war
who is known as Maru,
flaming with wrath
and full of anger.
Australian Aborigines,
"The planet Mars is
Bilyara, the eagle...
he was warlike, and much
given to fighting."
Early Indian astronomical texts
as in Asian India,
"Mars has blood-red eyes, is
fickle-minded and given to anger."
Now when you go out tonight and
look at the clear Phoenix skies,
look at the planet Mars and see
if you see an angry planet.
The nature of Mars...
This is Roger Bacon
from the Middle Ages.
"The nature of Mars is fiery... to
excite men to anger, discord, and wars."
And this is the leading scholar on
ancient astrological ideas, Franz Cumont
and in this he points out that
these ideas are basic to language.
"There can perhaps be no more striking proof of
the power and popularity of astrological beliefs
than the influence which they have
exercised over popular language.
All modern idioms
preserve traces of it,
which we can no longer discern
except with difficulty,
survivals of vanished
superstitions.
Do we still remember when we
speak of a martial character,
that it must have been
formed by the planet Mars?
That one of these 'astra', stars, which,
if hostile will cause me a disaster?"
So he's admitting that
the word disaster has,
has a direct relation to stars.
Turning to leading Irish hero.
He's a fascinating character
because he offers just a crystal
clear image of this raging warrior.
And so it says,
so when this guy went into battle he became
distorted with anger and battle fury.
He grew gigantic in size
and, like Mars, he fought indiscriminately,
killing friends and foes,
right and left.
Now the interesting thing about
that Irish hero is he was blind
and all of us will remember the
classic example of the blind warrior
is the biblical Samson.
And how was he described?
Well, he was characterized
by a hot anger.
The red-hot anger.
So Judges describes his
anger being kindled.
Interestingly enough, Samson has been
identified with the planet Mars.
The ancient Celtic
term for Cuchulainn
raging hot anger is
'f' 'e' 'r' 'g' Ferg
and in my opinion that's a cognate word
with the furor belli of the Latin God Mars.
Back to the Irish God again.
It says, when he was undergoing his
furor, he became crimson all over,
shook violently and
assumed a swollen form.
The top Irish scholar of
ancient warriors said that
the key to figuring
out these figures
is that all words for 'hero' expressed
the notions of furor, ardour,
tumescence, which means
swelling, and speed.
The hero, the warrior hero,
is the furious one, possessed of his
own tumultuous and blazing energy.
If you turn back, now again to the cult
of the Mesopotamian star God Nergal
clearly described
as the planet Mars,
one of his epithets describes
him as the sweller
but the word sweller also
means anger and fury.
So you get this image of this giant
planet-god, red, clearly red,
that takes on a massive form when he's
angry and starts causing disasters.
So very early on, this is an
image that Dave and I drew up
or actually simulated it with a computer
with life-size planetary models.
So the polar configuration
is over on the left.
The yellow body is Saturn and the green
body is Venus and the red body is Mars,
just for the sake
of illustration.
And what this shows is that
with just the slightest displacement of Mars
towards the Earth, it grows massive in size.
And so the Polynesian
name for the planet Mars,
interestingly enough, is
'the quick swelling one.'
Again, if you look at
Mars in the sky today,
see if that idea would
ever occur to you
that Mars is a quick
swelling planet or warrior.
So we all know that
the Greek Hercules
was identified with the planet
Mars by the Greeks themselves.
Less known is the fact that Hercules was
identified with the Mesopotamian God Nergal.
Very well-known is the fact that Heracles
served as a young male's role model
as a warrior and as an athlete.
And so again, archaic warriors
everywhere re-enacted in masked dances
the deeds of the
gods and ancestors.
They did so to gain the divine
ecstasy of 'the beginning of time,'
the time of creation.
In battle, when it mattered most
to live in these mythical times,
warriors bodied forth gods and
ancestors by fighting in their style.
They wanted to emulate the gods.
So, according to
this text it says,
the Batavii going to
battle sang of Hercules.
The Spartans did the same thing
when they went into battle
and of course Spartans
were known as being among
the greatest warriors
of the ancient world.
They invoked Hercules, they
wanted to be like Heracles.
It's very well known among Greek scholars
that the Greek Heracles was identified with
the great god of ancient
Tyre, a Phoenician cult
and Melqart in turn was identified with the
Mesopotamian God Nergal of the planet Mars.
So the characteristic rite
described in the Old Testament
about this Phoenician
God Melqart
is that every year he was burnt
to death on a great funeral pyre.
So how did Heracles
meet his end?
He was burnt to death
on a funeral pyre.
And so, Sophocles describes this at
great length in one of his plays.
(But back) so it says,
"At the precise moment
of agonizing death,
a flaming thunderbolt from his
father Zeus strikes Heracles.
He goes up in flames, in a
spectacular explosion of fire."
As he mounted the pyre, we are told in
this tragedy I was just talking about,
came a terrible
outburst of anger.
The bodily pains which he felt, united
with that disease of the heroes,
their fits of rage, which is
never very far from madness."
Interestingly enough, Australian Aboriginal
tradition relates of the planet Mars
that he died in a fire,
that he died on a funeral pyre and
changed into the planet Mars.
It is said that he was burnt to death on a
mountain where he had kindled the fire.
Back to... this is an early Greek vase showing
at the bottom Heracles, his funeral pyre.
At the top he is
flying off to heaven
where he's going to
receive his apotheosis.
And so the top scholar of these
ancient vases, James Boardman says,
"On two of the three Attic vases with the
pyre, Heracles is shown as a young man."
So he's been burnt to death
but now he's rejuvenated.
So it says, "The young Heracles has clearly
been rejuvenated by his experience,"
being burnt.
So this, the early writer Nonnos specifically
describes Heracles as the Phoenix
in a comparison with the Phoenix bird
for regaining his youth in fire.
Turning back to the Latin cult,
one of the most exciting discoveries
of the last hundred years,
was that they found these Etruscan
vases depicting the Latin God Mars
as getting a fiery bath here
at the hands of Minerva.
And again Dumezil and the other guys
discuss all this stuff and they all,
they discuss these
vases and they say,
well it's clear the little
guy is being rejuvenated
but we really don't have an explanation
for why that might be the case.
He's being rejuvenated
by means of fire.
So the first meaning says this means that
Mars is intended to be reborn from death
and a clear description says
he lived to be a 123 years old and he
died two or three times and came back.
So he's a resurrected
God, the Latin God Mars.
The Mesopotamian God was
resurrected as well.
Josephus, the writer on
early Jewish stories,
keeps using the word Egersis
in connection with Heracles
but that word also used, is specifically
used to describe resurrection,
the resurrection.
In ancient Iranian myth there was a
really curious little figure named Batraz
and like Heracles he is burnt
on a giant funeral pyre.
He's again a, one of
these raging warriors
that kills anyone
indiscriminately right and left.
He's the greatest warrior
of the Iranian warriors.
And so it says, this guy will
henceforth live in the sky
from which he will descend in
a blast, in a burst, sorry,
incandescent as at his birth, whenever
some danger or scandal threatens his kin.
And interestingly enough, he descends
from heaven as a furious red ball
periodically descending
to Earth like lightning.
So again, this is an image you're gonna see
again and again that this fiery red star
is going to grow massive, descend
from heaven as a raging form
but in a lightning-like
shape or as a meteor.
So turning back to the
Mesopotamian cult,
the planet Mars is specifically
described as fire falling from the sky.
This Semitic term 'miqit isatu'.
But that same word also means lightning
and it also means the fall of a meteor.
Pliny the Elder said that
these thunderbolts come
from the planet Saturn
and much as the inflammatory
ones come from the planet Mars.
So the planet Mars was clearly associated
with lightning and/or thunderbolts.
Again, the image from yesterday we showed
with Mars descending slightly from Venus,
on the left, and then the one from
today showing it as a massive form...
I think it's easy to see that
if something like this actually
transpired in the skies overhead,
you might think of a massive red ball
or meteor descending from heaven,
causing disaster.
So, earlier we talked about
the Pawnee traditions.
Where they emulated
the fiery warrior,
they clearly called him the planet
Mars as they went into battle.
And yet they claimed that that this guy,
the Pawnee Mars, came from a meteor.
The Latin God Mars.
It was said that on the
first day of the year,
that his shield
fell from heaven.
So at the base of
the screen it says,
"Worship of meteorites was easily
extended to ancient monoliths...
Mars' ancile," the shield, "is
the best known instance."
Back to the Iranian figure that
was burnt to death on the pyre.
He was, an interesting
story told about him
was that he was described
as an abscess.
And so you see this
a lot in the text
that the Martian warrior is described
as a pus-filled little guy, as an ulcer
but often as an abscess.
Interestingly that Semitic word describing
Mars as fire and lightning and meteor,
it also means abscess.
The Mesopotamian God Nergal himself
was known as the pimply one.
But the same word also means
lightning or ecstatic.
Well, this is a current
picture of the planet Mars.
I think it's easy to see
that if this object appeared in
the northern circumpolar heavens,
that you might easily say that that
looks like a pimply formed god.
We noted that the last
characteristic of the Latin God was
that he was the god
of the spring.
Now, that doesn't quite jibe
with the others at first sight.
And yet, Australian
Aboriginal tradition
also remembers the planet Mars
as the god of the spring.
So this little guy was the head
honcho of their warrior societies.
They painted themselves red
as they headed into war
but they said the red star was
seen to be responsible for spring
and he personified sexual
activity and fertility.
Interestingly enough, a very similar
tradition is found in an early Chinese text
where the red star
is associated with the
arrival of spring,
the beginning of the year, the exact
same thing as the Latin God Mars
is associated with the
beginning of the year.
And it's in the
beginning of spring.
So this is my conclusion.
The sacred traditions attached
to the Latin God Mars,
far from reflecting the different class
structures of archaic Indo-European culture,
encode the remembered
history of the planet Mars,
albeit much humanized
and historicized.
A radical rewriting of
history is in order.
We've only just begun.
And I think, if you think about these images
and think about Mars moving close to Earth,
look at the physical
structure of Mars now.
What would you expect?
I mean, Mars looks like a destroyed
planet, a scarred planet.
If it engaged in these catastrophes
well within the memory of man,
would you expect to see
something like that?
Would that help explain why Mars
doesn't have an atmosphere?
Like most other planets.
Why Mars' oceans of water have
apparently been ripped off?
Why rocks from Mars have
been ripped off the planet
and deposited on
the planet Earth?
If Mars participated
in these disasters,
like Dave and I have been talking
about for 30-some years,
what would that tell you about the
likelihood of current life on Mars?
I mean, it'd be pretty tough to imagine
anything other than single celled animals
or primitive, you know, primitive
organisms living up there now.
Certainly, these folks talking about
the pyramids being up on Mars
and Martians invading
us every now and then,
they're pretty unlikely to
be right, I would suggest.
Thank you very much,
I appreciate it.

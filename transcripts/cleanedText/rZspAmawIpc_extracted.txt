Welcome to Space News from
the Electric Universe,

The term "crisis in
cosmology" has been used
so routinely over the
last couple of decades,
I have to wonder if
its significance is
beginning to dull in the
public consciousness.
When science journalists
use the term, they're
generally describing the countless
scientific discoveries that contradict
or undermine 
Big Bang cosmology.
Of course, for decades now, numerous
scientific studies have shown an
apparent discordancy between the
so-called expansion rate in the
"early universe" after the
hypothetical Big Bang,
and the expansion rate
in the "later universe."
Well, just in the last
couple of weeks, the Keck
Observatory issued a press release
reporting the most reliable verification
to date that the discordancy is real,
and the rate of acceleration of the
universe's expansion is too great for
standard cosmology to explain.
But of course, the crisis
in cosmology goes much
deeper than problems with
the expanding universe.
It seems that just about every
week we hear about the existence of
objects, from stars to galaxies to
quasars to super clusters, as well as a
host of celestial phenomena that
"can't exist in the Big Bang universe."
And even more fundamentally,
they shouldn't exist in a
universe where gravity, and
gravity alone, dominates.
If you've followed this series,
you've seen reports on these
discoveries ad nauseam, and we'll be
exploring several of these specific
discoveries as we continue
in this new discussion.
So today, we're going to be
discussing all of this and more with the
chief science advisor to The
Thunderbolts Project, Wal Thornhill.
I can tell you at the outset that this is
going to be at least a two part or even
a three part presentation,
because for several
months now, there have been too many
blockbuster discoveries, for us to
adequately cover, 
which are incredibly
important for the Electric
Universe and Plasma Cosmology.
But before we begin addressing
these items one by one, I'd
like us to begin with a discussion on
the very foundations of Big Bang
cosmology, to clarify some essential
distinctions between scientific fact and
scientific theory, what is
known versus what is believed.
For instance, New Scientist
recently published the
collection "seventeen more things you
need to understand" in which it outlines
what it describes as "six
principles of physics" and again, the
reader might assume that
each of these principles
is an established fact
or a "law of physics."
Wal, you introduced me
to this New Scientist
piece, so why don't you begin by
explaining what you think it reveals
about the current state of cosmology
and the culture of science.
Yeah, that New Scientist
special starts off with the
first chapters on mathematics,
instead of physics.
You would think that if you're
talking about cosmology, the
first thing you need to talk about is
the model, the cosmological model, the
physical model, before
you start talking about
the mathematics that
you're going to apply.
They got sort of backwards, you
know, the cart before the horse.
And then, the very second one
talks about the Big Bang.
The very nature of the Big Bang should
sound alarm bells because, what we
observe in the universe
is pretty much a balance.
The solar system works like
clockwork, there's no gravitational
explanation for the beauty of spiral
galaxies and yet they seem to be a
standard form of galaxies...
So just the very nature
of the observations suggests
that using an explosion, something
equivalent to an explosion, a Big Bang in
the beginning, is something
desperately wrong, and as one philosopher
wrote and I read just recently, he said
that only an idiot would design a
universe with an unbalanced force, and
gravity is an unbalanced force, it's only
ever attractive, it's
never repulsive according to our
experience on Earth, but then we
extrapolate our experience on Earth out
into the deep space, 
and it doesn't work.
It only works within 
the solar system.
But even then, when you go back to Newton,
Newton also considered that gravity was
a balanced force, he looked at
it as a repulsive force as well.
And it does work, but nobody could figure
out just how that might be physically.
And so, that's been 
ignored ever since.
It wasn't until Halton Arp came
along and showed that his
balanced universe absolutely needed a
balanced force, gravity must be a
repulsive force on 
the cosmic scale.
And that was one of the key issues that the
Electric Universe had to deal with, because
how can we explain gravity as a balanced
force, and as soon as you do that, all of
the requirements for a big bang go away,
you don't need anything to separate
matter in the beginning, because the
result of that separation is either
that all falls back together again,
or it all continues to expand forever.
It's almost impossible
to have it just expand
to a certain point
and then sit there.
So this was, you know, a
major problem with the
Big Bang Theory right
from the very beginning.
The other thing is that, all
of the lack of real physics
in describing of how the
Big Bang originated.
For instance, if you look at Wiki,
that infamous source of information,
it was created from a
singularity which was described
as a very hot, small and
dense, super force.
In other words, the mix
of four fundamental
forces with no stars,
atoms, form or structure.
This is physically meaningless.
Singularity is, by the very
definition, involve the concept
of infinity, which 
isn't a number.
So you can't add, subtract,
multiply, or divide
by infinity and come
up with a number other
than zero, and that only as an
approximation in the case of division.
Singularities in a model are clear
evidence that the model has failed.
So right at the very fundamental level
we're not doing physics, and then again
we look at Wiki's explanation: to be hot
requires energetic particles, that's how
we measure heat, it's a measure of
the kinetic energy of particles.
That means that the singularity had to
have the matter there already in this
infinitely small point in space, right?
This schoolboy howler results from energy
being undefined in modern physics.
There is no such thing as pure energy, it's
always in relation to matter.
It's a gaping hole dug by Einstein and
his relativity theory, where any
arbitrarily moving observer can be
considered at rest at the center of the
universe, in other words you've all got
your own, you're all at the center of your
own universe and that's
obvious nonsense, because
movement of any of these
observers is a form of energy.
So Einstein removed the absolute
reference frame of the
fixed stars, that is the rest of the
universe, which was required by all the
great physicists of the preceding
centuries, including Newton.
And then they talk about
this singularity being
small, but that's meaningless,
compared to what?
It's a concept you can get by
dividing any number by infinity.
Then it goes on, it assumes there
are four fundamental forces.
Well, this is a product of
not understanding the physics
in the first place.
The Electric Universe, on the other hand,
needs only one, the electric force, and
then magnetism and gravity and the
nuclear forces are all described in
terms of the response of orbiting matter
to an external electric force, or in the
case of an atom, the
internal electric force
if the nucleus is
offset from the center.
And then, the last thing that it
talks about is this force being dense.
Now, any force requires the presence of
matter before the Big Bang, so once again,
we've got matter having to be there before
the Big Bang, and how can a force be dense?
Matter can be dense, a force
only has meaning in the presence of
matter, which again isn't
there before creation.
If it were, the singularity
would be a black hole, one of those
imaginary black holes from which matter
can't escape, so that it could never bang.
And if you look at the Electric
Universe over the past decade or so, and
Steve Crothers' analysis
of the mathematics,
the mathematics
doesn't work either.
It uses a pseudo tensor which in Steve's
words is just a meaningless jumble of
symbols, it has no 
physical significance.
The Big Bang is sheer nonsense, it has
nothing to do with real science.
What started the worship
of an expanding universe?
In 1929, Edwin Hubble discovered
that for fairly local galaxies in his
field of view, the fainter they are, the
higher their redshift--assumed to be due
to the Doppler effect, in other words, the
change in frequency of a signal, as it
recedes from you, drops in frequency,
and that's a redshift in light.
Anyway, Hubble himself remained
unconvinced that the
Doppler effect correctly
explained his observations.
He felt that the science
underpinning this physical model
was lacking, there's
something else involved.
It was left up to Halton Arp, who
worked at one point with Hubble, to
discover intrinsic redshift which means
that the objects themselves have a
different energy, a lower energy which
means that both the particles within
each atom, the protons and the electrons,
have a different mass, slightly lower, and
that difference in mass means that the
frequency of light that they emit will
be shifted towards the
red end of the spectrum.
It's as simple as that.
We just assume, we make
measurements of the
mass of the proton, the
mass of the electron
in laboratories on Earth and then put
it in a physics standards manual and
everyone assumes it's the same
throughout the universe.
It's merely an assumption,
and in the case of the
redshift, the very fact that Halton Arp
was able to find that it was quantized,
in other words this is a subatomic
effect, this is a quantum effect, and we
observe it in galactic scale objects;
means that the whole underpinning of
particle physics, as well, is
based on nonsensical ideas.
This idea that the quantum
theory only applies to the atomic and
subatomic scale is incorrect, so trying to
find the answers to everything through
particle physics and cosmology fails on
that very foundation.
The New Scientist article
which is supposed to be
giving us answers to the
17 big questions, when
it comes to cosmology, it talks
about the principles of physics.
Now, one of the principles
of physics that is
crucial is, that you cannot
create or annihilate
matter because that
constitutes a miracle.
We have no idea how matter is
constructed or how you would go about
constructing it, what the constituent
parts are, and what happens if you have
discombobulate, you know, a proton or
electron, what would these particles be
and where would they go,
how would we detect them?
None of this is answered.
When we come to what the New Scientist
puts forward as the six principles of
physics, none of them have anything
to do with this basic problem.
The first one says, "the speed
of light is a constant."
Who says so?
When we measure the speed of light,
it's always in a medium and to say,
as Einstein did, that there is no ether in
the vacuum of space, is sheer nonsense.
You cannot transmit an electromagnetic
signal through nothing, it has to be a
polarizable medium, and we measure the
polarizable medium and give it capacity,
you know, dielectric properties
which is what's needed.
So there is an ether, the speed of light
we know, depends on the density of the
ether that it's traveling through,
what its speed would be.
The speed of light is not
a constant, and this
was made crystal clear
when Rupert Sheldrake
spoke to us at one of our conferences, a
few years ago, and he pointed out that
it's acknowledged that when they
measured the speed of light, it varied.
So what's been done, they now define the
meter, the measurement of distance, in
terms of the speed of light and made
it a constant, they've fixed it.
This is unscientific and, in fact,
can lead to serious problems.
The second item is the
equivalence principle, the
equivalence between the
sensation of gravity and
the sensation of being
accelerated in a lift.
They are not equivalent.
Gravity is, despite the
formula which talks about a center of
gravity, is an effective force
between all matter in the universe.
So in the case of the
Earth, that's distributed
throughout the
volume of the Earth.
So the force on a person accelerating away
from the Earth will change, it will be
different to what you would experience
in an elevator, they are not equivalent.
The cosmological principle is just
another assumption based on observation
and it may or may not be true.
When you look at Halton Arp's different
perspective on the universe, we are only
a small part of the universe that is of
unknown age and unknown extent, so all we
can say is that in our local visible
universe, part of the universe, the
cosmological principle appears to hold,
but there is a lot of structure,
the structure is unexpected that is,
the filamentary structure of the
universe is not expected in the
gravitational model, unless you add dark
matter and all sorts of
other magical fairy dust.
But in the electrical model
that is absolutely necessary because of
the formation of stars
and galaxies along
cosmological Birkeland
current filaments.
So the filamentary nature is
actually prima facie evidence that the
Electrical Universe 
model is correct.
Quantization is the next one, number four,
and of course, quantum theory, as Richard
Feynman famously said, nobody understands
it, and that is correct.
Nobody understands it because there is
no physical model underpinning it.
The Electric Universe deals
with that in terms of
resonant behavior of structured
subatomic particles.
The Electric Universe merely
repeats the pattern of
the atom, because they're closest together
in scale, as an orbital system, and repeats
that for the electron and the proton and
says that they're orbital systems as well,
and therefore they will exchange
energy in discrete resonant ways.
You can only exchange energy
between stable orbits.
The other thing is that the foundational
work for these stable orbits comes from
Wilhelm Weber, 150 years
ago, so the foundations
of the Electric
Universe are that old.
It's just that no one was
paying attention at the time, "his
work was in German;" although Faraday and
Maxwell knew about it, they preferred
their field theories to ones which
involved real particles and an
instantaneous electric force.
But of course, this
is a real physical
model, this is one that
relies on physics.
Quantum theory of Niels Bohr is a
statistical theory, in other words,
anything is possible.
"Lies, damned lies, and statistics," you
can dream of anything you like, and this
is where the uncertainty principle comes
from; because it's a statistical model,
you can be uncertain about where a
particle is and what it's doing.
In the electrical model, there are real
particles in real space in real time, the
whole thing remains coherent, simply
because we're dealing with real time.
None of this relativity nonsense of
malleable clocks and distances.
The wave-particle duality
comes about also
from this problem of not
understanding matter
interactions at this structured
subatomic level, because there is no such
thing as a photon, you cannot have a
particle with no mass which is what the
photon is defined as being,
traveling at the speed of light.
Now, light is a wave phenomenon,
but the particles involved in
that wave are communicating with one
another instantaneously, so all of these
strange so-called nonlocality and spooky
quantum effects are just the order of
the day in the electrical model of
Wilhelm Weber and particle interactions.
He also showed that
there are stable orbits
in those electrodynamic
interactions.
It has nothing to do with
electrostatics, it's electrodynamic.
Not one of these six items is a
fundamental principle of physics.
So you start from that basis,
you've got nowhere to go
really, they're just stories that have
been made up to try and make it appear
as though we have a
cosmology at present.
Modern cosmology is not science, it's
merely a story and it gets more and more
complicated as time goes on.
Stay tuned for part 2

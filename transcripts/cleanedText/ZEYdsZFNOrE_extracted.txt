Science headlines today show signs that
elements of the Electric Universe paradigm
are becoming
increasingly mainstream.
With leaps in technology and data
have come the definitive refutation
of the notion of an
electrically sterile universe.
But the basic premise of a cosmos
dominated by the gravitational force
remains the backbone
of standard cosmology.
In this episode, Bishop
Nicholas Sykes forecasts
the perhaps inevitable paradigm shift
towards Electric Universe concepts.
This series of videos has claimed that the
existing paradigm of physical science,
accepted and taught in the halls of
academia as barely challengable,
has actually become
unfit for purpose.
If, as we have claimed, the Sun and other
stars are actually powered electrically
from outside their own cores
rather than being powered by
nuclear fusion within their cores,
this would be a significant instance of
the failure of the existing paradigm.
Electric Universe proponents
will not think it strange
when the time comes for the
whole line of dominoes,
representing the presently accepted
structure of supposedly hard physics
together with those other sciences
dependent upon it, to come crashing down.
To be sure, such a state of affairs
is not altogether new in the world.
In the epilogue to his last
book, "The Discarded Image,"
professor CS Lewis writes about
the medieval model of science
and its succession by the currently
accepted model, in this way:
"The old astronomy was not, in any exact
sense, 'refuted' by the telescope.
The scarred surface of the Moon
and the satellites of Jupiter
can, if one wants, be fitted
into a geocentric scheme.
The old scheme... had been tinkered a
good deal to keep up with observations.
How far, by endless tinkerings,
it could have kept up with them
until even now, I do not know.
But the human mind will not endure
such ever-increasing complications
if once it has seen that some simpler
conception can 'save the appearances'.
Neither theological prejudice
nor vested interests
can permanently keep in favor a Model
which is seen to be grossly uneconomical.
The new astronomy triumphed not because
the case for the old became desperate,
but because the new was a better
tool; once this was grasped,
our ingrained conviction that Nature
herself is thrifty did the rest.
When our Model is in
its turn abandoned,
this conviction will no
doubt be at work again."
Electric Universe researchers contend
that the EU [Electric Universe] paradigm
is far more economical than
the currently accepted model,
which has been endlessly tinkered
with to keep up with observations,
but would also, in my view, judge that
the entire case for the Standard Model
has reached the point
of desperation.
Let us now return to the
issue of relativity.
Some justifiable excitement appeared in
the media over some experimental results
that gave the possibility of showing that
neutrinos could travel faster than light.
Yet the whole of the theory of
relativity is dependent upon light
or rather electromagnetic radiation,
in which light is a part,
being the fastest
possible messenger.
Moreover, the theory of relativity
has by now become a core principle
that informs the working
of the Standard Model.
If relativity falls, then much of what we
thought we learned in the last century
about the physics of the
universe we know no longer.
Inevitably the question arises:
"Is relativity like some banks in
some countries too big to fail?
With what shall it be bailed out so
that academics and their supporters
can again live with some
semblance of normality?
Of course, this is not a
scientific question at all
but it is a question with which
Electric Universe researchers
have become all too familiar,
for not a few years.
Nevertheless, there is an increasing
number of independence of scientists,
who have proved to the satisfaction of many
that the theory of relativity is groundless,
in spite of the awe in which
it is generally held.
I would now like to supply my
two cents worth to that voice.
The celebrated lecturer
Richard Feynman noted:
if the Sun is exploding right now, it
takes 8 minutes before we know about it,
and it cannot possibly
affect us before then.
His reason for that
assertion is the doctrine,
that the fastest message that travels
between the Sun and the Earth
does so at 3 x 10 ^ 8 (300
million) meters per second,
the speed of light
through space.
At that lightspeed, the
Sun, viewed from the Earth,
appears to be where it actually
was some 8 minutes ago
and not where it actually
is when it is being viewed.
However, if the Sun by
its gravitational pull
is causing the Earth to
maintain an orbit around it,
the pull of the Sun on the Earth has
to be from almost exactly where it is
and not from where it was
8 minutes beforehand.
If the pull of the Sun upon the Earth came from
an 8 minutes-back position behind the Sun,
the Earth would be slung out
of orbit in short order.
Moreover for each planet, the
gravitational pull upon it of the Sun
would come from a
different point
― a different virtual Sun, so to speak ―
and no coherent solar system of
planets could be maintained.
It follows that there must be a much faster
messenger than light, namely gravity,
that travels between the
Sun and its planets
at a speed that makes the transmission
of light seem like a doddle.
We don't need any experiment
with neutrinos, therefore,
to tell us that something can
travel faster than light.
We just have to take into account all
the observations from which we infer
that the Earth and the other planets have
been moving around the Sun in stable orbits
for an extended period of time.
This requires the "gravitational
message" to be sent from the Sun
and received by the Earth as well as
other planets almost instantaneously.
Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity should,
therefore, have been repealed long ago.
Now, Wal Thornhill has applied this near
instantaneous transmission of force
to the level of the fundamental particles
of matter, such as the electron,
providing the possibility of an electrical
explanation of gravitation at the sub-atomic level.
We will consider this exciting
scenario in future presentations.

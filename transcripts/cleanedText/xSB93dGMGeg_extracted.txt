Electric Universe
2012 Conference
THE HUMAN STORY
Seeking The Third Story
David Talbott is the founder and
director of The Thunderbolts Project.
His roots in the catastrophic
movement reach back to the 60's,
but it was his book 'The
Saturn Myth' from 1980
which helped inspire the work
of several others now joined
in the collaborative endeavor.
He is coauthor with Wal Thornhill of
the 'Electric Universe', the Book.
His work is the subject of a riveting
DVD series, 'Symbols of an Aliens Sky'.
Two episodes have been
published so far,
we should be seeing parts of the
episode on Mars tomorrow evening
and highly recommend
that you be present.
I think it should be apparent to all
that this conference, 'The Human Story'
could never have taken place without
his inspiration and tireless efforts
not to mention his extraordinary
ability to galvanize those around him
so that to be delegated responsibility by
David sounds like a fun and worthwhile thing.
David is a muse in chief
for this movement.
His gentle manner and style combined
with a steely passion for the truth
is an inspiration to us
all and to a new public.
Here with talk intriguingly titled 'Seeking
the Third Story' is David Talbott.
- The Electric Universe -
SEEKING THE THIRD STORY
I had the interesting experience of
mentioning to several people that
I'm going to be talking
on this subject
and more often than not
someone would respond,
well, I wanna see that talk.
Which I find humorous because, well, I
haven't told you anything about it yet
and as it turns out
they do seem to have a sense as to what this
means that there really is something wrong
with our cultural and
scientific environment today
and there is a growing yearning
for a deeper understanding,
a deeper and more clear, and
more coherent, and unified,
and non contradictory, and non
fragmented way of seeing the Universe.
Now, it happened today, it happens
so often that the first question is,
Who Cares?
And I can't tell you how many
times I've heard that from folks.
Because a person with the reporter's
eye to a story, for example,
will always be thinking
in those terms.
And it doesn't necessarily register,
it may actually on the first words
that are used to express the
meaning of the Electric Universe,
it can seem rather remote
but if a person is intellectually alive
and has any attention span, let's say,
the Electric Universe is going to meet
that person at a level of very deep interest.
A lot of the entry with respect
to what is going on in this group
is related to the experience
of meaning and inspiration,
out of what is being
learned here.
And that comes clearly from the sense that
the truth is somehow shining through, true.
Something enduring, something lasting,
something that could affect us very deeply.
Now, I'm going to
show you a brief clip
from a future episode of
'Symbols of an Aliens Sky'.
How did human history begin?
The evidence may seem too
complex for generalization.
Yet all of history can be
stated as just two stories.
First came the story of mythology filled
with cosmic dramas and celestial wonders.
We lived in the
presence of the gods.
It was the gods who determined
the fate of the world,
demanding allegiance, even as
they called humans to sacrifice.
The gods were unpredictable,
when angry they went to war,
or they destroyed
their own creation.
Over time, however, man's quest
for deeper meaning in the myths
ignited sparks of
spiritual awakening
and it was from these sparks that
the great religions arose.
But all the world's religions
shared a taproot in mythology.
And not one freed itself entirely
from the momentum of the first story.
The second story arose from doubt, as
philosophers, poets and naturalists
began to lose faith in the myths, and some
stopped believing in the gods altogether.
That was because direct experience, under
a familiar and highly predictable sky,
gave no support to
the archaic myths.
Skepticism inspired closer attention
to nature, the essential requirement
for the rise of Science and Technology
that would change the world.
Thus the heroic completion
of the second story,
rational science rising to
vanquish myth and magic.
And so the full sweep of human history comes
down to just two stories in competition,
a cliche, Science vs
Myth and Religion.
Well into the 20th century it seemed
that we were forced to choose.
But if you have wondered, could the myths
harbor a truth that we have missed?
Something yet to be discovered,
a message for science,
hidden in the myths and
symbols of deepest antiquity.
The point I want to make is that seeking
a third story requires us to reconsider
two stories that dominated human imagination
across the whole sweep of human history.
Two stories.
Now, it was my role to
investigate the origins of myth,
and to pursue that subject I had to
come to grips with an unexplained mystery.
What was the mythic age of gods and
wonders remembered around the world?
Every culture said the same thing, the
gods ruled for a time then they went away.
This age of gods and wonders
is punctuated by disaster,
and in the end gods pass away or perhaps
they're translated into remote stars or planets.
Is that just imagination
from one culture to another
unrelated to anything actual,
actually experienced.
I had the benefit of having been inspired
originally by Immanuel Velikovsky,
and Velikovsky was an exceptionally
controversial figure.
Probably in the history of the 20th
century science he was up toward the top.
In the controversial
quality of his work.
He registered a very broad
hypothesis about human history,
but it had certain key elements
that are very relevant today.
The first is that the planetary system
was unstable within human memory.
He said that in dynamic
interactions between planets
electric arcs flew between these bodies
and affecting the surfaces those planets.
And he insisted that human
memories counted as evidence.
And planetary instability and human
memories counting as evidence,
both disqualified him from consideration
by the scientific community.
I happened to be publishing a
student journal called Pensée in 72
and I had this sense, from our
conversations with Immanuel Velikovsky,
that this was actually a historic
juncture, so as I was envisioning
how we might treat the
issue of Velikovsky,
we eventually came to the idea of putting
out a special issue of our student journal
distributed free on
Oregon campuses.
And this kind of cut across the
political divisions and so on
that we ourselves were fostering, with
the kind material that we're putting out
and that was Emmanuel
Velikovsky reconsidered.
And from that moment on my own
world just changed completely.
1 issue grew into 10, and this series had
a remarkable impact around the world,
it provoked this whole renewal
of interest in Velikovsky
in the light of new space-age
data coming back in the 70's.
I followed this questioning with an incredible
enthusiasm, and for a few years,
because of certain things that
were arising from my own study
I was actually living off of adrenaline
for, I swear, 3 or 4 years
realizing that an entirely different assessment
of human history and of evidence is possible.
Research method:
based first and foremost on
cross-cultural points of agreement.
Something that can not be ignored,
there is a power in diverse cultures
insisting on the same thing at
a level of very specific detail.
Attention to the earliest
sources, in other words,
the evidence was increasing that
there was a primordial experience.
Well of course, whatever has been preserved
to the point of cross-cultural agreement
you want to refer it back to the very
first expressions of those themes.
Because there's a natural tendency
of evolution over time in the myths
to fragment and to distort
or to localize the message.
There was a point
in which I realized
that there are hundreds of mythic
archetypes of points of agreement,
and that they're all connected and
that after the myth-making epoch
there is not a single
new archetype.
That was an
incredible revelation
that secured for me the possibility
of a unified theory of myth.
There were, must have been something
unique and experienced around the world
that gave rise to this unified
complex of mythic archetypes.
In a sense, the monumental
construction in antiquity is a witness
to something that is simply unknown
in human consciousness today.
Why would they all looking back to critical
junctures in the age of gods and wonders,
every monument that was ever
constructed, every temple, every city,
always involved a recreation
of the primordial event
and that event did not point to anything that
we can name in natural experience today.
Because Velikovsky had made this
seemingly preposterous claim
that the planet Venus appeared
in the sky as great comet
I kept my eye out for that particular
question all the time and I can only say,
because we want to cover a
lot of ground here,
that not only I but all who have seriously
investigated this question with
the kind of open-mind that is displayed
here, have concluded exactly the same thing.
Velikovsky was simply
and undeniably correct
in saying that the planet Venus was a
terrifying great comet, the parent of comets,
in other words, all of
the ideas about comets
when they responded with fear to a
wispy little comet coming into view,
everything that drove them was a
result of that primordial experience
of the great comet,
the mother of comets.
You can't pursue the mythic archetypes
without beginning to notice
that in the naming of planets in
relationship to these mythic powers
there is a consistency that has
to have an explanation
and there will be no explanation unless
the planets were gathered above humanity
in a way that has no conceivable
explanation in the sky we observe today.
So, that was the heart of a new way of looking
at human history and planetary history.
What was the age of
gods and wonders?
Where did the gods live?
The answer to that question is
undeniably, based on the early sources,
they lived in the sky.
And why did we stop
believing in the gods?
For the simple reason that
in the course of time with distance
from that primordial experience
there was nothing in the
human experience of nature
that would lend any support to the myths,
all myths became increasingly preposterous.
To gain a sense of the coherence
and universality of the myths
it's good to start with some
of the absolute fundamentals
a myth of the primeval paradise, the Golden
Age, an age of peace and plenty on Earth,
harmony in the sky.
There probably is not a well-documented
culture in an earlier time
that failed to remember
that tradition.
And then, there was
this catastrophic event
that brought the age of the gods
to its violent conclusion.
And what was the power that appeared in the
sky in the intervening phase of history?
This dragon like form.
But the most significant
about this form is that
when you investigated under the rules
of cross-cultural investigation
you find that every
ancient hieroglyph,
within the cultural
traditions you're investigating,
everyone, every symbol
is a symbol of the comet.
Long flowing hair, long flowing
beard, long flowing feathers,
serpentine form, fiery
countenance, fiery breath
all symbols of the comet.
Don't believe in accidents.
That's the heart of this research method,
convergence on extraordinary detail
has to mean shared experience,
even if we have not understood it.
I can thank Velikovsky and
quite frankly a brief outline,
I saw from Bill Mullen
way back in 1972,
it was like a page and a half outline of
Velikovsky's idea about the planet Saturn,
it was not in 'Worlds in Collision', he
had pulled it from 'Worlds in Collision'
in order to present a
more complete hypothesis.
But that was so intriguing,
this idea that Saturn had
this extraordinary role in
the earliest remembered time
and so, I followed that.
And yes, Saturn was directly
tied to the Golden Age,
as you can see in this quote about
life in the time of Kronos
when he ruled in heaven, Kronos being
Greek name of the planet Saturn.
Follow the threads and everything you
encounter just expands the anomaly,
expands the sense of something out
of our familiar experience
that was so much on the
mind of the ancients.
Today, probably not 1 in a
1,000 people know that Helios,
the Greek word for the Sun, was in early
time the name of the plant Saturn.
Sol - was a name of the planet Saturn.
Shamash - the Babylonian sun god, was
explicitly identified with the planet Saturn.
Scholars investigating this never
dispute it, but why that would be so,
is disputed.
There is an idea of a great
conjunction that has nothing to do
with what we call a conjunction
or even a great conjunction today.
We see the planets gathering
within a 30 degree arc of the sky
and they call that a
great conjunction.
No, the principle that is inherent is that
you see it at the heart of the ancient myths.
It's the planets stood in one
line, such that line
ran right through the heart
of those gathered bodies.
Now, why would anyone say that was
the condition that prevailed
in the first chapter of the
age of gods and wonders?
And that's what we'll see, I'll discuss
this in my presentation on Sunday.
Every culture in antiquity
tended to have a line of kings
and they could trace that line of
kings back to a mythic first king.
And this is where you find the
preeminence of the planet Saturn,
as the first father,
the father Kings.
What would that mean?
And why did that memory so preoccupy
those who formulated the rights of kingship
declaring that the blood
of that first ancestors
courses through the
veins of our King?
And what was the connection to the
myth of heaven close to the Earth?
The entire idea as a universal theme,
as a mythic archetype, makes no sense,
but there's an intimate connection to
Saturn that has to be explained because
you have a father figure and a
younger version of the same figure
and that has to be unraveled
but the truth is that the myth of heaven,
when heaven was close to the earth,
is inseparably connected to the planet
Saturn for no apparent reason at all.
So, I actually got Double Day, very
excited about a book before I've written it,
just on the basis of an article
I have written and an outline.
And I think that they had
expectations for the book
that left them sorely disappointed
after it was published.
The sales were simply not
impressive, and yet there is today
a group of people who
were inspired by the book,
it was effective with those
who really paid attention.
One incidentally is Ev Cochrane,
whom a number of you people know
and he is now a world-class
expert on world mythology.
There was this forgotten epoch
and what was seen in the sky
bore no resemblance
to things we see now.
And humans on Earth drew
pictures of these forms.
The dynamically evolving configuration
in the sky pressing in on the Earth,
obsessively preoccupying
human beings.
Out of respect for time I'm
not gonna belabor the details
but just leave with you this sense
of some underline pattern,
and as Bill Mullen said, it is
this ability to recognize patterns,
as is being done within our group
as a whole, that means everything.
Pattern recognition
leading the way
and in all every instance you're looking
at patterns that are archetypal
and every archetype is a defiance
of nature as we experience it today.
There is a wheel-like character to this
form and it provoked this explanation,
going back many years, that they must
have been drawing pictures of the Sun
and imagine that the Sun was a
wheel rolling across the sky.
And yet the truth is that these
pictographs in countless numbers
precede the discovery of
useful applications of the wheel
and that is very evident in fact
that the discovery of useful applications was
connected to models turned on temple walls
and in one way or another as
a praying wheel or whatever it might be,
this kind of an example of it
here in the wheel of Shamash
where the wheel is turn on the...
on a rope.
The useful wheel emerged from the
sacred wheel, it's not the reverse.
Notice the spokes of the wheel are
not functional anyway, very etheric.
And "Shamash is the planet Saturn", say the
magical texts of Assyrian and Babylonian.
So, honestly folks... Does the
Sun in our sky look like this?
Okay, here we go to a brief segment of the
first episode of 'Symbols of Alien Sky'.
You're looking at reconstructed images
of the formation in the heavens
just a few thousand years ago.
The configuration evolved through many
phases, evoking reverence and awe,
a model for kings and kingdoms
for thousands of years.
Great temples and cities
and sacred mountains,
all pointed back to the
mythic age of gods and wonders.
Let the world's first astronomers
point the way for us.
They knew that what the myths and
hymns and prayers called Gods
were planets and
aspects of planets.
Planets appeared close to the Earth
in heaven spanning configuration.
Memories of that celestial
splendor still surround us
even if humanity later forgot
much more than it remembered.
Reconnecting with our forgotten
past will be essential,
essential for our own
cultural integrity,
essential for the study
of human consciousness
and essential for
all of the sciences.
Here is the fulcrum of a
reconstructions stylized
but it carries the whole message that
I want to leave with folks tonight,
the claim that I'll swear by and yet
it could only sound preposterous
to someone who hasn't
investigated this.
The story of mythology is the story
of what happened to these bodies
and there is no other
story that really is true.
And anyone who follows the rules of the
investigation will discover this for themselves.
It's happening right now.
Maybe when we get to the panel
discussions at the Encore event
it will have some substantial
discussion of the human story
and we may talk about it
exactly what this means.
The point here is, this configuration
that is at the center of reconstruction
is the culmination of an
evolutionary phase that preceded it
through which the participants
were progressively clarified
at clarification of the personalities
of the male and female powers.
The female power being the great star in
the center of the overarching sphere.
The smaller star, smaller
planet, darker redder sphere
was the prototype of
the warrior hero.
The star burst form was the
prototype of the mother goddess,
the great star, the great comet, before it
was removed to become the angry goddess.
So, there's just this sweeping story,
it's not gonna be told briefly
because the configuration evolve through
dynamic and at times violent phases
but the point here is,
it can be reconstructed
because people were drawing pictures,
carving pictures on stone of what was seen
and today we have this incredible benefit
that the pictures that are recorded on stone
can actually be evaluated
under laboratory examination
of electric discharge in
a plasma environment.
And I should mention, because this
form is so unusual, I always laughed
when I would take a step
back and consider the symmetry
of the configuration
that I'd reconstructed.
I was calling this dust, gas and
dust in the emptiness of space.
Why would it gather
into symmetries?
And everything I was reconstructing
involved various layers and symmetries
that seemed utterly preposterous, and
then Wal Thornhill arrived in my office
in late 96, early 97, and
he explained to me
that in electric discharge in a
plasma you get this kind of symmetry
and he illustrated it for me.
Wal Thornhill, so that was the beginning
of a collaboration that won't quit now,
we published 2 books and the theme
is a convergence of myth and science.
One of those books, the 'Thunderbolts
of the Gods' takes advantage of a fact
that the cosmic thunderbolt
in the antic world
provides us with a bridge
between myth and science.
And every fact that you can bring forth
relating to this cosmic thunderbolt
is explicit and
extraordinary, and anomalous,
the warrior god's weapon was not
inspired by any practical function
and of course it never
looks like lightning.
But imagine a warrior within, launching
an arrow with the configuration seem here,
which would make the arrow
effectively disfunctional.
But it is a familiar form to those who
know electric discharge in plasma.
The Assyrian form, there are many variants
and it's quite clear that whatever
was being experienced it did go through
extraordinary evolution in the sky.
Not everyone understands this,
but the scholars who have looked
certainly do understand that the tridents
of early myth and symbolism were
forms of the cosmic thunderbolt.
And now you know why we chose
that image of this conference.
The ancient image of the
cosmic thunderbolt,
the Sanskrit vajra, Tibetan
dorje, the Japanese Kongo,
the weapon of the warrior god
Indra and so many others
and the identity of that
warrior god himself
and instance after instance,
he is his weapon.
The bolt of Odin, this bipolar
form is continually recurring.
Look at the heart of this figure.
The heart of heaven, the innermost heart of
that configuration that we initially show
was the form of the cosmic thunderbolt
in its first phases of evolution.
And that sphere that is identified
here as the masculine seed
is such a recurring element
it must, it just must be a part
of whatever dynamic sequence
is being displayed in the ancient
images of the thunderbolt.
A few greek examples.
And the point to follow is that all artists
progressively elaborated the thunderbolt form,
it became increasingly complex, there's
an underline form that stands out
and must be investigated in
relation to plasma discharge
in terms of the yet evolving ways of
artistically representing the cosmic thunderbolt
because it was evolving in the
sky and extremely common practice
was to juxtapose various phases
in the evolution of that form.
And that's what
you're seeing here.
Therefore, 5 or 6 different
elements of the cosmic thunderbolt
in its evolutionary sequence
that are displayed here.
Fact: the prototype of the warrior
god's sword or arrow was a thunderbolt.
Now, you have no doubt assumed
that the great warrior gods of all
of the folk literature and so on,
with their magical weapons,
they never missed their marker,
they returned to the hand
of the warrior himself.
That these were just based on our
experience of warriors with weapons,
it's quite the contrary.
The original form of the warrior's
weapon was the cosmic thunderbolt.
Now, there was a time after I converged
with Wal and I realized that a thunderbolt
it had to be at the center of the
whole story of violence in the sky.
I thought that I was the only one on
Earth that could have possibly known,
because it's such a
preposterous idea,
that all of these weapons of great warrior
gods were actually the cosmic thunderbolt.
I mean that's a ludicrous idea.
These stories of great heroes are claimed
to have emerged from our experience
in an earlier time of conflict and
battles on great battlefields and so on.
But I found I was not
the first by any means.
"When the sacrificer
brandishes the wooden sword,
it is the thunderbolt that
he hurls at the enemy."
"The sword is derived from a
lightning-flash archetype,
of which it is the descendant..."
This is why you find the word for
lightning in so many of the ancient words
for different heroic swords.
"... A 'derivation' of the sword, and similarly of
the celt, from a 'root' or archetype in lightning
is universal and worldwide."
in other words, that takes it right into the realm
of the archetypes, the points of agreement.
"In the matter of prehistoric weapons...
in every country without exception
they are always 'thunderbolts' and
never anything else." René Guénon.
Now, I think most of you understand that
investigation now is bringing together
the myths and symbols and experiments
in the laboratory that show bridges
that had never entered human
imagination previously.
Laboratory discharge
Knots, toroids and "wings"
emerge in plasma instabilities.
And this is a discharge form
from the Princeton plasma lab.
Illustrating or emphasizing
that instabilities produce axial
columns and embedded cylinders,
embedded cylinders.
This becomes extremely
important consideration.
An illustration of laboratory high-energy
discharge in a plasma medium.
The beginning with a knot.
Flattening into a torus.
The torus folding upwards into the
beginnings of the kind of champagne glass,
wine glass form, as
another torus is forming.
Back to just illustrate, you can see
it again in that particular image.
A more angular look
can be acquired.
Embedded cylinders.
And pinching of the cylinders
at the plasma pinch point,
which is key to the evolution
of that configuration.
The Vajra, yes artistic elaboration
has occurred I mean this could be
at least one or two thousand years
after the actual experience
and that's part of the evolution
of myth and symbolism over time,
but you see everything still
in the design element
that is inherent in the electric
discharge in the plasma laboratory.
The form in the hand of Zeus
is in that early phase, where it's
beginning to send out the petals.
I like this image, the red-headed
warrior is telling because,
I mean, one of the first things
that begins the register
when you are examining warriors identified
with the planet Mars is the red form,
but notice his head is surmounted by the
upper termination of the cosmic thunderbolt.
The warrior is his weapon.
Greek images showing that
evolution in very stylized forms
and the kind of complexity you see
here is actually representative
of the complexities that will appear in
varying conditions in electric discharge.
But surely no one needs to emphasize that
we've never seen lightning take this form.
So, what is being underscored here is the
absolute contradiction of the mythic archetypes
to the natural experience.
Only intense electric discharge in a
plasma can create these forms.
One step forward, more
than 10,000 years ago
paleolithic artist painted these images
on the walls of Lascaux cave in France,
they were realists with an
exceptional eye for detail.
Why these talented artists of the
Stone Age disappeared remains a mystery,
but the greater mystery
is the epoch that followed.
It seems that Neolithic artists lost the
ability to depict nature as we know it.
Accurate representations
of nature are present
but the dominant style produced a carnival
of ghostly creatures and absurd forms
never seen in our world.
How did this tendency arise?
Not in one land alone, but
on every habitable continent.
Absurd? Yes, but what provoked
the distinctive patterns?
A stick man with no head, just a
duck or other bird on his shoulders.
Hundreds of variations on this theme
occur in the American Southwest.
But the pattern
doesn't end there.
Notice the twin dots on the two sides
of these crudely crafted stick figures.
One instance alone
is just a curiosity
but widespread patterns
must have an explanation.
And other details only
accent the irrationality.
Recently an answer to these mysteries came
from outside traditional archeology,
from plasma science and laboratory
experiments with electric discharge.
Plasma scientist Anthony Peratt of
Los Alamos laboratories has shown
that these stick forms recorded
electrical events in the sky.
Something like the Northern Lights we see
today but a thousand times more energetic.
And he matches the rock art
forms precisely
to the configurations taken by
electric discharge in the laboratory.
The rock art images are explained as
sheets of intense electric current
in the evolution of
a plasma discharge.
The central column you see in
this stylized representation
is the axis of the discharge.
Wrapped around the axis is a torus or
donuts-like tubular sheet of charged particles.
The observer sees through the transparent
formation: champagne glass above,
squashed bell-shape below, so the plasma
density is greatest at the limbs.
Drawn in two dimensions, the formation
matches the stick man carved globally
on stone by the thousands.
The two dots under
the stick man's arms
are the exceedingly bright high-energy
radiation called synchrotron radiation,
emitted from the
center of the torus.
The current sheets continually warp
as the electric discharge progresses
and this form is not uncommon.
A two dimensional representation
might look like this.
Peratt's work has shown
that the stick man,
the duck headed version
of the American Southwest
and variations from Hawaii to Saudi
Arabia is a plasma discharge formation,
a subject on which he's an
acknowledged world expert.
Peratt's investigation is entirely
independent from our own.
Thousands of rock art images
have enabled a supercomputer
to identify formations as seen
from different positions on Earth.
The fit that he has documented
can not be accidental.
And yet our own investigation, which
preceded Peratt's by almost three decades,
converges with his in
extraordinary ways
as I shall clarify in the
second episode of this series.
For scholars and scientists as a whole,
rock art remains an unsolved mystery.
For 200 years experts have debated over
the vast library of images on stone.
Definitive considerations are now in
hand, calling for a new perspective.
One that follows the
compelling evidence
for high-energy electrical
events in the ancient sky.
And those who pursue this
line of investigation
must not be afraid to ask how
the movements of planets
may have contributed to an
electrified cosmic environment,
of which science knew nothing
only a few decades ago.
Now because we just introduced
the work of Tony Peratt
and I'm sure many of you know
that it doesn't stop here,
the convergence with Peratt has
actually a very interesting history
and I'm just gonna address that briefly
so as to not get stopped at this point.
But Tony became a very good friend
traveling to Portland more than once
I traveled to Albuquerque
and Santa Fe more than once,
we got together for dinners and
he was incredibly animated.
But I was essentially precluded at that time
from mentioning any association at all.
Now with the passage of time it
is, I think, the only appropriate
to be pretty explicit as I've been
over just the past 3 years or so
about the nature of that relationship, how
it evolved and what it actually means.
I was in 2000 working with Rick Smith of the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory, database manager
in conveying to Rick ideas about a more complex
dimension of an evolving configuration
that required us to look
at it three-dimensionaly.
And three-dimensional representation
was becoming increasingly important
because I was beginning to see that we were
observing configurations in a phase of,
you might call it cosmic wandering,
and in the myths it was the
phase of wandering gods.
And so, Rick produced an image
that I then translated
into an illustration of what I had
been calling the chain of arrows.
And when Wal came to Portland
in September of 2000
ahead of the symposium to which
we had invited Tony Peratt
I showed the image to Wal
of the chain of arrows form.
I asked him, Wal how did
plasma do this and Wal said;
"Look, it is so clear that it
is a plasma discharge form,
but it needs to be
investigated more completely."
And then Tony Peratt arrived at the
conference and in a private gathering
of speakers and trusting, you can see that image
upper left, he just drew out a form,
and he called it
the Christmas tree.
I said, Tony you've just
drawn the chain of arrows.
It's a very dominant form in
laboratory of discharge experiments,
it was named after Tony
Peratt, a Peratt instability,
his team members honored
him with that title.
I said that to Tony and he responded,
well how does it evolve?
And I'm not going to
discuss the evolution here
but I will allude to it
in my talk on Sunday.
But essentially it was twin filaments
spiralling up the axis of the Earth,
dividing into a stack of toruses that
took the appearance of a the chain of arrows
and then as a latter of heaven,
the backbone of the sky.
This is such an exotic concept and yet it
can be reconstructed in very finite detail
and it is simply inconceivable
to me that something other than
the actual human experience could possibly
account for the accord which is global.
So, Tony asked me when got back
home he said, "send me the rock art".
And for starters, though I have
thousands of rock art images,
I sent him just one and it was
entirely on the basis of intuition.
I had come to believe that this is one of the
purest representations of that discharge form.
As Tony recounts it, the moment he saw
this he knew that his life has changed.
His initial response was fear
that somebody had somehow
hacked into his computer and diagnosed the
plasma discharge from the lot of this stuff
back then, before Tony got it declassified,
was really top secret information.
This form, just given a little bit of three
dimensionality on the right
so you can see it is three-dimensional
and so you have wine glass on top
and you have that toroidal form at the
base and you have a stack of toruses
where the disk is folded sharply
upward, that's what does happen
and the stack of Toruses, Tony confirmed
to me, is absolutely and unequivocally
a dominant feature of the evolving
configuration in the laboratory.
And there is something quite
meaningful in this phase,
it's not as popularly inscribed on
stone for one reason in particular
that it's highly energetic and violent
and potentially deadly in its radiation,
and it collapses into this form,
which is the stick-man form.
And at the time I learned this
from Tony I had never imagined
that there was an explanation that I
could understand of the stick-man form,
and he provided it.
Bi-polar discharge
in space
Of course we now know that the geometries
of the electric discharge in plasma
are abundantly
evident in space.
And look at that core of the
inner, the most energetic emanation,
how beautifully symmetrical it is,
and that is a pointer back
to that kind of symmetries,
bipolar symmetries, that were
evident in the ancient sky.
Now the people are gonna get
bored with this image very soon.
Yes, I think it is the
third time tonight.
But is such a beautiful
bi-polar form,
and not all the forms exhibit
that spectacular symmetry,
because conditions in the sky would be
widely varying within the Milky Way.
But this bi-polar form is so clearly
analogical to the thunderbolt form.
Really quite spectacular, quite beautiful,
but certainly not driven by gravity.
Now I'm just going to give an overview of
directions for finding the third-story,
because our minds must be willing to work
with a reconsideration of the first story,
and the second story, and we must
come to fully appreciate the fact
that the 1st story will never be understood
in the absence of the Electric Universe
and the 2nd story must be rewritten
in the light of the Electric Universe.
So, this is the basis of the incredible
sense of the unified possibility
that is emerging now,
within this group.
Now that we're seeing space across
the entire electromagnetic spectrum
it is becoming undeniable that
things are occurring out in space,
that exotic structures are being seem
that were simply never anticipated,
but are observed
in the laboratory.
Electricity - the unifying force
And as we discussed,
what in our cosmic neighborhood would be
the best window to the Electric Universe?
It seems increasingly clear because the Sun
is the most thoroughly investigated body
in our solar system,
outside the Earth itself
that if we live in an
Electric Universe,
there is a fundamental misunderstanding
that must be corrected.
Our Electric Sun
And then down to the smallest
level and in the quantum domain,
surely the underpinnings
of the natural world
seen in terms of the role
of the electric force,
as Wal and many others who are gathered
here today, have begun to explain.
That is key.
Electricity of Life
The people who are here to address that
subject now, they are on the cutting edge.
It is both the ancient
myths and symbols and
the modern perception
of planetary history
that must come together
in one analysis.
The goddess image in much of our
culture today is very very popular
but one thing I came
to notice is that
it's popular and there is almost a kind
of reverence for that goddess form
but in all of the visionary art and exotic
representations of that mythic theme
it seemed as if there was nothing
actually underpinning it,
it was just floating...
and in the final analysis it is our
role to bring clarity to visionary art,
because the archetypes could not be meaningless
and we can agree with them on that
but we can bring the roots
beneath those archetypes,
so that they can begin to be
interpreted in a way that will be,
well, simply more meaningful.
The Cosmic Warrior
Why is it that amongst all the
planets around the world
the astronomical tradition
always identify
the planet of the
mother goddess as Venus
and always when looking out of Mars, they
unanimously agree, that was a great warrior.
Don't believe in accidents.
What we're all talking about
here is the power of convergence,
I enjoyed very much Greg
Volt's exposition on that.
● Interdisciplinary convergence
● Not artificial consensus
● Meaningful peer review;
we all want that
but not peer review that is
just a gate keeping device.
We want those who are open-minded
and fully accredited
to become the vehicle for
assessing extraordinary new ideas
and not to be dismissed or fired
because they gave their approval
to an extraordinary idea
and if anyone here doesn't believe
that there's that kind of fear
active under the present peer review
system in institutionalization of science,
well, you're dead wrong,
we see this all the time.
There are people here I happen
to know, are anonymous today
because of the power
of that force.
Pattern recognition as Dr. Mullen
was just emphasising earlier
it's a key, it's leading the way, it's
opening the doors to possibilities.
You don't start with mathematics, you get the
interdisciplinary picture by seeing patterns
and understanding what is going on
at a practical common-sense level
and you direct the mathematicians to
begin working with these patterns
which are counting us, something
is fundamentally wrong.
Don't just keep elaborating a present,
a previous idea mathematically
to make things work.
That means we need
a broader field of view,
this is what I love about the NPA,
they know what natural science is,
if you're always looking an inch wide and
a mile deep, how well are you able to see
the evidence shouting at you from
the broader horizon of your science?
It's telling you that you're,
your focus is to narrow
and you're missing the things
that actually falsify your assumption.
And I don't think any body in
this room needs to be told
that the role of the scientific
maverick is absolutely essential today
and we are here to support that
role, and it is why we came into
an alinement with the
Natural Philosophy Alliance.
And that is the end
of my presentation.

It's time to put to bed the fairy tale of dark
matter, something so dark of course it's invisible,
and so mysterious that it remains
undetected after decades of searching
for it with sophisticated instruments,
scanning all the known cosmos and
the entire electromagnetic spectrum. But how can
something be falsified that's this imperceptible?
Of course, there are many other invisible
non-existent astrophysical entities, such
as dark energy and neutron stars that
have been invented and disseminated
using disingenuous methods of measurement and
interpretation onto a naive unsuspecting public.
But those are battles for another day.
Being a scientist is like being an
explorer who's attempting to hack a
pathway through a dense jungle, snarl of
weeds, vines, trees and undergrowth.
But the scientist’s jungle consists of
natural ignorance and also a lack of
knowledge and grown false beliefs which
may be long time officially accepted mis-
conceptions. Real scientists try to produce
hypotheses, that is to say logical descriptions
of real things and how they interact.
All scientific hypotheses of course have to
be testable. If it can't be actively tested, a
hypothesis at least must pass the so-called test
of time. Incoming new data has to fit comfortably
into any proposed hypothesis or model
without too much tinkering with it, or
massive back-to-the-drawing board modifications,
and certainly without inventing imaginary ecological,
non-measurable forces and non-observable entities,
such as strange matter to explain the new data.
In the past few years I’ve been studying
Birkeland Currents. Those are the strong,
stable flows of electrically charged
particles that connect from one place in
the cosmos to another. What their form
and structure is and how they affect
objects they connect with. Originally
discovered by Kristian Birkeland early
in the 1900s coming from the Sun to the 
earth. They deliver the electric power that
lights up our auroras and I wanted to develop
an accurate, realistic model of their structure.
A complete description of what I did is
thoroughly detailed in chapters 10 and
11 of my latest book “The Interconnected
Cosmos,” published by Stickman on Stone,
and I urge you to pick up a copy. Anyway, 
here's a brief description of what I did.
My starting point was at the edge of the
scientific jungle, astrophysics and cosmology,
which supposedly is the scientific study
of cosmic space and those things that
inhabit it, but it really is a jungle of
contradictions and warped, bizarre,
impossible processes and imaginary
forces. But I had to begin somewhere.
At that time I had completed the
derivation and interpretation of a
mathematical model that had been started by Stig
Lundquist in 1950. He had determined two equations that
describe the basic shape of the magnetic
field that is inside a Birkeland Current,
but that's where he stopped. I completed his model
to include five major equations and also interpreted
what they implied about the physical shape
of the Birkeland Currents and their behavior
and that was not explained fully by Lundquist.
My model predicted that Birkeland
Currents uniquely produce coaxial
counter-rotational motion of their
internal plasma and are able to carry electric
current in both directions at the same time.
Let me emphasize, this is a unique
behavior. A coaxial cable here on Earth
cannot simultaneously carry current in both 
directions. As far as we know, true coaxial counter-
rotation is created in nature only by field
aligned, that is to say, Birkeland Currents.
For example a pair of tornadoes, located
near each other, rotating in opposite
directions, is not an example of coaxial
counter-rotation simply because they're
not coaxial, they're not inside one another.
So when NASA recorded those coaxial
counter-rotating cloud bands on both Jupiter
and Saturn, my model had passed its first test.
That was the extent of my first foray
into this cosmological jungle and at
that point I figured we’d pitch camp for a rest.
But then the announcement of the discovery
of counter-rotating stars in the faces of several
spiral galaxies, was even stronger evidence that was
headed in the right direction. In 
2014 it was reported that a vast
network of plasma filaments, Birkeland Currents
really, had been discovered that connect many,
if not all, the galaxies in the 
Universe in what has been called the
Intergalactic Web, abbreviation IGW.
The discovery was quickly confirmed and
a rush of scientific papers followed.
All this strongly suggested that
Birkeland Currents not only connect
objects within our solar system, but
there are much larger and stronger Birkeland Currents
arching across the vast distances between galaxies.
I assume that those galaxies within the
Intergalactic Web must be sending and
receiving electric currents via the plasma
filaments to which they are connected.
Also, I thought if galaxies actually form
on those Birkeland Current filaments in
the web, they probably inherit their
rotational profiles from those filaments.
If that happens, then the stellar
velocity profiles ought to be the same
as the velocity profiles of the
Birkeland Currents on which they form.
Remember that the typical stellar velocity profile
in a galaxy, a plot of the star's velocity as a
function of its radius r, how far out it is from
the galaxy's center, has been totally baffling to
astrophysicists. Actually they typically look
like a plot of the function the square root of r.
This shape cannot be explained by
Newtonian physics and almost all
astrophysicists deny that electrical
effects could possibly produce any of
what we see in the cosmos. So, 
that's why astronomers like Vera
Rubin and her colleagues postulated the
existence of dark missing matter in the
1940s. Their repeated unsuccessful
attempts to explain this rotation of
those stars is what set astronomers off on
their decades-old quest to find dark matter.
So, I wondered if the plot of the
rotation speed of the plasma in my model
Birkeland Current, might be similar to
the ones that baffled those astronomers.
I set out to determine what that
velocity profile might be. My model
yields information about the magnetic
field strength and the current density
in a Birkeland Current, but it doesn't
directly yield any information about the
velocity of the charges that make up those currents.
The key to determining the velocity of
the stream of charged particles in a
Birkeland Current was the realization that
the current density in any plasma has two components,
the charge density and the velocity of those charges.
The charge density is how much charge
you have per cubic meter and the
velocity of course is how many meters per
second does that box of charges travel with.
Therefore, if we know any two of these three
quantities j, rho and v, we can find the third one.
We obviously know from historical
astronomical observations what the
typical velocity profile of stars 
within the galaxy looks like, and it's
approximately the square root of r.
And we know from the equations of my
model that the current density j, varies
with radial distance r, out from the
BC's, that is the Birkeland Current's central
axis, as one over the square root of r.
So, I was able to solve for the third
quantity, not very hard, the charge
density rho that must exist inside my model BC,
using all this data, the data from galaxy NGC1620,
it turns out to be a simple inverse relationship,
one over r. This clearly demonstrates that an
electrical process exists, that can
produce the heretofore inexplicable
stellar velocities, that prompted
astronomers to search for dark matter in
the first place. In other words, the
refusal to accept the existence and
effects of electrical charges in space,
is what began, and maintains to this day,
the dark matter wild goose chase.
But is there any evidence that this
particular distribution, this one over r
shape, is the way charge really is
distributed inside an actual BC?
I took a short side trip off the logical
journey we had been on, to find that 
out. Did the velocity profiles of other
galaxies also require this same charge density in
the BC’s they connected with? That was the question.
Other galaxies may have slightly different velocity
profiles. Using any of those other velocity
profiles with the same expression for
current density from my model, yielded
slightly different charge density curves.
But the main point is that there is
always some charge density curve, that will
exactly reproduce any arbitrary velocity profile.
So, I repeat myself. We have now shown, and as I said
recently, presented in a greater detail in my new
book, that a purely electrical process does
indeed exist that can produce a hitherto
inexplicable stellar velocity [distribution] that
prompted astronomers to search for dark
matter. And that's the end of the story.
The charge densities may be slightly
different from that one over r-shaped
distribution in different galaxies but
the BC curve, that Birkeland Current velocity
curve will always match the actual one.
By the way we know that BCs often show
coaxial counter-rotation. So, when we
observe coaxial rotation of the stars in
a galaxy that is connected to a BC,
that's additional evidence that we're
correct that it is the Birkeland Current
that's producing the velocity of those
stars in those galaxies. The twisting
motions of the galaxy's Birkeland current are
what produces the velocities of those stars.
If we assume that the charge density
distribution that exists within a
typical Birkeland Current filament is, as
a function of radial distance r, the
distance out from the Z-axis of the
Birkeland Current, is proportional to one
over r, as it is for the one particular
galaxy I show there, NGC1620, we can
solve mathematically for the electric
field that particular charge density
plot creates. In other words, we know what
the charges are, where they are, we can
solve for the electrical field that results.
In turn, knowing the properties of that
electric field, allows us to find the
voltage that will occur at every point
within the Birkeland Current's cross-section as
a function of the radius value of that point.
It turns out that under this assumption
about the charge density, that the
maximum voltage occurs exactly at the
center of the Birkeland Current, that r
equals 0, the central Z-axis. Out 
from there, the points of increasing
radius, the voltage plot is a simple
linearly decreasing function of r.
This voltage distribution is exactly what's
needed to produce Marklund convection.
Okay, but so what? What's Marklund
convection? Well, in Marklund convection,
it's a process that occurs in a Birkeland
Current, atoms of the various elements present
are sorted according to their so-called ionization
potential. This results in the easily ionized, that
is to say the heavier atomic weight
elements such as iron, being found at the
center of the filament, and the lighter
elements such as hydrogen and helium,
being found in its outer regions. This 
process works, because positive ions
accelerate down the voltage drop that
starts at the center of the Birkeland
current, and ends at its outer edge.
They go faster and faster, until they
collide out at the edge of the Birkeland
Current with any matter, atoms, ions, dust,
any other stuff, and this releases heat.
Those collisions release heat. The
temperature is hottest at the collision site,
just at the Birkeland Current's edge. And
that's why the elements that are the
most difficult from which to strip off
an electron, such as hydrogen and helium, are found
out there. So the center of the Birkeland Current
is its coolest region and contains
the heavy elements such as iron,
and its outer edge is the hottest region
containing elements such as hydrogen.
This is intriguingly the same sorting
arrangement found in stars including our
Sun, which are formed in Z-pinches in Birkeland
Currents. Our Sun has a heavy concentration of
hydrogen at its outer surface.
Therefore, if the Sun was created at the
center of a pinch, such as a Birkeland
Current, then its center ought to be
relatively cool and its outer surface, the 
photosphere should be quite hot and it is.
We know that the dark center of a
Sunspot, the umbra, is much cooler than
the surrounding photosphere and it's 
a window into the inside of the Sun.
But the question still remained. Was 
my assumption that the distribution of
electric charges, the charge density rho,
one over r, correct? Does it really occur?
The answer came when a noted astronomer,
professor Michael Merrifield of the
University of Nottingham, reported that the
outer rim of a galaxy, this one was NGC4550,
mysteriously had a collection of counter-
rotating, hydrogen-rich stars at its
periphery, at the edge of it. He complained 
that there was no known way for this
to ever occur. His announcement
unintentionally provided supporting
evidence that I considered strong evidence,
for my claim that a Birkeland Current
had been, or was connected to this galaxy.
This might easily have been the cause,
not only of the hydrogen-rich collection
of stars along its edge, but also why
that band was counter-rotating with
respect to the other stars in NGC4550.
I assert that my assumption was thus
shown to be valid, at least in this
particular case. And once again, we 
see that an electrical process is the
explanation that eludes all these expert
astrophysicists that still say yes, yes,
we know electricity exists in the cosmos but it doesn't
do anything. Well, the Sun's heliosphere is a node, a
pinch in a Birkeland Current. According 
to our model, the only place in a
Birkeland Current that involves energy
loss, would be the outer edge of the
Birkeland Current where positive 
ions falling radially down that linearly
decreasing voltage profile, recombine
with electrons just outside. This
recombination process will emit a
low level of visible light. It releases
energy in the form of light. The newly
formed energetic neutral atoms called
ENAs, energetic neutral atoms, then
diffuse back into the Birkeland Current.
Being neutral, they're unaffected by any
of the electromagnetic effects there.
This visible light was discovered by the
NASA Lockheed Martin IBEX mission. The
announcement said in part, IBEX's 
all-sky map of energetic neutral
atom emission reveals a bright ring of
ENAs that encircles the entire heliosphere.
David J. McComas, IBEX principal
investigator and assistant vice
president of the Space Science and
Engineering division at Southwest
Research Institute, said quote,
”The IBEX results are truly remarkable,
with a narrow ribbon of bright details.
This is a shocking new result.
We had no idea this ribbon existed, or
what has created it. Our previous ideas
about the outer heliosphere are going to have to be
revised.” But if history is any guide, it will not
be revised. NASA and the astrophysics
power structure never admit they were
wrong about anything. We'll see what they do in
this case. In any event the Marklund convection
process may well be occurring all along
the vast length of the Birkeland Current
that extends on either side of our Sun's 
heliosphere. And that Birkeland Current is not
visible from Earth, probably because it's
an aging normal Birkeland Current that
has a weaker charge density along its
length than will be found at the Z-pinch,
the heliopause, the heliosphere.
The current density will be weaker, the
plasma will therefore be in dark mode quite
likely, and I think it is, from observation,
and any light generated by recombination
along its periphery will be even weaker
than that observed by the IBEX mission.
But the Marklund convection process, in
which the positive ions inside a Birkeland 
Current are accelerated outward,
directed by an E-field from a high-voltage
central axis, is exactly the same process
that we now know occurs just above the
edge of the Sun's heliosphere, when the
solar wind positive ions coming from the
Sun recombine with incoming electrons to
produce the light seen by IBEX. It's 
also similar to what happens just
above the Sun's photosphere, where
accelerating positive ions, escaping from
inside the Sun, collide with other matter,
which creates the high temperatures of
the Sun's coronal temperature anomaly.
It's the same process, just with higher
current density at the pinch than 
along the BC's length, and highest
of all just above the Sun's photosphere.
So, the evidence strongly indicates that
stars are connected to their planets 
and to other stars. All galaxies are
connected. The more we look carefully, 
the entire Universe is interconnected by
plasma Birkeland Current filaments. 
And the electrical interactions at all
locations are fairly similar, just with
differing strengths and sizes. The
process seems to be scalable. I have 
long wondered why cosmologists,
who claim the Universe is created by a
Big Bang explosion, never try to explain
where all the rotation comes from.
Just about everything we see in the
cosmos rotates, or twists, or spins. Why?
How did it get that way from a Big Bang explosion?
Birkeland Currents rotate and they counter-
rotate. Is that the source of all the rotation?
I claim yes, it is. At least until I hear of another
natural process that can cause the rotation and
coaxial counter-rotation we see 
everywhere we look in the sky.
We all have to realize that no one can ever disprove
the existence of something that doesn't exist.
In order to maintain or renew 
the sources of their grant funding,
astrophysicists who now refuse to put 
an end to their fruitless and wildly
expensive dark matter quest, are 
challenging us to do just that. In
maintaining their assertion that dark matter
still exists, they're saying something like,
”There's a big vicious dog under this
table. He's invisible, untouchable,
unsmellable and makes no sounds, but he ate my
homework last night. Prove to me he doesn't exist.”
Now, this is a dishonest, illogical
unreasonable, childish challenge.
Anyone seriously making such a demand is
a shyster, a snake oil salesman who is
intentionally trying to swindle his audience, or 
perhaps he's an intellectually lazy astrophysicist
fearing misinformation. Either way, the evidence is
indisputable. The theory and most importantly, the
rationale for the existence of dark matter
has now been systematically debunked.
An accurate understanding of the 
cosmos is impossible in the conventional
science of astrophysics, simply because
they refuse to expand their tool set.
Limited to the force of gravity in 
either its Newtonian or Einsteinian
format, gravity only attracts. Magnetic 
forces can attract, but they can also repel.
Electrical forces can also attract and they can 
repel. And then there's the Lorentz force that
exists between electrical charges moving through a
magnetic field. Including all of these essential forces
of nature when cracking the secrets of the Universe,
then the concept and necessity
of dark matter is outright ridiculous.
Another key difference between the Standard Model
and the Electric Universe model of cosmology.

Scientists on Earth are
again being reminded
of the awesome power of
dust storms on Mars.
The first stirrings of what has become
a globe-encompassing phenomenon
began on June 17th
when a dust storm touched down
on the famous Gale Crater.
For several decades such remarkably
energetic Martian storms
have posed enigmas that
meteorologists have yet to resolve.
Mars's atmosphere is only slightly more
than 1/2 of 1% as dense as Earth's
yet Mars has towering
dust tornadoes
some the size of Mount Everest
and global dust storms that dwarf anything
ever witnessed on our own planet.
In such a tenuous atmosphere,
how is dust removed from the soil
and accelerated into massive clouds
circling the planet up to 40
miles or more above the surface?
What holds the dust aloft?
What accelerates the winds and dust across
the near vacuum of Mars's upper atmosphere
to speeds greater than
250 miles per hour?
NASA scientists first witnessed
such an awesome event in 1971
when Mariner 9 became the first
space probe to orbit Mars.
In the subsequent
nearly half century,
mainstream planetary science
has shown little progress
in deciphering the
many mysteries
these and many others strange natural
events on the red planet present.
For many years, The Thunderbolts
Project has offered detailed analysis
on the role of electricity
in our solar system
and its connection to planetary
atmospheric and weather phenomena.
This analysis has
made many predictions
which continue to receive
stunning confirmation.
To understand the global
Martian dust storms
it's first necessary to explore
the undeniable electrical nature
of another type of dramatic
dust raising event,
a Martian dust devil.
The so-called dust devils
on Mars are truly alien
when compared to dust
devils on our own planet.
These monstruous formations are typically
kilometers high and hundreds of metres wide
or approximately ten times
larger than any earthly tornado.
The tremendous electric fields
associated with the phenomena
have been acknowledged by
NASA for well over a decade.
In 2005, the Space Agency issued
a news release which declared,
"When humans visit Mars,
they'll have to watch out for
towering electrified dust devils."
Unfortunately, mainstream planetary
scientists can only theorize
that the electric fields are ultimately caused
by the mechanical energy of air convection.
The NASA release states,
"Dust devils get their charge from grains of
sand and dust rubbing together in the whirlwind.
When certain pairs of unlike
materials rub together,
one material gives up
some of its electrons
(negative charges) to
the other material...
Smaller dust particles
tend to charge negative
taking away electrons from
the larger sand grains."
And here we see a fundamental
confusion of cause and effect.
As physicist Wal
Thornhill wrote in 2004,
"...in an electrified universe charge is
already separated on the macroscopic scale
and the movement of air in a dust devil
is an effect of charge recombination,
not a cause of
charge separation."
With such low
atmospheric pressure
how does one account for the dust
particles leaving the surface?
For decades, the Electric
Universe community
has developed experimental research
on electrostatic dust transport
which can provide great
insights into everything
from the collimated jet
seen exploding from comets
to the dust storms on
Mars and other worlds.
In 2001 Thornhill wrote,
"When I was doing experiments on
electric discharges to a clay surface
there was an electric wind effect
that would blow away all of the dust
and loose particles from the surface
before any arcing took place.
When the diffuse
discharge is big enough
it will rotate causing
a tornado effect.
We have seen but not recognized
electric winds on Mars.
Mars has no counterpart
of thunderclouds
to provide a convenient path to
ground for electrical differences
between the ionosphere
and the planet.
As a result more diffuse and
very tall discharges must occur,
giving rise to an
electrical vortex
that manifests by the material rays from
the surface into the thin atmosphere."
In June of 2001 the greatest dust
storm ever witnessed on Mars began
and did not start to subside
for a full 4 months.
In 2005 the Thunderbolts.info website
published a Picture Of the Day article
that made two completely unconventional
predictions about such dust storms.
As noted in the 2007 article
'Martian Dust Devils ―
Prediction Confirmed'
taking a pointer from
Wallace Thornhill
we asserted that the global dust
storm that engulfed the planet Mars
in August and September of 2001 involved
a packed assembly of dust devils
carrying great volumes of Martian
dust into billowing clouds.
Since publication of that TPOD,
a review of dust storm images from the
Mars Global Surveyor and from THEMIS
together with the systematic study
of related phenomena on Mars
has confirmed that our
statement was accurate
and yet it is also clear that the concept
of compact "dust devil congregations"
could only appear absurd
to conventional schools.
In standard theory an atmospheric vortex
requires a vastly larger circulation of wind,
a condition that precludes
what seems clearly to be seen
in edge-on pictures of
"storm fronts" on Mars.
This image shows
apparent vortices,
a word that would not be
used by NASA scientists
rising into billowing clouds from the margins of
the south polar ice cap in the Martian summer.
The caption accompanying
the release reads,
"Like billowing smoke
from a brush fire,
clouds of dust are seen streaming off the
edge of the Martian south polar cap."
The same 2005 Thunderbolts article
summarized the electrical cause
of the massive Martian
dust storms as follows,
"Since Mars has no thunderstorms to
'charge up its ionosphere',
it should present a good case
study of the Electric Universe.
The electrical model predicts that the
Martian ionosphere is indeed charged,
and it posits no isolated
dynamo to 'separate charge'.
On Mars, electrical effects will reach
directly from the ionosphere to the surface
without the ameliorating leakage via
storm clouds that we see on Earth.
Unlike radiant
energy from the Sun,
electrical energy can accumulate in the
planetary capacitor for some time,
with the potential for
planet altering events
when the atmosphere
finally breaks down
and massive discharge
activity is initiated...
At the same time the electric currents
flowing in the Martian ionosphere
will drive the high-speed winds
in the upper atmosphere."
The article then offered a second
extremely radical prediction
about global Martian
dust storms. It stated,
"There is also another aspect to the
interplanetary circuitry affecting Mars.
The greatest storm on Mars in 2001 occurred
when the planet was nearing perihelion
and was the closest it had been
to Earth in about 12 years.
At that time it was also being 'tickled'
by the Earth's plasma sheath,
establishing a temporary electrical
connection between Earth and Mars
for the transfer of charge.
It seems that Mars responded with an
outburst of atmospheric discharges,
these taking the form of
monstrous dust devils
- or more accurately,
electrical tornados."
Today as massive dust storms are
again encircling the Red Planet
science headlines have announced
another crucial fact about Mars
though no one outside of the
Electric Universe community
appears to have noticed
the connection.
Just as in 2001, today Mars is again
approaching perihelic opposition
and by late July it will make its
closest approach to Earth in 15 years.
One such convergence of circumstances
could be considered coincidence
but a second instance
demands closer examination.
Of course the Electric Universe also
predicts that dramatic solar activity
in the form of coronal
mass ejections
can provoke electrical
discharges from celestial bodies
that move within the
Sun's electrical domain
including comets
and even planets.
Such a display was in fact
seen on Mars in recent years
to planetary scientists'
complete bafflement.
In March of 2012
amateur astronomers spotted enormous
plumes jetting from the Martian surface.
The plumes were more
than 250 km high
and several hundreds of
kilometers in length.
As the lead author of a scientific
paper on the discovery stated,
"At about 250 km, the division between the
atmosphere and outer space is very thin,
so the reported plumes are
extremely unexpected."
In 2016, scientists using data
from the Mars Express spacecraft
discovered something
equally unexpected.
Immediately before the
plume was first spotted
Mars appeared to be hit by
a coronal mass ejection.
David Andrews of the Swedish
Institute of Space Physics stated,
"It's very surprising that was affecting Mars
right before the plume was first observed."
The implications of electrical
phenomena are obvious
even to mainstream scientists.
A New Scientist report of
the discovery stated,
"One possibility is that plasma could
be interacting with ice grains or dust
lower down in the atmosphere and electrically
charging them, boosting them higher,
but it's not clear how the
effect would be big."
It must also be
noted that in 2012
just days before scientists
noted that baffling plumes,
Mars was again at opposition
and at the time was at its closest
proximity to Earth in over two years.
As we've noted several times,
it's been known for many years that when the
Earth's magnetotail passes over the moon
it causes electrostatic dust storms
and visible electrical discharges.
As noted by NASA
scientist Tim Stubbs,
"Earth's magnetotail extends well
beyond the orbit of the moon
and, once a month, the
moon orbits through it.
This can have consequences ranging from lunar
'dust storms' to electrostatic discharges."
It is a poignant commentary
on institutional science
that decade after decade
of similar discoveries
continue to provoke only
surprise and perplexity.
Yet the surprises are only met with
ad-hoc amendments to existing theories
rather than the development
of promising alternatives.
Alternatives which have been
waiting for many decades
in the fields of plasma physics
and electrical engineering.
Planets are "organisms" that interact
with their plasma environments
in incredibly dynamic ways.
A fact which only confirms that
we live in an electrically alive
and connected universe.

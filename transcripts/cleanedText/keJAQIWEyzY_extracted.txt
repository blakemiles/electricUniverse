In 2013 the SAFIRE
project was created.
The objective was to replicate the Sun's
atmosphere in a laboratory on Earth.
A lab was designed and built
and at its heart was the
SAFIRE plasma engine,
the only one of its
kind on the planet.
Okay we can see you and Colin
and you see me in the background
talking to you on the cell.
Today, four years later the SAFIRE
team gives a tour of the lab,
via the web to a scientific review panel
scattered all over North America.
Two things define SAFIRE:
a unique premise,
and a remarkably
powerful methodology.
The premise driving the project is the idea
that electricity plays an essential role
in the functioning of
the Sun's atmosphere.
The methodology used to build
and run the SAFIRE lab
comes from the world of
engineering and manufacturing.
It is a statistical procedure that
allows for incredibly precise control
over the design and
managing of experiments.
This combination of
premise and methodology
has yielded remarkable,
if not startling results.
In August of 2017 the SAFIRE team
presented its most recent discoveries
at the Electric Universe conference,
”Future Science” in Phoenix Arizona
You were just
listening to SAFIRE
and that's just the beginning.
So, SAFIRE has proven
itself to be capable
to contain, control and stabilize,
high energy dense plasmas.
And you're going to
see that tonight.
We're seeing chemistry changes;
we are slowing the
speed of light down;
we're seeing variations in electron density,
comparable to the photosphere-heliosphere;
and nuclear bombs.
Electrical confinement
of high-energy photons.
These are just some
of the things,
and all of these things here, are due
to charged plasma affecting matter
of a different
electrical potential.
So, this time I want to
take the opportunity,
which is usually saved until the end of
the presentation, because time is short,
to thank the other
very key members
who are contributing so much
the success of this endeavor.
So, first of all I like to thank

and pulling this presentation together.
And none of this would have started
without you David Talbott,
making that providential call to
persuade me to take on this project.
So now I would like to
introduce part of our team
who are joining me tonight to assist
in presenting our discoveries.
Please welcome Dr. Michael
Clarage and Dr. Paul Anderson
Research objectives:
there's a lot of detail to it but
fundamentally SAFIRE stands for:
Stellar Atmospheric
Function In Regulation;
the objective sounds
way out, there
but basically the contract says
we’re to do everything we can
to recreate a “Star in a Jar”
and test the Electric Universe
and test the electric Sun model.
So, the technology we're going to use
in SAFIRE or have been using in SAFIRE:
We have Floating Potential,
Plasma Potential, Plasma Density,
Ion Current Density, Electron
Energy Distribution,
Electron Temperature,
Mass Spectroscopy,
Optical Spectroscopy,
Thermal Measurements,
Infrared Thermography, Radio
Frequency Measurements,
Electromagnetic Measurements,
Scanning Electron Microscopy,
Optical Microscopy,
Voltage across the Plasma,
Current across the Plasma,
Voltage feeding the Plasma
Current feeding the Plasma, and Video
Capture of the Plasma Phenomena.
And we're going to discuss each one
of these with you in detail tonight;
just kidding.
What we will show you however,
is how we use this technology
to reveal some of the most startling
discoveries we made this year instead.
Now, Michael you're up.
- I'm up;
- Let's get started.
Optical spectroscopy.
So, Jim Ryder said
everything we know is from light
I'll think about that
but almost everything we know about
the Sun is definitely from light.
And optical spectroscopy is a
really good friend, as a scientist.
Every element emits very
characteristic frequencies;
a lot, you could imagine, like every
species of bird has its own song,
and you would never confuse a
chickadee with a seagull, right?
So, if you study these
elements spectrographically,
each one is quite unique,
and we can learn a lot about
what's going on for those atoms,
by things like the relative
heights of those spectral lines;
the widths of those spectral lines;
the shape of those spectral lines.
Here's three different discharge
regimes in our plasma.
On the left, you can see there's
the center anode, very bright
and then around
it is halo, okay.
Those are double layers
in a halo around that.
In the middle panel you can see that
the double layer is gone, right?
Just the center anode is there
and on the right-hand panel
we basically just cranked
all the dials up to 11
and that got a super
high-powered discharge.
You can see there, that's our
spectrographic probe tip
it's a fiber optic that we can move
around anywhere we want in the chamber,
to study what's going on.
And so right there, that fiber-optic tip
is looking right into the double layer.
Okay it's not looking at the anode,
it's looking at the double layer.
The next one the
double layer is gone
so the probe tip is just looking
at the general plasma discharge.
And then the last one
we moved the probe,
but it's looking at this super
high power discharge.
So, we'll just look at
one spectrographic line.
This is like one note.
One note being emitted
by the hydrogen, okay.
It's the 656 nanometer line,
one of the most famous spectrographic
lines in the universe.
And we can measure
the width of that,
and inside the double layer we see
the width is 0.12 nanometers, okay?
That's pretty tiny; these are
pretty good instruments we have.
We boosted the resolution spectrographically
by about a factor of 4 or 5, just recently.
So we're getting...
it's good right?
That's pretty good resolution.
Then the double layer goes away.
The width of that line, same
line, hydrogen emission,
the width goes down
to 0.07 nanometers
and then for the third one, the super-high
power one, it jumps back up to 0.09.
This made us super excited to be
able to see this and measure this.
Because one of the reasons these
lines can change their shape like this,
and get broader and more narrow,
is the number of free electrons
running around in the plasma
and if there's a lot of free
electrons running around the plasma,
you can kind of picture that they're
crashing into hydrogen atoms,
and causing extra wobbles on top
of the note that's being emitted,
that tends to broaden
the line more, okay.
That may seem like a small change, you
know, 0.05 nanometers from 0.12 to 0.07,
but that represents like 50 to 100 times
change in the free electron density.
So double layers have
within them about 100 times
more free electrons running
around than not, okay.
This is super exciting
that we can measure this.
If you just stick in a probe into one
place, and you get one measurement,
you're not necessarily so sure you can
guarantee what you're looking at.
But if you can measure
changes like this,
then you have much more
confidence as a scientist,
that you're actually observing
something that you can talk about.
And where do we see
comparable changes, you know,
in free electron density?
Well, we see those changes going from
the photosphere to the chromosphere,
from the chromosphere to the corona
out at the end of the heliopause.
So, we're actually getting
into the realm where we have
changing conditions in our chamber,
and the ability to measure them,
that are also going
on in our star.
That summarizes that.
Yeah, it’s too early to stop.
Do you think it's too early?
I think it's too early to stop.
I think they're just
absorbing right now.
So we'll just take a
breath and keep going?
Sure you can take a
breath, I'll keep going.
Okay.
It’s not always this
much fun in the lab.
Some more yelling and screaming
going on, things like this.
So, the next section is where we get
into the fun part: statistics, okay.
But it's really,
really important,
because Design Of Experiments
(DOE), actually is the mainstay.
It's the foundation of the
work that we're doing,
because in science today there's a
lot of stuff that's in question,
and we're not going to be subject
to those kinds of questions.
So we impose what's called
Design of Experiments
and Dr. Paul Anderson is going to take you
through what we've been doing with SAFIRE
and I think you're going to be amazed
about some of the findings with them,
all right. Thank You, Monty.
So just as Monty said,
we want to investigate some basic plasma
physics that is occurring in our chamber.
The first thing we did,
was in looking at our chamber,
was that we wanted to
tame the plasma, okay.
And I'm going to show you first a video
here, of the plasma as we know it now.
We can move the cathodes as you can
see, we can stabilize double layers,
we can change the double layers
as a function of distance.
At the same time we can also change gas
concentration and type of gas in there.
It wasn't always that pretty;
some of our initial plasmas were
pretty dirty, very unstable.
If you look at a lot of old plasma literature
before they even named it a plasma,
they commented on how difficult it was to
contain this energy, and understand it.
So, these are some of
our initial discharges.
Lots of impurities on some of the
materials that we use for the anode;
striking different discharges;
a lot of instabilities
in the plasma.
And what we wanted, we eventually
wanted it to look like this. Right?
This is a very simple plasma,
which entails a simple anode on
the left, and a cathode on right,
and this is
basically a 1D plasma
where you're striking a discharge
between these two electrodes.
You can adjust the gas pressure,
the gas type in this,
as well as the
voltage in this system.
Fairly straightforward.
This is a top view of SAFIRE;
it's not as straightforward
as the plasma tube.
This is looking down on SAFIRE
from Monty's model here,
and as Monty listed previously,
all the instruments that we have,
we have them there
for a reason,
and every single run we use all the
control instrumentation for the chamber
as well as driving all the
detection that Monty mentioned.
So there's a number
of detectors on here
as well as the fundamental
control of the chamber.
So, through a lot of data
acquisition and controlling,
we're able to now control that plasma
chamber and carry out experiments.
So, one of the first things we had
to confront is how to drive it
and understanding the gas input like this
is just one aspect of the gas input here.
This is the gas and
vacuum control system.
We also had to
understand our SOPs,
to implement safety procedures
when you're working with
2,000 liters of hydrogen at
high temperature, right?
So, we had a number
of things to control,
in addition to wanting
to control the plasma.
So, we looked in a literature and we
talked about it and we said okay,
well learning to drive this, let's
concentrate on plasma experiments
that are well documented and that's
why we came up with Paschen’s law.
We decided to choose
Paschen’s law to understand
the plasma ignition in
the SAFIRE apparatus.
So, Paschen’s law describes a point of current
flow at a particular electric potential
through an ionizable gas, or gas
between two electrodes, okay.
So, fundamentally we have two
electrodes, positive and negative;
you have a gas, you have a
certain pressure of that gas,
usually conducted under vacuum,
and you have a distance between those
electrodes and you strike a voltage
and there's no current flow initially,
until you get to a certain point
where that voltage can overcome
ionized gas and conduct a current.
Now, when that occurs,
(there) is a certain voltage.
Okay, so we decided
to do that in SAFIRE.
So, this is a classic
Paschen curve in hydrogen.
The other gases also have other
curves that are very similar.
They exhibit the same minimum;
so if you notice here in the
graph, or X-axis here,
being a term of PD,
pressure and distance.
Notice it's in a
logarithmic scale.
So, it's a reduced variable, you have
both pressure and distance in one axis.
In our Y-axis, we have our voltage
that we strike to obtain a discharge.
So, if you go ahead and do a bunch of plots at
different pressures at different distances,
you'll end up falling on a curve
like this for your electrodes.
So, what we did in SAFIRE we went
ahead and did a SAFIRE apparatus
with a spherical anode and our two cathodes
at various distances, equidistant.
As much as we wanted to vary both
of them, we kept them constant.
And we discovered already SAFIRE
is acting very differently
than a typical plasma
discharge apparatus.
We had to use a modified version of
Paschen's curve which you see there,
of the law, and we also found that the gamma
term which is in that lower denominator,
in the denominator, that did
adjust with different distances,
and so that's something
new that we're exploring,
and we hope to get a
publication out of this.
So you'll notice that
already we have a departure
from regular plasma physics in a
regular anode-cathode discharge;
say a discharge tube.
Another reason why we did this
is, okay we ignited the plasma,
but what is the
morphology of the plasma,
what does it look like at
these various settings?
So it's kind of an experiment with
killing two birds with one stone,
in that we determine the
ignition characteristics,
which we needed to
control the plasma,
and we also explored the
morphology of the plasma.
So, that was a very powerful
thing: we were able to pursue
some various regimes and then
establish our Design Of Experiments.
So, we discovered that
the configuration
is a significant departure
from typical plasma apparatus,
that you may have from its
typical anode and cathode.
So then we went into the
Design Of Experiments.
We decided on where we're going to look,
what kind of plasma regimes we want,
because ultimately we want to dial
in stability for experiments.
There's no use in doing
experiments for double layers
if they appear for one
microsecond and then go away.
We wanted them nice and stable.
Now to obtain stability
in any system,
whether it's in SAFIRE or whether
it's in your kitchen, baking bread
we, need reproducible results.
But that only comes from
understanding your factors;
factor is another
word for variable.
So, to understand those factors and
variables, you need more experiments, right?
Traditionally this is called
the Edisonian approach:
you have more factors, you do more
experiments, you get more data.
The problem with that is, that just
because you do more experiments,
you might not be
increasing the resolution.
In other words, the
signal-to-noise.
The signal-to-noise that
you're looking for;
you need to increase that
signal from the noise,
so you get reproducible results,
and you know you're stable.
And what Design Of Experiments
does, it's a methodology.
It increases the resolution,
but also it decreases the number
of experiments you have to do.
So, I urge many of you who are
experimentalists, or who are curious,
to look up Design Of Experiments
and to learn the techniques.
Because it is extremely valuable
in both saving time and resources
and it greatly increases
your resolution.
Now, again I won't
go into why that is.
I discuss a little bit of it in my past
presentation and you can read about it online,
but basically what you're doing
is, you're conducting experiments
where you're making sure
your points are orthogonal.
So, in other words two factors
are always opposite each other;
you're making things symmetric
in your design space.
Just an example of what
that does for you:
on the on the right column here,
you can see the efficiency.
That's a measure of the
experimental variance.
You can actually calculate the
variance in your experiment,
prior to even doing
experiments with your design.
Now OFAT is stands for One
Factor At a Time.
That's how traditional
experimentation is done;
that's how the Edisonian
approach is done.
And so, you can see here, it's comparison
between a traditional number of runs,
where you're kind of a shotgun
approach to experimentation,
and what's called a
full factorial DOE.
There are many types of DOE’s out there, but
this is just the most basic taught DOE.
You can see that just with
three factors, right?
say pressure, type of gas, and
distance of the cathodes, right?
that's three factors, three
variables
with the number of runs for
OFAT you need 16 runs,
that gives you a certain experimental
variance, or efficiency, of 2.
But you're half that number of
runs with your full factorial DOE.
And as you get upwards, now you say, wow
128 runs, that's still a lot of runs.
But as I said, there are other DOE formulations
that you can pursue to help with this,
to help decrease that number more and still
maintain that experimental efficiency,
without having to
do 512 experiments.
So, in a nutshell that's
really what DOE is.
We explored this first in phase
1; this is our phase 1 setup.
Very simple; we had an anode in a
bell jar surrounded by a cathode;
we had a voltmeter did add some other
instrumentation crammed in there.
But for the purposes of this,
this was a just a snapshot
of one of the bell jar
experiments with a small anode.
And really what we determined
through Design Of Experiments
is these various regimes that
the plasma goes through.
So, we were already kind of dialing in
the anode, even in a small bell jar,
so logic would assume we could do
that when we scale up as well.
And actually it does, when
you use the right approach,
when you use Designs
Of Experiments.
So, we're really happy
with our various regimes.
This is a snapshot of, I would say,
the main regimes we work with.
That's not to say that there
aren't others in between there.
So, I'll just go through here a
little bit and show you close up.
I call this a dark
quiescent phase;
this is right on the edge, very small
changes here, this is not stable.
Very small changes in either voltage or
current, can lead to this extinguishing.
But there is still a plasma layer
around the edge of the anode.
Now as we increase our current,
we obtain what we call ”tufts”
These are anode tufts.
These have been
experimentally seen before,
but we can now control them,
we can control the number,
the concentration in a square area, and
they're always equidistant from each other.
As you increase the energy, and as you
increase the current in the system,
they start to grow in size
and also squeeze together,
until you reach a point where
they actually start to coalesce.
And this is what we refer
to as moving tufts.
This can also be adjusted in
terms of pressure and current.
So, as these things start to
move, they actually spin more,
and eventually what comes into
being is this double layer phase,
multiple double layers, that are controlled
by current and gas pressure.
So this was probably the most
double layers we obtained,
I would say, with a
three inch anode.
This is a 3-inch anode.
This is a 3-inch anode so those tufts, I
think we reached up to about 7 or 8 tufts
at least in the Design Of
Experiments that we got.
Monty: “Yeah they're big”,
and they're stable
and also we have
quiescent phase:
this looks familiar, doesn't it?
We even got some holes in that,
arising from something,
we don't know.
And that layer is
fairly significant.
It stands off the
surface of the anode,
and we also have these asymmetric
double layers that occur over time.
Time is also a factor, but we
weren't able to quantify it yet
because what happens over
time, is your anode heats up.
Thermionic emission happens,
it changes the properties
so that's the one factor that we
have to dial in a little bit more.
As we don't understand the effect
of time on this anode yet,
but we know it affects it.
And also the Zeppelin high-intensity,
kind of let it loose phase.
So, those are stable
regimes, all right,
so to dial in the plasma, also we
want to work with different anodes,
different size anodes.
The top is a 1.5 cm [errata: inches, see 26:16]
anode, the bottom is a 3-inch anode.
You'll notice that we're
obtaining the same regimes;
a little bit different shapes, but for the
most part we're getting the same numbers,
and at proportionally
the same current.
And what do I mean
by proportionately?
Well, when you're impinging a 1.5-inch
anode compared to a 3-inch anode,
the current density is a
lot higher on that, right?
So, we had to adjust our current density
properly to obtain the same response.
So, that's what we did in this experiment,
and these are just some numbers.
If you want to have
fun with the numbers,
we're calculating that we're getting
about 85 W/cm2 in the top discharge,
but you can see in the bottom
one, where we throw in 22 Amps,
we're getting a little bit less
wattage there with the calculation,
but within error
you're almost there.
So we're tracking very well with scalability
of the plasma between different sizes
and as you can see, the
current is the main driver,
that's what has to be adjusted.
Now you say here, I may say
indications of a transformer.
Well that's only in a way.
That's why we have it in quotes right?
Transformer.
So, as double layers form,
plasma resistance decreases and
current flow is less impeded.
Michael alluded to that earlier:
electrons are more intense or more
concentrated in these double layers.
Why is that?
We want to study some more.
But now is where we get
into our statistics.
What you see on the graph is
an actual by predicted plot.
This is what comes out of
Design Of Experiments, okay?
It may just look like a straight line
to you, but this is very powerful,
because what it enables you to
do is to predict things, okay?
So, the top graph here has,
as you can see on the Y-axis
or the vertical axis
(thank you),
on a vertical axis you
have voltage actuals.
So that's the voltage
we actually measure
and what do you see here?
voltage predicted.
So, when you read papers
scientific papers,
or any kind of reports that have prediction
values, that's what they're referring to.
They're building a model and they're seeing
how well the model can predict the voltage,
or whatever response
they're studying.
So, we can look here that the equation
of the line is pretty darn good,
considering the fact that we're
working with a plasma, okay?
it's R-Square
value is about 0.92.
You look at the error, it's only plus
or minus 10 Volts in that prediction.
We had a number of responses,
or a number of observations
in this set of experiments,
31 experiments.
So, we have sufficient
degrees of freedom,
when we're only looking at
three or four factors,
to determine which of
the factors do what.
We want to know, is pressure
a factor,
is the number of double layers
a factor, current, right?
And that's what this is, so you
can see here the green circle.
The parameter estimates are what
you'd back out of statistics.
That tells you the most
important factor in your model,
and what is this telling us?
It’s telling us the pressure is
actually a pretty darn important thing
in this Design Of Experiments.
So, your pressure is leading those
significant changes in your voltage.
Kind of
makes sense, right?
Followed by your number
of double layers.
Now double layers, and we're
struggling with this right now,
double layers can either be a response
or it can also affect the system.
Just like V = IR, the typical
Ohm's law V = IR
what is your response and
what is your factor?
It depends on how you set
up your measurements,
and it depends on what
you're measuring.
So, our current though, is also an
important factor, as you can see there:
parameter estimate of about 10,
but you see these other
things down here.
The pressure is multiplied by
the number of double layers
and the number of double layers
is multiplied by current.
These are what's known as second-order interactions,
higher-order interactions right here.
And what that means is that
they also have an effect
and they're needed to
explain the model.
They're significant enough to
be needed to explain the model.
Actually I left this last one in
here; you see that 0.14 p value
p-value is a measure
of statistic.
That one is below 0.05,
that means that that parameter is
significant, it's real in a model.
You should definitely include it
so that one's 0.15-ish and so
that's not a significant factor.
I just left that in there,
just so you could see,
but all the other ones are
significant, they're below 0.05.
So, pressure exerts the largest
effect, followed by double layers
and the second-order interactions
decrease that voltage response.
Again, what happens, what
can we do now with that?
That's just a bunch of numbers.
How do we visualize what
happens in a dynamic system?
And that's where modern software
and modern computers come in,
because they enable us to do
these Designs Of Experiments.
So, as we create double layers,
what you see here on this graph,
you have three factors which are
your X-axis which you can vary now.
We have a model that's
about 92% accurate,
and we also have a voltage, our
predictive voltage in our system.
So as we change these factors we can
observe what happens through the voltage,
so if you keep your eyes on
the number of double layers
I'm going to increase the
number of double layers here.
Now what happens to
the other curves?
There's slope changes right?
I'm going back and forth here.
So, if the slope changes, that means
that there's a second-order interaction.
There's a higher-order interaction
between all these factors.
What it also means is that this model
says, that if we change our current,
or our pressure,
does the voltage change?
No, it doesn't according
to the model.
Now one statistician said
“all models are wrong,
but some are useful”.
So, that's where
we're at right now.
But you can also see
something else.
You can see the unfortunate
area here that says,
hey you've got to do more
experiments there.
That's a confidence interval,
it doesn't have enough data to give
you a smaller confidence interval.
So this curve could actually
come down a little bit
as long as it’s within
the confidence interval.
But that's the power of
Design Of Experiments:
you wouldn't be able
to plot this out
if you were to do one factor at
a time in a shotgun approach.
So again, I changed
another factor here.
I decrease the current so you can see
the spread in the confidence interval
across all these guys here.
So we have a little
bit more work to do.
That's the end of a kind of plasma,
physics, stability and spectroscopy.
I don't know; you feel
like keep it going,
or you want a question and
answer session for a little bit?
Okay, let's move on.
Monty: Let's move on,
well, predictions in thermodynamics,
like Paul was saying,
what did you say about models?
All models are wrong,
some are useful.
Yeah, all models are
wrong, some are useful.
I stood up here two years
ago, we spent a lot of money
developing and designing SAFIRE,
predicting the kind of thermal
responses we get out of this.
Because we knew we had a lot
of energy, of 180 kilowatts.
That’s what the design was
predicting at the time,
and the thermodynamics model is based
on what's called total heat flux.
You heat up the core, okay?
And I'll show you a
picture of that.
Well the thermal response
is 120 degrees Celsius,
but basically we
heat up the core
and we put an certain amount of
energy in there that heats up the gas
and other things are starting to
respond, but the final response,
based on the design, is a 110
degree chamber temperature,
and the temperature in and
around the core here...
I think I can do this,
there it is.....
would be about 2500
degrees Celsius.
And this also is telling you
how fast the gas is moving.
It's moving quite slowly, and
that's what we were predicting.
Now the people who are working on this,
would be guys like Dr. Lowell Morgan,
Tommy Mello who actually
develops the coding
for what's called
computational fluid dynamics.
This is really high-end stuff,
it's stuff that we use to develop
to do analysis on, rocket engines and
jet engines, and so many other things.
And we're very good
at what we do.
This is how we kind
of make a living.
However you're going to find out
that our predictions were wrong.
So, we did another model and this here,
what you're going to look at here,
right in this area here,
this is our analysis of
putting in one of our probes
and see what the kind of
thermal response that we get,
and what the model is telling us is that
the temperatures of the gas,
just off and around the
surface of the anode,
should be around 2,300 to
2,500 degrees Celsius:
well within the constraints or you might
say the operating limits of tungsten,
which is what the tips are made
of, our Langmuir probe tips.
But what really happened, and
you want to watch this video.
Show you here, what you're
looking at here is the probe tip
and we're going to play this video
and this is a very low-power plasma
[Laughter]
So, where you say,
“now you see it,
and now you don't.”
Langmuir probes are about
8,000 bucks a pop,
and I had to make a telephone
call because we pull it out.
Before I get into that, I just want to let
you know the actual power at that time
was 182 Watts, that's a 182
Watt light bulb imagine, okay?
and we're going like,
what is going on.
So when we opened up SAFIRE,
we discovered what was left,
and this is what the tip looked
like after it vaporized.
This is just the residual tungsten you
see here, on that kind of nodule.
That's what was left of it, and everyone
who knows anything about tungsten,
it takes about
6,600º C to boil it.
To vaporize it, you
need more energy,
and in thermodynamics, some
of you probably already know,
there's a time domain
associated with it.
How much heat is lost
in the system as well.
So, it's not just 6,600 degrees;
if you're gonna
vaporize it that quick,
it would typically point to temperatures
that are much higher than that,
not the 2,300 degrees
we predicted,
because you know the tungsten
should have heated up,
might have started glowing a little
bit, but it should have lived in there.
Well, obviously it didn't, and
this is what a tip looks like
at the top, before and after.
Now, the white stuff is alumina
and its melting temperature
is about 3,600 degrees Celsius.
So, I made a call.
Actually, I should back up a little bit
here because I got a story to tell you.
I called a company,
a great company.
I'm not going to
mention who it is.
We had gone into great
detail with them,
as to what kind of process
we were going to get.
And they said, “We have
the probe for you.”
And so we bought two of the
probes and we put the one in
and I showed him, he talked to me
and I said, “this is what happened”
we showed them what was left of the
probe tip and he came back and said,
“Your plasma is too hot”.
I said, ”Really, you think”?
I said, ”You guys knew and
understood the plasma we have,
and we went over this
with you guys in detail”
and I'm thinking, “What am
I going to tell Scott?”
Then these guys say, “Let me know
when you like to buy a new one”.
So, I called Scott
and I told him,
”We just vaporized a Langmuir probe
and we did it with only 182 Watts,
and we don't understand what's going on
in SAFIRE; it shouldn't have done this.”
And Scott says, ”Wow, you
know what that means?”
I’m thinking, I
just lost my job.
”Yeah it means that our
thermodynamic modeling is wrong.”
I'm thinking “I'm
out of my job”,
and he says,
“Well, yes, maybe,
but what's amazing, it means that you have a
lot of energy impinging on the probe tip.
You might have an effective
way of boiling water”
and the he said, in his
deep voice “Do it again”.
I'm going nuts: the (probe) guy
just said, my plasma is too hot.
The boss is saying, do it again
and I'm thinking I'm gonna have to
spend another $8,000 on probes.
These things like eight thousand, I
said eight thousand bucks a pop,
we got to get control
over this thing.
Because otherwise you know we're going
to burn through money pretty quick,
so we decide to make a new one.
Bigger, stronger.
I'll put higher pressure nitrogen
into the core and cool the core
and make all of it ceramic to
withstand the temperatures.
That's going to work,
so that's it.
That's the new and improved Langmuir
probe, much bigger, thicker tip
we figured that, since the
plasma is so intense,
we don't have to worry
about the small wire.
We'll put something in thicker
and even get some measurements.
What really happened... again.
So, I'm going to
play a video here,
and this is where we got some serious
questions and Lowell got involved.
Just watch what happens here:
this is a macro lens.
Everything looks wonderful
and good; we're happy.
Adiós!
Yes, that’s what we said.
Well, we’ve lived so far; that's
good, let's just keep it going....
The motion I can see in the probe, is
from the forces that are in the plasma
and then it really did
some amazing stuff.
So, we were happy,
it actually survived
but the thermionic emissions
which we're going to get into,
that's what you call
thermionic emission.
That's not, you might say, the plasma;
the plasma has gone out by now,
so this is just a radiation.
This is like when you light
a tungsten light bulb.
This is what you get, so the
radiation here just grows immensely.
We don't know right now
why the color changes,
we know that we're obviously
getting other emissions in here,
probably from the tungsten, and this
is happening in like nanoseconds.
So we go from this beautiful
violet color to these colors;
we don't know what this stuff is
that's flying around in there.
We think it could be copper
and/or iron or whatever.
We were able to capture
some of these images,
but we would have to say that the
atmosphere in SAFIRE is somewhat hostile.
What was interesting is the
crater on the side of the anode.
So, we decided, well you know what,
let's take a closer look at this thing,
because we were still getting information
back from the tip, which is good news
and so this is what tungsten looks like
after it's been machined with diamonds.
It has a kind of a sintered
look to it, a powdery look,
and this is what the tip looked like
after we pulled it out of the chamber.
So, we're seeing some cracking within the
alumina a little bit; we weren't too concerned.
The bright blue color was
kind of interesting,
but we had a closer
look at the tip,
and we were seeing the grinding
marks from the diamond wheel.
We didn't see any physical
deterioration of the tip,
and that was just
great news for us.
And we thought, okay we've got something
that looks like it's going to survive;
and we took a look at the alumina and
it looks like it will start to melt,
so we knew that the temperature was around
3,600 degrees, maybe a little hotter,
but still in good shape.
And then what I did,
is I just took my pliers and
we changed the probe up;
we just retained and I put my
pliers and pull it out, and it crumbled.
If you know anything about tungsten
it doesn't normally just crumble
and I thought well we you know
we've got a bit of a problem here
so I put it under
the microscope.
I looked at it and I said that
doesn't look like tungsten;
comparatively to the two, there's
been a huge change in its structure,
but not on the outside.
The surface on the outside just
looked like it was when we put it in.
So, we started taking
a closer look at this
and it was like, what is
all this white stuff.
And you can see the fracture in the
tungsten is very sharp; it's very clean;
it's not like we've bent it
or anything, it just broke.
So, we decided and this
one Paul got involved;
he says, listen I know some guys
on the University of Toronto;
let's get this thing and get some
scanning electron microscopy done.
So, we did and I'm going over
the material in the tungsten.
If you know anything about materials,
what you're looking at here,
well the black stuff,
could be contamination,
but the kind of geometrical
shapes that you see there,
above that other stuff that
looks like shale, is tungsten.
It looks like it was
getting melted.
That shale isn't how
it normally looks,
but this is on the
inside of the tip.
On the outside of the tip it
wasn't being affected at all.
Not at all.
When we did the scanning, when we did the
SEM, it was coming back it was tungsten.
the molecular structure, the crystalline
structure, looked just like it should.
We looked inside and this is what
we found, and we found a lot more.
So, we took a look at the anode,
that big crater that
was left on the side.
There's some interesting stuff.
It was kind of like, okay there's an intense
plasma discharge kind of steel material.
So, we thought okay,
this is kind of like,
you know, it's
really cool artwork.
We didn't see anything that was
kind of, you know, too outrageous.
We saw this area here and I thought,
well let's take a closer look.
I don't know why, I
just picked a spot,
and I thought what the
heck is that nodule
at center of the top of that
mountain that's in the crater here?
And this is what the scanning
electron microscopy showed up.
Now, if you know anything about this,
when you have really bright spots in SEM,
it usually means you have really heavy
materials in there, heavy elements,
and they start to emit.
So, now I'm going to
head back to Paul,
and he's going to go through SEM
and tell you what we found.
Thank you, Monty.
So, scanning
electron microscopy.
There's also an additional
technique on here:
energy dispersive spectroscopy
and what I'll do is I'll
show you a quick slide on
where that energy dispersive
spectroscopy comes in.
I should have had a slide on the
scanning electron microscope as well,
but if you picture just a regular
optical microscope that you can find.
You look through the top and it
goes through a series of lenses;
the light comes up from the bottom,
through your sample and you can see it.
And really the way SEM works, is that you
replace your eye with an electron source,
an electron gun that gets shot
through a series of magnetic lenses,
which then hits your sample, which is
mounted and again this happens in a vacuum,
and then a detector
is off to the side
to detect the electrons I
bounce off your sample.
So, not only do you get a secondary electron
image if you will, an emitted image,
but you also get other stuff
coming off of that as well.
So, if you have the right detectors
in your electron microscope,
you can detect other things.
And in this case, energy
dispersive microscopy,
is where the beam
hits the material
and more of the inner core
electrons get excited,
and then relax back
and emit the X-rays.
So, you see these characteristic X-rays,
it’s just a depiction of an atom,
that electron gets excited, gets
bumped off and then relaxes down
and emits that
characteristic X-ray.
So, each element
has a fingerprint,
much like spectroscopy that
Michael was speaking about.
It's another technique
to look at elemental
quantities in materials
in an electron microscope.
So, clean iron: this is
just the iron anode.
We're going to look at both the iron
anode, as well as the tungsten tip here.
So, what do you get
from clean iron?
You get a slide here;
this is the probe tip.
You can adjust that to be a line graph, or
an area; you can integrate over an area.
In this case, we were just looking to see
what was there, so we did the probe tip.
And you can see that
the composition,
the oxygen comes from surface
oxygen absorbed on it.
You have your silicon
and manganese as well,
which are impurities in your
iron, but mostly iron.
You can see there:
almost 98% iron.
And you get that from these
characteristic X-ray energies.
These energies are in
Kilo Electron Volts,
and again each atom, each element has a
characteristic series of frequencies
that it will emit at certain
electron impingement energy levels.
So, another clean iron spectrum.
We did a series of these, just to look,
kind of get a feel for the average here.
In this case, there's a lot of oxygen on
this one, which is not too surprising.
Sometimes you get
lots of oxygen.
So, going back to Monty's
original optical spectroscope:
here you can see this nodule;
and the secondary electron image
here, you can see this lighting up.
It can either be
heavier, it can also be
something that doesn't
conduct electrons very well;
so it brightens a lot.
It can emit electrons;
it charges.
So what Monty did actually, Monty
did all this microscopy here.
He put the probe actually
on that nodule first.
And what did we see?
We see some of these other elements here,
namely aluminum and oxygen, a lot more oxygen,
so that's kind of in line
with aluminum oxide.
It could be something
from the probe.
It could be something, some dust particle
from the probe that's embedded in there.
But there's also these
other amounts in there.
We saw manganese before.
There’s titanium,
there's also cerium.
Cerium might be an impurity
from that probe housing.
But then, when you increase
your magnification
and you go look at the morphology
of the crater around this material,
it gets a little bit unusual,
in that we are finding barium,
significant amounts of barium.
We also saw the other
materials as well,
that you would associate with
the alumina from the probe tip,
but it's also dispersed
in that crater.
But, nonetheless a lot of elements
there that weren't originally there.
Now, in the same way we can
look at the tungsten probe tip
and we look at the
clean probe tip:
the aluminum, the silicon,
probably from the housing, right?
It’s got alumina around
the actual metal.
We also detect sodium
and potassium.
I put in a question mark, because
that could come from contamination;
it could come from whatever
the preparation was.
And then we have ytterbium (Yb).
That was also a shoulder
peak on a few of these.
So, it might be peak overlap, or it could
be real; we need higher resolution.
Then we start to see some other
elements here, such as cobalt, tin.
Copper is probably from the cathode, but
this is the inside of the tungsten probe.
So, it could be contamination, or it
could be there from other mechanisms.
We don't know, we got
to do more experiments.
Electron microscopy
is very selective:
I spent many years doing
electron microscopy
and you can find anything you want in your
sample, to make your professors happy.
Not that I did that, but
I was very careful,
because that's exactly
what they taught me.
They taught me, listen you don't just take
a few pictures, you got to take a lot.
You got to go through it, so that you're
representing your sample honestly.
And that's something
that we did:
we looked at a
lot of parts of this.
We still need to
do more experiments;
one set of experiments
is never enough,
especially when you're
doing elemental analysis.
So, obviously, we need
some more verification
and we got to think of where these
impurities could come from.
But looking back
at this micrograph
you see that this area
here is sintered.
And as a reminder,
like Monty said,
the melting point of
tungsten is around 3,600º C
- well, melting really.
Boiling is 6,600 right, yeah.
Now, our anode was
only at 1,000 C.
So, we have some temperature
disparities here.
We also have sintering
of the material;
we have stress fractures
here, along the grain boundaries
and we have this weird sintered kind of
explosion from the inside of the matrix.
So, again: impurities maybe?
Calcium, aluminum could arise
from alumina materials.
As far as we know there is no barium,
cerium, titanium in the chamber.
You look at all the
materials that go in;
the next step is looking at the
processing of the materials we use.
Maybe there are impurities in the
processing of materials that we use.
Highly likely not, because a lot
of these materials are very pure.
So we know what’s in the chamber,
we know there are impurities.
What we see in this analysis, we see
something that is not accounted for.
Now I'll go out on a limb here, I
mean there's a lot of data out there,
and take it for face value in the Low
Energy Nuclear Reaction (LENR) community
that has done a number of
studies on transmutation.
A lot of the craters that they observe and
that they see transmutation occurring in,
have the same kind
of characteristics.
They actually come out from
the lattice of the material.
Now they work a lot with palladium
and platinum and noble metals
that are highly
loaded with hydrogen.
So, they load these
things up with hydrogen
and then they observe these reactions that
occur over time, and they're very minute.
Very small changes in the overall
concentration of materials.
Nonetheless they are real, because
they can pinpoint these craters,
they can analyze the materials they’re in,
and they see these changes happening.
So, these are just a few select
papers, recent ones that came out
with some transmutation reports.
Commercial enterprises have
repeated this as well.
Mitsubishi, and recently Toyota
replicated Mitsubishi studies
here with some of
their R&D investment,
seeing that there's transmutation
in certain complexes.
So, validation of results.
As I said, one data
set isn't enough,
especially when you're dealing
with certain kinds of reactions.
At the University of Toronto
I am going to follow up,
using laser ablation-inductively
coupled mass spectrometry.
So, that's pretty much the SEM.
But now instead of just doing a probe and
looking at the X-ray energies coming off
you're actually going to laser
ablate, or laser vaporize materials
that are in certain areas
that you highlight,
that is then analyzed with a mass spectrometer,
a very accurate mass spectrometer.
So, this is a technique that the Toyota
folks used to validate Mitsubishi's results
and will hopefully eventually return,
and do augmented studies on,
not only the anode but possibly
other parts of the reactor.
We're about to pause
now again, if we want.
Yeah, go ahead, yeah, sure,
you need the microphone,
you need the microphone.
“We know that in the Sun will happen,
in the nuclear reaction that happen is,
hydrogen the main
fuel in the top,
and reach a million degrees
in the solar corona.
So, what do you aim,
what temperature do you aim
to reach in the container.
What kind of container?
Is it going to be a
magnetic container,
like the one that they use,
or are trying to use now?
We were actually going to
talk about that,
because the temperatures that we're seeing
right now, there are two responses.
And why I was talking about
the thermodynamics,
is because right now, standard
thermodynamics cannot
answer for why we're
getting some of these, for
what you would see, for what
we call, “thermal responses”.
So, think of your
microwave at home.
In fact, the energy you are putting in there
isn’t thermal, like a convection oven,
but you can still heat up
materials that are in there.
So, the kind of energies that
we're going to be getting into,
we're going to be talking
about this very shortly,
would be analogous to
that kind of thing.
So temperature,...
... that's a whole discussion and
we can get into what temperature is
in the context of plasma physics,
which isn't, you might say, standard,
thermal or black body radiation
kind of responses that you got.
So, the temperatures that
we're seeing here, would be
looks like (they are) orders of
magnitude beyond what we predicted,
in layman's terms.
But in real terms
it's not a thermal
temperature in that context.
We're going to be
getting into this.
Okay, another question?
Well presumably, you were going to use
your probe to test different things,
but then your probe
got destroyed.
Does that mean you've
been kind of sidetracked
into to figuring out what's
going on to the probe,
before you get on to what you're
going to use the probe for?
Well, obviously, you have
to look at the failure mode
to determine what it is you're
going to be doing next.
And we're already looking
at that, so
we take a look at the actual time component
that it took in order for this to happen.
So, the amount of time it took for
the probe to see this much damage,
is about 15-20 seconds,
which if anybody who knows anything
about TIG (Tungsten Inert Gas) welding,
that's not a very long time,
because normally some of the arcs
that you get in TIG welders,
and this is type of
tungsten we're using,
you could weld for half an
hour, or maybe even an hour,
before you have to take
the tip out and grind it.
But we weren't seeing any
deterioration on the tip.
This is internal.
We got big questions here; this
shouldn't be happening in that context.
So, those temperatures, in
some of the TIG welding,
the arc itself can
reach 19,000 degrees.
So, [we could be seeing], the responses that
we're getting here are an indication of
much higher temperatures.
So now, what does that mean?
Well, we did get the tip
and in we did get it out.
And it was in one piece, and
we were still getting data.
So, what we have to do now, is come
up with a way to get a controller
that, as we move it down through those
double layers, and back out again,
we can collect the data and bias the probe
quickly, we are talking milliseconds,
and grab that data and get the heck
out of Dodge before she gets smoked.
Okay, that's what we have to do,
and that's not going to be easy,
because you get into floating potentials,
and other types of technologies,
which to do that, there’s
going to be some challenges.
One more?
Yeah, okay maybe one more.
It might be a quick question,
may not be long one.
It's really quick.
As a control, did you look
at the probe by SEM before?
I know you looked after,
but did you look before?
Yeah, we have one shot of
the probe tip in there;
the standard tungsten,
like I showed.
No, I see tungsten;
we didn't show the
graph, but we did do it.
Yeah, we use different types
of tungsten you can get,
with thorium and a bunch of other
types of elements that are in there.
Though this was just
a pure tungsten tip.
So, I mean 99.5%
or 99.9% tungsten.
Okay, let's move on.
So, now we're going to get into the
measurement of the plasma and double layers.
Data that we were able to get
from the probes once we got them
to a place we could use them.
So, we found quite by accident
what appeared to be a small voltage
drop, just off the surface of the anode
and according to our research
objectives, we were supposed to find.
But it wasn't much at all.
We saw initially about a 30 Volt
drop, just off the surface,
but it got us to thinking that maybe
the probe tip is just too long.
And so, these are
the double layers,
and this is not scaled properly,
but just to show
you how it works.
So the tungsten tip that you see
there, between the two red marks,
is the length of the tip
that's exposed to the plasma.
And that's actually what picks up
the electrical characteristics
of the plasma that's
measuring it.
So, as you can see right here
between the two red lines
there's a few double
layers that are in there.
And what happens
in effect is that,
because the tip is long and it's
measuring a few double layers,
we think what we get is more of an
average of what the voltage is.
It's measuring across those.
So, we decided well let's
just shorten it down.
And so, we did,
and when we did, basically,
this is what we saw:
and the voltage drop here
was almost 300 Volts.
It was 270 Volts, I think
or something wasn't it?
And the distance was
0.03 millimeters.
It's really thin, okay?
But it's a very
powerful double layer.
So, we've done the test a number of times and
we validated this particular measurement;
this sharp voltage drop.
The actual curve coming off of
the back, can vary a little bit,
but the sharp voltage
drop that you see here,
is typical of all the plots
we're seeing in SAFIRE.
So, we can confidently
say today,
in fact there is a sharp voltage
drop that Dr. Donald Scott predicted
and that is in fact
what we're seeing here.
And it's pretty big.
So, with that, this is where
Michael is going to take over,
because he was doing
some analysis on this
and this is getting into
his area of expertise.
You get all the fun stuff.
I do.
So, we can look at global
properties of the plasma,
the discharge,
electrical properties,
or we can also look at properties at
a particular point in the plasma.
So, what Monty just talked
through with the Langmuir probe,
that's because we're trying to get measurements
at particular points in the plasma.
But it's also worthwhile
knowing and analyzing
what's going on with a
discharge as a whole.
So, here's plots of current and
voltage across the whole discharge
and you can see in the bottom
some pictures of what's going on
in the chamber at that point.
So, at Point A, we have a
pretty quiet discharge,
with a few anode tufts on there.
Then we crank up the current.
What happens?
The plasma responds by increasing
the voltage drop across the plasma,
and by creating a lot more
of those little tufts,
and actually eventually
sending them into motion.
Then at point B you can see
that red line shoot up again.
That's because we cranked
the current knob;
so, we pushed more current
through the plasma.
And in response, you can see the voltage
goes up again across the plasma,
and we create a lot of double layers;
six or seven double layers there.
That wiggle in the blue line,
we don't know what that is yet.
That's not our power supply,
so to be looked at later;
and I'm not actually going to talk much
about what happened at the end there.
We had a big release of energy, but I can't
talk much about what was going on there.
Okay, then you can also look at
the resistance across the chamber
and the power consumed by, or
transformed by the discharge.
So, the green Line is the resistance
across the whole discharge,
and the black line is the
power consumed or transformed
and it's those same regimes,
same A, B, C and D.
So, the first thing that happened,
when you created all the little tufts:
that green Line drops way down.
That's the resistance
of the plasma.
It goes way down, when
those tufts are created
and there's that initial
increase in the power consumed.
Then, at point B they've
cranked the current more,
the resistance goes down even more,
as we're creating double layers
and the power consumption
goes way up.
So, the plasma is responding
to how we're pushing it
and one of the ways, and we can repeat
again and we need to study more, is
it responds in ways to
lower its resistance
and greatly increase the amount
of power it can transform.
We designed SAFIRE to be able
to vary voltage and current independently.
This particular run, we were
just varying the current,
but no one knows yet, in a cosmological
setting, what the driver is.
Whether voltage primarily drives
things, or current drives things,
or some combination of them.
So, we have built in the flexibility
to control them independently.
And this may seem
like basic research,
but it is, and it's
so needed because,
even though we know double layers are
everywhere, they're over our heads right now,
they're in the magnetosphere,
they're in solar flares etc.,
there's not that much known about how
to write down the circuit diagram
for double layers in astronomy.
There is almost nothing
known about that.
So, this research
that we're doing here
is entirely done largely to help give
direction to future astrophysicists,
so they know what to look for in
magnetospheres and solar flares etc.
and how to interpret what they're seeing
in terms of electrical circuitry.
This is absolutely
fundamental, what we're doing.
So, let's switch then to the
point measurements, okay,
so now we're not talking about the
global plasma, we're talking about
that point where the
Langmuir probe is.
And we go up close, the left-hand
side is close to the anode.
The anode actually starts at
the number 1, not at zero,
the surface of the anode,
and then we move
out to the right
and we go out basically to
the end of the chamber.
The red X's are the floating
potential, with our new probe.
That means you stick
a probe in there,
it's going to raise up to a certain
electrical potential on its own,
just from being
inserted in the plasma.
We measure that, we move it out
and we take measurements,
that's the red line.
And you can see that it goes
from 300 Volts down to zero.
Totally makes sense:
we had our anode of 300 Volts,
you move the probe all the way out to the
end of the chamber, it goes down to zero.
Then the fun starts
and you can calculate other parameters in the
plasma, like the electric field strength.
So, electric field strength is
how much your electrical
potential changes with distance.
And so, if I had a chamber that
had a 300 Volt anode here,
and the end of the chamber, which was
a meter away, went down to zero,
you would say that the change in the
electric potential is 300 Volts per meter.
Okay, that's how you
describe electric fields:
300 Volts per meter,
is the change.
But what we found very
clearly from this data,
and I'm sorry I didn't label
the vertical axis better,
but that green peak,
that's the electric field,
that peak has nothing to do
with those numbers on the left.
That green peak is at about 8,000 Volts
per meter, not 300 Volts per meter,
which you might think, if you
just looked at the rough numbers.
So, this is great because it's showing
us that these discharge plasmas,
they have the ability to sustain within
them, much more intense regimes,
much more intensive is going
on than you would ever guess,
if you just were stepping back and
looking at your power supply, right?
If you look at your power
supply, you would never guess
that there was 8,000 Volts per
meter electric fields in there.
The black line is charge density,
so these double layers exist
because charge is positive and negative
charges build up next to each other.
So, we can see we're starting to be able to
measure those charge density fluctuations.
It's the left hand side
there, the black line
when it gets a little bit closer to
the anode, it drops way, way down.
I didn't include
it on this graph.
I couldn't get that on there
but just so you know that
that black line drops way down,
if we get one fraction of a
millimeter closer to the anode.
And then the blue one is the
resistance of the chamber.
So, since we have a designed a double
probe also, we didn't show you that one,
we can stick those
two wires in there
and measure the resistance of the plasma
across that little gap between the two wires
and so you can see the resistance is basically
infinite, as you get closer to the anode,
drops to almost zero, climbs back
up, falls back down and that last
rise at the end there
of the resistance line,
I'm pretty sure, is heading back up to
essentially, you know huge, huge numbers.
I love this graph.
I'm very proud that we
were able to make this,
because you don't often see so many
plasma parameters, all taken together
and displayed together and, similar
to what I was saying about
the overall plasma electrical
characteristics is so needed for astronomy
so you can start making
circuit diagrams,
this sort of ability to see all these
different parameters in the plasma,
at the same time,
on the same graph,
is what we need in order to start
digging into what's going on,
what's the physics inside
of this plasma here.
And since a lot of these results
were done pretty recently,
more analysis kept coming in the
day, we were supposed to submit it.
Lowell gave me this graph,
okay, I'll put this in there,
before we hit ”send”, he
sends me another graph.
Okay, I'll put
this one in there.
This is the electron temperature
in the different areas, that plasma close,
we're getting close, to the anode, okay?
So it's going up and down;
see how, that close to the
anode there, it's at 7.
Okay, that's Electronvolt,
7 Electronvolt electrons.
That's pretty hot for
earthly conditions.
If I had a jar of 7 Electronvolt electrons,
and you stuck your thermometer in there,
it would read about 81,000 degrees.
That would be the effective
comparable temperature to it.
So, we have in SAFIRE tens of thousands
of degree fluctuations in temperature
taking place over millimeters or centimeters,
safely, no one's being hurt, right?
Not yet, and we can control
it, we can reproduce it,
and as we saw with the probes,
we're starting to see how
to release that energy.
But we'll talk more about that very
soon; about the release of the energy.
Now, it's important to
point out that the team
does have a paper published
from previous work.
This was written by Lowell
Morgan and Montgomery Childs.
It was published in the Plasma Sources
Science and Technology journal.
This looked at
previous discharges,
mostly from the point of how
much light was being emitted.
So, a really good analysis
by Lowell on this one.
One of the main
conclusions from this,
we're trying to answer, how
do these double layers form.
Believe it or not, no one really knows
how these double layers form, okay.
it's pretty interesting;
Lowell's idea was, that the production
of negative ions and electrons,
creates instabilities
in the plasma,
which leads then to the
segregation of the charges.
If you want, we can certainly
get you this paper,
that you can dig into
his analysis on that.
Again to remind people, I'm
excited by some of our results,
because we're seeing fluctuations
in these parameters,
that are comparable to the sort of fluctuations
we need to have to be able to say, yes
we're looking at astronomical
quantities here, comparable quantities.
We should just take a breath in,
before getting into radiation.
So everybody breathe.
We were talking about the ITER,
Tokamak experiments, you know
and see the sheer amount of
money that's going into them.
And it seems like we're trying to force
nature to do something it doesn't want to do,
with these magnetic confinement
fusion experiments.
And you know, you put another
50 million dollars into it,
and then you get much stronger
magnetic fields to try,
and it still just doesn't work.
You can't make the plasma do it
and I don't know if you can
see it from the videos,
but we're in the lab
working on this plasma.
We're not actually driving it so hard,
we're not forcing nature to do anything.
That's certainly how I feel it.
It seems like, we turn it up
and then the plasma responds,
and everybody's happy, we're not
forcing anybody to do anything, right?
So, I feel that's one of the things that, it
feels to me like we're on the right track,
because it doesn't have that feeling of forcing
something that nature doesn't want to do.
Plasmas are certainly Dr.
Morgan's specialty.
We said, could you please,
take a look at this.
Take a look at why, what
happened to our tungsten probe.
Okay, from what you know, can
you please dig into this.
So, we spent some
time looking at that.
Radiation trapping.
So we're going to talk
about that really soon.
How to envision that.
So, I knew that biology had
complicated chemistry.
Biochemistry, is
complicated stuff, right?
Light and life, it has all these
things and I'm starting to realize:
plasma chemistry is really also equally
complicated, and it makes me wonder about
what sort of chemistry
is being done on stars.
It's really complicated stuff.
So, Lowell came back with... right,
this is not a result of thermodynamics.
traditional temperature
that melted this probe.
You have to look at radiation
hydrodynamics which, he explained to us,
is really one of the most complicated
areas in Applied Physics.
There's not much that you could
say is more complicated;
it's why Livermore and Los Alamos
labs always have the best computers,
because you need supercomputers
to do these analyses.
I wrote down this
quote from him that
”nuclear weapons have very little
to do with nuclear physics
and a lot to do with
radiation hydrogen dynamics”
Okay, let's talk about radiation trapping
and slowing of the speed of light.
Imagine that this whole room
is the SAFIRE chamber, okay.
The stage is the anode, and all
of us are hydrogen atoms, okay.
And being hydrogen atoms, like we said that
every species of bird has its own song,
so we can all talk to each other, for all
hydrogen atoms, we can exchange thoughts
and tell each other things and exchange
photons and energy, stuff like that;
and the anode is up here, and electrical
energy is being pushed out
to all of us, from
the stage here.
Okay, so you got the
picture, right?
Now imagine that that
whole side of the room,
you're now all
helium atoms, Okay?
To the rest of us, that side
of the room just went dark.
We can't see them anymore,
we can't hear them anymore,
because we are now on
different wavelengths.
We cannot exchange energy
with them anymore.
Okay, so we'll leave
them for a second.
We'll just focus on this side.
Electrical energy comes
off of the stage
and let's imagine that it gets absorbed
by two people on the front row, okay?
They hold on to it for a
while, they get excited,
they're bubbly, they can't
sit still in their seats;
they're getting all
kind of pumped up,
but they hold onto the energy, hold onto
the excitement for a while; maybe 30 s.
While they're holding onto it,
two more people on the front
row get some of this energy.
They get all excited,
they can't sit in their seats they
can’t wait to tell somebody something.
After about thirty seconds, those first
two people finally can turn around
and they communicate their
excitement to somebody behind them.
But then that person who gets that
excitement behind him in the second row,
they also have to hold
on to it for a while.
They can't just turn around and
tell the person behind them.
So, there's this slow
progression of this excitement.
If it were a different scenario,
if you weren't hydrogen
and I wasn't communicating to
this specific frequency of light,
which I'll mention soon, then
as soon as you got excited,
you would just turn around and
talk to the person behind you.
As soon as you told, they
would just turn around
and tell the next
person behind them,
and that excitement would go out through
the hall at the speed of light, right out.
But that's not what happens.
There's a specific resonant
frequency that hydrogen has.
It's 122 nanometers;
that's pretty hot stuff.
That's the level of energy that we
see coming off of solar flares,
coronal loops, things like that.
That's how we see that
level of intensity.
When hydrogen gets that, it
holds on to it for a while.
In fact, it holds on to it
thousands of times longer,
than it takes to just exchange the
information with another hydrogen atom.
So it's that particular way
that hydrogen manifests
that slows down the speed of light, the
progression of light, by thousands of times,
and ends up building a huge
amount of energy in that region.
We didn't forget
about the helium’s.
So, the helium's they don't see
anything going on over here.
It's dark, they can't
hear anything,
and one of you gets the bright
idea: let's build a probe
and we'll put it across
the aisle and we'll see.
So it's like a couple of guys go
running back to the breakout room,
they take apart some
of Ricky's paintings.
They get the wood frames,
they stick some dried sage that I saw
over there on the table in that,
and two guys put the probe
across the center aisle
and it touches into that
region and bursts into flames.
Ashes fall on the floor.
So that's how they know: that look, we
couldn't see it, it wasn't visible to us,
but as soon as we put our
probe in there, it got fried.
That's radiation trapping and
slowing down the speed of light.
That's what we have going
on in our chamber,
and that's my....
Now you know all about radiation
hydrodynamics that you need to know.
How'd I do Lowell,
was that okay?
... yeah and you know what's interesting
also is that this whole arrangement is...
You could call it electrostatic.
We just have a battery, we
just have 300 Volts.
So it's an electrostatic
machine we have.
So we have an electrostatic machine that can
trap photons, high-energy photons.
We have an electrostatic machine that
can slow down the speed of light.
We have an electrostatic
machine that can release
in an instant very large
quantities of energy.
And we're controlling it.
We can predict how to
get to these regimes.
This is a plot of the expected
temperature the probe tip would get to.
And so, you can see
under certain regimes,
which are the left and right axes there, of
hydrogen density and electron temperature,
the red area there:
10,000 degrees predicted.
When that poor probe goes
into the hydrogen section,
you could expect that much
energy to go into the probe,
raising it up to about
10,000 degrees.
Now, does that explain
everything we saw?
I don't know,
but it certainly is the right way
to start analyzing this problem.
Monty: A lot going on this year
and we were really getting concerned
towards the end of the project,
whether or not we were
even going to do this.
We started getting the analysis back,
and we sure were
getting really excited.
There was actually hope, even though
thermodynamics can't resolve for these things,
radiation hydrodynamics can;
plus a lot of other things.
So, we see ourselves as, now that
SAFIRE, I would say, is stable,
we can get these stable plasmas,
we're now in a place where I would
say, with pretty good confidence,
that we can start to actually do a number of
experiments and get really good data back.
But these results are,
in my view spectacular.
The chemistry changes:
(we) don't know.
We shouldn't have barium
in there, or titanium,
no idea where the
stuff came from.
We can be guessing, but
we should find out.
Variations in electron density comparable to the
photosphere, heliosphere and nuclear bombs.
Those are the only places that we see
these kinds of intense, dense plasmas.
Electrical confinement
of high-energy photons.
That's a lot.
And what we're saying here in effect is
that, and what Michael was talking about,
and the transformation characteristics
of the plasma, the double layers,
those double layers, when Paul's talking
about second-order interactions,
what we're talking about, it's
like an audio feedback loop
that just keeps getting bigger and
bigger except that in a double layer
it gets to a point that the
double layer forms,
and the plasma now
becomes stable.
Up to that point, electrically you
can see a lot of activity,
but when the double layer forms,
it goes stable and
it it's very robust.
So, it'd be like the
double layer,
and I'm going to jump out
here a little bit too,
because I think we're
really at that place,
where we have our atmosphere
in the Earth, 350 miles up.
Conventional science says, it is gravity
that holds our atmosphere here.
But mechanical engineering, I mean, we
have big machines that try to contain,
or get vacuums that aren’t
even close to space vacuums.
What I'm trying to say in effect
is that only 300-mile distance,
we've got a space vacuum that can
suck your eyeballs out of your house.
I mean, out of your head (it has
been a long day), out of your head,
and yet there's no mechanical
device retaining our atmosphere.
And what we are seeing, what
we forgot to mention actually,
is we do have a pressure
delta in SAFIRE.
That's a big deal because I think
Langmuir predicted theoretically,
that we should see this.
I mean that's what Lowell is....
What we're saying in effect is,
when we get a vacuum in a chamber,
a gas would fill this
room, or the chamber,
and the pressure in itself would
be equal throughout the chamber.
But when these double layers form,
that's not what's happening.
So, we do actually have
higher pressure
inside these double layers than
we do actually have outside,
in the greater
part of the chamber.
So, you actually have
a plasma force field
that actually can contain
these molecules, these gases.
That's a big deal.
So, the core of
SAFIRE is cooler.
The highest temperatures we thought
we saw was maybe around 1,000º C;
and obviously the temperatures,
or the effective temperature,
or you might say, the response temperatures
we are getting with the probes,
are many orders above that.
Way, way, way above that.
So these are things that we're exploring
with SAFIRE and I think that's really it.
These questions we are going
to leave on the screen here
and I guess we're open for
questions and answers.
[Applause]
Other way
that's good!
eighty-five
”So the temperature of the anode
right now in the hydrogen is 600”
”It has been at 600, even though we had
like kilowatts going through there.
Yeah,
that's good.”
”..a lot hotter with
the nitrogen..”
Shortly after the 2017
Phoenix conference,
the SAFIRE team discovered a
unique process that initiates
and sustains the
plasma double layers.
This was a major discovery,
because it is these
plasma double layers
that produce both the extraordinarily
high energy densities
and the electric field that contains
these energies within the plasma.
This new advancement in plasma
science demonstrates a process,
that consistently creates, contains
and controls the plasma double layers
in stable exothermic
plasma reactions.
Although the energies
and densities
are comparable to the Sun's
photosphere and nuclear bombs,
the data shows no harmful side
effects, such as radioactivity.
But the science of what is actually happening
at the molecular and atomic levels
is not yet fully understood.
Understanding these reactions,
will give valuable insight
into the way the Sun's
atmosphere functions,
and provide the foundation by which these
energies can be beneficially harnessed
This research will be the
top priority of 2018.

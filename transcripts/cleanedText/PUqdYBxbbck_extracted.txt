The Catastrophic Termination
of the Last Ice Age
(excerpt)
The Moai and you have all kinds
of incredible mysteries their
notice Moai with the
hands and the elbow.
Just as a side note, you get something
very similar to Göbekli Tepe I think
but... These are some
of the petroglyphs
notice the hands we were just
hearing about the hand shape.
And you have comparisons, these
are just some comparisons
between Easter in Petro
and Göbekli Tepe,
but what you have on Easter island which
is really very strange and mysterious
is this so-called indigenous, was
indigenous script, indigenous something,
this is a modern reconstruction, a
monument outside the governor's office
but the rongorongo script.
Have people heard about that?
It's on wooden tablets only
about two dozen, 26 or so.
People argue about the
authenticity of some of them.
Are known at this point they are
inscribed on these wooden tablets
and these have never been, to this
moment unless we write about it,
really been properly
interpreted or deciphered.
So, we're looking at these, we
come back from Easter Island
was surveyed like a little break tooth
from thinking about other things
we're looking at but I can't
get my mind off, you know...
Why do civilizations disappear,
why did the Ice Age end?
We watch 'Symbols of an Alien
Sky' and Katie says to me
Well, you know those
rongorongo characters
they certainly look like
the plasma petroglyphs.
And we starting to look
at them, and look at them
and I've gotta say I tend to be
skeptical about things that first right
thing or you know...
I didn't want to watch it again,
I mean, no no insult to you...
but I mean, I'd seen a 'Symbols of an Alien
Sky' before I found it really interesting
but she insisted all we should watch
it again, good to relax the brain.
And here we're looking at this,
and these are rongorongo glyphs.
See them there?
This is someone here, another
one here and I believe,
we believe that as you
start looking at this,
you get the same imagery, you get
the same forms very consistently
I gotta say that, you know,
it's just been crazy
the diverse interpretations did very very
despair trying to interpret rongorongo
if you look at the literature
about it, which I've read,
of the literature I try to get my hands
on I'm not find an inc in even convincing
but it does make sense to me that
these glyphs record or were inspired
by these plasma configurations.
And I just throw this, I well, not
throw it in this, and I think
it has been suggested by Tony
Peratt and his group that Nazca
the Nasca Lines may record,
well, he didn't really
get into the glyphs,
the huge glyphs on the
surface that you have there,
but you start looking at these,
you were looking at rongorongo
there's a petroglyph of the
Easter arm with the hand symbol
and I while you have that
Nazca too, wondering,
does this all start to tie together
again as a unifying thing.
You look at other
aspects of this...
And I realize what time it is,
I'm paying attention on time.
...but you look at other
aspects to this for instance,
some of the legends and I come to
this great detail but Easter Island.
There's a legend I want read this, "In the
days of Rokoroko He Tau the sky fell",
whether they referring to
by the sky falling that,
"Fell from above onto the earth.
The people cried out,
'The sky has fallen in the
days of King Rokoroko He Tau.'
He took hold: he
waited a given time.
The sky returned; it went
away and it stayed up there".
Again so, who could
this be referring to?
Plasma changes in the sky.
So, we suggest Katie and I, that
maybe the rongorongo tablets
are reporting some kind of, if
it's solar plasma outbursts
or maybe in the context here, other
types of plasma configurations,
cataclysm, geomagnetic storms,
could it be recording this.
In fact, when you look at the
glyphs they seem to, in many cases,
morph from one form to another as
if they're record in like a film
different configurations
in the sky.
We suggest that maybe it's
what we call scientific text,
or you know, and this
original ones, like anything
some of this could have been lost
later, it could have been reused,
it could been tried to turn into
some type of language later,
but I'm suggesting for the
origin of these glyphs.
Could it be that they were recording
some kind of plasma events?
Whether it's a solar ejection,
something like the Carrington event
or something much more dramatic,
and could this be the end
of the last ice age?
Could a plasma event like that, be what
caused the end of the last ice age?
It would come down, it would hit, it would
incinerate the surface of the Earth,
it would leave only large stone structures,
which is what you have surviving.
It's now been documented very
recently within the last couple years
that so many neolithic structures from
around the end of the last ice age
they are associated with underground
tunnels and caves, artificial caves.
Why would you did those?
Why would you dig into...
not dig, carve into rock?
Spend tremendous amount of time,
time and energy to do that.
Well, if you're trying to survive a cataclysm
from above, the early fire coming down.
That would create deluges, huge floods,
biblical floods, evaporating water,
evaporating ice, you would have to
precipitate out again, you rise,
you are causing, ice sheets to
melt, sea levels are rising
earthquakes, volcanic
activity increased,
you find around the world
and I just mention this
couple of example for instances,
Easter Island, this low,
thick, stone "houses", they're almost like
fallout shelters or protected shelters,
also even Easter Island, their
use of artificial caves to avoid
give you just a example, you
have things like Mesa Verde
I don't know, where they
just under cliffs for the
fun or was that, in some cases are not
say all this would go back that far
but is it a collective memory?
Is it a memory that you have to protect
yourself for what may come in the future?
Back to Göbekli Tepe, were they
seeking to protect themselves?
Was this plasma come in down,
was literally burning and incinerating
that they want to protect this structure?
I throw it out there
and could this be because
of the great rains
ultimately that eroded the Sphinx,
could it pushes all back?
The geology does not deny that it
could be that all, it's compatible.
And again Peratt and his group
have questioned the date.
Well, as I said, here I'm suggesting that
maybe at least one of these major events,
because there may be more than
one, could have been at 9,700 BCE
by conventional date, I realize not
everyone accepts a conventional dating here
and that this could have
wiped everything out.
And I've got two more slides, because
I know I'm running out of time.
Could it happen again?
This is something
that people ask me.
This was published in
astronomy and astrophysics
similar things have been
published in Nature for instance
so, can this is a good
conventional peer review.
In this case we're looking at a
reconstruction of solar activity
this is the end
the last Ice Age.
You know so incredible mood
swings if you would of the Sun
and are very high solar activity
and sort of decline since it was
end of last Ice Age, 7,000 or
so BC declines, we have low,
notice that we're ramping up again
in the last century or less
there's a lot of indication, things are
happening, things are going active again
so, I would say be
prepared although I'm not.
Yeah, I don't want be overly
dramatic, but who knows...
If something hits tomorrow,
you heard it here right?

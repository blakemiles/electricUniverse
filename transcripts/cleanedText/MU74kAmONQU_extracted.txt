Welcome to Space News from The Electric
Universe, brought to you by The
Thunderbolts Project at Thunderbolts.info.
In Part One of this presentation
phycicist Wal Thornhill began laying the
foundations for a new theoretical
understanding of our sun and all stars.
Standard theory remains that stars are
born due to the gravitational collapse
of material in nebular clouds over vast
spans of time. We're told that stars die
when they inevitably exhaust their fuel,
or simply explode. But for many years
countless discoveries have contradicted
these fundamental concepts. In this
episode Thornhill further explores the
Electric Universe predictions and
explanations for a variety of stellar
phenomena. So, let's return to the
declaration of our esteemed internet
lecturer that our sun was born about 5
billion years ago. There is no evidence
whatsoever for this categorical
statement. With the thermonuclear model
discredited by the observational
evidence, the complex life story of stars
is exposed as fiction. Two recent reports
support this judgment, out of a countless
number of others, expressing surprise at
unexpected discoveries. On March 6, (2017)
phys.org headlined a report, “Star
clusters discovery could upset the
astronomical applecart.” It begins, “The
discovery of young stars in old clusters
could send scientists back to the drawing
board.” Because models of stellar
evolution are based on the assumption
that stars within star clusters formed
from the same material at roughly the
same time.  However “back to the drawing
board” always means embroidering the set
of beliefs permanently inscribed on the
board. No physicist shows the
intellectual integrity to wipe the board
clean of its own scientific Big Bang
myth and start afresh; it's all too hard
and scary. So, Dr. Kenji Bekky from the
International Center for Radio Astronomy
Research says, “The formation of these
younger stars could have been
fueled by gas entering the clusters from
interstellar space.” However, observations
showed “that there was no correlation
between interstellar hydrogen gas and
the location of the clusters we were
studying.” “We believe the younger stars
have actually been created out of the
matter ejected from older stars as they
die, which means we have discovered
multiple generations of stars belonging
to the same cluster.” The words “We believe”
are accurate; the discovery of multiple
generations of stars is not. The notion
of the age of a star is based on
plotting a point on the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram where the
star leaves the main sequence after the
exhaustion of its main fuel. But we have
shown that stars do not exhaust their
fuel any more than an electric light
does. Stars don't die because their fuel
runs out, or mysteriously explodes.
The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is simply a
plot of points, and not an evolutionary
sequence. Stars have been observed to
change swiftly and inexplicably from one
location to another on the diagram. When
viewed correctly as a mirror image, the
diagram represents the change in color
and brightness of a star as the
electrical energy focused on it,
increases along the x-axis. Sharp
discontinuities exist in experimental
gas discharges between dark mode, glow
mode and arc mode. These discontinuities
simply explain the sharply different
appearances of faint white dwarfs, bright
sun-like stars and red, so-called dwarfs,
and red giant stars. The red color is due
to an extensive anode glow and the faint
white color is simply a coronal glow of
a normally constituted stellar body
lacking a bright arc mode photosphere. No
imaginary ultra-dense dwarf object is
required. There is no need to invent an
ad hoc requirement for stars to have
exploded and then somehow gather their
widely scattering dust gravitationally
to give birth to younger stars in the
cluster. Stellar explosions are often
invoked to clear dust and gas from star
clusters.
Astronomers can't have it both ways, but
critically, none of this complicated
”ad-hoc-ary” fits the observations of
filamentary star birth inside molecular
clouds. The second report appeared on May 18,
last year in phys.org, titled, “Stellar
mystery deepens.” A Monash University-led
research team made an unexpected
discovery that a large group of stars
are dying prematurely, challenging our
accepted view of stellar evolution. Their
results revealed that large numbers of
helium burning stars are dying
prematurely in the M4 globular cluster.
Professor Lattanzio from the Max Planck
Institute for Astrophysics said, Globular
clusters are some of the oldest objects
in the Universe. Although we have some
ideas for what is going on in them, every
time we look carefully we find
something unexpected. They are both
fascinating and frustrating at the
same time.” The international team found that
about half of the stars tend to skip the
red giant phase, instead becoming white
dwarfs, millions of years ahead of
schedule, demonstrating once again what's
wrong with the modern scientific method
characterized as shut up and simulate.
Professor Lattanzio continued: “Computer
simulations do not agree with this
observation; so as well as continuing
observations, new computer models will
need to be generated to better
understand what is taking place in the
cores of these stars.” But the computer
models are built on missing or invalid
concepts: there's nothing going on in the
cores of stars, and globular clusters are
not understood. So, the mathematical
computer simulations produce a virtual,
unreal cosmos that, like the movies, can
be programmed to produce anything you
can imagine and the artist's impressions
we see in science reports are little
more than glossy advertising material,
but much more deceptive, because it is
falsely labeled ‘real science’. There is no
real mystery here. With no nuclear fire
inside, stars don't die by bloating to a
red giant and collapsing to a white
dwarf as their fire goes out.
The life and death stories of stars are
fictional: the bloated appearance of red
giants is not due to internal pressure
caused by hypothetical helium burning at
100 million degrees in the core of a
star. It is a purely electrical effect,
witnessed in laboratory low pressure gas
discharge tubes. Red stars are those that
satisfy their need for electrons from
the surrounding plasma by expanding the
surface area over which they collect
electrons, by growing a large plasma
sheath that becomes the effective anode
in space. The growth process is
self-limiting, because as the sheath
expands, its electric field grows
stronger. Electrons caught up in the
field are accelerated until they become
energetic enough to excite neutral
particles they chance to collide with
and the huge sheath becomes a uniform
red anode glow: it becomes a red giant
star. The electric field driving this
process will also give rise to a massive
flow of positive ions away from the star,
or in more conventional terms,
a prodigious stellar wind. Such loss of
matter is the characteristic feature of
red giants; standard stellar theory is
at a loss to explain this, since the
star is said to be too cold to boil off
a stellar wind. Arthur Eddington himself
expressed his puzzlement about white
dwarfs, “Strange objects, which persist in
showing a type of spectrum entirely out
of keeping with their luminosity, may
ultimately teach us more than a host
which radiates according to rule.” He was
right: a white dwarf appears extremely
hot, white and under-luminous because it
is a faint, white coronal discharge. As
usual, a thin plasma sheath will be
formed between the plasma of the star
and the plasma of space. The electric
field across the plasma sheath is
capable of accelerating electrons to
generate ultraviolet light and X-rays
when they hit atoms in the atmosphere,
and the power dissipated is capable of
raising the temperature of a thin plasma
layer to tens of thousands of degrees.
The spectral lines are broadened,
sometimes to the point of disappearance,
due to the coronal electric field. This
gives the misleading impression that
hydrogen, whose
spectral lines are smeared the most, is
missing in many of these stars and that
therefore, they are remnants of larger
stars that have conventionally lost or
burned their hydrogen fuel. So, globular
clusters are not some of the oldest
objects in the universe. Their
spherical shape of a dense collection of
stars, and their elliptical orbits about
the galactic center, hint at a quasar
style birth process from the plasmoid at
the heart of the galaxy. If so, the
electromagnetic environment inside the
globular cluster is different to that in
open clusters of stars. So we should
expect an unusual distribution of white
dwarfs and red giant stars and the
puzzling observation that some globular
cluster stars have 100 times more iron
than others, could also be explained by
electromagnetic sorting of elements
within the globular cluster at its birth.
The fact we don't understand stars in
the 21st century, highlights what Arthur
Koestler wrote in The sleepwalkers, “The
history of cosmic theories, in particular,
may without exaggeration be called a
history of collective obsessions and
controlled schizophrenia; and the manner
in which some of the most important
individual discoveries were arrived at
reminds one more of a sleepwalker’s
performance than an electronic brain’s.”
Science is still in its childhood and we
behave as infants. We give far too much
credit to scientists for knowing what
they are talking about.

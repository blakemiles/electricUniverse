[Host, Michael] Today, we offer a
brief introduction to a fundamental
theoretical difference between
traditional solar physics and astronomy,
and the physics of
plasma cosmology.
On the Sun, we're told the
magnetic field lines move,
or merge, and frequently
break and "reconnect".
This process is called
magnetic reconnection,
a mechanism that many solar physicists
claimed to be responsible for
enormous energetic outbursts from
the Sun, such as solar flares.
We are told the magnetic reconnection
in Earth's magnetosphere
is one of the causes
of Earth's aurora.
And, astronomers now envision the process
in the magnetospheres of many planets.
However, the 20th century's
most distinguished plasma physicist,
Nobel laureate Hannes Alfven, admonished
astronomers to drop the concept
of "magnetic reconnection" since the
language confuses cause-and-effect.
Alfven stated, "Of course there can be
no magnetic merging energy transfer.
Despite ... this we have witnessed
at the same time an enormously
voluminous formalism building up based
on this obviously erroneous concept".
Thunderbolts colleague Dr.
Jeremy Dunning Davies explores
the plasma cosmology alternative
to the reconnection concept.
[Jeremy] The subject is
magnetic reconnection.
Now, in very simple terms from what is
written, it seems that as far as magnetic
reconnection is concerned, one is required
to believe that enormous quantities
of energy are produced by magnetic lines
of force breaking, and then reconnecting.
Now, undoubtedly there is some physical
process occuring which produces
the enormous quantities of energy
observed in the situations concerned.
But, this explanation, at
least in it's simplest form,
cannot possibly be valid since, crucially,
lines of force are simply not real.
They're not physical entities.
Now in astrophysics, the idea of
magnetic reconnection is used to explain
some huge surges of energy in
what, for example, solar flares.
This point needs to be considered now,
in the light of what I've just said.
But, it might be noted that, when
you take separate magnetic fields
and they come together and combine
into a single field, the strength of
that resulting field will be enhanced
at some points, and weakened at others.
The overall result might be
expected to be a completely new
pattern of lines of force due to
the totally new magnetic field,
brought about by the natural
merging of the original fields.
Again, there's no breaking
of lines of force,
merely the natural emergence of a new
pattern due to the said merging.
As for the enormous quantities of energy
produced in some physical occurrences,
such as solar flares, it seems to me,
far more likely that the true explanation
is to be found within the realms of
plasma cosmology/plasma physics,
whichever you like to call it.
Now, most of the experiments
associated with plasmas
are performed in normal-sized
laboratories, here on the Earth.
And, there's no real reason to suppose
the results of such experiments
extrapolate to the cosmic scale
but, we've got to start somewhere.
And, it seems that the field of plasma
research does offer many good clues
to help in the search for the real explanation
of such phenomena, as solar flares.
Now, this is seen quite rapidly
by examining the contents
of Anthony Peratt's book,
'Physics of the Plasma Universe'.
In this volume (Chapter 5 of
this volume, specifically),
one reads of double layers
and their properties;
and in Section 5.5 of that very chapter,
which deals with the basic properties
of these double layers, one reads of the
phenomenon of exploding double layers.
Now interestingly, this is
a topic discussed also in
Alfvén and Arrhenius book,
'Evolution of the Solar System'.
And, in that book on page 250 and
I'll quote specifically from it.
They say, "If a current flows through
an electrostatic double layer
(which is often produced by the current
itself), the layer may cut off the current.
This means that the voltage
over the double layer may reach
any value necessary to break the circuit
(in the laboratory, this could be 10^6V;
in a solar flare, it might be
even of the order of 10^10V).
The plasma, however, explodes and
a high-vacuum region is produced.
Now, all this information,
specifically in Peratt's book,
relating to double layers would seem to
indicate a more physically realistic
explanation of some cosmological
phenomena, such as solar flares.
Indeed, as far as solar flares are
concerned, they are discussed specifically
in Section 5.6.2 of
Anthony Peratt's Book.
Now, bearing in mind the total
physical illogicality of the notion
of magnetic reconnection,
together with the realization
that a physically acceptable alternative
is there for all to see and examine,
it is difficult to see how the presently
accepted position can remain tenable,
and accepted, as yet another piece
of scientific conventional wisdom.

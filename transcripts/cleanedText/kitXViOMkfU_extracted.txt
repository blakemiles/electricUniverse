Christiaan Eijkman discovered that a
bacterium in polished rice caused beriberi
and an antitoxin in the
coating cured it.
Eijkman verified his theory with a
massive study of 280,000 people.
He ruled out the possibility
of other causal factors;
sanitation, hygiene and so on
and he cured victims by
feeding them unpolished rice,
just as his theory predicted.
He was awarded a Nobel
Prize for his achievement.
Gerrit Grijns followed
in Eijkman footsteps
but Gerrit was a crackpot,
that is, he had an
altogether different idea.
He imagined beriberi was caused
not by something in the rice
but by something not in the rice.
He began looking for data that would
raise doubts about Eijkman's theory.
Beriberi was also associated
with diets of tapioca root,
foods other than rice
polishing could cure it.
And no one could find
Eijkman's bacterium.
Both theories
explained the facts.
Both theories predicted the cure.
Both theories were verified.
But Grijns's theory could be applied
to a much larger assemblage of data
and had benefits far beyond the
domain of rice diets and beriberi.
Today, astronomers attribute the
non-Newtonian motions of stars and galaxies
to an infection of dark
matter in the universe.
Gravitational theory which has been
experimentally verified many, many times
can explain the observed
motions only by assuming
there's some unseen matter
swirling around outside what we see.
The cure is in the
galactic polishings.
Now along
comes a crackpot idea:
perhaps the non-Newtonian motions
aren't caused by something out there
but by something not out there.
Perhaps gravity is not out there.
An abundance of anomalies raises
doubts about gravitational theory:
galaxies that are supposed to be astronomically
far from each other are interacting.
The primary distance indicator,
the cosmological redshift is quantized
in sharply delineated bands;
matter is collimated into extremely
thin, long, and coherent filaments;
concentrations of matter that should be pulling
everything in are spewing everything out.
And the quantity of dark matter needed
to explain those anomalous motions
turns out to be over
90% of the universe.
Douglas Allchin's paper 'The Epistemology
of Error', discusses the episode of Eijkman
Grijns, and beriberi.
He emphasizes that the important
distinction for characterizing knowledge
is not the conventional
"dichotomies of fact/artifact,
true/false, and right/wrong."
Rather,
"...key epistemological distinction is between
empirically unresolved questions or uncertainty,
and resolved questions."
"Grijns's challenge was not to show ...
that beriberi was a nutrient deficiency.
Rather, he had to show
first how initial evidence
consistent with a bacterial
interpretation was ambiguous.
Then ... it could indicate something else."
Allchin identifies
"...uncertainty as
the primitive state.
Fact an artifact co-emerged from
undifferentiated perception."
He goes on to assert that simply confirming
a theory doesn't provide reliability.
Verification must be accompanied by
a search for alternate explanations,
which he calls ― 'error probes.'
He presents the idea of error
probes in a rather static way:
a theory, such as Eijkman's which is
verified, is later shown to be "erroneous"
But in moving from one to the
other, a dynamic process occurs.
One can't assume, as the
term 'error' tends to do,
that the process stops
with the second theory.
The later theory may eventually
be shown also to be erroneous.
The concept of "domain
of validity" fits better
with an ongoing process of
discovering alternative explanations.
The domain of Eijkman's theory
was the data then available
about rice diets and the
effects of polishings.
Within the boundaries of that
domain, Eijkman's theory was true.
Verification, then, is a 'truth probe' that
probes no further than a theory's frontier.
Eijkman's efforts were
limited to truth probes.
He neglected to perform an error probe
because he assumed (albeit unconsciously)
that the domain of the
bacterial theory was infinite.
You can't learn anything new if you limit
yourself to verifying what you already know.
Presumably, Eijkman was not
in a position to be able
even to imagine a cause bigger
than bacterial infection.
But his work began the
process of differentiation
that prodded Grijns to
imagine a bigger concept.
Similarly, Newton was not in a position
to imagine anything bigger than gravity.
His error and that of his mainstream
followers down to the present day
was the assumption that the domain of validity
of gravitational theory is universal.
Newton didn't know about plasma or
galaxies or redshifts or error probes.
His followers, however, don't have
this excuse of simple ignorance.
Their efforts to preserve the theory at
the expense of the phenomena are culpable.
To establish what Allchin
calls 'deep reliability',
it's necessary to investigate
possible alternative explanations.
He states,
"Reliability hinges on a dual process
of confirmation and ruling out error."
Today there are a number of alternatives to
the Newtonian idea of universal gravitation.
Tom Van Flandern developed a
theory of "limited action" gravity.
Fred Hoyle and Jayant Narlikar have proposed
a variable mass version of gravitation.
And there are several proposals
of electrical and plasma dynamics
that largely or entirely
replace gravity.
All these theories
explain more data
and have further reaching implications
than the mainstream theory.
Their domains are larger.
Their potential
benefits are larger.
Their promises of increased understanding
of the universe are larger.
Universal gravitation suffers
from "shallow reliability"
that extends no further
than verification.
Even that is eroding
as space probes discover anomalous
details to once confirmatory data.
Ambiguity is increasing.
Knowledge heretofore
assumed to be secure
is slipping back into the
primitive state of uncertainty.
It will re-emerge transformed
by a new resolution.
The error probe, when finally it's forced
on a stubborn and blind establishment,
will find the error to be Newton's.

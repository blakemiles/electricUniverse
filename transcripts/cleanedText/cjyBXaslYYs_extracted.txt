I hear people talking about “we
have disruptive technology.” Our
position on it is, maybe a little more
gentle, in the sense that technology
doesn't have to destroy economies. We
don't believe they should. We believe
that they should be transformative, to
how people migrate, or progress from one
level to the other. Disruptive
technologies - well, they just don't
typically work very well. So
transformative technology works like
nature itself. It considers all the
factors: functional, economic,
environmental, social and political. It
doesn't produce toxic waste, antithetical
to life. It doesn't attempt to bankrupt
an existing system, or put humans out of
work. Why would you want to bankrupt your
customer? It’s transformative, it transforms
it doesn't trash.

Montgomery Childs and his wife,
Tracy are on their way to Baltimore.
Monty is going to deliver his third
presentation to the Electric Universe group.
[Music]
For two years, he has been developing
a way to test the Electric Sun model.
[Music]
In my professional life, one of the
things I do, is diagnose systems and
make them stable. Stable systems are
often the consequence of a stable process.
[Music]
There are billions of stars in our
galaxy. For as long as we have been
watching them, their luminosity, spectral
nature, and thermal characteristics have
remained relatively constant.
Statistically, it points to a very stable
system. A supernova, or a pulsar, is so
rare an event, as to be considered an
outlier, and not that relevant
in the overall equation.
[Music]
In industry, if you have something as
statistically stable as the stars appear
to be, this suggests a
relatively simple process.
And we have a tool
for studying process.

In January of 2012, David
Talbot invited Monty Childs to
give a presentation at the Electric
Universe conference in Las Vegas. Monty
introduced Design Of Experiments (DOE)
as a methodology for testing the Electric
Universe model. Of the 300
people in the audience, few
had heard of the concept
of Design Of Experiments.
But one person, Scott Mainwaring, became
very intrigued. “...SAFIRE, Stellar
Atmospheric Function in Regulation
Experiment. So what we want to do, is we
want to validate the
EU model, as it relates
to the Sun...” At the next
conference, in 2013,
Monty  suggested a number of experiments
that might be done to test the Electric
Universe model, by focusing on the Sun.
The Electric Universe group asked him to
write up a formal proposal for a
project designed to do exactly that.
[Music]
I can't imagine, how you could ever test
the thermonuclear fusion model of the Sun.
To my knowledge, we've never been
able to replicate sustained nuclear
fusion on Earth. But the
Electric Sun model is different.
Electricity is something we've been
experimenting with for centuries. And
electricity, in the form of plasma even
though the word “plasma” is relatively
recent, we've been aware of this
phenomenon for over a century and a half.
Two years of research, has led me to the
conclusion that the Electric Sun model
might be boiled down to
a fundamental process:
charged plasma, affecting matter of a
different electrical potential.
Now charged plasma, matter,
and electrical potential;
these are things that can be
experimented with in a lab.
Scott Mainwaring gave me a paper
written in 1879 by Sir William Crookes.
[Music]
Michael Faraday was 24 years old, when he
coined the phrase “radiant matter” to
describe, what he believed was the fourth
state of matter. Sixty years later, Sir
William Crookes was one of the first to truly
experiment with this fourth state of matter.
[Music]
He placed rubies in a vacuum
tube, filled with a rarefied gas.
There was an anode at one
end, a cathode at the other.
He introduced sufficient voltage to
ignite the radiant matter. The rubies
started glowing red. Crookes talked about
radiant matter and phosphorescence.
The radiant matter is now called “plasma”.
I read Crookes work and studied the
photographs and work of Kristian
Birkeland, created between 1896 and 1913.
[Music]
In his “terella” experiments, Birkeland used
an electrified globe in a vacuum chamber.
The images he produced, are remarkably
similar to modern photographs of the Sun.
Robert Quinn and Ralph Fiorito, produced
similar images in 1967, while attempting
to generate plasma stability.
[Music]
[Music]
The Electric Universe people had already
seen a similarity between Birkeland’s
terella and the interaction between the
Earth and the Sun. I suspect the
underlying process is, charged plasma,
affecting matter of a different
electrical potential. I'm wondering, if it
might actually be the process that makes
stars shine. Possibilty,
feasibility, viability and
capability; and that doesn't just apply
to whether or not we can replicate the
phenomena in a laboratory experiment, but
it also means, the means by which we
measure, are they capable? No theoretical
models, no extrapolations, no
interpolations, no mathematical
adjustments of the data. Do we have a
ruler that we can actually all
agree on that's a standard.
At the Albuquerque conference in
2013, Monty Childs presents a detailed
proposal for how to proceed with the tests.
“...and if the experiment is feasible.
So all these things have to be addressed
right upfront, before we even start
spending a nickel.” “...it means that we
have the ability to modify or adjust its
potential relative to its environment.”
Okay. You're saying yes. These guys may
want to go to a megawatt or something, and
then do you might null the whole show...”
Key people from the Electric Universe
group offer questions and suggestions.
”...I can take a look at the chamber
design and its boundary conditions...” Then
give it their support. Bruce 
Mainwaring and Scott Mainwaring,
of the Mainwaring Archive
Foundation, agree to finance the project
under the auspices of the International
Science Foundation. It will be called the
Stellar Atmospheric Function In
Regulation Experiment,
the SAFIRE project. The aim of
SAFIRE is to explore the electrical
nature of the Sun's environment and by
implication, the processes involved in
the functioning of stars. “... it's going to
go from hydrogen here, mixing with iron, to
helium and it's going to be a series of
pretty...” Over the next six months,
I spent a lot of time on the phone with
a number of the Electric Universe people.
“... ten trillion degrees like...” Bit by
bit, I could see a potential team slowly
taking shape. Monty and Tracy 
Childs arrive in Baltimore.
The Natural Philosophy Alliance is
holding their 20th annual conference at
the University of Maryland, College Park.
They have invited the Electric Universe
group to contribute presentations. ”...and
asked ourselves now the question that has
never been asked in 70 years of solar
physics, is the Sun truly an island in
space. With no electrical connection to
billions of stars and the sea of plasma
that constitutes the Milky Way...” “...what
we want to do is capture in real time, not
just a qualitative...” Monty offers a
summary of the SAFIRE project.
”...see if we can pick up any ion
acceleration occurring just outside the
sheath...” Given that the Electric Universe
hypothesis is challenging current
conventional theory, “... so you can imagine
electron temperatures of 10 million...”
I was expecting a bit of resistance at
the NPA. But NPA people didn’t seem at all
intimidated by what we were
proposing to do. Quite the contrary.
”...over 40 kilowatts so get fusion...”
I found them very helpful and very
encouraging. “...you'll
have these charges, yeah...”
[Music]
”....so can transformative technology work
on future itself..... it considers all the
factors, functional, economic
environmental, social, and political. It
doesn't produce toxic waste, antithetical
to life. It doesn't attempt to bankrupt
an existing system, or put humans out of
work. Why would you want to bankrupt your
customer? ... it’s transformative, it transforms,
it doesn't trash...” These are some of the
capabilities of the SAFIRE Lab. I won't
list them out loud; this is just to give
you an idea of the potential of the lab,
and we keep adding to the list. To be
pragmatic in the real world, we had to
select a few to take forward into
commercial applications. Here are the
capabilities we have chosen - A fully
functioning plasma laboratory for
experiments - An energy generating reactor
for producing clean energy - An energy generating
reactor for remediating nuclear waste.

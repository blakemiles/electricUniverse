You've just entered the
theater of an alien sky.
If the words and images seem strange
to you there's a reason for this.
Our world was once a
vastly different place.
To experience this won't hurt you
and there is nothing to fear.
In these discourses, we've followed the
evolution of a planetary configuration
close to Earth stretching
across the ancient sky.
Centered at the north celestial pole, it
remained stationary for an extended
period at this position. That's the
underlying nature of the primeval Sun
remembered around the world.
We've noted that the named
planets progressively emerged
from a dusty plasma cloud,
identified in mythic accounts as
the great sea of primeval chaos.
The differentiation of the planets, and
their observed movements in relation to
each other, and the electrical
activity between these bodies
provided the core content of
ancient creation mythology.
In the original accounts, creation meant
events visible to humans on Earth.
We've named three planets in the mythic
Great Conjunction based on recorded
astronomical traditions that trace to the
birth of astronomy in ancient Mesopotamia.
Saturn as the overarching luminary,
named as the primeval Sun;
Venus as mother goddess and radiant eye,
heart and soul, and
Mars as the dark,
reddish innermost body, the
child in the womb of the goddess,
the pupil of the feminine
eye of the primeval Sun.
We've followed the emergence of a
triangular form, recalled as the first
form, the luminous seed of creation.
And we've identified this unique form
as the concrete celestial referent
for the popular 3-fold goddess,
three faced goddess,
or three goddesses in one. We've noted as
well the explosive discharge activity
associated with this triangular form,
and the essential role of the discharge ejecta
as the mythic primeval matter of creation,
the very material from which, in the creation stories,
the gods were said to have constructed
a great citadel in the heavens,
the legendary homeland of the gods. Through
local storytelling and re-enactments across
the centuries, this celestial dwelling came
to be remembered as the ancestral homeland
of every nation recounting these events.
These core themes of an archetypal
memory have taken us to the critical
moment at which a bright crescent,
appeared on the gas giant Saturn
due to light from the Sun.
This moment provides an extraordinary
test of the reconstruction as a whole.
Once we place the named bodies in
3-dimensional space,
centered at the celestial pole, and allow
for an illuminated crescent on Saturn,
an inescapable conclusion will follow.
The crescent must have rotated visually
with the rotation of the Earth, in a precise
relationship to a cycle of day and night,
with no counterpart and no analogy
in anything occurring today.
A star in the center
of a rotating crescent.
The image is recorded around the world.
A crescent which, given the circumpolar
placement, must have turned around
the polar center in a daily cycle
of brightening and dimming.
No ambiguity, no compromise allowed.
When seen with eyes wide open, how
credible are the popular claims of
historians, archaeologists and
comparative mythologists
when they identify the symbolic
crescent as our moon?
By what reasoning would ancient
skyworshipers have extravagantly and
irrationally placed our little crescent
moon into a configuration never seen,
but recorded independently
by humans around the world?
Always keep in mind that the mythic
crescent does not stand alone.
The great star of Venus in the center of
the crescent is just one enigma
in a crowd of unsolved mysteries.
A particularly powerful addition
comes from the mythic world mountain,
a column of fire and light
rising along the polar axis
to pierce the crescent.
That's what gave the
crescent it's mythic identity
as the cleft peak, the horned peak,
the twin arms or twin pillars
of the sky - a subject we'll
review one theme at a time.
In it's juxtaposition with
the revolving crescent,
the polar mountain adds crucially to the
midnight appearance of the crescent in
the most celebrated moment in the archaic
daily cycle. No contrived reconstruction will
ever account for this symmetry. And
that's why a radical break from common
understanding is so essential, as we intend to
make crystal clear in the episodes to follow.

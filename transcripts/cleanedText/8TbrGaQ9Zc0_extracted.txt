Welcome to Space News from the Electric
Universe, brought to you by

Where does gravity fit in the
Electric Universe? Contrary to a somewhat
common misperception, the Electric
Universe does not deny gravity's
existence, nor its role in the cosmos and
our own world. Rather the Electric
Universe theory as proposed by
physicist Wal Thornhill suggests that the
fundamental mysteries of gravity may be
explained by the electrical structure of
matter. In his 2008 article “Electric
Gravity in an Electric Universe,” Thornhill
asks, “When we apply force to a body,
how is that force transferred to
overcome inertia? The answer is
’electrically’ by the repulsion between
the outer electrons in the atoms closest
to the point of contact. The equivalence
of inertial and gravitational mass
strongly suggests that the force of
gravity is a manifestation of the
electric force.” Today,
Bishop Nicholas Sykes further elaborates
the query he first posed in his
previous episode:
”What is the speed of Gravity?” and he
elaborates the explanations for gravity
that the Electric Universe proposes.
My last Space News video about the light
exceeding [the] speed of gravity, titled “What is
the Speed of Gravity?” provoked some
reactions. Someone wondered if I have
never heard that gravity was not a force,
but the bending of the fabric of
Space-Time. Another argued that gravity
did not need explanation, because it was
something that was “just there”
Einstein's proposition that nothing can
travel faster than light, has become so
entrenched that even some of us
identifying with the EU model as a whole,
find it difficult to give fair
consideration to the claim that gravity,
operating as a real force, requiring a
real explanation, necessitates a real
transmission, far greater than the speed
of light.
Yet, even if we are only at the beginning
of providing such
an explanation, it is important for the
integrity of the EU model, to adhere
always to a simple force-based model for
gravity, because gravity does, when all is
said and done, manifest itself to our
senses as a force. The Electric Universe
model is constructed with explanations
that invariably exclude “just there”
formulations, which are in effect widely
used agreements to discard the need for
rational explanation. As a result of such
agreements, the scientific landscape is
littered with such follies as black
holes, dark matter, dark energy,
multiverses, and magnetic reconnection,
all of them being “just there”
formulations, without rational
explanation, designed to plug the holes
in popular science theory with the
unexplainable. Sir Isaac Newton
understood that he was unable to
formulate an explanation for
gravitational attractions, even while he
described the behavior mathematically of
bodies under gravitational influence
over vast distances with astounding
accuracy. He speculated on gravity’s
cause, but decided to leave that issue to
a future generation, who might bring
better tools than his, to master the task.
Our own generation does indeed have
better tools than his, but we have become
distracted from the task he and others
bequeathed to us, by a multitude of
follies. These consist of the
extraordinary plethora of the “just there”
formulations that prevent us from
accomplishing what Newton and others
bequeathe to a future age. If one reads the
book “Relativity” by Albert Einstein
published for example in 2004 by the
Folio Society, one will see that he
develops the concept of light or
electromagnetic radiation, being the
fastest possible messenger, merely by
assuming that, since nothing was observed
to go faster than light, then there is
no credibility to the idea that anything
could go any faster than light. In
chapters 7, 8 and 9, for instance, he
assumes that information from two
simultaneous flashes of lightning could
never by principle, reach an observer
any faster that light speed in a vacuum.
From that simple idea, the whole theory
of relativity was developed, starting
with the deduction that two simultaneous
events in one frame of reference, might
not be simultaneous in a different frame
of reference. The theory of relativity as
conceived by Einstein depended therefore
entirely on the idea that one could
never make deductions about space and
time that might ultimately rest upon
anything going faster than the speed of
light. It is, therefore, illogical to
assert, without any other reason for
doing so than the theory of relativity
itself, that nothing can go faster than
the speed of light. To make such an
assertion would be to engage in a
tautology, i.e. circular reasoning, because
the theory of relativity is founded upon
that assertion in the first place.
Only if the theory were independently
and incontrovertibly verified by
observation or experiments, might this be
reasonable. And such is often assumed to
be the case as Einstein himself hoped
that it would be. But so far as I'm aware
there is not a single case of this
theory’s verification that may not
reasonably be disputed. Under these
circumstances therefore, it is entirely
scientific to consider the possibility
that there may well be something
observable or reasonably deduced
traveling at a speed faster than light.
As has already been indicated in my
videos, the motion of the planets in the
solar system requires that the force of
gravity between the Sun and its planets,
assuming as we must, that this is a
real force and not a mental construction
of some kind, must be transmitted between
them at a speed of many orders of magnitude
faster than the speed of light. And the
physicist Wal Thornhill shows also that
such speeds of force transmission are
just as necessary within what we call
the fundamental particles of matter for
the stability of those sub atomic
structures, as it is for the stability of
stellar planetary systems. Indeed, by such
concepts, the physical foundation of the
mathematical structures of quantum
mechanics may yet be revealed and made
clear in a way similar perhaps to the
clarification of the physical foundation
to Sir Isaac Newton's “Mathematical
Principles” of gravitational action that
great task that he and others bequeathe
to generations yet to come. In such
manner, the Electric Universe model holds
out a great promise; the promise of a
physics and a cosmology that rest upon a
secure foundation to replace what is
taught in our prestigious schools, the
current model, which as Einstein himself
discerned, relies upon two foundations:
the Theory of Relativity and Quantum
Mechanics that are themselves mutually
irreconcilable.

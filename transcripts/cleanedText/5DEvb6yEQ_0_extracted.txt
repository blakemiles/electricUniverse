Stephen Smith on Planetary Catastrophism &
Electrical Scarring of Planets and Moon - Part One
Scientists now working with
the Thunderbolts Project
have proposed a new theory of our
Solar System and its history.
In the relatively recent past,
only thousands of years ago,
several planets moved on unstable paths and
engaged in violent electrical exchanges.
However, the apparent clockwork
regularity of planetary motions today
precludes many scientists from
considering the planetary instability.
But let us consider the evidence
that these events did in fact occur.
In part one of this
extended interview,
Thunderbolts Picture Of the Day
managing editor, Stephen Smith,
offers an introduction to the
theory of planetary catastrophism
and the electrical scarring
of planets and moons.
We begin by asking the question,
where did this theory of recent
celestial catastrophe come from?
It's difficult to say exactly where
the idea of electrical scarring arose
since there have been myths as far back
as we can trace that talk about Gods
hurling energetic weapons at one
another and striking various objects
like the Moon or the Earth.
The myth of Phaeton and Helios
comes to mind as an example
of an Earth-based
catastrophic event.
Phaeton, as most people realize,
stole the sun-god's chariot
and he lost control and
steered close to Earth
causing a disastrous fire that, according
to Greek myths, was worldwide.
So from a scientific standpoint some
early proponents of planetary scarring
were probably people
like Ignatius Donnelly,
who in the late 1800s thought
that Earth in particular
had suffered a terrible catastrophe
involving the approach of a giant comet.
And then later, Immanuel Velikovsky
wrote 'Worlds and Collision'
where he proposed a
similar catastrophe
due to the interaction of
planetary bodies with Earth,
especially Venus and Mars.
The two theories, from Donnelly and Velikovsky,
have been expanded as time has gone on
and they've been modified because
planetary probes and solar satellites
have made essential discoveries
about the electrical nature
of planetary plasma-spheres.
Each planet, moon in the solar
system is pretty much immersed
in a sea of a great electric
field generated by the Sun.
And that field is formed because of the
action of electrically charged particles
streaming through
the solar system.
And that stream or actually a storm
of particles, is called the solar wind
and it's composed of plasma.
And plasma, you hear it often described
as the fourth state of matter,
but since it makes up more
than 99% of the universe,
in my opinion it should be considered
the first state of matter.
And as I just mentioned of course,
the Sun is an example of plasma.
Now the general idea that Earth
is somehow an electrical entity,
is probably thousands
of years old
but it's only been in the last hundred
years that scientists have given credence
to the possibility that we are
living in a dynamic solar system
where electricity is
an important factor.
The Sun's electric field extends
for billions of kilometers
and it influences the planets,
it influences their motions,
it influences how they
interact with each other
and it maintains the
various charge signatures
or electrical potential of
each of the planetary bodies.
Now, several members of
the Thunderbolts group
including Dave Talbott, Wal Thornhill,
Mel Acheson and me for that matter,
have come to the conclusion that
Earth and other planetary bodies
and moons in the solar system
were probably impacted by huge
bursts of electrical energy
sometime in the recent past and that
would be the fairly recent past.
And my personal opinion is that what we see
on various rocky bodies in our neighborhood,
was caused by the action of
gigantic lightning bolts
and clouds of electrically energized
plasma, rather than asteroid impacts.
Scientists on Earth were surprised
when space probes returned images
of heavily tortured
planetary surfaces
and enigmatic features that conventional
geologists have been unable to explain.
Planetary scientists were stunned by images
from the first flyby of Mars in 1964.
I think it was,
that was Mariner 4.
And in fact, the giant Valley,
Valles Marineris on Mars,
is named for that mission,
it's the Mariner Valley.
The surface of Mars was a complete
surprise to the mission team.
No one thought that Mars would look
more like the Moon than anywhere else.
So as far as lunar missions were
conducted in the 60s and 70s,
more craters on the Moon and
huge cracks and what they call
sinuous rills, were discovered there
and sinuous rills are
deep canyons on the Moon
and they run for a thousand kilometres
or more through the terrain.
And one of the most puzzling
things about some of the rills
is that they go
uphill and downhill.
If they were formed
from flowing lava,
then they certainly defy the laws
of physics, that's for sure.
So Mars and the Moon have a
lot of similar structures.
Mars exhibits sinuous
rills just like the Moon.
They wind across its surface
for great distances
and I might say also that the moons of
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune
also possess nearly
identical features.
On Jupiter's moon Europa, for example, deep
rills nearly cover its entire surface.
On Dione, one of Saturn's moons, there are
cliff faces that crisscross the landscape
and what they do is they outline gigantic
fissures that are many kilometers deep.
So you could name practically
any moon in the solar system
and I could point out features
that are difficult to explain
when we rely on
conventional theories.
For generations, geologists have
envisioned planetary landscapes
shaped incrementally
over eons of time.
But does this approach
actually explain
what we see on Earth and
other planetary bodies?
Most children are taught geological
theories on a simplistic level
when they enter
elementary school.
They're taught about erosion, the principle
that wind and rain are natural processes
that take millions of years to create
the various formations on Earth.
I remember being taught that rain is a
carbonic acid solution that dissolves rock.
It changes that to carbon
dioxide and other minerals
that gets swept down into the
rivers and then to the ocean.
This weathering is thought by conventional
geologists, to erode the mountains
in time spans that they mark as
hundreds of millions of years.
And that's rain and then wind is
supposed to carry dust particles in sand
that scour away cliff faces.
It's slowly eroding them down.
Steep valleys are said to
gradually become shallow meanders
and sharp mountains flatten out into
rolling hills that eventually disappear.
Freezing water expands pushing
cracks and boulders apart every winter
and after millions of years they're
said to crumble into pebbles
that pile up into mountains of gravel
and form sandy beaches or desert dunes.
But since the earliest days of the
Thunderbolts Project there's been a suspicion
that something's really wrong with
that long slow view of geology.
Now I know it seems like what
I'm saying is far too sweeping
and that I'm trying to supplant so-called
normal geological processes
with unproven hypotheses,
but since I can only provide a cursory
view of these ideas during the interview,
it's important to take what
I'm saying at face value and
the listeners should look into the matter
more closely when they have the opportunity.
I've written scores of papers
that discuss these ideas
so they'd be a good
place to start.
Some of the most interesting things
I've discovered in my research are,
for example, forests of mineralized trees
under some of the deepest ice in Antarctica.
Cores that they've drilled through
the ice sometimes contains scorched
and petrified wood when it's
brought up to the surface.
Mineralized trees are also prevalent
in the Prairie, in the American Prairie,
and elsewhere in the world.
They're called petrified forests
and they often contain thousands
of shattered and splintered
tree trunks that have
been turned to stone.
There are fossilized animals in
literally unbelievable numbers
encased in sedimentary rock
that's been hardened into stone
and these deposits are
hundreds of meters thick.
And you can find millions
of fish skeletons
that look like they're
swimming through sandstone.
So I ask what force
can fossilize fish
leaving their skeletons
in lifelike postures
as if they were killed and
turned to stone in an instant?
How could it keep them whole without
being crushed or scattered?
Also there's anomalous formations on
Earth that can't be readily explained
and some of them I've written about would
be like the great Trango Tower in Pakistan,
the Brandberg Massif in Namibia,
Shiprock - New Mexico,
Ayers Rock,
the Olgas in Australia,
mount Thor on Baffin Island,
then Table Mountain in
South Africa for instance.
Now when the Cassini space probe
entered orbit around Saturn,
it found that several of Saturn's moons
also demonstrated electrical scarring.
There's signs of electric
discharge machining everywhere.
Cathode sputtering, anode
blisters and sinuous rills.
They're cut into those moons.
For example, Tethys
is a moon of Saturn.
It's only about a thousand
kilometers in diameter,
yet it's got huge scars on its
surface in comparison to its size.
Saturn's other moons exhibit the
same difficulties with scale,
moons of small mass with craters and canyons
that are hundreds of kilometers wide.
On Tethys, for example,
there's Ithaca Chasma
and the Odysseus multi-ring
formation, as it's called.
Now, Odysseus is 400 km wide.
And remember Tethys itself
is only 1,000 km in diameter.
Odysseus has steep walls, its interior is
flat, it has wide terraces along its walls
and in the center is a
circular mountain range.
They call it the crown of Tethys and it's
more than 5 km high and 100 km in diameter.
Ithaca Chasma, that
I just mentioned,
is 1,000 km long and 100 km
wide and it's also 2 km deep.
So since frozen, barren, airless moons and a
warm, water-rich, oxygen planet like Earth
are home to bizarre landforms and
structures that defy convention
I think it's a mistake to use
Earth-based geological theories
as a model for the formation
of what we see out there.
Rather I think we should
do the exact opposite
and use what we find in the Solar System
to model the topography of Earth.
Scientists generally
envision only two processes
when explaining craters
on planetary surfaces,
impacts and volcanism.
But countless crater formations
routinely defy these explanations.
As far as craters on planets and
moons, those are easy to see
because the moon is so close to
us that we can get some idea of
what a heavily cratered
body might look like.
But contrary to the
impact of giant asteroids
or extinct volcanoes being
the cause of these craters,
they have highly
anomalous features.
For example, they have flat,
melted-looking floors.
They have very
steep sidewalls.
Now you would think that an impact
would create a conical formation
that's rather chaotic-looking and
not leave vertical sidewalls
on the sides of a flat
melted crater floor.
There's also a lack of blast
debris around the crater.
There's no giant fields of boulders and
dust starting out with large objects
and then tapering off to small
objects around these craters.
In fact, the surroundings look like they're
as clean as the crater floors themselves.
There are also dendritic
ridges extending up the sides
and I know Dave Talbott has done quite
a bit of research on dendritic ridges,
particularly on Mars.
But those same dendritic
ridges are found on the Moon
and they're also found on the crater
walls on other planetary moons.
Some of the craters have
ramparts around them,
in other words, the crater
is inside of a raised mound
and surrounding sometimes
these ramparts are moats,
their deep trenches carved around
the exterior of the crater walls.
Craters (lay) often have
offset multiple rings.
Just like I mentioned
earlier on Tethys,
craters have central
peaks or bulges.
Now a lot of planetary scientists
claim that those peaks or bulges
are due to what I call it,
what's called rebound effect,
that when an asteroid hit, it
melted the surroundings and it
started to rise up like you sometimes
see slow-motion films of water-drops,
where they rise up and leave
a peak in the center, briefly.
And they contend that that's been caused
by the same sort of rebound effect.
However, those central Peaks
are often steep and sharp.
They have flat sides, there
are often multiple peaks
and a lot of times the bulges
in the centers of craters
are criss-crossed
by deep channels.
So I don't understand how any of
that sort of formation could exist
when you're talking about a
rebounding liquid that then hardens.
You would think it would be a slumped-looking,
rounded, relatively coherent looking bulge
and not these trenched bulges
or sharply pointed peaks.
Another interesting thing about
craters on the moon and other bodies,
is that they have hexagonal
or other polygonal shapes.
I've seen craters on Mars, for
example, that are square!
So I have no idea how an impactor is
going to leave a hexagon or a square
when it strikes a solid surface.
There's closely spaced
chains of craters.
You have smaller craters on
the rims of larger craters
and in fact that seems to
be a preferred formation.
When you look at craters
on Mercury, for example,
you see these wide-angle views that show
hundreds of craters within the field.
On more than half of them, you see multiple
craters on the rims of larger craters.
The craters often have
scalloped edges too,
like they've been cut out
with a cookie cutter
and one of the perfect examples of
that is Victoria crater on Mars
that a lot of people are probably
familiar with. It got a lot of press
when the Opportunity Rover parked
on its edge for quite some time.
Unbeknownst to many
scientists today,
experiments with both plasma discharge
and electrical discharge machining
have reproduced many of the cratering
patterns that defy conventional reasoning.
Plasma discharges are scalable.
When you look at formations created
in the laboratory, for example,
Dr. C.J. Ransom at Vemasat labs
performed several experiments
where he blasted different materials
with rapid electric discharges
at a very short duration.
He formed domed craters. In other
words, you've got a big old crater
with a melted looking interior
and a dome in the center
and those formations can be seen on
Mars, particularly at the South Pole.
He formed bullseye craters, that is craters
with multiple rims, one inside the other.
He created various sample materials, sandstone
and calcium carbonate and other materials
that might be found
on planets and moons,
and when he exposed them to these
fast transient electric discharges,
he created a lot of different
formations that we see.
It's not exactly electric
discharge machining
but electric discharge machining
is an industrial process
where they use high-energy electrical
discharges to machine metal.
And they use it because it gauges
out tiny little pits in the metal,
leaving very, very
smooth surfaces.
So they can make very complex metallic forms
that don't require a lot of finishing.
And when you look at some of these
surfaces under an electron microscope,
and then compare, for example, some
of the formations on Mars, it looks,
you could almost tell that Mars must have
also been electrically discharge-machined.
Since the Earth and all of the bodies
within the Sun's electrical domain
are electrically charged,
it is not surprising that we see ample proof
of electrical scarring happening today
on a smaller scale.
You do see electrical scarring as I
would call it, on comets, for example.
I would say that we've been fortunate in
this time that we've been able to send
spacecraft out to different comets
and observe their features.
One of them, that Wal Thornhill wrote
about extensively, was comet Wild 2.
And Wild 2 is a perfect example of the
electric discharge machining hypothesis
because its surface, rather than being a
slushy snowball with a bit of dirt in it,
looks like it's hot and
dry, more like an asteroid.
And when you look at its
surface and compare it
to some of these electric discharge
machined metals, they look very similar.
The comet Hartley 2 also revealed
what could be considered
an active process of electric
discharge machining on its surface,
because one of its ends
was glowing brightly
as if it was being eroded
by a plasma discharge.
We didn't get any close-up
views of that end of the comet
but surrounding it was a
cloud of ultrafine dust
that had been presumably
machined off the surface.
Now also you can look at moons
like Io, Jupiter's moon Io,
and you can see that there are what
they call, volcanoes on its surface
but these volcanoes are so hot
that any imaging by any spacecraft
of these formations has overloaded the
camera because they're so bright.
In fact all the images that you see on the
web, of Io's volcanoes, are false color
because the camera imaging system
simply could not resolve the interior,
they were so bright.
Now as Wal Thornhill
has pointed out,
because these formations
tend to move around on Io
these are probably
the touchdown points
of vast electric circuits that are
occurring between Io and Jupiter.
And in fact, Io moves through
the magnetosphere of Jupiter
and it acts like
an induction motor.
It's actually creating current
flow between it and Jupiter,
that are millions of
amperes in power.
So I would say that Io and Wild 2 and comet
Hartley and as well as, for example,
Saturn's moon Enceladus with
its bright plumes of vapor
that are being machined
off its surface,
are excellent examples of what might be
happening currently in the Solar System.
However, I should point out that some of
the things that I've been discussing
on Mars and Earth and
Venus or Mercury,
those events are orders of magnitude
greater than anything we can see now
because we're presuming
a Solar System
that was far more electrically
active at some time in the past.

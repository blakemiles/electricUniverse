Previously I promised to talk about what the James
Webb Telescope may tell us about newborn planets
and the subsequent formation of
planetary systems. I said and I quote,
”It includes the formation of the solar
system and the recent history of the Earth.
It's a cosmology that involves us.” End quote.
Those who have watched the feature-
length videos on the Thunderbolts
website, Symbols of an Alien Sky
and The Lightning Scarred Planet Mars,
may appreciate the extent of the
revolution in all the sciences and humanities that
are implied by the Electric Universe paradigm.
Fred Hoyle in 1950 expressed it well,
open quote, “...if there is one important
result that comes out of our inquiry into
the nature of the universe, it is this:
when by patient inquiry we
learn the answer to any problem,
we always find, both as a whole and in
detail, that the answer thus revealed is finer
in concept and design than anything we could
ever have arrived at by a random guess.”
End quote. Thankfully, the 10 billion dollar 
James Webb Space Telescope has been
successfully launched towards its parking
spot, 1.6 million kilometers away.That's
about four times the distance to the moon.
We are told it will take a month to get
there and another five months before its infrared
eyes are ready to start scanning the cosmos.
In a high-stakes quest to behold light
from the first stars and galaxies
and to scour the universe for hints of life.
The technology is amazing, but the
real science that is needed to properly
understand the observations is non-existent.
Our SAFIRE plasma experiment proved
that astrophysicists don't understand
stars and their source of radiant energy.
The notion of first light is based solely
on the Big Bang creation myth which
I dealt with in part one of this series.
As for gravitational cosmology,
Newton's view of gravity has only been
shown to work in the solar system
and Einstein's warped view of gravity in
his non-physical theory of space and time
did away with Newton's force of gravity,
the force we experience every waking moment.
Einstein stopped doing science by
elasticizing the fundamental standards of length
and time. At the same time quantum theory divorced
physical cause from effect, which is fundamental
to science. So it is no surprise that recent
articles declare an emergency in Big Bang cosmology
and often no obvious way out of the dead end.
Meanwhile, all other creation myths from
around the world have been shown by scholars to
have a common origin in a celestial cosmology that
is ignored, while featuring identifiable planets
battling with strange-looking
thunderbolts in a doomsday sky.
The creation stories tell of the
establishment of the present sky
following a period of apocalyptic chaos.
Rationally, those stories can have
nothing to do with the creation of the universe.
On 1 December, 2021 New Scientist published
an article titled, ”Is our solar system a cosmic
oddity?” Evidence from exoplanets says yes.
The author goes on to suggest that the
story of the formation of the solar
system has started to look like a fairy tale.
It is in fact a bedtime story invented
to make us feel safe, because 
the echoes of those creation
events have imprinted an instinctive
existential fear in humans
which we see manipulated by many
unprincipled leaders throughout history.
The solar system has a frightful recent
history that is essential to grasp
before we have any hope of understanding
exoplanetary systems, ourselves,
or life in the universe. The hopes 
and massive investment in the
James Webb Space Telescope will not benefit us all
without real science to understand the observations.
So an introduction is essential, because
the events I'm about to describe and
explain in the upcoming new year episode,
is so different to anything you have heard before.
The panorama is both breathtaking 
and disturbing. It changes everything.
In part two of this series on the discoveries
available to the James Webb Space Telescope,
I explained the simultaneous electric
birth of stars and gas giant planets in
molecular clouds. This has now been
essentially confirmed by a report this
week in phys.org, whereby up to 170
free-floating Jupiter-sized planets have
been found 420 light-years away
in a star cluster in the Milky Way.
This number greatly exceeded expectations.
They were only found because they were
hot enough to glow in infrared light.
It's assumed they were born recently and
it is only their natal heat that allows us 
to see them. But in an electric galaxy, all
free-floating bodies will intercept some
electrical energy sufficient to heat
them. So, they are not steadily cooling
and their age is indeterminate. But this
discovery raises serious problems for
the standard hypothesis that such bodies
formed by gravitational accretion about a bright
star and subsequent ejection by planet-to-
planet scattering. In the Electric Universe of
electric stars, these free-floating Jupiter-sized
planets are formed singly or in pairs at the 
low end of the brown dwarf star masses.
In my previous Space News I wrote and I
quote, ”These stars are arguably the most
important target for the infrared James
Webb Telescope because they are the most
numerous and some of the closest stars to us.
The telescope should confirm that all brown
dwarfs against giant-sized bodies
enclosed in a huge red anode glow.
To give some idea -- if Jupiter's present invisible
plasma sheath will lit up, it would appear in
the sky at opposition the size of the Sun.
Brown dwarfs are simply small red giants.”
In December 1999, I published, “Other stars,
other worlds, other life?” on my Holoscience
website. There I wrote, Open quote, 
“In the last few years a new
class of faint stars has been discovered.
They are called L-type brown dwarfs,
because the element lithium appears in their 
spectra. They are the most numerous stellar
objects in the galaxy and bridge the gap
between stars and Jupiter-sized planets.
They are too small to be shining from
internal thermonuclear power.
A further puzzle is that they radiate
blue and ultraviolet light even though
they are cool at a temperature of around 950K.
Water molecules dominate their spectra.
All of these puzzles are simply
explained by an electric star.”
And I note here, in 2019 it was shown
that lithium is produced by low-energy
nuclear transmutation in the
SAFIRE plasma reactor. I continue.
”There is no lower limit to the size of a
body that can accept electric power from
the galaxy so the temperatures of smaller dwarfs
will range down to levels conducive to life.
The light of a red star is due to the
distended anode glow of an electrically
low-stressed star. The blue and ultraviolet
light come from a low energy corona.
Since an electric star is heated
externally, a planet need not be
destroyed by orbiting within its anode glow.
In fact, life is not only possible inside
the glow of a small brown dwarf, it seems far
more likely than a planet orbiting outside a star.
This is because the radiant energy
arriving on a planet orbiting inside a
glowing sphere, is evenly distributed
over the entire surface of the planet.
There are no seasons, no tropics and no ice 
caps. A planet does not have to rotate; its
axis can point in any direction; and its orbit can
be eccentric. The radiant energy received by the
planet will be strongest at the
red and blue ends of the spectrum.
Photosynthesis relies on red light.
The sky’s light would be a pale purple
the classical purple dawn of creation.
L-type brown dwarfs have a water as a
dominant molecule in their spectra, along
with many other biologically important
molecules and elements. Its children
would accumulate atmospheres, and water
would mist down. It is therefore of particular
interest that most of the extrasolar planets
discovered are gas giants,
several times the size of Jupiter,
orbiting their star extremely closely.
It is our system of distantly orbiting
planets that seems the odd one out.
In fact, it argues in favor of a galactic
traffic accident between the Sun and a sub-brown
dwarf like Jupiter or Saturn.” End quote.
Since I wrote that article, there 
have been many developments.
For example the Kepler and TESS space
telescopes have discovered that hot
Jupiters are less common than previously thought.
And that so-called super-Earths are the
most numerous class of exoplanet.
The most important developments in
Electric Universe thinking is a more
mature understanding of electro-gravity,
supported by the general electrodynamic
theory of the great experimental
scientist of the 19th century Wilhelm Weber, 
together with the observations of the
modern day Galileo, Dr. Halton Arp.
Unlike the Big Bang, unbalanced universe,
the Electric Universe is in balance
with a dipole of gravitational force
which is identical to the magnetic force,
but manifests weakly due to the
gravitational distortion of the electrical
structure within the electron and proton
inside the atoms of a celestial body.
The gravity of that body is established
initially by the powerful long-range
electromagnetic convection of matter
into the center of the Birkeland current
filament in a molecular cloud.
Being a dipole electric force,
the gravity of a star or planet
will change with changes to the
surface charge of that body.
This provides the essential feedback mechanism
required for the ready capture of passing bodies
and the rapid stabilization of orbit.
Halton Arp provided a fundamental
benchmark for real cosmology, when he
found that the universe is not expanding.
It is balanced and requires a repulsive
gravity to explain his extensive observations.
The Electric Universe had to meet that
observational benchmark and it does so
for the simple reason that all celestial
bodies will be spherically polarized
with the same gravitational pole facing 
outwards. They will repel each other.
Every ponderable body is subject to 
that repulsive force of gravity from all of
the other matter in the universe -
a manifestation of Mach's principle,
which results in gravity appearing to be an
attractive force. This attribute is essential to
understand our survival of the planetary
close encounters recorded by our prehistoric
myth makers, and memorialized
by cultures around the world.
It explains why the first civilizations
arose suddenly in a thunderclap
following those events. The unexpectedly large
number of free-floating Jupiter-sized planets in a
single nearby star cluster
announced in the phys.org report,
has particular significance for our Electric Universe
cosmology. In the Electric Universe these objects
are not free-floating planets, but are 
in fact brown dwarf stars that glow in
infrared because they are receiving a low level
of electric power from the galactic circuit,
sufficient to establish a discharge,
manifesting as a red anode sheath.
Such objects form a reservoir of brown
dwarf stellar systems that could
encounter and become integrated into a more
powerful star system, like that of our Sun.
That there are so many of them goes to explain why
such an event is not only plausible, but inevitable.

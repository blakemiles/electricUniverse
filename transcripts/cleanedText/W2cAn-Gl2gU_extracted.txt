To understand more of the predictive
analytics of the Doherty set and how it
applies to the Electric Universe model,
I will now proceed to show off 10 real-
world applications and examples of magneto-
hydrodynamic currents, flows and patterns.
But first, I will simplify our understanding
of what exactly the Doherty set is.
The set is simply the next iteration
of the fruit-of-life and flower-of-life
sequences that so many of us are already familiar 
with. The flower-of-life is an ancient motif found
all over in temples and other
holy places throughout the world.
This concept is very important, but 
if you just take it one step further
and take the fruit-of-life seen here and rotate it on
top of itself, one layer after another layer, using the
inverse square Bessel function as a
parameter, it constructs the Doherty set.
We will get more into this later in this
episode when we explore Theodohertian roots.
So that's how you construct the Doherty set.
It's all one over r, just as Don Scott reiterated so
eloquently in his latest video. Perhaps this geometry
provides the rotation and origin of spin, as Birkeland
Currents that professor Don Scott just hypothesized
as well. It certainly does make sense that this
emergent dynamic geometry is fundamental
in the construction of Birkeland Currents.
Since this show is all about magnetohydrodynamic
flows, let's define what magnetohydrodynamics is.
Magnetohydrodynamics is the study of the flow 
of electrically conducting fluids in the presence of
magnetic fields. Models in which plasma is treated
as a perfectly conducting fluid, are the most
successful models for describing the equilibrium and
large scale stability properties of magnetized plasmas.
Examples of such magnetofluids include plasmas, liquid
metals, salt water and electrolytes, among others.
We will probably get deeper into these
flows in other episodes, but for now we
will begin with a simple water droplet in acoustic
levitation. Have a look-see how each of the
harmonics fit nested within the framework of the
Doherty set, even as the frequency increases.
These shapes are natural 3D cymatics. Now, let's 
imagine these shapes moving through tunnels.
Not just any tunnels, but tunnels in space,
connected directly to the universal electric circuit.
These plasma tubes, or currents, do indeed
exist and are called helicon waves. Waves exist,
and oftentimes make up the geometry of 
the entire structure of the current or flow.
Helicon waves are what we see as the
auroras and yes, they have a sound.
The literal sounds of the heavens.
So when we're viewing the auroras,
just know that they are literally 3D cymatics,
which brings us to the next type of current,
Birkeland Currents. Intricate 
geometric patterns persist in
and along Gaussian Bessel filaments or Birkeland
filaments. Like, for example, look at Saturn's north
pole. This hexagonal geometry was created
by, and persist due to Birkeland Currents
coming from the Electric Sun.
Look at the similarities all the way
down to the petals that propel the counter 
rotation. Let's bring it back down to Earth and
talk about the geometry of lightning.
Now we would assume that this wave-
nested-within-wave behavior that 
is indicative of Birkeland Currents,
would have a fundamental geometry that
would allow it to efficiently distribute
charge and that this caduceus-like
braiding would work all the way down
into the filament of lightning and indeed, 
it does. In a paper written by Wayne Burn
titled “Polygonal Crater Formation 
By Electrical Discharges”, he shows
that charge flows through lightning
in hexagonal tubes, or sheaths,
each layer in counter-rotation.
This is similar to all the other flows
that we've talked about thus far.
Evidence of this geometry of polygonal
cratering can be found all over 
the planets, including the moon.
This process is also known as “electrical
scarrification”. Further proof of this geometrical
process of charge and charge separation
can be found in Theodohertian roots.
Theodohertian roots are extremely easy to
understand, and just like the water droplet, they
increase the [number] of sides,
incrementally along with the harmonics.
First, charge neutrality seeks edges as
we just saw in lightning. Knowing that,
we begin using regular polygons. Then 
we nest the polygons equally inside
each other, giving us the inverse
triangular, inverse square,
inverse hexagonal, etc. geometries.
We then bound, or circumscribe the
polygons, and this is what gives us the Bessel
function. Each one of these Bessel functions is
unique, just like our fingerprints,
and atomic uniqueness. From there,
we iteratively repeat the Bessel function,
cascading outward from the initial Bessel function.
It is this projective geometric
construction that forms the filament.
This is how to build the Doherty set and the first
principal geometries of Birkeland Current formation.
It is all cavitating. Along these filaments,
constructive and destructive wave interference also
occurs, which is largely responsible for the reality
we experience. Destructive interference is when two
waves traveling in the same direction, are aligned
at the crest of one wave and the trough of the other.
The waves cancel out. Constructive interference
is when two waves traveling in the same direction,
overlap and their crests combine to produce a
larger wave. For the next flow we have vortices,
chirality and cavitation. First, observe 
our polar vortices and the magnetosphere.
Now, observe the “vortexture” of the Doherty 
set overlaid. It's literally like a “vorchestra”.
The “vorchestra” can be thought of like the
fascia - the sheath of stringy connective tissue
that surrounds every part of your body.
It's electric and moves all of our
thoughts through our body, along this
entire organ, at the speed of light. But
this “vorchestra” is on all scales,
connecting everything in the cosmos.
Another term for this is also the “cosmic connectome”.
We can see the electromagnetic field creates the form,
and the shape has power. The 
chirality of the vortex spinning
clockwise or counterclockwise, is another
electromagnetic force, often controlled
by the Coriolis effect. These vortices form on
all scales, from the galactic to the cavitation of
microspires. For this next example, we will
combine a few of the previously mentioned flows.
In 2016, researchers discovered a new type of 
fire - blue whirls. Blue whirls are a swirling flame
phenomenon that evolves from a chaotic fire
whirl and burns with nearly soot-free combustion.
Supercomputer simulations have revealed the 
flame structure and flow structure of the blue whirl.
At this point, I had already been sketching this
shape for years, and I knew of its importance in the
grand scheme of things. So in 2017, I published a
paper exposing the taxonomy of opposed spiral vortices
of the blue whirl to be composed of
a set of six opposed spiral vortices.
In 2019, a paper published by Cornell
University shows that the vortexes of
the blue whirl are composed of three different 
flames. And so we're getting somewhere with the
predictive power of the set. Speaking of
prediction, this geometry predicts that the base of
Birkeland Currents or how a Birkeland
Current nests and stacks on the poles,
is similar to the shape of a blue whirl.
This heterodyning, phase-conjugate
stacking reminds me of something else. Phase 
conjugation is multiples of the Golden Mean.
Surprisingly, another current that this shape
shows up in, is in Elon Musk's SpaceX Raptor
engine test. This particular shape is
indicative of minimal energy configurations
and also shows up prominently in lens flares, 
as well. A kink instability is a current-driven
plasma instability, characterized by
transverse displacements of a plasma
column's cross-section from its center of mass, without
any change in the characteristics of the plasma.
So basically, it's extremely similar to the
braiding of the caduceus, as seen here in the
Doherty set. This is the first 10 concatenations.
Concatenations are just a series of
interconnected things or events.
Currently, there is an unknown amount of
pairing and nesting of different sizes
of kink instability on all scales.
There's so much work that still needs to
be done on mapping out the infinite
amount of toroidal node, helical, coaxial coils.
And I stress that I say toroidal node,
because the helical filaments are
centered by nested [tori] and these
nested [tori] are also the repeating cosmic
Bessel function that any source star gives off.
For this last example, we have branching systems -
roots trees, distribution of matter in the universe,
Lichtenberg flow, or dendritic arborization.
It's been called many different things.
This shape takes place in many living things throughout
the Universe. It's one of the shapes that remind us
that everything is electric. Our synaptic brain
activity, our veins, our organs and even the
hypothesized dark matter that is
actually a Birkeland polyphase web.
So many things take on this beautiful shape in 
nature. Lichtenberg flows are often a sign of
living systems, or a vestige that living systems were
once there. All in all, cosmology is gorgeous and
filled with myriad flows. And once again, it is self-
evident that the Doherty set and the EU model itself,
provide a framework to help us
understand the intricate dynamic
geometries of magnetohydrodynamics on 
all scales, from the micro to the macro.

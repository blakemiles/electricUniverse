Welcome to Space News from
the Electric Universe,

On this series, we reported
on the increasing frequency
with which astrophysical
literature acknowledge a fact
which was long verboten
in the space sciences.
The existence of electric currents that
flow through the so-called vacuum of space.
At the vastest cosmic scales, many
astrophysicists now recognize the
"fundamentally electromagnetic
structure" of the stupendous jets
hundreds of thousands of light years long
emanating from active galactic nuclei.
At a much smaller scale, in our own
neighborhood in the solar system,
electric current systems are known to
link the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn
with their respective moons.
And on our own planet, in recent
years with improved technology
has come ever finer evidence of
tremendous electric currents
that are connected to
previously unknown phenomena.
In 2017, we reported on the discovery
of so-called supersonic plasma jets
high in the Earth's atmosphere
which reach temperatures
approaching 10,000 degrees Celsius.
A Phys.org report described the
surprising discovery as follows,
"The theory that there are
huge electric currents,
powered by solar wind and guided through
the ionosphere by Earth's magnetic field,
was postulated more than a century ago by
Norwegian scientist Kristian Birkeland...
While much is known about
these current systems,
recent observations...have revealed that they
are associated with large electrical fields."
Nevertheless, antiquated
notions of charge neutrality
and disconnected bodies in empty space
continue to dominate the space sciences.
In this episode, our guest Richard Moore
explores the role of electric currents
called Birkeland currents throughout
our electric solar system.
We're on the verge of a paradigm
shift in cosmology
and it's being pursued
by the scientists
that are putting together something
called the Electric Universe model.
And it's really rather unique
kind of collaboration going on,
kind of ironic collaboration,
where the EU scientists
are pursuing the theory
and doing experiments that can
be done in the laboratory.
And then meanwhile, the
mainstream cosmologists
who completely dismiss the model
or even ignore it entirely,
ironically they are helping develop the
EU model with all of their space probes
because every
single space probe
is, turns out to be confirming,
verifying the EU model
and even though that's happening
the mainstream still doesn't
recognize what they're doing.
So it's a very interesting kind of ironic
collaboration between pioneers on the one hand
and the mainstream people who don't
realize quite what's going on.
So it all started, I think, with
Kristian Birkeland way back in 1908.
Combination of experiments and
going out and observing the Aurora,
he came up with the theory
that the Auroras are caused by the
electric current from the Sun.
This was completely rejected
by the mainstream cosmologists
primarily by a man named Sidney Chapman who
really dismissed and attacked the whole idea
because the mainstream people didn't
believe that currents can flow through
what they thought
was empty space.
But then, in 2007, just
about a century later,
the THEMIS satellites found evidence
of what they called magnetic ropes
connecting the Earth's upper atmosphere
directly to the Sun.
In other words, they were confirming
Kristian Birkeland's original theory.
So what they did, they described
it as thirty kilovolt battery in the space
creating flux rope pumps
into the upper atmosphere.
Even though it was confirming
Birkeland's theories,
they didn't really quite see it as
currents, they saw it as magnetic ropes.
Now, the reason that the
current comes in at the poles
is because of the
Earth's magnetic field.
As the current comes
out from the Sun,
it's focused in by the
magnetic field into the poles.
These currents that come
from the Sun to the Earth,
the mainstream calls
that the solar wind
as if it was something blown away
from the Sun by kinetic forces.
They aren't really recognizing
that it's an electrical gradient
which is causing the current to flow
out to the Earth and other planets.
So now let's take a look at the
structure of the Birkeland current.
As a current flows through
plasma, it creates its own magnetic field
which contains itself, forces it to be
focused into these rope-like currents.
And in 2016, one of these
space probes found
that these rope-like
currents go into Saturn.
So it's showing that the currents go
all the way through the solar system
reaching even the outer planets,
just as they do with the Earth.
So again, mainstream cosmologists ignorant
of the properties of Birkeland currents
attribute this rope shape to an imaginary
thing they call magnetic reconnection.
In fact, in this image we can
see that there's a gradient
with the Sun being more positive and the
outer shell of the heliosphere more negative
so that there's this gradient
that forces electrons toward the Sun
and positive ions
away from the Sun.
So what they call a wind is
actually an electrical gradient
which is what causes these
currents to come out from the Sun.
And then, another probe, we
can see in this NASA study,
they found that there's a
flow of electrical energy
that goes by every moon, every
planet, every asteroid and comet,
are all influenced in one way
or another by these currents
which the mainstream
continues to call - a wind.
Now, let's look a little closer at
what a Birkeland current is like.
Each one of the
strands of the rope,
as we can see in this image and
looking at a cross-section,
it's made of concentric cylinders of current
that rotate in alternate directions
and we can actually, again, with
the help of mainstream probes,
we can see this counter rotation,
we can see it happening in
the Aurora on the Earth.
And then we can also see it in the
poles of Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune.
Clearly, these are all caused
by the same phenomenon,
these counter-rotating
Birkeland currents.
Now, in the case of
a planet like Mars,
where they don't have a
strong magnetic field,
in this image we can see that the aurora can
happen over the entire surface of the planet.
Since it's not focused
into the poles,
the current can come in
toward the planet itself
and we can see an aurora
over the entire surface.
Similarly, on Mars, because there's not a magnetic
field to constrain the currents to the poles,
we can have streams of currents
coming right down to the surface
and creating huge tornadoes,
electrical tornadoes that are many, many
times the size of any that occur on earth.
Now, let's move on now
to the effect on comets.
A comet is moving rapidly, you know,
it has a very exagerated eliptical orbit,
so that it's coming rapidly from the
negatively charged part of the solar system
toward the more
positively charged part.
And that causes the
comet to discharge
creating a tail that points in the
direction of the electrical field.
According to the EU model then,
the only difference between an
asteroid and a comet is the orbit.
It's not that there's any
difference in what they're made of,
it's just because a comet has an
exaggerated orbit and it discharges
whereas the asteroids, which are
comparatively circular in their orbit,
they don't discharge.
So, the mainstream has this theory
that comets are dusty snowballs
and they say the tail is due to
the sublimation of water.
However, when space probes have
actually reached a comet,
as we can see in this image, they can see
they're just rocky bodies, like asteroids.
They're not at all
dirty snowballs.
So, once again, the mainstream is confirming
and verifying with their probes
what the Electric Universe
has said all along.
As Arthur Schopenhauer said,
"All truth passes
through three stages.
First, it is ridiculed.
Second, it is violently opposed
and then third, it is accepted
as being self-evident.
Now, where we are right now is that the
EU model is being ridiculed and ignored.
It hasn't quite been violently
opposed yet because
it hasn't been acknowledged enough in
the mainstream to even be seen as a threat
but we can see by the trends that are
happening with these discoveries
that can't go on much longer.

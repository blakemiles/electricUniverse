ELEGANT SIMPLICITY
In the sciences,
that's the Holy Grail.
As mysteries arise seek out the root
causes, the gems in the rubble pile,
and then even the rubble
will begin to make sense.
Is it gravity that drives
the universe forward?
Within the space sciences, that's
long been a foundational assumption,
not to be questioned.
But is it true?
Or is there a deeper level at which gravity
itself is an effect, not a first cause.
Day-by-day this question
rises to the surface,
even taking center
stage on occasion.
Today's most inspired scientific discussion
places a spotlight on the electric force
acting at all scales
in the natural world.
The subjects range from the subatomic
domain and bio-electricity
up to galactic and
intergalactic space,
even including profound events
close to Earth in ancient times,
some affecting human
consciousness the world over
and provoking new interest today
in experimental verification.
With the introduction to the Electric Universe
comes a wave of realization and inspiration,
the signature of electrical events
is now more clear than ever
and the result is a scientific
revolution now well underway.
Come to our conference in June
and meet today's pioneers of
the Electric Universe paradigm.
June 17th to 19th,
in Phoenix Arizona.

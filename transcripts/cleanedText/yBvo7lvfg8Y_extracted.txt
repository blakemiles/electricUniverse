The question of the Sun's possible
role in triggering large earthquakes
is the subject of growing
scientific interests.
For decades, some have noted
a parent correlations
between dramatic solar
phenomena and seismic activity.
Yet definitive scientific proof of
a connection has remained elusive.
Recently, the founder of Suspicious
Observers Ben Davidson and colleagues
published a landmark scientific paper
revealing compelling statistical evidence
of a role of solar activity in
triggering large earthquakes.
We asked Ben to give us the latest
developments in his research
as well as a brief preview
of its forthcoming talk
at the Thunderbolts
conference Elegant Simplicity
taking place June 17th to
19th in Phoenix in Arizona.
The foundations for investigating
solar triggered earthquakes
were really a number of coincidences
that really just stood out among
what seemed like
otherwise random data
and suggested that solar phenomenon
could trigger earthquakes.
Now to just look at sunspots solar
flares or even its effects on Earth
you look at the geomagnetic index, how
many geomagnetic storms is it producing
what level, things like
that. Those are the main
things people look at when they're looking
at space weathering solar phenomena
and that's where a lot of the
odd coincidences can be found
but that's not where, you know,
that's not where you're going to find any patterns,
it seems like sometimes you can use those
things to predict earthquakes very well
and correlate a, you know, find a
relationship between the Earth and the Sun
and then other times it
appears not to be the case.
And so there's that question of why does there
appear to be this on off switch, sometimes
weeks at a time, sometimes months at a time
on and then off or, you know, weeks on or off.
And so we started to look beyond solar
flares and sunspots and things like that
because we really see all of
these things as symptoms
really, of something
else that's happening
and that is a polar magnetic
field cycle on the Sun.
This would be the solar polar fields that
come out of the polar regions of the Sun
and wrap around, you know,
towards the equator
and pretty much encompass
the entire solar system
coming out of the Sun's poles just like Earth's
magnetosphere comes out of Earth's poles.
Well this solar polar field cycle,
which is the 11 year cycle,
when it reverses is when we
get the sunspot maximum
and all the flares
and things like that.
Well not only are
sunspots and solar flares
and the resulting geomagnetic
activity at Earth
a function of this 11 year
solar polar field cycle
but even things like the
placement of coronal holes,
sector boundaries in the heliosphere,
current sheath, basically the
the magnetic character
of the solar wind,
the size and the position of the solar
prominences, often referred to as plasma filaments,
all of these things
are actually driven
by this underlying 11 year
solar polar field cycle
that is often ascribed to being
11 year sun spots cycle
but really it's it's the magnetic fields
on the Sun that are really driving that.
And when you look beyond the symptoms
like sunspots and solar flares
and geomagnetic activity to the
underlying thing that is driving
all of those things, the
solar polar magnetic fields,
you come to something that has never once been
analyzed in terms of earthquakes until now
and when it is analyzed you
find that this is so perfect
of a, of a place to start this
the sort of new field of science
that it really can't be ignored.
Somewhere between 88 and 90% of the
largest earthquakes in the world are
shockingly close to these polar
magnetic field cycle events
and so basically what I mean
by that is during the 11 years
that the cycle takes place we
get peaks in this magnetism,
the high points in the magnetism about
twice a year or about 6 months apart.
We get reversals, positive to negative,
negative to positive, about every 11 years.
These things do not exactly happen all
the time, they're spread far apart
and yet most of the major earthquakes on
the list are within just a handful of
days of these events that happened
6 months to years and years apart
and we have now completed our
forth study on this material
the first one was published last year that
was between myself, Dr Kongpop U-Yen,
who many in the EU
community know already,
and Dr. Chris Holloman, a statistics
professor from The Ohio State University
who actually, I was able to take the pattern
that we all were pretty sure we saw,
translated into mathematics and
actually proved that it was real.
Well since then we've done
subsequent analyses on...
on the Chile 8.3 in
September of 2015
we did a more longer-term analysis of
the solar polar fields just earlier,
earlier this spring, and just
in the last couple of days
the data has updated enough to show us
that the first great earthquake of 2016
the magnitude 7.8 that struck off the
coast of Indonesia on March 2nd 2016
was indeed occurring at a negative
peak in solar polar field magnetism
and it was a peak that actually had not
been matched on the Sun for 15 years
so that's another way of saying
that as the Sun, you know,
presents these different
levels of magnetism,
the Sun had not presented Earth with
this level of magnetism since 2001
at least in terms of
the negative polarity.
And it does appear, now that we've gotten a
little bit past that mark's second event,
that it was indeed a peak
in the fields cause since then the
the total magnetic field strength of
the Sun has been weakening somewhat
so that was a a long-term event and a
short-term significant event as well.
And it's looking like, based on the
limited data we have thus far,
this big one we just had in Ecuador
about a week and a half ago,
which was on the heels of that
deadly earthquake in Japan,
they happened just 24 hours apart,
it's looking like we're gonna have
another peak there as well so
we also just had the word come
in that that first paper,
the foundational one with myself, Dr.
U-Yen and the Dr. Hollomon
got its first citation, it was cited in a
paper that was published late in 2015
also talking about solar system
phenomena and earthquakes.
So what's, it really sort of came
out of the coincidences that
seemed to hint, that
Sun creates earthquakes
but guided by all of the very
convincing research that says, hey
you can't use sun spots
you can't use solar flares
you can't use geomagnetic activity
over long periods of time,
here is the data. Therefore we have to conclude
that there is no solar induced earthquakes.
Well, when you use that as your
guide and you realize
that all the things they're looking
at are really just symptoms
of the more driving,
underlying force on the Sun,
you begin to realize how this could have
been missed over the last few decades
and just how vital this
can be when you see how,
how well correlated the
Sun is with these large
oftentimes tsunami-
inducing earthquakes.
Once you've nailed down,
using solar phenomena,
the times when the Earth
should get more active,
you then need to be wondering where
this activity is most likely to strike,
where's this earthquake
gonna happen
and the single most promising
thing we've ever seen
came out of the Demeter satellite.
I believe t'was a French satellite
and it was detecting
ionosphere disruptions
that seem to occur before some
of the largest earthquakes.
Now some scientists have written
these off, others have been using them
to try to create an
earthquake forecasting system.
The problem is that for all the
times that this Demeter data
a couple, you know, at least a dozen
for all the times it was used
to publish papers on ionosphere
disruptions before earthquakes,
it was never once used to communicate
such a disruption to the world
as hey, watch out,
an earthquake may happen here.
A lot of this stems out of what happened
in Italy with the earthquake scientists,
a lot of folks are worried about, you
know, liability with things like that
and as of now there are some promising ideas
in terms of looking at the ionosphere
but they're in their infancy.
What may be a better thing to do is what
actually I'm trying to do right now.
Many folks who are listening to this will
know that we successfully completed
our second Kickstarter
campaign earlier this year,
we've raised $120,000 to create
the disaster prediction app,
and that is going
to do two things.
One, it's going to be using those space
weather phenomena we described earlier
to warn of times when Earth
is going to get more active
but also we're going to be tracking
the data that comes in on the GPS,
the magnetometer and on the EMF monitor
within most of these cell phones,
iPhones have all those and
many Androids do as well.
And so what we're going to be able to
do is, we're going to be able to see
when there are multiple signals from
different cell phones in a given area
that are showing the
same type of anomaly.
Maybe there's ten different
cell phones in Los Angeles
and all of a sudden their GPS says
they're in the Pacific ocean.
What are the chances that all ten got
catapulted thousand miles west at the same time.
Or perhaps there is a
magnetic field disruption
of a certain micro-Tesla that's
read by 20 cell phones in Seattle,
what are the chances they're all standing next
to the exact same microwave with the door open.
There are things like this where you start
to say okay, we can use some of these signals
because it's more than just the
ionosphere, we've seen everything from
animal behavior going wild to positive
ion emission prior to earthquakes
but also radio frequencies emerging
and, sort of, spiking in power.
You've seen magnetic field disruptions as
well and you've seen GPS disruptions,
just about every phone has a
GPS detector in it as well.
So what we're hoping to do is not wait to
install a bunch of very expensive machines
all over the world that may have to be recalibrated
if they get hit by lightning or something,
we are going to actually have this at monitoring
some of the electromagnetic conditions
around the globe around
these areas and hopefully
there will be enough people with
these things on their cell phones
that will be able to get some concrete data and
actually start to be able to predict locations.
So looking at the different
electromagnetic signals
and that really is the
only way to do this,
electricity is the great
snitch of the universe
she's gonna tell us pretty much
everything that's going to happen
we just have to learn how
to listen the right way.
In June this year I'll be giving
another talk, third year in a row,
at the Electric Universe
conference in Phoenix
and this year it's going to be a little
less specific and a little bit more
macro view of a lot of the things
that are going on in the community
and a lot of the paths forward
that seem to be most promising.
We have, on the horizon, a period of
great change as some of our leaders
will be looking to others to carry this story forward
as we look twenty, thirty years down the line
and so what does the future of
the Electric Universe look like,
and hopefully I'll be able to convince
everyone that it is a promising future
from a vastly interdisciplinary
field of view,
talking about a very broad range of
disciplines, a very broad range of interests
that are going to end up being advanced
and coming around to really embrace
some of the electric ideas that have been tossed
around in the community the last few years.

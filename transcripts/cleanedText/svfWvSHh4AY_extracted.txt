You have just entered
the theater of an alien sky.
If the words and images seem strange to
you, there's a reason for this -
our world was once
a vastly different place.
To experience this won't hurt you
and there is nothing to fear.
This little video will be the
first in a series looking
at celestial events that
changed human history
and catalyzed the birth
of the great civilizations.
Nothing I'll propose in this series
will be found in familiar text books
but the events can be
confirmed by factual
evidence. That means fundamental
facts that are not in dispute.
It happened just a few
thousand years ago
when we lived in the
presence of the gods.
Planetary powers ruled
the celestial theater
in the lost age of
gods and wonders.
Planets gathered in close
congregation, as if alive,
engaging each other
electrically.
But then the gods grew
violent and they went to war,
driving human witnesses to take shelter
in caves and rocky enclosures.
Humans left to remember - to
remember the powers of the gods -
formations and
cosmic events
not to be
forgotten.
Yes, how could we know how? How could we know
that extraordinary natural phenomena
in the sky above our early
ancestors provoked an
outpouring of human imagination? Of
course, the ancient witnesses did not
understand and they relentlessly
misinterpreted their experience,
but this experience was the most
awe-inspiring and terrifying occasion
in all of
human history.
Every ancient monument was, by
it's very nature, commemorative.
Every crowning of a king,
every sacred marriage,
every sacrifice to the gods,
every sacred temple and city,
every obelisk,
pyramid and tower
re-enacted a critical juncture in a
remembered age of gods and wonders.
This truth comes down
to us without exception.
And the over-riding, fatal
mistake in modern perception
is the assumption that
the mythic archetypes
can somehow find their explanation
in phenomena occurring today.
But the events that provoked the global
archetypes, and the entire symbolic
content of the
first civilizations
can be systematically
reconstructed.
Rational and well-established
principles will enable us to draw
reliable conclusions from a
crowd of unreliable witnesses.
That's the long-overlooked
truth of the matter,
and it's that message I intend to
confirm in this video series.
Not that long ago
our world was, indeed,
a very different place.

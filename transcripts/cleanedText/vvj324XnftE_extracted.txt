Observers of the spectacular northern
lights are offering new testimony
on the amazing sounds produced
from electromagnetic phenomena
in Earth's upper atmosphere.
Witnesses in Sweden reported hearing
sounds similar to so-called
'laser blasts' from
the Star Wars films.
A photographer and tour guide named Oliver
Wright was able to capture audio of the sound
which seemed to grow louder as witnesses
approached nearby power lines.
A link to the audio may be found in
the description box of this video.
This is hardly the first instance
that witnesses have reported
peculiar sounds associated
with intense auroral displays.
In fact dating back centuries,
long before the existence of
earthly transmission lines,
witnesses from the Arctic reported hearing
hissing, crackling or clapping sounds.
Recently, the scientific
mainstream has begun to recognize
that the audible phenomenon
is actually real.
In 2012 a team of scientists in Finland
discovered a pattern of audible clapping sounds
that appeared at times of
high auroral activity.
The lead investigator of the study
suggests that the phenomenon is:
"likely caused by the same
energetic particles from the Sun
that create the Northern
Lights far away in the sky.
These particles, or the geomagnetic
disturbance produced by them,
seem to create sound much
closer to the ground."
A space dot com report
on the study states:
"Scientists still aren't sure exactly
how the auroral sounds are created.
They can be quite variable,
ranging from claps and crackles to
muffled bangs and sputtering sounds.
Because of this sonic diversity, several
different mechanisms might be at work..."
The sounds produced by auroral activities
seem similar to the sounds reported
over many centuries, associated
with spectacular meteors.
Consider the case of the meteor explosion
over Peekskill, New York in 1992.
Witnesses reported electro static
crackling sounds for several seconds,
both before and after the
meteor's fragmentation.
Witnesses reported electro static
crackling sounds for several seconds,
both before and after the
meteor's fragmentation.
In the Thunderbolts Picture Of the
Day article "The Peekskill Meteor",
author Michael Armstrong
asks the question:
"Since the fragmentation took place at
an altitude of about 41.7 km in a vacuum
where there is not enough
atmosphere to carry sound,
how did this electrophonic noise
propagate for over 25 miles?"
In 1992, the scientific paper "Electrophonic
sounds from large meteor fireballs"
attempts to explain
the phenomenon.
The abstract of the paper reads:
"Anomalous sounds from
large meteor fireballs,
anomalous because they are audible
simultaneously with the sighting,
have been a matter for debate
for over two centuries.
Only a minority of
observers perceive them.
Ten years ago a viable physical
explanation was developed,
which accounts for the phenomenon
in terms of ELF/VLF radiation
from the fireball plasma being
transduced into acoustic waves
whenever appropriate objects happen
to be in the vicinity of an observer.
This explanation has now been verified
observationally and supported by other evidence
including the study of meteor
fireball light curves reported here."
Although mainstream science is now
recognizing the unusual sounds
associated with terrestrial Auroras and
meteoritic phenomena respectively,
many mysteries remain that demand
new theoretical perspectives.
In the early 20th century,
the Norwegian experimentalist and
electrical pioneer Kristian Birkeland
proposed that charged particles from the
Sun were the cause of auroras on Earth.
For decades the
scientific mainstream,
including the renowned
mathematician Sydney Chapman,
largely rejected
Birkeland's hypothesis
favoring instead the idea that Earth's
magnetosphere is an impenetrable envelope
squeezed by the solar wind
to induce auroral activity.
Only when satellites detected the
magnetic signatures of electric currents
in the Aurora in 1973 was Birkeland
hypothesis irrefutably validated.
But even today the scientific mainstream
resist the implications of the discovery.
Institutional science tells us that
charged particles from the Sun
accelerate along
magnetic field lines
and collide with oxygen and nitrogen
gas particles in our upper atmosphere.
The gas particles become
excited and release light.
But in recent years science discoveries
confirmed that the auroras
are the product of the electrical circuitry
between the Sun, Earth and all planets.
In 2007, NASA scientists
reported the discovery of
"giant magnetic ropes" that connect
Earth's upper atmosphere to the Sun,
and explosions in the outskirts
of Earth's magnetic field.
The rope-like structures, NASA
describes, are Birkeland currents
which are electrical current flowing
through the conductive medium of plasma.
Recently, professor Donald
Scott has published
his mathematical modeling
of Birkeland currents
and identified the tell-tale structures
of the currents in the upper atmospheres
at the poles of some planets,
including the Earth.
Visual proof of the Birkeland currents'
influence is counter-rotating bands
such as those seen on the screen
at the North Pole of Saturn.
Similar counter-rotation may be
seen in this particular video
of the Aurora Borealis on Earth.
Electromagnetic energy in
Earth's upper atmosphere
is also the cause of some of the sounds
associated with meteor explosions.
Standard theory tells us that friction
ablation causes meteors to glow,
flare and fragment as they pass
through the Earth's atmosphere.
But, as noted in the aforementioned
Thunderbolts article, The Peekskill Meteor;
"At about 50 km above
the Earth's surface,
is there enough material in space to
begin a friction ablation process
for an object
traveling 14.7 km/s?
If not, one is
justified to conclude
that electrical interaction took place
to initiate the glow and flareups."
In the Electric Universe view, any object
that comes far away from the Earth
is differently charged than
the Earth's plasma sheath
and the object will begin
to electrically discharge
as the difference between it and lower
layers of the sheath increases.
Again quoting the
Peekskill meteor article:
"...meteors and spacecraft trigger the
formation of instabilities in plasma layers.
The energy of the flickering and flaring,
as well as of the low-frequency radiation,
comes more from the ionospheric
plasma than from the meteoroid.
The meteors that we've come to think
of as 'burning up in the atmosphere'
may instead be the targets of mini-
thunderbolts from the ionosphere."
We also note the European Space
Agency surprising discovery in 2014
of a so-called "mysterious song"
emitted by the Comet 67P.
The song was detected in the form of
oscillations in the cometary magnetic field
at a level of 40
to 50 millihertz.
To make it audible
to human hearing,
scientists increased the frequencies
by a factor of about 10,000.
As one scientist said
of the discovery:
"This is exciting because
it is completely new to us.
We did not expect this
and we are still working
to understand the physics
of what is happening."
A space.com report attempts to
explain the finding as follows:
"The physical process is
somewhat difficult to understand
without a deeper understanding
of plasma physics,
but we can use a simple analogy to
have a better idea of what's going on.
Consider your garden hose.
If you start the water flow,
there's a chance that the hose starts
to oscillate, generating waves.
This is about what
happens in the plasma.
Of course, the flow we have in the
cometary situation is not like water,
but it's a flow of
charged particles..."
But somehow the
analogy is suitable.
The discovery of electromagnetically
produced sounds from comets, meteors,
and the Earthly auroras remain a
surprise to conventional science,
but they offer further proof of the
electrical connectedness between the Sun,
the Earth, and all bodies
in our Electric Universe.

A new scientific paper published in the
journal Science reveals yet another
major surprise from NASA’s Juno
mission to the gas giant Jupiter.
In 2019, the Juno spacecraft twice
flew past the extraordinary long-lived
anti-cyclone called the Great Red Spot, the 
longest enduring storm in the solar system.
The data reveals that the storm reaches
much deeper beneath Jupiter’s cloud
surface than space scientists can explain. A report
on the findings from sciencealert.com states,
”NASA’s Juno spacecraft zipped past the
Great Red Spot - an anti-cyclone large
enough to swallow Earth - twice in 2019.
Measurements from those flights are now
revealing the storm structure in far
more detail than telescope images can
show. That data suggests that the vortex
probably extends anywhere from 186 to
310 miles deep, far below Jupiter's clouds.”
”Mysteriously, the jet streams surrounding
the Great Red Spot extend even deeper - nearly
1,900 miles below Jupiter's cloud surface.
The researchers aren't sure why. They 
do know, however, that those jets -
distinct bands of gas wrapping around the
planet - are keeping the Great Red Spot alive.
The storm is wedged between two jet
streams that move in opposite directions,
powering the spin of the vortex...”
Juno scientist Marzi Parisi of JPL states,
”It's surprising that the Great Red Spot
goes so deep... but it's also surprising
that it doesn't go as deep as the jets...
So something is happening at 500
kilometers that is basically dampening the Great
Red Spot” Unbeknownst to the scientific press, this
discovery is yet another remarkable
affirmation of a long string of
predictions by the chief proponent of the
Electric Universe, physicist Wal Thornhill.
In July of 2017, in an interview on the
Thunderbolts series, Space News from the
Electric Universe, Thornhill made the following
statement. ”Plasma physicists have shown that
Birkeland currents draw the heavy elements
towards the centers of celestial bodies
and the gases form their atmospheres,
with hydrogen and helium outermost.
So the composition of Jupiter can't
be assessed from its atmosphere.
Jupiter is not mostly hydrogen and helium.
All of the issues raised mean Jupiter is
a solid shell composed of heavy elements.
It will have structure both on its
external and internal surfaces. Jupiter
 is not, as (Donald) Scott said of the
simplistic standard model,
’boring and uniform inside.
Anywhere you look will not look the same.’
Finally a word about Jupiter's Great Red
Spot. Its continued presence for
centuries is another argument for a
solid body beneath the clouds.
Its giant tornadic form is that of a
continuous electrical discharge vortex,
for an elevated surface feature acting
like a lightning rod. Which could be the
birth scar of one of Jupiter's moons.
The Juno spacecraft is due to observe
the Great Red Spot closely on its next
close encounter with Jupiter where I
expect even greater gravitational and
electromagnetic anomalies to be
found associated with the spot.”
Unfortunately, the electrical phenomena
that Thornhill explained and predicted
over four years ago, are not part of the
standard theoretical toolkit, and thus
were not on the table for
consideration by Juno investigators.
However, we have repeated ad nauseum
 on this series, that the only valid test of
a hypothesis is its predictive record.
By this standard, it becomes difficult to
rationalize institutionalized science's
continued disregard for the Electric
Universe and plasma cosmology. It 
is now worthwhile to review some of
the most “outrageous explicit
predictions” by Thornhill, later confirmed
by science discovery, and dating 
back over a quarter of a century.
As far back as the mid-1990s, prior to
the arrival of the Galileo space probe
in the Jovian system, Thornhill
registered several advance claims.
Following the lead of earlier investigators 
Dr. Thomas Gold, Dr. Anthony
Perratt and professor Alex Dessler,
Thornhill insisted that the so-called
”volcanoes” on Jupiter's moon Io are
actually electric discharge plumes.
He predicted that the so-called “volcanic
vents” would be much hotter than lava,
that the plumes are the jets of cathode
arcs and they do not explode from a
”volcanic vent”, but move around and
erode the periphery of dark areas which
planetary geologists call lava lakes. The 
so-called “lava lakes” themselves are
merely the solid surface of Io,
etched electrically by cathode arcs.
They would not reveal the expected
heat of a recent lava flow.
Each of these predictions received stunning
confirmation. Io's volcanic hot spots were not only
hotter than any lava on Earth but were too
hot to be measured by Galileo’s instruments.
In fact, no lava flow ever recorded has
produced temperatures as hot as seen in
the original Galileo image. Also, 
as predicted by Thornhill, the
discharging was found to be focused on
the edges of the so-called “lava lakes”,
though the rest of these dark
fields are comparatively cold.
None of the expected volcanic vents could be 
found. And in fact some of the volcanic plumes
were discovered to move across the surface 
of Io. It was also discovered that the plumes
emit ultraviolet light, something
inconceivable under normal conditions of
volcanic venting, but ultraviolet light is
of course characteristic of an electric arc.
Perhaps most significant of all, from the
electrical viewpoint, was the discovery
of filamentary structure in the plume
of the so-called volcano Vashtar.
To this day, planetary scientists admit
that filamentary structure simply has no
place in a volcanic plume and cannot be
explained. And yet, as noted previously by
Gold, Peratt and Deshler, it is the
distinctive feature of the penumbra of
an electric discharge. More 
than a decade and a half ago,
Thornhill offered an equally ”radical 
prediction” on the planet Saturn.
On February 5th, 2005 Thornhill published
his analysis of scientist discovery of a
“warm polar vortex” at Saturn’s south pole.
Thornhill offered a detailed electrical
interpretation of the phenomenon and
chastened investigators for referring to
the vortex as the “first to ever be
discovered in the solar system.” He wrote,
”Keck researchers don't seem to have
done their homework. Or maybe things that
can't be explained get forgotten!
Saturn's ‘warm polar vortex’ is not
’the first to ever be discovered.’ The 
Pioneer Venus Orbiter (PVO) discovered a
warm ‘giant vortex’ of surprisingly
complex structure and behavior located
in the middle atmosphere at the north
pole of the planet, with a similar
feature presumed to exist at the south pole
also.” On the question of Saturn’s strange
polar hot spot, Thornhill offered an explicit
prediction. He stated the Electric Universe also
predicts experimentum crucis that both poles
should be hot, not one hot and the other cold.
In 2008, the Reuters News Service
published a science headline, Scientists
Find Hot Spot On Saturn's Chilly Pole.
They wrote, “Saturn's chilly north pole
boasts a hot spot of compressed air, a
surprising discovery that could shed
light on other planets within our own
solar system and beyond.” Planetary
scientist Nick Teanby said of the
discovery, “We didn't expect it to have a
hot spot at the north.” Saturn's north
polar hot spot was a total surprise to
planetary scientists because the pole
had been deprived of sunlight since its
winter began more than 12 years earlier.
Another clue to the incoming electric
currents creating the polar hotspot, is the
long-lived hexagon, also at Saturn's north pole.
While planetary scientists have long
favored an explanation for the hexagon
based on fluidic experiments, recent
scientific discovery definitively
excludes the fluid dynamics theory.
In 2014, scientists studying data from
NASA's Cassini spacecraft focused on
Saturn's northern stratosphere, a region
hundreds of kilometers above the atmospheric
hexagon. The shocking discovery came when they
began observing a vortex far above the
famous hexagon. One of the investigators
says of their discovery, “As the polar
vortex became more and more visible, we
noticed it had hexagonal edges and
realized that we were seeing the
pre-existing hexagon at much higher
altitudes than previously thought.”
A 2018 ScienceAlert.com article states of the
discovery, ”...since wind conditions change
dramatically with altitude, the fact that
the hexagon shape persists so much
higher than the cloud tops is a baffling
conundrum.” In other words, the evidence
overwhelmingly favors the explanation
that incoming Birkeland currents are the
cause of both Saturn's polar hot spots
and the mysterious hexagon structure. The
Saturnian system provided even greater
confirmation of Electric Universe theory
in 2018 with the discovery of water in
Saturn's atmosphere which is remarkably
similar to water in Earth's oceans.
In fact, it was well over half a century
ago that Emanuel Velikovsky offered 
the radical prediction that the source of
Earth's water was Saturn, provided in an epoch
when the planets were in close congregation.
Thornhill's own investigation led him
to conclude that Earth, Mars, and the
Saturnian moon, Titan were all satellites
of an object he refers to as proto-Saturn.
In December of 2004, Thornhill predicted
that spidery ravine networks, called
Lichtenberg forms in electrical terms
would be seen on Titan, not unlike the
so-called “arachnoids” on Venus.
He also stated it was unlikely that
large craters would be observed, although
mainstream investigators were expecting
them in abundance. In the standard view of Titan,
the moon is billions of years old, allowing plenty
of time for massive impacts to scar the surface.
In Thornhill's opinion, Titan shares a
similar history to that of Venus.
Both were born very recently by
electrical ejection from a “gas giant.”
In both cases, planetary scientists have
proposed an ad hoc theory of massive
planetary resurfacing which has erased
many of the craters. A recent birth
also removes the need for a global
hydrocarbon ocean to supply over
billions of years the methane observed
in Titan's atmosphere, since methane is
destroyed in the atmosphere by sunlight.
That too was affirmed when the Huygens
probe landed on a solid surface in what
looks conventionally to be a drainage basin.
However, the channels leading to that
basin have the distinctive appearance
of surface lightning scars and need not
have been carved by a flowing liquid.
To date, images returned of Titan
reveal that large craters are almost non-
existent. What they do show are the very
Lichtenberg patterns of electrical
discharge Thornhill had anticipated.
Perhaps no Thornhill prediction was more
dramatically affirmed than the one that shocked
scientists with NASA's Deep Impact mission.
As far back as October of 2001, after the
announcement of NASA's 2005 mission 
to the comet Temple 1, Thornhill wrote,
”Given the erroneous standard model 
of comets it is an interesting exercise to
imagine what surprises are in store for
astronomers if the plan is successful.
The electrical model suggests the
likelihood of an electrical discharge
between the comet nucleus and the copper
projectile, particularly if the comet is
actively flaring at the time. The
projectile will approach too quickly for
a slow electrical discharge to occur. So
the energetic effects of the encounter
should exceed that of a simple physical
impact, in the same way that was seen
with comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 at Jupiter.”
24 hours before the impact event in
collaboration with the Thunderbolts.info
group, Thornhill predicted that an
electrical flash might precede the
impact and explosion and that the
explosion would be much more energetic
than NASA anticipated. And this is
precisely what happened on July 4, 2005.
Other successful Thornhill predictions
included: a surprising lack of increase
in water production in the cometary coma,
indicating a lack of subsurface
water anticipated by astronomers;
an unexpected lack of ice on the comet nucleus,
or water in the immediate ejecta from impact;
a sculpted comet surface with sharply
defined craters, valleys, mesas and ridges,
the precise opposite of what one
expects of a “dirty snowball”;
a rearrangement of the comet's
jets due to charge distribution.
And of course in the 16 years since the
Deep Impact mission, the evidence in
favor of the electric comet model has improved
tremendously. The ESA's Rosetta mission to comet 67P
revealed one surprise after another,
including the obvious stratified rock
and extreme planetary geology seen
everywhere on the comet nucleus; the
discovery of sand dunes and other
impossible cometary features;
the stunning absence of visible water
ice; the discovery of molecular oxygen in
defiance of the comet's origins
in a primordial nebular cloud;
the continued non-detection of so-called apertures
which are thought to collimate comet jets;
the puzzling double-lobed shape of the comet
which is also seen routinely among asteroids;
and even a completely unexpected
electrical aurora emitted by the comet.
In fact, in the many years since
the predictions we've outlined were
published, Thornhill has further
developed his model of electro-gravity
which explains among other things the rounding
of cometary orbits by electrical discharge.
Indeed, those who have followed these
presentations understand space discovery
has served as the ideal testing ground
for the theoretical predictions of
Thornhill's Electric Universe model as well 
as the discipline of plasma cosmology.
And of course these predictions become
more powerful, when juxtaposed with the
failed predictions and endless surprises
for standard gravity-centric theory.
This juxtaposition is both a gadfly for
institutionalized science beckoning for
change, and an invitation to all
inquirers, both present and future,
who are inspired to discover our Electric Universe.

In part one, I predicted the discoveries
to be made by the James Webb telescope
about the creation myth of the Big Bang and
the failed gravitational model of galaxies.
In this second part, I'll talk about the gulf
between thermonuclear and electric star models
and expected discoveries from the James Webb
telescope. First, I want to pay special tribute to
an unsung pioneer of the Electric
Universe, Dr. Charles Bruce
who lived from 1902 until 1979, an 
Englishman who was uniquely qualified
to recognize the electrical nature of the
universe, as both a Fellow of the Royal
Astronomical Society and an authority
on terrestrial lightning. Dr. Bruce
graduated in 1924 with First Class Honours
in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy.
In 1952 he was awarded a Doctor of
Science, both from Edinburgh University.
In 1942 he was elected a fellow
of the Royal Astronomical Society,
in 1964 a Fellow of the Institute of
Physics and in 1965 a Fellow of the
Institution of Electrical Engineers. He joined
the Electrical Research Association from 1924
until his retirement in 1967. The 
event which led him to the study of
the significance of electric discharges
in astronomy was his attendance at a
lecture on the Sun and the Ionosphere,
given by Professor Sydney Chapman,
the leading British mathematician and geophysicist.
When he noted that the velocity of a
solar prominence, which reached 
the height of 1 million miles in an hour,
was very close to that of the leader 
stroke of a terrestrial lightning discharge.
In December 1960, he wrote an
article in Electrical Review titled
An All-Electric Universe. It outlines his
theory published much earlier in 1944,
which and I quote ”...endeavors to show that
electrical discharges have gradually condensed
matter from the primordial gas and dust
of a general universal atmosphere,
first into galaxies, then from the
condensed matter of the galaxies into stars.
Discharges in the extended atmospheres
of stars further condense the matter,
ultimately to allow the formation of
planets and satellites.” End quote.
Key to this discussion is two of Bruce's major
concepts. He was the first to propose the birth of
stars and planets in high-compression magnetic
pinches along current channels in molecular clouds,
rather like cloud-to-cloud lightning.
He was also the first to propose that
secondary bodies, or satellites, may be ejected
from a star by a phenomenon observed in arc welding
where the arc pinches down on the
electrodes causing a high pressure jet
and the ejection of metal in the arc welding
process. Such an ejection of matter is observed
to be independent of gravity.
Bruce's detailed electrical explanation
for phenomena seen on the Sun, relied 
upon comparisons with atmospheric lightning.
Understandably he accepted the
thermonuclear source of the Sun's energy.
Bruce's struggle with astronomers was
in trying to convince them of global
lightning in stellar atmospheres.
The famous British astronomer Arthur
Eddington had noticed evidence for
stellar lightning when he wrote his book
”The internal constitution of the stars”, published
in 1926, that established the standard model of
thermonuclear stars, and I quote,
”If there is no other way out we may have
to suppose that bright line spectra in the
stars are produced by electric discharges
similar to those producing bright line spectra
in a vacuum tube... We conclude provisionally
that bright lines in the spectrum of a static
star indicate that either (a) the star is
greatly disturbed by ‘thunderstorms,’
or (b) it is a nebulous star.”
But the million degree corona and
excited atoms producing the bright line
spectra outside the Sun, clearly show the
energy is coming externally from the galaxy.
Clearly he didn't have the mathematics to deal
with that. On page one of the book he states,
and I quote, ”...an understanding of the mechanism
of the interior throws light on the external
manifestation of the star and
the whole theory is ultimately
brought into contact with observation.” 
End quote. He has fooled all the experts since.
The next unsung engineering hero of the
Electric Universe was Ralph Juergens who
lived from 1924 until 1979. In the 
1970s, Juergens referred to Bruce's
work and solved the energy problem
by introducing the physics of a low
pressure gas discharge which requires
a galactic circuit to power it.
His revolutionary insight was to recognize
the Sun presents all the detailed features
of an electrically stressed anode in a coronal
discharge. He even foreshadowed my input to his
model when he wrote in 1976 and I
quote, ”Could it be that the search for
thermonuclear energy is a false trail
that has been followed all these years
with no real hope of success? If the 
Sun and the stars indeed succeed
in fusing lighter elements to form heavier
ones, are the relevant activities carried out
more or less in plain sight- in
their atmospheres?” End quote.
We can generally trust engineers. They've got to
make things work. The Electric Sun model was finally
tested experimentally by the SAFIRE
project, with funding from the International
Science Foundation.
Following confirmation of nuclear
processes by other laboratories,
success was announced at the annual
Electric Universe conference in 2019
at the University of Bath in England.
Just to add icing to the cake, last 
month a paper was published in
the Astrophysical Journal titled,
”The Sunward Electron Deficit:
A Telltale sign of the Sun's Electric Potential.
Although the real significance of the
discovery is lost on the authors who
insist that the heat of the Sun is
causing the charge separation, what 
they measured was the drift current
of electrons toward the Sun
which is characteristic of electron
drift toward the anode in a discharge tube.
The SAFIRE project showed nuclear
transmutation production of heavy
elements that are found in the solar
spectrum. It shows all main sequence stars
produce some radiant energy by the electric
discharge, but most importantly it catalyzes
nuclear transmutations in their photospheres.
To produce the star's radiant energy and
heavy elements, together with neutrinos.
Clearly, sunspots are dark simply because
there is no radiation coming from within.
So, the complicated ad hoc life stories for
different classes of stars is unnecessary,
as is the evolutionary classification 
of stars into populations I and II.
Shortly, I will show that the electric model
fits all stars. The James Webb telescope, when
successfully deployed, will allow us
to see finer and fainter detail in the
starburst regions of dense molecular clouds
where stars and gas giant planets are born.
The twisting and turning glowing
red filaments of constant width
are like those in a novelty plasma ball.
They are rotating Birkeland currents
threading the gestating stars in those clouds.
The stars grow in mass until they are
born by a slingshot effect as the filament twists
away. The enigma of the upper limit of star
mass is simply answered. The James Webb
telescope should put this explanation
beyond any doubt, because gravity alone
cannot produce such twisting and turning
filamentary structures. It is hard to overstate
the importance of evidence of helically twisted
filament pairs and braids. The Electric Universe
position has always been that the universe is one
giant web of rotating electric currents that
flow as filaments of helically twisted pairs
and braids and manifesting that morphology at
all scales. That stars are born in an intense
magnetic pinching of a galactic Birkeland 
current. That every star is connected to the
galactic circuit by a coaxial Birkeland current.
That every galaxy is connected to a
larger intergalactic circuit by coaxial
intergalactic Birkeland currents.
It is often very difficult to remotely observe
an electric current in plasma dark mode,
passing through the diffuse interplanetary,
interstellar or intergalactic medium.
For example, the discovery of
interplanetary electric currents has
only occurred when space probes have made
unexpected in-situ measurements. Nevertheless,
it is often possible to remotely observe
such electric currents because, for example,
dust is aggregated to the current via Markelund
convection. Or, because the density of neutral atoms
in the local plasma and the 
current density is sufficiently high
for the generation of electromagnetic
radiation in different parts of the
electromagnetic spectrum. As I have often
noted, radio astronomy is of particular
importance because Birkeland currents typically
emit synchrotron radiation in the radio spectrum.
Of course, many observational challenges 
remain. Not least because looking out into the
universe from our place in the galaxy,
is like looking through a tangle of
spaghetti, producing the cosmic microwave
foreground. The observational evidence has already
been accumulating for the existence of helically
twisted filament pairs and braids at all scales.
In solar flares. In star-forming molecular clouds.
In supernova remnants, planetary nebulae
and other diffuse nebulae.
Within galaxies. Connecting galaxies.
And even galaxy clusters. Indeed, in June this
year (2021), phys.org reported on a finding by an
international team of astronomers and I quote,
”...mapping the motion of galaxies in huge
filaments that connect the cosmic web...
that these long tendrils of galaxies
spin on the scale of hundreds of
millions of light years” and that
”rotation on such enormous scale has never been
seen before. The results published in Nature
Astronomy signify that angular momentum can be
generated on unprecedented scales.” End quote.
The phys.org report states ”Noam Libeskind,
initiator of the project at the AIP, says,
and I quote, ”Despite being thin cylinders
- similar in dimensions to pencils -
hundreds of millions of light years long,
but just a few million light years in diameter,
these fantastic tendrils of matter rotate.’”
On these scales the galaxies within them
are themselves just specks of dust. They 
move on helixes, or corkscrew-like orbits,
circling around the middle of the
filament while traveling along it.
Such a spin has never been seen
before on such enormous scales,
and the implication is that there must
be an as yet unknown physical mechanism
responsible for torquing these objects.’”
Of course standard model astrophysics
has no explanation for the observed
helical and rotational motion.
The phys.org report reveals,
”How the angular momentum responsible for
the rotation in a cosmological context is one
of the key unsolved problems of cosmology.”
Of course, the problem remains
unsolved because there is no tool,
or combination of tools in the Standard
Model tool kit that can produce
helically twisted filament pairs and braids,
other than by development of the physics of
magnetic flux tubes which are, after all,
merely an effect of electric currents.
The Electric Universe provides the answer.
Rotating electric currents impart spin
to galaxies, stars and planets as first
proposed by Dr. Bruce almost 80 years ago.
It provides a simple explanation
for Eddington's admission,
and I quote, “...the fact is that rotation of
celestial objects is altogether mysterious...”
End quote. They are responsible for the
remarkable alignment of galactic spins over
cosmological distances and,
as Alfven noted, they are
responsible for transferring energy and
momentum over large and very large distances.
I predict that the James Webb Space
Telescope with its vast improvement in
sensitivity and resolution, will 
reveal the existence of the
connecting network of helically twisted
filamentary pairs and braids even more clearly.
We will discover helically twisted filament
pairs and braids everywhere we look.
I make the same prediction for the square
kilometer array and the extremely large telescope
and indeed every new telescope that
significantly extends observational
sensitivity and resolution. Returning to stars, 
two properties of stars we can measure
from their light are luminosity
and color or surface temperature.
They are presented as a scatter plot
in a Hertzsprung Russell diagram
which, from an electrical engineer's
point of view, is strangely mirror
reversed, with stars getting 
cooler as you go from left to right.
There is, as Professor Don Scott writes
in his excellent book The Electric Sky,
an elegant correspondence between the
electric star plot and the electric Sun model.
The luminosity and color of a star is due 
to plasma discharge phenomena in the
ionosphere of a dense planetary type body.
All bright main sequence stars exhibit a
phenomenon seen in the laboratory on the
anode of a low-pressure gas discharge,
where increasing current density
causes bright secondary plasma tufts to
progressively crowd the photosphere
to give the appearance of granulation,
eventually forcing the photosphere to expand 
and the spectrum to move from yellow
towards blue and increasing the luminosity.
Periodic behavior observed in
photospheres, like sunspots
and helioseismic oscillations,
are driven by resonant behavior in the
interstellar and interplanetary circuits.
You may notice gas giant planets in the
lower left-hand corner of the plot,
together with the red dwarfs. That's 
deliberate. There are no failed electric stars.
In that region the bright photospheric
plasma tufting reduces and disappears
and we see only the red anode glow
of the red and brown dwarf stars
enveloping their gas giant nucleus. Our 
Sun's more compact red anode glow is
seen briefly as the chromosphere during total
solar eclipses. The red anode sheath effectively
increases the anode surface area of a
star to collect sufficient electrons to
stabilize it in the galactic circuit. Red giant
stars have a gigantic glowing anode sheath.
Their powerful stellar winds are caused
by positive ions, stripped from the
atmosphere and body inside, and
accelerated away from the star
by an electric field that strengthens
as the anode sheath expands.
The density of the ions passing through that
anode glow contributes to their brightness.
Variations in the plasma environment
cause the observed changes in size and
brightness of red giants and can produce
dramatic flaring from electric arc
ejection of matter from the star.
The red giant Betelgeuse has recently
demonstrated many of these phenomena.
I predicted in 2008 that dense red
stars will appear as giants. The 
other outliers in the Hertzsprung-
Russell plot are the white dwarfs. Eddington
wrote about white dwarfs when first discovered,
quote, “Strange objects, which persist in
showing a type of spectrum entirely out
of keeping with their luminosity, may 
ultimately teach us more than a host
which radiates according to rule.” 
End quote. He got that right, ultimately.
Here's the lesson: The luminosity in the Hertzsprung
Russell diagram has a mathematical relationship
to the mass of the star, however 
the luminosity of a white dwarf
frequently differs by a factor of 100
from that of another with almost the
same mass and apparent chemical composition.
The first problem is that mass is
undefined in physics. The second 
problem is that the universal
gravitational constant, or big G, has 
a mathematical dimension of mass
and mass according to m=E/c2
is an energetic variable.
So, the luminosity of a star can't tell
us how much matter is in that star.
The calculations that require white dwarfs
composed of dense matter are worthless.
White dwarf stars are a simple coronal 
discharge. It's like the faint white light we see
around the Sun in a total eclipse, which 
demonstrates the low luminosity of
such a discharge. White dwarfs have
no bright photosphere or chromosphere.
The galactic electric field reaches down to the 
star and is strong enough to smear out the
hydrogen spectrum and excite the spectra
of heavier elements sputtered from the
planetary body of the star.
A plasma discharge can switch
discontinuously between dark, glow and arc
mode, as we see in the abrupt brilliant
flaring and X-rays of faintly glowing
brown dwarf stars, nova outbursts
and the sudden searchlight brilliance of a supernova. 
These outbursts are caused by exploding
plasma double layers where a cosmic
circuit is suddenly opened and the store
of electromagnetic energy in that
circuit arcs across the switch.
For a nova and supernova, the power
stored in an interstellar circuit is
unleashed on the hapless star and heavy elements
from its planetary core jetted into space,
as Dr. Charles Bruce hypothesized.
The structure of the interstellar
circuit in that event can often
be seen lit up around the remnant.
In no circumstance does anything going
on inside the star cause it to explode.
Last we come to the family of brown dwarf 
stars. These stars are arguably the
most important target for the infrared
James Webb telescope because they are
the most numerous and some of the closest stars
to us. The telescope should confirm that all
brown dwarfs are gas giant-sized bodies,
enclosed in a huge red anode glow.
To give some idea, if Jupiter’s present invisible
plasma sheath were lit up, it would appear in
the sky at opposition the size of the Sun.
Brown dwarfs are simply small red giants.
All red stars lack the transistor action
of a bright main sequence photosphere
which steadies a star's radiance
as their electrical input varies.
So, the phenomenal shrinkage in size of
Betelgeuse over many years with steady luminosity,
followed by its recent polar ejection of
matter and dimming, is easy to understand.
Like their giant brothers, brown dwarfs
can be expected to show the same
behaviors and like red giants, have an
unexpectedly strong stellar wind for such a cool
star. A lower-mass brown dwarf in a
binary system has already been found
hotter than its higher mass companion.
Such a reversal of temperatures with
mass is not predicted by any
theoretical model for brown dwarfs.
So, I expect new discoveries to confirm
important parts of this narrative and
not require any ad hoc additions to
the Electric Universe explanation.
In part three I will talk about what
the James Webb telescope may tell us
about the newborn planets and the
subsequent formation of planetary systems
and it includes the formation of the solar
system and the recent history of the earth.
It's a cosmology that involves us.

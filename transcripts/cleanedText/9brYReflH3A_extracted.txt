For thousands of years, we humans have
gazed up at the sky and wondered,
looked for messages, looked for
keys to deeper understanding.
But perhaps the
cosmos is laughing.
Do we really see the universe as it
is or as we thought it should be?
Throughout the space-age,
astonishment and surprise
have been the hallmark
of scientific progress.
Everywhere we've looked, whether
close to Earth or in remote space,
we've uncovered things
forbidden by our theories.
What we expected to
find, we've not found.
And things beyond all expectation
have become commonplace.
In science a surprise
is always good news.
It prods us to see things differently,
to ask more pointed questions.
One discovery in space
inspires another,
and beneath it all today is the
encounter with the one thing
our theories didn't allow --
intense electromagnetism.
Electrical and magnetic
energies in the vacuum of space
beyond anything
astronomers expected.
That's what has happened as astronomers,
physicists, and planetary scientists,
have come face to face with
the Electric Universe.

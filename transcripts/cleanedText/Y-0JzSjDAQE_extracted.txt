The novelist Robertson
Davies once stated,
“The eye sees only what the mind
is prepared to comprehend.”
In the 21st century, scientists on
Earth are observing and gathering data
in unprecedented detail on the remotest
phenomena in the physical Universe.
Of course, as those who have
followed this series are aware,
what they actually find is routinely
very different than what they expect.
And what is the source
of these surprises?
Probably more than any physical science
on Earth, in astrophysics and astronomy,
where the essential tool is not
a microscope but a telescope,
data can be interpreted
a number of ways.
In the sciences, as in life,
invalid interpretations begin
with erroneous assumptions.
In the 20th century's space sciences,
one such assumption was that electric
charges and currents cannot exist
in the so-called vacuum of space.
An intriguing insight into
common beliefs on the subject
can be found in the discussions
of some popular websites.
On the website Quora.com, the question
is posed in the form of the query,
“Does lightning exist in space?”
The most viewed response
attempts to answer as follows:
“There is no lightning in space.
Lightning is the result of ionization
of air into a channel of plasma
caused by strong electric field
(in this context between
a cloud and the ground).
There is no air in space and
nothing to get ionized.
Strong electric field would produce nothing
in space and there would be no lightning.”
The notion that nothing exists in space
to become ionized is of course laughable.
Astrophysical plasmas,
or “ionized gases”,
have been a subject of intense scientific and
laboratory investigations for nearly a century.
And even the notion of so-called space
lightning at the vastest cosmic scales
has more recently been appearing
in astrophysical literature.
In 2011, radio astronomers reported their
measurement of the electric current
in a nearly 150,000 light
years long extragalactic jet.
As reported in the New
Scientist article,
“Universe’s highest
electric current found”:
“A COSMIC jet 2 billion light-years away is
carrying the highest electric current ever seen:
10¹⁸ amps, equivalent to a
trillion bolts of lightning.”
As we’ve reported recently, new papers
in peer-reviewed astrophysical journals
propose that powerful electric
currents flow in extra-galactic jets
and that the jets themselves are
“fundamentally electromagnetic structures.”
However, if you
follow science media,
it’s likely that you’ve
not noticed any attempt
to contextualize the development
as significant for astrophysics.
One person who has noticed this disconnect
is Thunderbolts colleague Chris Reeve,
who has spent many years documenting the
online discourse on scientific controversies,
including the occasional
“skeptical” polemics
against the Electric Universe
and Plasma Cosmology.
Recently, Chris published a commentary
exploring why the recognition
of vast, cosmic electric currents
has apparently yet to register
either with science journalists
or most online commentators.
Chris’s initial comments were presented in
an item posted by a Slashdot.org editor,
entitled, “Can Electricity Travel
Through Space on Astrophysical Jets?”.
An October 2017 paper titled "Electric Currents
along Astrophysical Jets" reports that
"Several researchers have
reported direct evidence
for large-scale electric currents
along astrophysical jets."
A review of the citations at the end of
that paper and others would seem to suggest
that one of the great Internet science
debates has finally been settled:
Electricity does indeed travel through
space over vast cosmic distances.
What has been interesting to watch
about this unexpected development
is that science journalists have so far not
explicitly reported this as a shift in theory,
and commenters on sites like phys.org appear
to deny that any change has even occurred:
"The jets have been shown not
to be electric currents,
the energy and the physics involved
are certainly not electromagnetic."
This comment completely
rejecting these new findings
was highly rated by
other phys.org readers,
suggesting that the failure to explicitly
report this as a change, in theory,
has left this controversial topic
in a highly confused state.”
With Chris’s permission, we now
present his full commentary,
outlining the history
of the controversy.
I've been engaging people on these
topics for around 12 years now.
In fact, it was some peculiar interactions I observed
here on Slashdot back in 2007 [slashdot.org]
which greatly stimulated
my interest in this topic.
The idea that electricity
flows through space
is largely the brainchild
of Hannes Alfven,
who earned the Nobel for his
creation of magnetohydrodynamics
(the math which models cosmic
plasmas using fluid equations).
What has not been particularly emphasized
by scientists or the science journalists
is that Alfven realized
towards the end of his career
that the widespread application of MHD
in astrophysics was a huge mistake.
And he used the opportunity of his
1970 Nobel acceptance speech for MHD
to explain to the
astrophysical community
why they should not be using
MHD to model cosmic plasmas.
The exact history of what happened
is difficult to track down,
and I've never seen it fully
told in an academic setting
― which is really quite extraordinary,
in a history of science sense.
Quoting The Plasma Universe of
Hannes Alfven, by David Talbott:
"Alfvén's interest in magnetic fields laid
the foundations of today's MHD theory,
a theory widely employed
by astrophysicists.
In the original
formulations of the theory,
Alfvén spoke of magnetic fields
being 'frozen' into neutral plasma,
and the magnetohydrodynamic equations
he formulated implied that
the electric currents that create magnetic
fields could be effectively ignored.
Hence, the plasma activity on the
Sun and in more remote space
could be analyzed without
reference to any larger domain
of electric currents or
electric circuits ..."
To this notion, astronomers were
readily attracted, and for a time
they thought they had an ally in
the brilliant electrical engineer.
Although his 'fundamental work and
discoveries in magnetohydrodynamics
led to his Nobel Prize in 1970, the
background to this occasion is paradoxical.'
Through much of the 19th and 20th century,
most astronomers and cosmologists
had assumed the 'vacuum' of space
would not permit electric currents.
Later, when it was
discovered that all of space
is a sea of electrically
conductive plasma,
the theorists reversed
their position,
asserting that any charge separation
would be immediately neutralized.
Here they found what they were looking for
in Alfvén's frozen-in magnetic fields
and in his magnetohydrodynamic
equations.
Electric currents could then be viewed as
strictly localized and temporary phenomena
— needed just long enough
to create a magnetic field,
to magnetize plasma, a
virtually 'perfect' conductor.
The underlying idea was that space could
have been magnetized in primordial times
or in early stages of stellar
and galactic evolution,
all under the control of higher-order
kinetics and gravitational dynamics.
All large-scale events in space could still be
explained in terms of disconnected islands,
and it would only be necessary
to look inside the 'islands'
to discover localized
electromagnetic events
― no larger electric currents
or circuitry required.
In this view, popularly held today,
we live in a 'magnetic universe'
(the title of several recent books and
articles), but not an electric universe.
The point was stated bluntly by the
eminent solar physicist Eugene Parker,
"No significant electric field can arise in
the frame of reference of the moving plasma."
But the critical
turn in this story,
the part almost never told within the
community of astronomers and astrophysicists,
is that Alfvén came to realize
he had been mistaken.
Ironically ― and to his credit ―
Alfvén used the occasion of his
acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize
to plead with scientists to
ignore his earlier work.
Magnetic fields, he said,
are only part of the story.
The electric currents that create
magnetic fields must not be overlooked,
and attempts to model space plasma
in the absence of electric currents
will set astronomy and astrophysics
on a course toward crisis.
In accord with Alvén's observations,
American physicist, professor Alex Dessler,
former editor of the journal
Geophysical Research Letters,
notes that he himself had originally
fallen in with an academic crowd
that believed electric fields could not exist
in the highly conducting plasma of space.
He stated,
'My degree of shock and surprise
in finding Alfvén right
and his critics wrong can
hardly be described.'
In retrospect, it seems clear that Alfvén
considered his early theoretical assumption
of frozen-in magnetic fields
to be his greatest mistake,
a mistake perpetuated first and
foremost by mathematicians
attracted to Alfvén's
magnetohydrodynamic equations.
Alfvén came to recognize that
real plasma behavior is too
'complicated and awkward' for
the tastes of mathematicians.
It is a subject "...not at all suited
for mathematically elegant theories."
It requires hands-on attention to
plasma dynamics in the laboratory.
Sadly, he said, the
plasma universe became
"...the playground of theoreticians who
have never seen a plasma in a laboratory.
Many of them still
believe in formulae
which we know from laboratory
experiments to be wrong."
Again and again, Alfvén
reiterated the point:
the underlying assumptions
of cosmologists today,
"...are developed with the most
sophisticated mathematical methods
and it is only the plasma itself
which does not 'understand'
how beautiful the theories are and
absolutely refuses to obey them."
There exists considerable
confusion on this topic
of electricity through
space over cosmic plasmas,
and it has been extraordinary
to observe that this confusion
is especially pronounced
in the tech community.
I have sought to document this bias
in the tech community (and elsewhere)
against electricity in space
since I first observed it.
Perhaps the most important untold story
is about this mistaken assumption
which formerly dominated
astrophysics and cosmology,
that space is basically empty (as in
there is no interstellar matter).
If you go back and look at what
transpired, we can see that this mistake
played an important part in the
selection of theories and hypotheses.
For example, Hannes Alfven's 1937
proposal of a galactic magnetic field was
"met with widespread
resistance (if not scorn),
as it directly contradicted
the prevailing wisdom
that a vacuum filled
interstellar space."
A 1963 Popular Science
interview with James Van Allen
points out in big bold letters
at the top of page 76:
'Space' was invented on Earth
before we knew what was out there.
The article explains:
"I found Dr. Van Allen in Boston, at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
where he was conferring with
other space scientists.
That evening, over dinner, I asked him about
newly discovered phenomena of 'empty' space.
'Most people still think of space
as a cold, black vacuum,' I said.
'Is it true that scientists shared this
misconception until very recently?'
'Most scientists did think of space
as a barren waste,' he said.
'When we started getting real
information, it was quite a revelation.'
The crucial turning point in our conception
of space, of course, came in 1958
when we finally sent the first
instrumented rockets up.
These probes were pretty quickly
recognized to be radioactive
when they landed
back on the Earth.
This was a big
surprise at the time,
and within just a few years, the
implications were openly discussed
in the introductions to numerous
astrophysical and plasma physics textbooks.
For example:
"Today it is recognized that 99.999% of
all observable matter in the universe
is in the plasma state,
and plasmas are found at temperatures
and densities far exceeding those
that will support matter in
the first three states."
I've documented about 20 examples of
these textbook admissions by now.
Here's another one:
"Plasmas can be divided into two broad
categories: natural and man-made.
It is an interesting fact that most of
the material in the visible universe,
as much as 99% according to some
estimates, is in the plasma state.
This includes the
Sun, most stars,
and a significant fraction
of the interstellar medium.
Thus, plasmas play a major
role in the universe.
Plasma physics is relevant to the
formation of planetary radiation belts,
the development of
sunspots and solar flares,
the acceleration of high-velocity winds that
flow outward from the Sun and other stars,
the generation of radio emissions from
the Sun and other astrophysical objects,
and the acceleration
of cosmic rays."
These more recent admissions by astrophysicists
that electricity can flow through space,
therefore, bear
enormous importance,
for it is today recognized
that of the matter we can see,
it is essentially almost
entirely in the plasma state.
So, if we are modeling
that plasma incorrectly
― as observations of large-scale
electrical jets seem to suggest ―
it stands to reason that
certain perplexing mysteries
(like dark matter) are likely to
be explained by this mistake.
Perplexingly, the Slashdot community has
been overtly hostile to this simple notion
that electricity can
flow through space.
Attempts to even just convey
new findings in this area
are either completely ignored
or treated as pseudoscience
even when the announcements appear
in established scientific journals.
For example, here is another
recent effort to inform
the Slashdot community of a very important
vindication for electricity in space:
"The previously
controversial claim that
'astrophysical jets are fundamentally
electromagnetic structures'
is becoming accepted by
some astrophysicists.
A summary of recent publications on the
subject by Don Scott in particular
notes the common presence of counter-rotating
cylinders in black hole jets,
a feature not expected
by conventional models,
yet a hallmark feature
of Birkeland currents
which was mathematically
described in a 2015 paper.
Counter-rotating
cylinders are considered
an important prediction for
the Electric Universe claim
that large-scale electric currents
travel through space over plasmas.
This recent acknowledgment offers additional
vindication for the historical claim
that the history of Birkeland Currents
appears to be mired in politics.
A 2007 Slashdot post titled 'Astronomers
Again Baffled by Solar Observations'
elicited a number of hostile
reactions by Slashdot readers
that the Electric Universe is
obviously a 'crackpot theory',
but what happens if astrophysicists
start to widely acknowledge
that large-scale electric currents
do indeed flow through space?"
It would seem that a mistaken
bias against electricity in space
continues to dominate
conversations to this day,
and will surely continue to
do so for some time to come
but it also increasingly appears that
these convictions are today out of step
with the current claims of
the astrophysical community.
So, in a sense, we now see the
Slashdot community largely unaware
that a huge theoretical
shift has occurred,
and that a lot of ridicule and
dismissals in this community
need to now be re-evaluated in the
light of the recent recognition
that electricity does indeed
travel through space.
If I had to guess at what will happen next,
people will probably start suggesting
― as they tend to do ―
that everybody actually already knew
that electricity travels through space.
But, the only way to find out
how people are going to react
is to finally start reporting
on this situation.
This conversation is way
past due at this point.

How old and how stable
is our solar system?
On this question astronomers have
grown more uncertain year by year.
The actual history of the planets could be a
far cry from anything we learned in school.
Here's our reporter Cameron Mercer,
with excerpts from his conversation
with the electrical
theorist Wal Thornhill.
We have always lived in a
very interesting solar system,
however, we've never been able to
pin down just how interesting it is.
First it was entirely special,
with no equal anywhere else
then, a century ago, sentiment gradually
shifted and people started to understand
our solar system as
a common occurrence.
There were bound to be other
solar systems out there,
just like ours,
waiting to be found.
Less than two decades ago
we started making our first
observations of other solar systems
and the more we find the
stranger our seems to be.
The solar system has actually
been described as weird,
when compared to planetary
systems around nearby stars.
We seem to have the gas giants
much further away from the Sun
then similar planets are
around nearby stars.
Around nearby stars those giant planets
orbit very closely to their star
and the answer to this problem is
another ad hoc addition to the theories
of how the solar system
formed and that is that
the giant planets were not form where
we see them now they must have migrated
because all the exoplanets that
we've discovered are large planets
even larger than Jupiter
orbiting their central star
in days or even
hours in some cases.
So, those systems of planets
are quite different
to anything that we see
in our own solar system.
This raises the issue of how
exactly did our solar system form
and why are our gas giants
so far from the Sun?
As straightforward a
question as this seams
this is actually proven
very difficult to answer.
Astronomers quickly learned that the
general theory of solar system formation
couldn't work for our
own solar system
since it postulates that planets form
in more or less their current orbits.
Uranus and Neptune are far out, too far
out to a form where they are today.
So, in 2005 some French astronomers
came up with a brilliant idea.
What if the planets
orbits could move?
Maybe then, they could migrate
from some earlier state
to the improbable arrangement
that we see now.
This idea had been entirely
untested, until recently.
In 2005, Nature magazine
published a paper,
which has become known as the Nice
paper, because it came from France,
and that paper was trying to find
the early stage of the solar system
and finding that nothing worked for Uranus
and Neptune, the outermost guest giants.
The guest giants simply couldn't
have formed at a great distance,
because it takes far too much
time for them to have accreted
from a cloud of dust and gas.
So, the Nice model
was proposed
which supposes the gas giants formed in
close where they are more likely to form.
Now, this recent paper is the first
simulation of the Nice model
and it's tried to simulate
changes which could produce
Uranus and Neptune at
their present distances
and also Jupiter and Saturn in their
present far-flung orbits from the Sun.
The simulations of the Nice model show
that Uranus and Neptune remain a problem,
we still cannot make a planetary system that
looks like our solar system theoretically.
David Nesvony, of the Colorado
Southwest Research Institute,
ran over 6,000 simulations
of the Nice model
in his searching for a viable
early stage of the solar system.
He had 4 target
criteria that, if met
would qualify the simulation as a
potential early state the solar system.
In only 2.5% of cases were they able to
satisfy just the first 2 criteria out of 4.
This is a huge problem for the current
theory of solar system formation,
it means the early solar system
could not look like it does now,
with Neptune and Uranus
in the outer reaches.
The paper concludes with the formation of
Uranus and Neptune, the outermost gas giants,
and say that it's just long-standing
problem in planetary science
and the paper finishes with 'future work
will be needed to address these issues'.
Astronomers are heading down the
right path, starting first with
a theory of static formation which hadn't
the slightest to performing our system
they proceeded to then
consider planetary migration.
David Nesvony took this yet a step further
and considered planetary ejection
in which case he found his chances of
producing our current solar system
increased almost tenfold
over the Nice model.
It seemed certain that the solar system
required rearrangement of the planets
to explain their present
placing and characteristics.
The Nice model wasn't enough, just rearranging
planets, so the next thing was ejection,
but that also
hasn't been enough.
Did something more dramatic occurred to
produce the solar system we see today?
In all the theoretical
work that has taken place,
we have assumed that all of the matter that's
in the solar system right now began their.
No one, except in the very early
days, considered capture of objects
from beyond the solar system.
There was good reason
for this, to do so
the object coming into the
solar system has to lose energy
and gravity doesn't offer any
simple way of doing that.
In the Electric Universe, there is
electrical exchange which can take place
and captures very much more likely
than it is in the gravitational model.
So, the very fact that we do have
gas giants like Neptune and Uranus
at distances from the Sun where
they could not have accreted
suggests that they
were captured.
Not only that, the motion of Pluto and some
of the outer moons do suggest capture,
rather than having
been formed in place.

How do objects in
our universe form?
In the unimaginably vast
cosmos at all scales,
from comets and asteroids
in our solar system
to the vastest
superclusters of galaxies
stretching for hundreds of
millions of light years,
astronomers and astrophysicists
imagine gravitational processes
and only gravitational processes
governing these objects' formation.
But the objects we see tell a different
story and demand new theoretical pathways.
In our own solar system, one
of the most puzzling forms
is a double-lobed shape of most
common nuclei imaged to date,
a weirdly similar form
also seen in nebulae
and even in the peanut-shaped cross-section
of the galactic bulge of our own Milky Way.
In this episode, physicist
Wal Thornhill will explain
why the pairing of
celestial objects
is a predictable effect of a
universe governed not by gravity
but by electromagnetism.
It is almost 50 years
since Hannes Alfvén
predicted the inevitable death of
gravitational big bang cosmology.
Why is it taking so long?
The reason seems to be that cosmology
has become a dogmatic belief system
as firmly entrenched
as any religion
within a global fraternity
who have been taught
that computer modeling based on those
beliefs will provide the answers
someday at whatever cost.
But computer models tend to
have a life of their own.
New parameters, forces, particles and
imaginary celestial objects can be introduced
and endlessly adjusted to
match almost any observation.
Gone are the classically-trained
scientists of the 19th century
who aimed for simplicity and matched
theory against physical experiment.
Today, theorists waste most of
the computing power on Earth
generating virtual reality
objects and universes.
They sit in front of computer
screens reflecting back to them
what they know about what they
know about what they know.
Meanwhile, the key is to be found in what
scientists don't know they don't know,
which is a consequence of dogmatic training
that there is no alternative to gravity
as the governing force
in the universe.
Yet no cosmologist will admit
that the force of gravity
remains unexplained
in the 21st century.
Einstein had the crazy idea that there
is no force, just our warped perception.
This requires, according to the
media celebrity Brian Cox,
that you ignore the surroundings and define
a falling object as being stationary.
It works fine until the ground,
for no apparent reason,
smacks into the
stationary object.
The product of this nonsense is a fictional
universe containing dark matter,
dark energy and black holes.
Physics, be damned!
Clearly, theoretical Big Bang
cosmology is fake science
when there's another peer-reviewed and
experimentally tested cosmology available,
based on real electrical
plasma behavior.
And remember, practically the entire
visible universe is in the plasma state.
So plasma cosmology is where real
physics answers are to be found.
Alfvén, who was both a
practical electrical engineer
and physicist in the
classical tradition,
told very publicly in his acceptance speech
for the 1970 Nobel Prize in Physics,
what theorists don't
know about plasma.
But it seems mathematical theorists
don't like an alarm going off
when they're busy
playing computer games.
Alfvén later wrote about the pressure
by theorists on real astronomers,
"...the result was the development
of a cosmological establishment,
like that of the
Ptolemaic orthodoxy,
which did not tolerate
objections or dissent."
Alfvén accentuated the essential role
of electric circuits in space plasma
and a circuit by definition,
carries electric current.
Of course, there are
no wires in space
but nature always contrives to do things
in the simplest and most effective way.
Charged particles encounter least resistance
by following magnetic lines of force
and producing what's known as
field-aligned current filaments.
Two parallel current filaments
interact electromagnetically
to draw closer and
rotate about each other.
The resulting twisted pair
of plasma current filaments
is named after an early pioneer
of the electric universe,
the Norwegian
Kristian Birkeland.
So the key signatures of cosmic electricity
are "doubleness" or pairing and rotation.
On August 24th, phys.org published
'The Origin of Binary Stars'.
It makes the admission that
"The origin of binary stars has long been
one of the central problems of astronomy."
It's been found that
protostars and young stars
are more likely to be
found in binary pairs
strung at intervals along a
filament inside a molecular cloud.
About half of the binaries are
in elongated core structures,
and they conclude that the initial cores
were also elongated structures...
One of their most significant
major conclusions
is that each dusty core of material is
likely to be the birthplace of two stars,
not the single star
usually modeled."
This raises the real issue that
astrophysicists don't understand
how either the filaments
or the stars are formed,
something that plasma cosmologists
have shown for half a century or more.
Here's an image taken at submillimeter
wavelengths of a star forming core,
showing that it contains
two young stellar embryos.
The caption says,
"Astronomers have concluded from a
systematic study of very young cores
that most embryonic stars form in multiple
systems and later some of them separate."
The problem is that astrophysicists are
using a gravitational accretion model
based on the concept
of a center of mass
which doesn't lend itself to
preferentially producing pairs of stars.
Meanwhile, the plasma cosmology
model is electromagnetic,
driven by a linear twisted pair
of Birkeland current filaments.
It's an inherently
binary phenomenon.
In the Electric Universe,
stars and planets are formed along
the Birkeland current filament
by a powerful and long-range 1/√r
electromagnetic scavenging force
acting on the diffused dust
and gas in a molecular cloud.
This compares to the puny short-range
one over r squared gravitational force
which cannot form a
filament anyway.
On the basis that nature doesn't
do anything the hard way,
gravity just isn't the answer!
To emphasize that science is
only trivially self-correcting
and has to undergo periodic
revolutions or paradigm shifts,
Hannes Alfvén argued, 40 years ago, that
stars are born in interstellar clouds
by magnetic pinching along
plasma current filaments.
Infrared space telescopes, like
the Herschel Space Observatory,
spectacularly confirmed
this 30 years later,
but Alfvén remains
ignored to this day.
Old beliefs die hard.
Plasma physicist Anthony Peratt
was a student of Alfvén.
Peratt's plasma cosmology textbook
'Physics of the Plasma Universe'
has on page 119 a section on doubleness
in current conducting plasmas.
He writes,
"The 1/r dependency of the Biot-Savart force
law between current conducting filaments
leads to a curious phenomenon:
a pairing of filaments.
This pairing leads directly to
a "twoness" or "doubleness"
when many filaments are
present in plasmas
in which the magnetic field
plays a major role."
The supercomputer
simulation shown here
is based on the electromagnetic interaction
of a large number of charged particles
moving in a magnetic field,
and demonstrates the evolving
sequence between three filaments.
It shows the two closest filaments
interact strongly to form a spiral
while the third
remains quiescent.
So what do we find in the paper
referred to by the phys.org report?
"The higher-order
[star] multiples
generally contain a mix of components
at wide and tight separations,
and all systems have at least one component
far from the center of the [elongated] core."
This matches Peratt's simulation of
multiple Birkeland current filaments.
On the galactic scale, the elongated core
is the central bar of a spiral formation.
Here we see an X-ray image of
the active galaxy Cygnus A,
a relatively nearby galaxy
containing a powerful quasar.
It's the second strongest
radio source in the sky.
You can see three X-ray hotspots
along an elongated core.
X-rays peek out where matter and
current density is highest.
The two hotspots at the end of the
elongated core or bar, of the galaxy,
are the footprints of twin
galactic Birkeland currents.
In a repeated pattern at the galactic
scale, it has been found that like stars,
galaxies are also strung like Catherine
Wheel fireworks along cosmic wires.
But instead of
producing twin stars,
they generate spiral arms full of stars
from the ends and along the rotating bar.
The central hotspot in the bar is due to
the electromagnetic plasmoid jet engine
at the heart of all
active galaxies.
It is the quasar factory required
by Halton Arp's research.
Since the twin Birkeland currents
are great plasma attractors,
they will form a thick toroid of matter
as they rotate about the galactic center.
Seen edge-on, it gives a peanut
profile to the galactic bulge.
So what do scientists find?
A Hubble News release
in 1994 titled
'Hubble Uncovers a Hidden Quasar in
a Nearby Galaxy (Cygnus A)' says,
"Though Cygnus A is categorized
as an elliptical galaxy,
it has an unusual peanut shape due to a dark
band of dust encircling the enigmatic nucleus."
Needless to say, the hidden
quasar in Cygnus A is a mystery.
"I was stunned when we realized we had
a quasar; it was a total surprise"
said Dr. Anne Kinney of the Space Telescope
Science Institute, Baltimore, Maryland.
The report explains that,
"Most quasars existed billions of
years ago in the early universe,
and, so, it's unusual to
find one in our own epoch...
Though this provides an
unexpected opportunity
for close-up study of the mysterious
'engine' behind a quasar,
these results add further mystery as
to the true nature of the powerhouse."
Finally, the report adds,
"Previous ground-based
radio observations
show that there is an elongated optical
object in the Cygnus A's core.
This is inconsistent with black hole models that
predict a compact point source of radiation."
Forget imaginary
gravitational black holes!
Overpowering electromagnetic
forces dominate in galaxies.
All of these observations are
consistent with plasma cosmology
and Halton Arp's observations of quasar
birth from active galactic nuclei.
It supports his evidence
against redshift
being a measure of great age
and distance of quasars.
Galactic redshift is a measure
of youthfulness of a quasar.
In other words, the
universe isn't expanding.
There was no Big Bang.
The universe is of unknown
origin, age and extent.
There is no need for cosmology
to compete with creation myths.
I wrote in 2006,
"On this website I have made many
successful yet unusual predictions
based on the Electric
Universe cosmology.
For example, what would be seen when
close-ups were taken of Io's 'volcanoes';
the initial flash and unexpected
outburst from Deep Impact;
what would be found beneath
the clouds of Titan;
and the link between spiral
forms at the poles of Venus
and the 'hot spot' at
Saturn's South Pole.
If the test of a good theory
is successful predictions,
the Electric Universe
is unparalleled.
Even better, if it can simply explain details
in the new images of Saturn's South Pole.
Earlier in February, 2005,
I've written about Venus,
"...we should expect to see evidence of the
twisted pair configuration at the poles of Venus,
if the input current is sufficiently
strong and this model is correct.
The Venusian polar dipole shows
the precise configuration
and motion of Birkeland current pairs
in plasma discharge experiments.
That includes a surrounding
spiral vortex."
Professor Fred Taylor of the University of Oxford
Atmospheric Oceanic and Planetary Physics Department,
wrote about the
Venusian polar vortex,
"...the absence of viable theories which can
be tested, or in this case any theory at all,
leaves us uncomfortably in doubt as
to our basic ability to understand
even gross features of planetary
atmospheric circulations."
Yet the same phenomenon discovered on Saturn,
years later, again puzzled scientists.
My web article titled
'The "Spiral Galaxy" at Saturn's Pole'
quotes a NASA report that describes
a hurricane-like storm at Saturn's
South Pole with a well-developed eye
ringed by towering clouds.
The storm is approximately 8,000
kilometers or 5,000 miles across
or 2/3 of the diameter
of the Earth.
"It looks like a hurricane, but it
doesn't behave like a hurricane"
said Dr. Andrew Ingersoll, a
member of Cassini's imaging team
at the California Institute
of Technology in Pasadena.
It is locked to the pole
and doesn't drift around.
A movie taken by Cassini's
camera over a three-hour period,
saw the shadow cast by a ring of
towering clouds surrounding the pole
and two spiral arms of clouds
extending from the central ring.
These ring clouds,
30 to 75 kilometers
that is 20 to 45 miles above those
in the center of the storm,
are two to five times taller than the clouds
of thunderstorms and hurricanes on Earth.
Though it is unlikely moist
convection is driving Saturn's storm,
the dark eye at the pole, the eyewall
clouds and the spiral arms together
indicate a
hurricane-like system.
"The clear skies over the eye
appear to extend down to a level
about twice as deep as the usual
cloud level observed on Saturn,"
said Dr. Kevin Baines of Cassini's visual
and infrared mapping spectrometer team.
"This gives us the deepest view yet into
Saturn over a wide range of wavelengths,
and reveals a mysterious set of dark
clouds at the bottom of the eye."
Those dark clouds are the footprints
of twin Birkeland current filaments,
seen here reflecting the maxima
in a computer simulation
of the magnetic
energy distribution
between two Birkeland current
filaments in the inset.
Notice particularly, the
energy hot spots distribution
is identical to that
seen in Cygnus A.
It indicates that powerful storms
on Earth, like a hurricane
with eye wall clouds
and spiral arms,
are driven electrically and not simply
by solar heating rising moisture.
This in turn suggests
that climate scientists
are missing the most powerful
influence on extreme weather events.
It seems to be clinched by the
Mount-Everest-high dust devils on Mars
that generate a planet-wide
dust storm for months.
There's not much solar
heating or air mass on Mars
sufficient to drive this
remarkable phenomenon.
In fact, it is the Martian dust
devils that form the dusty atmosphere
and warms it by
trapping sunlight.
A change in external electrical
energy causes a change in climate.
So we should look to our electric Sun's activity
for answers to climate change on Earth.
Our recent Space News on the double-lobed
form of many asteroids and comets,
receives a simple explanation
based on their formation in an electrical
exchange between two planetary bodies.
Each filament will tend to concentrate
matter excavated from the more negative body
into two lobes joined
by a bar or neck.
It explains the mixture of
planet-surface-formed minerals
and high temperature minerals
found in comet dust.
Comets do not hold the secrets
to the formation of the Earth,
but to the violent electrical encounters
between bodies sometimes captured by the Sun.
The twin filament nature of
electric currents in plasma,
causes us to see double effects
at the galactic scale,
at the stellar scale,
at the planetary scale,
the cometary scale and right on
down to the laboratory scale.
Such vast scalability
of plasma phenomena
is an overwhelming advantage of plasma cosmology
over gravitational big bang cosmology.
It has been shown to be highly
explanatory and predictive.
These are the hallmarks
of a successful model.
Plasma cosmology doesn't require
fudging with dark matter,
black holes and dark energy.
It suggests the hugely expensive
high-energy particle physics
and gravitational wave
experiments are a waste of money
when gravitational theory
has no physical basis.
The mathematician John Wheeler described
gravity in metaphysical terms,
"...matter tells spacetime how to curve
and spacetime tells matter how to move."
The words 'spacetime' and 'tells'
are physically undefined.
It isn't physics!
Alfvén was right,
astrophysics is in crisis
as shown by the perpetual state
of surprise at new discoveries.
Charles MacKay was right
when he wrote Extraordinary Popular Delusions
and the Madness of Crowds, in 1841.
"Men, it has been well
said, think in herds;
it will be seen that
they go mad in herds
while they only recover their
senses slowly, and one by one."

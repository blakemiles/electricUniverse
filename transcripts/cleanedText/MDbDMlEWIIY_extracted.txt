Notes Toward an Electric
Catastrophist Model for Geology
Good afternoon!
My talk is going to be based on the
Venus section of Worlds in Collision.
It's not really the words of Dr. Velikovsky
but the survivors', that he quotes.
And the description of the
events that took place.
The dates are not important.
I'm comfortable with his dates.
It doesn't really matter.
It could be Nibiru, could
be Saturn, Jupiter, Mars,
but I'm comfortable
with Venus as he thought.
Let me get a different
image there.
The picture that's painted
is dust, sand, gravel, rocks, very
large boulders falling from the sky,
mingled with a river of fire.
Dr. Velikovsky thought that was
oil. In many cases it might be
but it might also be plasma,
similar to the Aurora.
The dusts and rocks and gravel and
boulders were mingled with a river of fire.
According to the Mesoamericans,
the rocks were glowing red hot.
If you can heat a rock to
incandescent, incandescence,
it would be much
easier to heat dust.
So you have molten material.
The electromagnetism might
pull in iron preferentially.
It's raining oil for
days and nights.
The oil's running through rivers, people
climb trees to escape it and drowned.
According to the Mexicans, I
think, it killed more people
than the rocks and
everything else combined.
There's a hurricane going on.
Beyond our description,
worse than Andrew,
which almost killed me,
might have actually.
The Sun rises where
it used to set.
That's a tough one. And
it could be a tippy-top,
but from what I see in the field it
really looks like it stopped rotating
and went the other way.
You can go to the headwaters
of the Colorado River.
Rocky Mountain National Park, Fraser,
Colorado, spend quite a bit of time there.
You can see the valleys are full
of sediment to a large height.
Flat on both sides, equal heights as if
water was pushed up from the equator.
There's a 13 and a quarter mile
bulge of water at the equator
because of centrifugal force.
If the earth ceases to rotate,
according to Dr. Velikovsky,
the water would rush
north and south.
The dust, it's falling, would
be part of the flood.
That is what I believe is the sediments
up at the top of the Colorado drainage.
So it's really a mess
and it's electrical.
Ah, an interesting image from
Wiki images, Wiki Maps...
The yellow is sediment, I believe
that's part of the flood.
It was basically under
water, being moved around.
The part that's not yellow, this
area here is circle right there,
are mountains in a
circular pattern.
Within that circular pattern, which I think
is a vortex, there are more vortices.
Right here and right there, we'll
get into those a little later.
But what's kind of interesting, we were
looking at Valles Marineris earlier, Wal
seeing the shape of the galaxy.
I see mountains coming up through
Canada, curving to the left,
they actually go through
Alaska into Far East Russia
and in an arc of
volcanic islands come down.
Coming out of the south of this, you
have mountains curving to the right!
Oh, the Canadian Rockies
are a little blip there,
you got Baja here,
kind of similar to the Canadian Rockies
on the right-hand side of this.
These mountains come down substantially
cut through Mexico, Central America,
actually go through
Columbia, Venezuela,
with an arc of volcanic islands
coming back into Mexico!
It seems to look a little like a
galaxy or a huge low-pressure area,
like a giant hurricane.
That shows the mountains going
through, coming around and back.
Again, down, around and back.
Could be a coincidence
that in an Electric Universe,
I picture Venus
sitting over here,
as it bops up and down. As Dr. Velikovsky
thought it would come in close,
there'd be a discharge, it would
release it and it came back down,
during the plagues of Egypt, during
Exodus, that's how he describes things.
These are volcanic formations.
They swing around here, they
go up, come around down...
A lot of these volcanic formations
have something in common;
Missing volcanoes.
The volcanoes have gone away,
they've disappeared completely.
The geologists are fuddled,
they go out to look for them,
they can't find them, they
know they have to be there
because there's the salt!
What else could possibly heat
dirt other than a volcano?
Except in an Electric
Universe, with a river of fire
we now have another option for
molten rock, heavy with iron.
Electromagnetically, possibly, pulling
in iron from a dusty atmosphere.
As a friend of mine points
out, it's dusty plasma.
So it's going to be affected by an
electromagnetic event hovering over here.
10³⁹ or a lot more than gravity.
It could be pulling in dust as we interact
with comet Venus from thousands of miles.
Shaping it with a hurricane-force wind
and accumulating it in mountains.
These are plutonic, this is
granite and its cousins.
It's interesting and that on the left
side of this, there's a lot of granite.
On the right side of this, there's a lot
of granite, it seems like a mirror image.
Oh also, this is
kind of interesting.
This is the Sierras, is a 400 mile
long pluton of solid granite.
The largest pluton
on the planet.
Under the pluton of
granite is sediment.
The granite supposedly
bubbled up from below.
So how does sediment get
in between that?
There should be a tongue of granite going
down to wherever the granite came from.
So geologists have the Pacific plate
shoving sediment underneath of the granite
because they have to explain it.
But if the granite
came from the air,
it would be sitting on top of the
sediment that was there to start with.
Now we come over to metamorphics.
The Sierras have metamorphic rock but not
enough to show up on here dramatically.
But the coastal range does. And you can
see they're sort of a circle there.
And then we have the Canadian Shield
with Hudson's Bay in the middle.
This is all flat and
it's all metamorphic.
This might have something
to do with that.
It could be a positive, negative,
negative positive, I'm not sure.
I'd like to have EU
folks sit around and
drink and talk about this in the
evening while I can listen.
But it seems as if something
happened over here.
And I'll show later on that it seems to have been
rapid and it seems to have been one event
for all the mountains. And I
don't want it to be that way,
I'd like it to be
simple and embraceable.
But it's not, it looks like it
was really a horrible thing,
with very few survivors.
And in 'Worlds in Collision', the survivors
thought they were the only ones.
They came out of their caves.
They were the only
ones that made it.
They don't know anybody
else in the neighborhood
for a 100 miles, there's
no communication.
That's a recurring theme.
It happens in Mexico,
it happens a lot.
This is on a highway
93, north of Las Vegas.
This is welded tuff.
It's a wonderful formation.
Welded tuff is red-hot dust that comes
out of a volcano and blows downwind.
It's so hot that it sticks to the
windward side of obstructions.
Sticks to the windward side of obstructions
and grows back and up into the wind.
This is an accepted
geologic process.
The problem is, many times this is
40, 60 miles from a missing volcano.
And if you look at a volcano at
night when the dust comes out,
its incandescent.
It blows downwind a very small distance
and it's no longer incandescent.
So 40 miles downwind, it's not going to
make rock, it's going to make dirt.
You need something to keep it
hot, like a river of fire.
It's a close-up photograph of it.
It's 30, 40 feet
thick on the top.
Solid rock, not like partial
rock, this is gnarly rock.
This is the edge
of the formation.
We have windward over here
and leeward over here.
The wind is blowing
from here this way.
It gets to this Ridge
and it goes beyond, it's...
At first I thought these
were dunes, everywhere.
But dunes only
happen with dry sand.
This isn't dry. This is either wet dirt, clay,
mud, sticking or it's incandescent, sticking,
sticking to windward and it
can't accumulate on leeward
because it blows past it.
So you get layer after
layer building up,
and you can see how these
layers accumulate it.
This is not wild speculation, this is a
geologic process that's accepted universally.
The welded tuff process.
When my friends and I discovered
this, it was really convenient,
it made everything so much more
simple than it had been in the past.
You don't need a lot of post-
process activity to do this.
It happens on its own and it makes
a dendritic ridge along the side.
That's Mars.
That's this process, they
kind of, look like cousins.
So it's hard,
if you can't say that electricity can't
make dendritic ridges. It probably can.
But there's a lot of other processes
that seem to produce dendritic ridges.
Mount St. Helens after the
landslide of pyroclastic flow.
There were explosions in the valley
where this material accumulated.
After the explosion, the sides of the
formation that was created by the explosion
started to slough.
It created dendritic ridges.
There are dunes in San
Francisco after a storm.
As with the landslides, it
created dendritic ridges.
There's a number of fact, number of
ways to make the dendritic ridges.
And this seems to be one.
Right along here you can see back here,
there's another one, another one back there.
This is the area the
wind's coming this way
and these welded tuff formations
go all the way across Nevada.
Hundreds and hundreds of miles
of mountains made of welded tuff.
I think they're external, I
don't think they fold it up.
I've been looking for folded mountains. They
might exist, then I'd be happy to find one.
Dr. Velikovsky thought
mountains were folded
because of the stress of
this ceasing of rotation.
His advisors gave him the
standard geologic model.
I hate to disagree with them but it
seems like there's other options.
So this is an area,
west of there.
These mountains seem
rather circular.
And the circularity of them
goes back to that point.
There are circular mountains over here
right at the base of the Sierra.
This one here in particular.
These are welded tuff but on top of a
lot of these mountains is dolomite.
And dolomite is a big
problem for geologists.
If you had googled 'dolomite problem',
you'll get page after page of links.
It doesn't form at the bottom of
oceans the way geologists wanted to.
They need it too but it doesn't
do it, according to chemists.
They've tried to make dolomite
precipitate out of ocean water.
They can do it but they have to boil
it and fill the water with uric acid.
So, picture dinosaurs
urinating in a boiling ocean.
600 million years ago.
And then that dolomite, that can't
happen, is thrust up on top of mountains,
like the dolomites in Italy.
The top of the mountains
have the dolomite!
Some was like I wrote the reports
about the dolomite myself.
The beauty of dolomite is when
they went to comet Halley.
They found 7% dolomite, according to
NASA, and they claim it's understated.
Because its tiny little crystals (are) microscopic
and their spectrometers miss a lot of it.
So there's probably more.
So you have comet dust that can
answer the dolomite problem.
All over the world you
have this dolomite.
It's, it's my best friend.
It's just the most
wonderful stuff.
So this whole thing
seems to be a vortex.
As part of that larger
vortex that we saw earlier,
this would be the
western part of it.
That shows you where the center
is, that shows the mountains.
There's a dolomite
mine right there,
I'm friends with the general manager, I
think he might give us a tour on our tour.
It's the largest one in California but
the dolomite seems to be circular.
This is Four Corners,
we're down here.
This red thing here are granitic
and metamorphic mountains
that seem to be in
a circular pattern.
This goes over to
Highway 93 right there.
So this seems to be the eastern
vortex with a vortex to the west.
And that's where
they come together.
And if you have two vortices, you might
actually have a double layer in between,
explaining all that melted stuff.
And there's other things going on up here
which I'll get to a little bit later.
Actually they're right there.
Could be a coincidence all
this, I really don't think so.
This is the welded tuff.
This is actually dolomite
down here, trending this way.
The welded tuff trend
were at the, on the leeward side.
Welded tuff trends back
in the other directions.
These seem to have been
fairly simultaneous.
I would think that these were
first and then this covered
the area going behind so it gives you
a feel for the layers of dolomite,
layers of shale, the
dolomite comes in layers
and it's up to 6,500 feet thick.
And then on top of one formation
like the Bonanza King,
which can be up to 6500 feet thick, there's
more dolomite and limestone underneath of this.
Limestone comes
from comet dust too.
From comet Halley.
I'll get into the oil from comet Halley
a little bit later if I have time.
There's cubic kilometers of
it on this little tiny comet.
This is welded tuff south of
Pahrump, gives you some idea.
It seems like the current
density goes up and down.
I picture Birkeland current spinning. One
positive filament, one negative filament.
They're attracting different
things ionically.
So they're pulling
dust and making layers.
Dolomite shale, different
types of welded tuff layers.
Everything has an ionic nature,
it's going to be attracted ionically.
But as it spins you get
different types of material.
These are mountains. I just
spent time here recently.
This is dolomite and
it's alternating layers
and it makes dendritic
ridges on the leeward side.
It's just a natural part of the
process, you don't have to add anything.
It comes out this way.
I've done experiments
with spackled wall stuff
and it builds back up in the
direction that you're spraying it
from kind of similar to this. And it
makes a cliff on the leeward side
This is looking from the side
so that you can see
the layers go through.
They're not just a surface feature.
One layer, another layer,
all the way through.
Dolomite shale, dolomite
shale, dolomite shale.
I'll get into it all right now.
Almost all of the oil we've recovered, up
until very recently, has come from dolomite.
Because it's porous. We
couldn't get at the shale oil.
Dolomite, being porous, you should put a hole in, a,
earth, open pipe, the pressure pushes it in
and because it's porous
it can keep pushing.
With shale it's a solid rock, you
have to frack to get it out.
Comet Halley has the equivalent
of cubic kilometers of oil.
Almost identical to
the oil in oil shale.
That's really convenient from a
little tiny comet, 12 by 8 miles.
So think about Venus
being 8,000 miles across.
Scary comet, eats people, we saw
Dave's pictures at all that.
It gives you the opportunity to
explain the dolomite and the oil.
They come together, they're a package, they're
part of comet dust according to NASA.
If you search shale oil, the
last paragraph on Wiki,
well it talks about
extraterrestrial oil and comet Halley.
And the cubic kilometers. Each cubic
kilometer is 8 billion barrels.
Think of the potential for Venus
and think of 'Worlds in Collision'.
And eyewitnesses emotionally describing
rains of oil for days and nights.
And it runs down
rivers into lakes.
Just north of here, not too far, is the
Green River Basin. North of I-70 in Utah.
There are 3 basins
associated with 3 lakes.
(It) has 4 trillion barrels of proven reserves,
more than half of the oil in the world.
Proven reserves, there is oil
everywhere, it's not theoretical.
I think, that yellow map
shows what caused it.
It's where the oil came from. It
comes from comets, not dinosaurs.
And it doesn't...
The abiotic oil people have it coming
from volcanoes under the ground.
And it gets
really complicated.
If you listen to our ancestors, it
came from above. It's common oil.
In my humble opinion.
This is Oregon, Smith Rocks.
This is welded tuff.
That's windward, that's leeward,
these are the dendritic ridges.
The missing volcanoes (are)
over here. They went away.
I want to do a charity
for missing volcanoes.
This is a map showing it, you
can see that it makes pinnacles.
That's the process. These are individual,
they start to grow together over here.
That's my photograph.
It makes triangles!
This is the flat, leeward side,
when the current density is high.
It seems like this
process is exacerbated.
And it grows back, the
wind's coming towards us.
This can't grow because the wind is coming
around here and the dust is blowing past it.
It blows into water, it gets washed away.
Even if it's red-hot, it's now dirt,
gets washed away.
This is the water
line, you can...
There's actually a creek
that comes by here,
must have been flooded
during this flooding stage.
But these shapes are
really important.
We're going to see Mount Whitney
shortly, which is granite.
It has the same shape and a completely
different explanation from the geologists.
I'll get into some funny
stories about that later.
This is Mount Whitney.
This would be windward, this
is leeward, here's the cliff.
Here's what I like to
call the water-ski-ramp.
It's nice and flat, building
back and up into the wind.
It's hard to see the layers of
granite because it's so molten.
The layers seem to
have blended together.
This is looking at it from above.
It's hard to see a little bit,
here's the ridge line, right there.
This goes down to the Kern River. Goes
down, empties out down by Bakersfield.
And then these mountains start
again with a ridge and a windward.
This is leeward again and windward. It's
like the wind was coming from the West,
making these
mountains of granite.
This one shows it more clearly.
Windward, leeward.
Same thing there.
There's Mount Whitney.
Reminds me of welded tuff.
And if this is
bubbling up from below,
it shouldn't look anything
at all like welded tuff.
Has a completely
different explanation.
They seem to be cousins.
This is Maroon Bells,
south of Aspen.
This is conglomerate, people try to
climb it. They die, their anchors fall.
And then the Rangers
have to carry them out.
They gave me all these descriptions
of how difficult it is
to carry dead weight
out of the mountains.
It's not consolidated.
This is leeward.
This is the other
side of the valley.
This is windward. The next
mountain is the same.
They repeat themselves. The wind
is from the same direction.
Although these are not straight-line
winds. In many cases they're vortices.
And the trending is different
from one side to the other.
Which is difficult for
plate tectonics to explain.
They don't have just one
plate bumping into another.
They have to have a
disappeared plate.
Really, oh wow, all right.
This is Frenchman Mountain.
Just east of Las Vegas.
You can see the layers. They all go back. These
are the same layers as the Grand Canyon.
Right here at a 50º angle,
that's one extra layer.
This is leeward.
It's building back.
The wind for this is all
from the same direction.
If the wind was from the south this would
be covered. You won't be able to see it.
If the wind was from
the west on this side,
it would cover it, all
that would disappear.
Unfortunately, this looks
like it's one event.
Down to the
Vishnu schist.
And the granite that's at the
bottom is same as the Grand Canyon
I don't want to
make it so dramatic.
But unless the wind was from the
same direction for multiple events,
you wouldn't get this.
And that makes it
really spectacular.
I'd like it to be less spectacular.
It would be more embraceable.
But it's as if that happened
during the plagues of Egypt
while that vortex
was taking place.
There's going to be a discussion
later on, this evening at 6:30.
Informal, with a computer where I can
use Google Maps and all my images.
And we can go through
all these things.
That's the leeward side
of Frenchman Mountain.
The Vishnu schist is down there.
You can see the layers building
back. It makes dendritic ridges.
They come ... Five
minutes, finished.
Cool, it's better than
I was hoping for.
This is the majestic catalinas,
just north of Tucson.
This is nice.
It's metamorphic, you
can see it trends back.
This is granite, it's
unbelievably thick.
This is like a couple thousand
feet thick of solid granite.
This is the leeward
side on the back.
You can see the "water ski
ramp", it's nice and smooth.
The wind was coming towards us.
This is Snowdon Peak. It's
quartzite, it's metamorphed quartz.
There's missing pieces. I think
this was electrically removed.
You can see the layers, if you look at the
photograph where it's clear on a computer,
building out back towards us.
This is the leeward side,
the kind of dendritic.
But you can't see those gaps,
because the energy that created them, I
think, was coming from the windward side.
It didn't get through.
This is the base of it. It's all
dendritic, on the leeward side.
This is Zion park. When I
talked about Snowdon Peak,
when I was writing this, or sort of
writing it, there's not a lot of words,
I said that I had never seen a canyon that
would seem to be excavated electrically.
Although I was open to it,
I'd love to find them.
But they don't seem to
be produced that way.
But these are, these are three thousand
foot canyons that are straight.
And it seems as if the electricity went right
through it. It goes past the high point
where the dendritic canyons,
which I think are fluvial,
stopped at the high point. They get
smaller as they go up. There's less water.
They don't go past the ridge,
these go past the ridge.
This is Snow Canyon. Over
here, this is Kolab, Zion.
These are all zapped.
These are where the two
vortices are coming together.
And it seems as if something came from
the south and ripped these suckers out.
This is shale, this is mud. Up
at the top of these formations.
That's how high it is.
These formations have the
same mud on the top of them.
The current couldn't get to it.
But originally, this must have
been covered just like that.
And then these
canyons were removed.
It removes the sediments much easier than
it removes the welded tuff formations.
That's the close-up.
Now you can see the slosh here. You
can see the depth of the canyons.
They go straight, they
don't follow the drainages.
They don't follow the
dendritic paths.
There's rivers running
through here.
They don't go where the path would be easiest.
They just rip right through a mountain.
So I've been looking for electric canyons.
Wanting to find them for 6 years.
And finally, I've missed them because
I was looking for dendritics.
In reality, the key to this is just
like the rilles of Mars and the Moon.
They're straight.
And I think it's like a ray gun, probably
electrons, going right through it.
Although, I'd like to hear Wal and Don
and Mel and folks talk about this.
Again with a lot of liquor.
This is what happens.
This one, last one.
This is at the edge. This isn't
in the canyon that's removed.
This is where the
process is slowing down.
This is what the process is like.
It scratches the material away
and disappears it into dust.
This is the marks, these are
the marks that you look for.
They're in Las Vegas,
at Red Rock Canyon.
You can see how things get
affected electrically.
This is the Electric
Universe version of geology.
Please stop by.

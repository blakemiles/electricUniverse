In Part 3 of this
four-part presentation,
physicist Eugene Bagashov
continues his analysis
of the New Horizons mission
to the dwarf planet Pluto.
In the Plutonian system, one of the great
surprises for planetary scientists
was a Chandra Observatory's
detection of X-rays from Pluto.
This is only one of several
phenomena at the planet
that sometimes draw the
analogy of Pluto to a comet.
In the Electric Universe Theory, as
developed by physicist Wal Thornhill,
any body on a significantly
elliptical orbit
can display comet-like
characteristics.
Today, Eugene Bagashov offers
his own thoughts on this
and other surprises from Pluto,
including the mysterious behavior
of the Plutonian atmosphere.
Eugene Bagashov: In one of the
previous Space News episodes on Pluto,
I've mentioned the various
atmospheric anomalies
that have been detected at this dwarf
planet by New Horizon spacecraft.
Those include, for example,
the low atmospheric pressure
and at the same time the unexpectedly
high location of haze layers.
And in the paper called "The Atmosphere
of Pluto as Observed by New Horizons"
that came out in March of 2016,
there are reports of some new
misconceptions being observed.
For example, it is said
that the upper atmosphere,
approximately 200
kilometers and above,
is much colder and much more
compact than the models indicate.
So, the authors have supposed there should
be some "cooling agent" present there.
Yet, they acknowledge the complete
lack of evidence for such a presence.
And it seems that the
nitrogen escape into space
is also a few orders of magnitude
less than was previously thought,
actually around
10,000-times less.
Such a huge mistake clearly
means there is something wrong.
Basically, the model that is
being used doesn't seem to work.
The temperature near the
surface, on the other hand,
was determined to be somewhat higher
than it should be, around 45 Kelvin.
The models seem to indicate that,
at the given atmospheric pressure,
the nitrogen ice will be in equilibrium with
the atmosphere only at around 37 Kelvin.
So, the atmosphere near the
surface is 8 degrees too hot,
if one might use this word
for Pluto conditions at all.
It's too hot for the nitrogen
ice to just sit there.
So, the scientists have supposed
that the surface might possibly be
covered with some other
less volatile material.
Yet, as I've noted in
previous parts of his review,
we clearly see nitrogen spectral
signature on the surface.
The mentioned paper also reports
of an identification of at least
20 haze layers in the
Pluto's atmosphere,
separated by distances of the
order of tens of kilometers.
The authors propose gravitational
wave-like displacement
as the physical reason for
the observed layering.
It is thought that the process might
be initially driven by sublimation
and the interaction
of weak Pluto winds
with the orographic
features such as mountains.
The proposed wind speeds are around
one or two meters per second.
But from the EU perspective,
such layered structure
makes one think about
plasma behavior,
which is not at all far-fetched,
given their apparent lack of
any significant protection
from ionization by solar particles
and galactic cosmic rays.
In my opinion, it is entirely possible
that the electromagnetic effects
might be somehow ruining the models
that are used by the New Horizons team
to infer the temperature, pressure,
and other relevant parameters.
Another evidence for this comes from the
recent paper quite straightforwardly titled
"The Puzzling Detection of
X-rays from Pluto by Chandra."
Chandra is a well-known
space X-ray observatory.
Once in 2014 and on three
occasions in 2015,
it has been devoting its time
to the Pluto observations
in support of the New
Horizons mission.
As a result of approximately two
days of total observation time,
it has detected eight photons in the energy
range from 300 to 600 electron volts
while none has been detected in the
range of 600 to 1000 electron volts.
The detected events
seem to be genuine,
that is, not related to background
sources or the instrument noise.
And they all come from the square box
with the side of 100 Pluto radii
centered on the planet itself.
Unfortunately, the instrument resolution
couldn't allow for any more details.
So, they have to originate
from somewhere in the system.
And maybe eight photons in two
days doesn't sound like much.
But considering how
far away we are,
if the same flux is going
in every direction,
we get a pretty impressive 200 megawatts
of X-ray power flux leaving Pluto.
This is about it 1,000-times weaker
than the total power of Earth auroras
during a decent
geomagnetic storm.
The question, however, is where
do these X-ray photons come from?
The authors of the paper rule out
the possibility of auroras on Pluto
since it is supposed not to have
any significant magnetic field.
Another possibility is
scattering of solar X-rays
but the spectrum is different and the
power is up to 1,000-times too high.
So, the last option that
the authors propose
is the so-called "solar
wind charge exchange."
Basically, this means that the solar
wind ions strip away electrons
from the atmospheric atoms,
and those electrons settle
in the solar wind atoms,
making the neutral
or less ionized,
at the same time emitting a photon
in this case in X-ray energy range.
Very roughly speaking, it is the
transport of negative charge
from the atmosphere
to the solar wind,
which sounds pretty much
like an electric current.
Anyway, the interesting
part is that this process
will be more or less consistent
in terms of spectrum,
still is thought to be too weak to
provide the needed number of events.
The author state that one needs around
40 times more solar wind hitting Pluto
than should be available at
this distance from the Sun.
I quote: "The solar wind must be
somehow significantly focused
and enhanced within 60,000 km of
Pluto for this mechanism to work."
Do we know any means of focusing
positively charged particles?
Well, the most simple and straightforward
answer would be with the electric field.
If you suppose that Pluto
bears the negative charge
with respect to the solar wind
coming from the inner heliosphere,
it would indeed tend to focus it, almost
like an electric lens, so to speak.
It might as well happened that
the charge would be big enough
to accumulate the wind
from a very big area.
Thus generating the
needed number of events.
What is interesting is that
the solar wind density,
registered by SWAP instrument
at the time of the fly-by,
was actually around five-times
bigger than expected.
It was thought to be a result of the recent
passage of coronal mass ejection shockwave
but might at least partly be caused by the
mentioned focusing of the solar wind.
One of the arguments against the
electric comet idea, by the way,
is that the solar wind
density is too low
to produce the observed
amount of water in comets.
But very simple calculations show
that it might be easily compensated
by taking into account the
negative charge of comet nuclei,
which we know is present and the
charge needed is very reasonable.
For example, for the maximum of
[Comet] 67P water emissions,
my calculations gave the charge of
the order of only tens of coulombs.
Of course, here I've neglected Debye
screening and other complex plasma effects,
which might be very important but the
core idea seems not at all impossible.
So, it seems the specific electromagnetic
effects might be responsible
for the X-ray emissions on Pluto as
well as the other mentioned anomalies.
I'd like to mention that
the comparison of Pluto
with comets and 67P in particular
is not too far-fetched.
The X-rays detected by
the Chandra telescope
are in the energetic range of
a few hundred electron volts,
which obviously would correspond
to the electrons being accelerated
by the electric field of a few
hundred volts potential difference,
somewhere in the
Pluto environment.
And interestingly enough,
the Rosetta probe,
upon the arrival in the
vicinity of the Comet 67P,
have detected a mono-energetic beam of
singly-negatively charged dust particles
with energy of a few
hundred electron volts.
The fact that those particles
had almost the same energy
means they also most likely were
accelerated by the electric field,
and not were the result of some
thermal processes or whatever.
So, it seems that in general this
kind of electric potential scale,
a few hundred volts, might be
characteristic of the interaction
of very small bodies with
interplanetary plasma.
Another occasion of very similar
negative beam detection
is the Saturn's moon Hyperion, zapping the
Cassini probe during its flyby in 2005.
There the potential difference was
of the same scale, around 200 volts.

Good afternoon everyone. Current scientific
theories of the atom are hypothesizing that the
nucleus is made up of a chaotic blob of protons 
and neutrons. There is no known structure for
the nucleus. Quantum mechanics states that it is impossible
to show a true shape for the nucleus, but instead relies on
mathematics to express the atom and its non-
deterministic nature. Is it possible that there is a structure
to the nucleus of the atom? In this presentation,
I will make precisely that attempt and show you how
this structure, with its particular rules and mechanics,
are responsible for the periodicity and the grouping of the
Periodic Table of the Elements. My goal today is to
take you from this two-dimensional solar system model of
the atom with no structuring whatsoever (as we can
see on this side) and I want to take you to a logical
threedimensional structure of the atom. The proton-electron
model that was adhered to until the acceptance of the
neutrons in about 1933 has been taken as a base 
for that. Now, before I continue, I would like
to draw everybody's attention to the disclaimer of this
presentation: “We are all agreed that your theory is crazy. The
question which divides us, is whether it's crazy
enough to have a chance of being correct.” Niels
Bohr. The presentation is made up of the following: 1 -
Current understanding of the model. We'll take you through a
short history lesson there, and then we will go 
into 2. Proposal for the Structured Atom model.
The third part will be to touch upon 3. implications 
of this model, and [finally] 4. we will state our
conclusions. Our journey begins in the early 1800s when
John Dalton was doing his research. Dalton used relative
atomic weights and published a table of
relative atomic weights. So, we have the first
rudimentary form of a Periodic Table of the 
Elements. For example, Dalton found that
12 g of carbon could react with 16 g of
oxygen to form the compound that we now call
carbon monoxide. Or with 32 g of oxygen to form carbon dioxide.
The ratio of oxygen masses - 32 to 16 – simplifies to 2:1.
At some point, it was discovered that certain elements have
common properties and that there was a periodicity to the
elements. In 1864 John Newland described
a law of octaves. He observed periodicity
according to the relative atomic weight and identified some
new elements such as germanium. His concept however was not
recognized by the Society of Chemists until 1887.
After becoming a teacher in 1867, Mendeleev
wrote a definitive text book of his time,
”Principles of Chemistry” in two volumes, 1868 to
1870. It was written as he was preparing a textbook
for his course. This is when he made his most important
discovery. As he attempted to classify the elements according
to their chemical properties, he noticed patterns that led
him to postulate his periodic table. Mendeleev claims to have
envisioned the complete arrangement of the elements in a dream,
quote, “I saw in a dream a table where all
the elements fell into place as required.
Awakening, I immediately wrote it down on a piece of 
paper. Only in one place did a correction later appear
necessary.” I would like to point out here in his periodic
table the purple elements like helium, neon, argon
krypton etc. which were totally unknown. And here we see
for example the germanium. By looking at these empty spots,
we were able to pinpoint where the next
element should be and that's how we found
them. J.J. Thomson performed his cathode ray
experiments in 1897. If a gas sample is introduced
into the region between two charged plates, which we can
see on the bottom here, a current flow can be observed,
suggesting that the atoms have been broken down into
charged constituents. The source of these charged
particles is a heated cathode which causes the atoms of
the sample to ionize. These were known as cathode rays at
the time. In 1897 Thomson set out to prove
the cathode rays produced from the cathode
were a stream of negative negatively charged particles
called electrons. From Maxwell's theory he knew that charged
particles could be deflected in a magnetic field which is
shown just about here. So, depending on the polarity, the
electrons went up or down. Because of the bending
of the path of the emitted electron in the
cathode tube experiment, it became clear that it had to
be a charged particle, negative in nature because it was
pushed by the north south magnetic field
that has been put into the electron beam
path. Through his work science was introduced to a whole
new discovery namely the electron. Through his work
the result was a model for the atom that acknowledged electrons
and the fact that they can be taken away from the atom,
leaving a positively charged atom. The discovery of
these subatomic corpuscules overturned the notion that
atoms are indivisible. The best description
at the time was that it would resemble a plum
pudding, where the electrons resemble the distributed
plum throughout the pudding which is depicted here. He was
honored with the Nobel Prize in physics in 1906.
When Chadwick famously discovered
the neutron, it caused a debate that was finally more or
less settled at the 7th Solvay Conference in Brussels,
Belgium in 1933. The only alternative to
neutrons was the existence of nuclear electrons
which would counteract some of the proton charges
of the nucleus. Since by then it was known that
the nuclei had about twice the mass than could be
accounted for if they were simply assembled from hydrogen
nuclei, meaning protons. But how these nuclear
electrons could be trapped in the nucleus was still a
mystery. This is when and where it was decided, at the Solvay
Conference, that a neutron is not a combination of a proton
and electron, but rather a fundamental particle
without an electrostatic charge, meaning it is
neutral. Hence the name neutron. After the acceptance
of the neutron, which was very much influenced
by the need to make quantum mechanics work, we basically
end up with our current understanding, in essence at
least, of the atom. An atom has several key
attributes that are observed: a positively charged
nucleus (the nucleus is depicted here) - the nucleus is made
up of positive protons and neutral neutrons - the red and the
green if you will, red - green. The electrons do however
not fall into the nucleus which is still a little bit of a
mystery. And the ratio of the neutrons, protons,
and the outer electrons, on average is one on one on
one. Note that current nuclear physics explains the
nucleus in quantum-mechanical terms. In a nucleus
occupying a certain energetic state, each nucleon is set to
occupy a range of locations. To refresh everybody's mind, here
is what the current Periodic Table of the Elements looks like.
We see there is a periodicity, in groupings, in the
list of elements. The periodicity goes from the
left to the right, and the groupings go from top to
bottom. The term ‘element’ is used for atoms with a given
number of protons regardless of whether or not they are
ionized or chemically bonded. For example hydrogen 
in water. In short, the number of protons and the
outer electrons determine the element. When all this
is taken into account, the current understanding of the
atoms and the elements is very poor, to say the least.
If this is all that is offered after a century of research and
untold amounts of resources having been poured
into technological projects based on this,
then I would feel disappointed in fact. This is what 
drove me to study the atom and the elements. The
disappointment of in truth a highly disputable
model that asks us to believe certain things in
order to make it work, could simply not satisfy my 
need to know. Throughout the years, my personal
lesson was that the whole basics was wrong. This started
for me around 2006 and ever since the model has been slowly
growing and maturing. The strong force, which is seen at
the first bullet point, is a postulated force. It simply
was needed in order to explain how the protons would stick
together in the nucleus. So, any good model should be based on
observations and logic. Only after that comes the understanding
of the whole, or the narrative if you will. The Structured
Atom Model has the following key features. It shows 
a logical construction of the atom in accordance
with observations. It explains why the atom has a positive
nucleus with negative electrons around it. It explains
why the electrons do not fall into the positive nucleus.
It explains in a logical manner how chemistry arises. It
explains the periodicity of the Periodic Table of the Elements
and, still an open question, why do electrons and protons
not annihilate each other? Still unanswered.
SAM is a new model. No, yes, take your
pick. Let's see. This model is still very much in
development and despite some efforts to the question
as to why the proton and electron do not annihilate each
other is still unanswered, the only thing I would like
to add is that the observation would indicate that
perhaps the proton and the electron are made up of smaller
organizations. The model right now does not rule this out nor
deny it. In fact, I think this is a beautiful example of how
we can cooperate [coming] from different disciplines to find
the answer to this question. For the model itself, it is not
essential to have this question answered because it goes
beyond the scope of the organization of the nucleus. The
observation is still there regardless of the answer
to the question. There has to be an organization
to the nucleus of the atom. There's simply too
many hints and leads that cannot be ignored that
point to this to be true. When we try to find an
answer to how the nucleus of the atom is organized, we
can find no real answers at all. Only that the nucleus is
made up of neutrons and protons. How these fit together
is officially still a mystery. This presentation
will offer evidence that the nucleus is structured,
and we'll point out how this is the case, with its 
regularities and rules, and what principles are in
effect. At about 2008, I found a correlation of the
geometry of the spheres; it's called spherical geometry.
You'll be surprised how little can be found on that.
When we reach the number seven, we
reach lithium. It's called a pentagonal bipyramid with a fancy 
word, and in 2010 I understood that carbon corresponded
with the icosahedron, or rather 12 spheres.
In 2012, I found basically an entire structure of the
nucleus and how it functions. Ever since I have been a
student myself of this model and I can find correlation after
correlation. Some of these I hope to share with you here.
The model in short comes down to this. We have a
duality, which is depicted here on this slide that we call
a proton-electron pair that has the electrostatic force
acting between them and this force is the causal
factor for the principle of the densest packing
that creates geometric shapes. These geometric shapes
are integrated in a specific order and number, and they
create all the elements. During the next
slides I will try to show you how that is the
case. So, when we go into the structure of the atom model,
I would like to point out these postulations/observations that
the model is based upon. There's only one fundamental
force: the electrostatic force. The atom must have a
definitive organization which is responsible
for all the attributes of a particular element.
The neutron is not a fundamental particle, it's a 
composite of a proton- electron, but is redefined as a
connection between a nuclear electron and its surrounding
protons. A stable element must have a stable nucleus. There can
be no movement without any cause in the structure
of the nucleus. A sphere, or a proton, must always
be part of one of the three identified geometrical
structures, namely the tetrahedron, the pentagonal
bipyramid or the icosahedron. The depictions will come in
a little bit. The inner structure of the atomic nucleus
dictates the outer electron structure, or rather the orbitals. So,
here we reach the “New” neutron. This is a schematic view of it.
In the center we can see how the neutron is redefined.
Instead of being a fundamental particle, we have an electron
in the center, with two neighboring protons.
This is a stable structure. The charge of the electron in
the center is divided over the protons. This binds the
protons into a rigid connection, if you will. It resembles the
nucleus and is a stable configuration. The second electron, to
make the whole neutral again, is simply booted out. It's placed
in orbit which is about 100,000 times the radius of the
nucleus. On the left we can see schematically how the
free neutron decay occurs. At the bottom we can see
an intimately connected proton and electron, meaning
there is no more energy in that system. It does decay however,
into the top depiction of basically a hydrogen atom - a
proton and electron at a distance. On the bottom
right, we can see what happens when we go into a
triangular configuration which is depicted by helium-3.
There's simply no room for more than one nuclear
electron - they're too close to each other. The other two which
are depicted in the green here are simply booted out again.
But to balance the whole, being three protons and three
electrons, above that we see how we end up with a helium-3
with only one nuclear electron taking its resting
position in the center of the three protons, or at least
it is seeking out that point. So, in classical terms we are left
with only one neutron, two protons, and two outer electrons.
I would like to point out a paper done by Carl
Johnson (actually more than one paper) and it's called
”Statistical Analysis of Isotope Masses.” This
analysis of the precise NIST data seems to indicate
that there is no energy which exists within any atomic
nuclei to account for the existence of any Pi mesons or the
necessary binding energy of any neutrons, or of any
ultra powerful strong force, or any neutrinos for that
matter. This research has resulted in a far simpler and more
logical description of atomic nuclei. It also entirely complies
with the known laws of science. No unseen
strong nuclear force - which allegedly
works at an inverse fifth power of distance, except then it
also reverses in effect at really short dimensions - is either
necessary or represented by any energy source. I would like
to invite everybody who is very interested in this topic to
try and seek out those papers - quite profound. Here we see
the building blocks of the model. From left to right we can
identify them. First, we see the Platonic solids.
On the bottom we see the spherical geometry. Spherical
geometry is not like the so-called hard (?) geometry which uses
points and lines in a two-dimensional depiction. Here we can
see how the Platonic shapes are actually
created by using spheres. In this case the
protons, and as Plato already said, the atoms must be made
up of geometrical shapes. This picture here was taken last
year, sitting at a curb at the Grand Canyon, and I would
like to point out this gentleman with the red hat, James
Sorensen. Ever since we met, James has been participating
in this model by creating software code that led to a
threedimensional Atom Builder. We can actually recreate
on the computer the several elements. The pictures you see
during this presentation are taken from
that particular Atom Builder. The model has
already proven to be crucial for further 
continuation. On the left we see the basic building
blocks. The first one would be hydrogen, the second one would
be deuterium, the third one would be helium-3, the fourth is
helium-4. This one is the so-called pentagonal bipyramid
which equates to lithium, the first true element that
we have in the periodic table. Even the name implies this,
because lith, lithium, meaning stone, stone-like and the
last one represents carbon. Here we see some
essential tools that we used to develop the
model. Nothing fancy, nothing expensive. The magnets that
we can see on the bottom here are used as a valuable tool
because they mimic the central attraction force that is also
there in the atomic nucleus. This beautifully mimics densest
packing, or rather the electrostatic force.
Treated properly, they will show you the correct structure of the
elements. Everybody can do this. Here we see the platonic
solids again, created using spheres for the so-called
spherical geometry. Take note that the cube and the dodecahedron
are not stable. They can easily be distorted, in contrast to
the other three. So, the cube is not stable; the tetrahedron
is stable; he icosahedron is stable; the dodecahedron is not
stable; and the octahedron is stable. The proton geometrical
structure cannot exist on its own, nor can an electron structure
be on its own. They need each other. They need each
other in order to be in equilibrium. Only one on its
own cannot be, the other one on its own cannot be, together they
can be. They are in equilibrium. All the protons that we have
in this model must belong to [one of] three geometrical
structures, as I said, the tetrahedron here, the pentagonal
bipyramid represented by lithium, and the icosahedron represented
by carbon. On the left we have the electron structures
which is an octahedron and a dodecahedron.
On the bottom here I show how they exactly fit together.
The icosahedron is the most complete of the platonic
solids, meaning there is no bigger geometrical shape
that can fit into a sphere, i.e. there is no
bigger geometrical structure. The combination of
protons and electrons pull towards their shared common center
of that icosahedron. This is the primary argument for the
applicability of the densest packing principle.
Carbon embodies the icosahedron with its 20 triangular
facets. (Let me see if this is right, right). Carbon embodies
this icosahedron with its 20 triangular facets. The 20 triangles
correspond to the number of electrons necessary to reach
the noble gaseous state. With carbon, as is depicted
here, not all the triangular facets of the nucleus are
occupied, meaning there are positive spots left on the nucleus
that can still react. In the green, we can see where an electron
would be, and where there is no green yet, like here, or here,
there’s still positive charge left. So, on the left we see
a carbon with only six inner electrons. On the right we have
a carbon with the six inner electrons and the six outer 
electrons. However, take note not all the spots are green,
meaning there's still chemical reactivity left.
This is basically the fundamental principle as to why
chemistry is happening. When we take a look at the
noble gas configuration, we have the same nucleus,
however, there are (like shown on the right) extra protons. These
extra protons also imply there are extra electrons, and in the
case of neon, we get the first complete nucleus whereby all
the spots are occupied. Hence, we reached the noble gaseous
state. It's important to notice that this
icosahedron of the carbon - which is still
depicted here - has 20 triangular surfaces. So we get 10
inner electrons, and 10 outer electrons. Together they will
occupy no more positive charge, no more negative charge,
no more reactivity and again [we have] the noble gaseous
state. The main structure of the atom, or the backbone of the
nucleus, is made up of the icosahedron or, as determined in
this model, a carbon nuclet, whereby nuclet
refers to the identified geometrical shape of the
protons. Each geometrical shape or nuclet has a center of
attraction that is created and shared by the protons that
are part of that nuclet. The geometrical structures
are connected to each other by sharing no proton as
shown on the first image. Here the main structure of
the atom is therefore a collection of the connected
carbon nuclets that adhere to a doubling mechanism.
We tried to depict this in the rest of the pictures here. We go
from one carbon nuclet, to two carbon nuclets,
to four carbon nuclets, to eight carbon nuclets.
This triangle, as you can see, is everywhere on the
nucleus of the atom. This is most important: all the proton
structures will always have only triangular surface areas.
This is when it is stable. So, this triangular area is where
an electron would find its resting spot or at
least balance out and try to find that position.
Here we see how the periodicity of the periodic table is
a result of these geometrical shapes. What we see here
highlighted is the carbon group in the periodic table.
The carbon belongs there, silicon belongs
there, germanium belongs there. When we go 
to shapes, we get this picture. On the left
we see carbon made up of 12 nucleons or protons. In the 
center we see silicon which is 28 in total. However, on the left
we see the same recurring carbon nuclet which is where all
the reactivity or the chemistry is. On the right we see the
green. Every time we see green, it resembles a neutralized
spot, meaning that part of the atom or the nucleus
does not participate anymore. When we reach germanium,
which is made up of 70 nucleons or protons, we can see that
basically the whole atom is neutralized. And again the same
recurring carbon nuclet. The numbers still add up. So, when
we see in this model these numbers here they correspond
exactly to the element. Another example is the alkali
metal group, lithium, sodium and potassium. When we try and
take a look at those shapes, we get the following picture. On
the left we see lithium with seven particles in
the pentagonal bipyramid. In the center we get
sodium - 23 particles. Again, the only active part
of the atom is the red part here and to the left the
neutralized part. On the right is potassium- 39.
The whole atom is neutralized except for that lithium nuclet.
A final example would be the noble gases. So, we've taken neon,
argon, krypton. When we take a look at the shapes, we get the
following picture. Everything is completely green - only
neutral endings as I call them - and we see neon with 22
in this case. Neon has 20, 21, 22 as stable isotopes, chosen
22 here. Argon with 38 here, and krypton with 80 here. And this
keeps on recurring, this keeps repeating.
The cycle of eight. Here we see how the periodicity of
the periodic table of the elements is the result of these
geometrical shapes. So the valence factor, or rather how
many connections we can make with a certain element,
we can see that the carbon is usually taught to us as being
a plus 4 or a minus 4. The nitrogen being a minus
3, the oxygen minus 2, the fluorine minus 1. We can
see the number of green increasing. Meaning 
every time a pair is added, that part of the atom is
neutralized. And the valence factor is dropping by one.
When we continue, we reach neon, completely neutral. Sodium
however, is plus 1 represented by the lithium nuclet again,
as we saw in the previous example. Magnesium simply has
two of those. Aluminum is a little bit more complex, it has
a lithium nuclet or geometrical shape and on the right side
we see the yellow, which represents a beryllium
nuclet, just a little bit heavier than the
lithium. After that comes silicon. Silicon again is +4 or -4
and +2. But we see, just as above, the carbon nuclet. And here
the active carbon nuclet, on the right side the atom again
is neutralized. This keeps repeating and repeating and
repeating - the periodicity of the Periodic Table of the Elements.
Carbon 14. Most commonly known example I would say,
carbon 14 is radioactive for approximately 5,000
years or something to that effect, and actually we
see the densest packing at work. In the center is a general
depiction found on Wikipedia for example, how an electron is
booted out, or in this case over here, we see how a neutron decays
into a proton and an electron. They also talk about neutrinos and
anti-neutrinos, but we leave them out for the moment.
On the right side here, according to the new model, we can see
carbon-14. In the center we have the same carbon nuclet that
was blue just a moment ago. We have on the top one extra
neutron and at the bottom one extra neutron, meaning it's
a proton plus an electron to bind them together. When they
come close, they decay. Meaning the two are together now
and there's only one electron needed, or rather actually
there's only room for one electron. So this second electron
is booted out, as we can see here. It takes its place in
the orbit, therefore we reach the next element. So, you could
say in classical terms, that the numbers are six protons,
six electrons and eight neutrons becoming seven
protons, seven electrons, and seven neutrons. That's
the decay. If we talk the new model, we actually 
have over here 14 protons with eight inner
electrons (the six of the carbon plus the two of
the loose neutrons) and the six outer electrons
that have always been there and it decays to the bottom
to again 14 protons, seven inner electrons and seven outer
electrons. This is the so-called beta minus decay.
Now, our current research still focuses very
much on these structures and we're trying to create a
corresponding periodic table of the elements. Not so
much that the current one is wrong, but there are
some improvements to be made. Half the elements still
have to be created in the Atom Builder that was mentioned 
before. We're not there yet, it's quite complex because of
the number of possibilities that arise due to the doubling 
factor. So, we are currently for example looking
at the possibility of the existence of elements halfway
the periodic table of the elements that have not yet been
discovered. I'm not talking about the real heavy elements
I'm talking about elements halfway the periodic table, close
to iron, close to copper, close to silver, gold etc. Nature 
tends to skip these steps not so much because it cannot
be done, but because the combination of two to make the fusion
happen usually we get a helium nucleus or an alpha particle
which combine. An alpha particle consists of four of these
protons, but to create that missing element in between,
we need a deuterium to act on that. Just on chance-based
and the abundancy of certain elements makes it almost
impossible. Besides that, we are not even aware that there
might be something missing. It is my belief that ultimately
these elements will be either discovered or created and I
hope, I think, might actually validate this model in the
future. We can see here how it basically resembles a tree-like
structure and where this doubling effect is coming on.
So, this is like a stem, two branches which go into
another two branches and another two branches, or rather
four. Interesting to note over here there's a collision.
The two branches basically touch each other and that
happens just about where the stable elements lead and bismuth,
which are the most stable last elements in the periodic
table, from that point on all the elements are radioactive. I
believe that due to that coming together of the branches is where
it breaks. The bottom basically breaks up and the atom
is split in two. I think we all know what that leads
to. This theory is still far from complete - it
provides actually opportunities for everybody to
participate in this advancement. There are limitations to
specific fields of science due to limited understanding of
the atom I believe - in general and the elements specifically.
The atoms affect just about everything. In fact, I would like
to challenge the scientific community to either point out these
flaws and provide the next answer, or a clue or an error, or
validate a proposed model. This is something I think we
should all agree on. All that is presented here today
has been done without any professional support and
represents a few creative minds working together.
I can only imagine what we could achieve
as a collective. We see here a screenshot
basically of the Atom Builder that has been created. Again,
James Sorensen has been most important in this. He has been able
to convert the model that I have in this rudimentary form into
this Atom Builder and we can see some of that here. Anybody
who is interested in this and learning more about this,
I would like to invite to the breakout room. We have a beautiful
setup and we have lots of examples. We have magnets you can
use and create and play with. I would like to summarize the new
atomic model as follows. We have a duality
that we call a proton-electron pair with the
electrostatic force acting between them. This force is the
causal mechanism for the principle of densest packing that
creates geometrical shapes. These geometrical shapes
in a specific order sequence and number create all the
elements. The model shows to observe nature and properties
of the atom and explains the reason why the nucleus of
the atom is positively charged, why the outer
electrons stay at range and do not fall into the
nucleus and addresses a causal factor for chemistry.
In fact, physics and chemistry are kind of separated, exactly
where the atom is. In this case the physical model goes
straight into chemistry and there are many, many more
implications and consequences - too many
to mention today. There are some potential
implications and I named some here.
We have plasma physics, astrophysics,
cosmology. I think we can reach a far
better understanding of the nuclear
structure. Better understanding of chemistry,
nuclear fusion and fission. Maybe even smaller nanotechnology.
Radiometric dating - which is, to say the least,
quite controversial - and transmutations and
perhaps, as I mentioned, new elements. To conclude with
the thanks. Many people to thank, but a few persons
in particular: Susan Schirott, Mark Span, Jean
Hafner for your EU support - unwavering I
would say. James Sorensen – special. He made the Atom Builder
and a website and that will become in the end I hope a tool that
we can use for educational purposes. Jan Emming for the
text editing and his unwavering support as well. Karen
Elkins with graphical representations and feedback. And I would
like to conclude there. Unfortunately, I cannot show you an
animation, but again I would like to invite you
to the breakout room where we have some lovely
animations going and I would like to
thank you for your attention.

”In the sphere of thought, absurdity and
perversity remain the masters of the world,
and their dominion is suspended only
for brief periods”, so opined Arthur
Schopenhauer, my favorite of the well-known
philosophers because he could look on the dark side.
Let me attack some of the absurdities
regarding ‘space’, ‘ether’, ‘nothing’ and
’infinity’ by jacking apart the word ’cosmological’.
Note the middle word is ‘logic’.
Really intelligent, but irresponsible
creative thinkers have found the perfect
intellectual playground: ‘cosmology’.
The subject is far enough removed from
practical life that we really don't care
that much. We love the sensationalism and
creativity and the not so very mundane
mystery. But this playground is now
costing the world a lot of resources.
Hear ‘money’, ‘cash’, ‘moolah’, ‘filthy looker’ or
whatever your favorite term may be.
In the current expositions of the James
Webb Telescope with its discrediting of
the Big Bang, now is a good time to call
a halt to the cosmological
chicanery or ’cosmo-illogicality’.
Even prior to the James Webb Telescope
revelations, astronomers had discovered
large-scale galactic structures.
Actually Birkeland currents, which they
characterized as ‘massive spinning
filaments’ with unclear provenance.
These are not so much of unclear
provenance in the Electric Universe
paradigm, which goes a long way towards
climbing out of the rabbit hole, at least
in the material realm. Heidegger, a
heavyweight thinker, noted quote ‘nothing
nothings’ end quote. In other words,
nothing doesn't do anything, it can't
contain anything like a marble or like
the universe. And it doesn't make up real
space or volume in the physical universe.
There is no such thing as ‘nothing’ or
’nothingness’. The term is just and only a
mental marker used for contrast or as a
reference, like zero. The philosopher
Michael Miller wrote quote, “As Parmenides
pointed out about 2,500 years ago, and as
Ayn Rand reminded us more recently, there is
no nothing. To say that a void exists
is to say that there is a place where
non-existence nevertheless exists. Voids
are absurd - an epistemological error, a
figment. There is something everywhere;
reality is full. It has no gaps.” End quote.
And also philosopher Michael Miller
claims quote, “The universe is not in
space, space is in the universe.” End quote.
Hooray for Michael Miller. Yes and yes.
I sometimes wish we could do away
with the cosmological word ‘space’.
Cosmologically, the term is only good for
a vague reference to a region out beyond
the observational point. There is the real volume
of the universe, which we often call ‘space’,
and then we have the imaginary infinite
extension of the Cartesian coordinates, x
y and z which we call ‘space’. We mistakenly conflate
the two concepts. But these are not the same thing. This
false idea of space cannot be valid, or
reified nor specified. But neither can
volume be reified for that matter - but only specified.
Neither volume, nor space in general, can
be reified into something that stretches,
shrinks, curves, warps, or ripples. The
material inside the volume may ripple, but not volume
itself. Given both sound reasoning and evidence,
the EU paradigm has confidently settled
on the conclusion that the volume of the
physical universe is filled with an ether.
In other words, the existence of an ether
is axiomatic. It should not be up for
debate. Currently, the EU thinking is that
this ether is composed of polarizable
neutrinos, where there can be no such
thing as voids of nothingness.
Again, the philosopher Michael Miller has
paved some of the way to the model. Quote,
”’Curved space’ is a staple of 20th century
thought. Space warps are a cliche of
science fiction. Generations of science
students have tried to make sense of
curved space, and succeeded only in
warping their own minds. Curved space is
taken for granted among the learned; if
you protest that curved space is absurd, they roll
their eyes and shake their heads pityingly.” End quote.
And also, Michael Miller said concerning
the theories of relativity and lack of
an ether, quote, “The infamous Michelson-
Morley measurements cited by Einstein
were poorly done, had too short a path length, were 
plagued by other instrumental problems, and did not
consider the possibility that ether could
be entrained by the earth.” End quote.
But what does the term ‘curved space’ even
mean if we're curving something not even
real? Not only is it a reification but
how does it measure up against the
principle of immutable units. It clearly
violates this principle. There is a
correspondence between the human mind and physical
reality, which means that if you cannot visualize
it, it cannot be real. Bottom line: the whole
monstrous mathematical edifice of Einsteinian
thinking about relativity, and there
being no ether, has a false philosophical
foundation. It violates axiomatic
physical principles and space-time is a
double reification absurdity. Do we not 
need to do a massive rethink of all this?
More and more, people are beginning to
understand that modern academia has
fabricated this circus assembly of
falsities. A modern mythology little
better than the primitive ones at which we scoff and 
sneer. In my opinion, our wholesale rethink must
also concern the origins of humans on
Earth, languages, religions, cosmology,
ancient civilizations, the unsound
psychological condition of mankind, and
more. Not because of the dictates of sacred
literature, not because of some mystical revelation
does this awareness begin to dawn, but
because these unwieldy constructs cannot
stand the force of logic and critical
thinking applied to the vast amount of
evidence and information now available out 
there. Much of this corpus fails to become
integrated into something more
meaningful that makes sense. Thus,
we wind up with a construction that fails
the simple test of coherence and consistency.
Mankind may be on the verge of the most sweeping
intellectual revolution ever seen in this world.
For the first time in history, there is now a convergence
and reconciliation possible between the worldwide
catastrophes the first men on Earth tell us they
experienced. This ancient global experience,
adequately buttressed by geology and
planetology, demands a scientifically defensible
foundation - a cosmology called The Electric 
Universe. When just the framework of this is
developed, this reconstruction of the ancient times
sweeps away the modern mythology. It will transform our
understanding of Earth science,
paleontology, anthropology, biology,
etymology, origins, and especially
psychology and religion. To further
characterize this soulless modern
mythology, it remains adamant about some
of its absolutely absurd and
disconfirmed claims, such as the
invariance and randomness of radioactive
decay; the constant speed of light in
space; the absence of an ether; and the universal
constant of gravity, among many other aspects.
This modern mythology and its followers
largely remain impervious to
understanding the electrical force
as being the major structuring and
energizing agency in the universe, as
well as the major factor in sculpting
the geological formations on the surface
of the Earth and the other planets.
Would you believe that the proponents of
the modern mythology sling vast amounts
of time around as the explanation for
otherwise inexplicable developments? You
don't have to strain to believe this, quote, 
“The doctrine that the Earth was of
unlimited age allowed geologists to
explain any phenomenon, not by the laws
of physics, but by ‘reckless drafts on the
bank of time.’” End quote. Chamberlain 1899.
On the other extreme from nothing or
zero, ‘infinity’ may also be a useful
mathematical construct. But it cannot be
applied to any countable or measurable
aspect of the tangible physical universe.
It is misguided to think of space being
infinite, just as it is for zero being a
number. The physical universe may be vast,
beyond our scope or scale, but it is
misguided to think of it as being
infinite in its particulate makeup or volume.
The number of galaxies, stars, planets,
atoms and subatomic particles, including
ether particles, are all countable and
the number cannot be infinite. To think
otherwise, violates our foundational
logic and opens the door to mysticism
and intellectual and spiritual chicanery.
So, does the physical universe have 
a boundary? Maybe not so much.
Think of this boundary not as a thing,
but rather as a limit of what is
included with nothing else. The 
non-sequitur question is often asked,
what is on the other side of
the boundary of the universe?
The obvious answer is - nothing. Nothing.
The definition of the universe is such
that it includes everything that exists,
and there can be no thing outside of it.
Modern man remains also in denial as to
the tenuous hold on biological viability
that the earthly biosphere actually has.
Essentially in denial that a major
X-class coronal mass ejection or a
nearby gamma-ray burst could sterilize
our globe. With enough warning modern
man, via the aid of our military and space
exploration technology, might be able to
deal with an asteroid on a trajectory of
impact. But there is no conceivable way to even
ameliorate an incoming giant CME or gamma-ray burst.
Given that point locations in space are
addressed by the Cartesian coordinates,
we can become aware that the solar
system is playing a kind of Cartesian
doomsday roulette with humans on earth.
The frequency of the most powerful CMEs,
strong enough to send us back into the
Stone Age, evidently averages out to
about 50 years. In March 2023 two X-class
CMEs were released from the Sun, the most
powerful directly opposite to our direction.
But even then, it affected our communications.
Something to think about, because 
we are largely in denial of this threat,
and we could do something about it.
Burying our national electrical
transmission grids, would protect them
from both natural CME threats and from
nuclear weapon electromagnetic pulses.
Recently, plasma torch technology has
been developed that makes tunneling
50 to 100 times faster and easier.
My final point is a distressing one.
In spite of what the truth actually is;
about the Electric Universe; about the ancient
Saturnian configuration and its catastrophic breakup;
about the significant chronological
reduction that needs to be done,
our human race consistently distorts,
misrepresents and sometimes denies what
the reality actually is. And we 
fabricate something to fit an
erroneous paradigm or false sense of security
- and for a wide variety of perverse reasons.
Maybe someday soon more people can get a glimpse of
how far down the rabbit hole as a race we really are.
There is a way out, but not without
becoming intellectually responsible.

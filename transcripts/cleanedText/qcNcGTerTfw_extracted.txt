THE ELECTRIC COMET - Best Evidence
Presented by
THE THUNDERBOLTS PROJECT™
What is a comet?
To answer that question we've
contrasted the common scientific view
with new evidence that
challenges that view.
The new evidence directs
our attention to the
Electrical behavior of comets,
almost entirely ignored through
the course of the space age.
Of course, theoretical
issues will always arise
when facts and interpretations
are intermingled.
But, when a theoretical
interpretation masquerades as fact,
that is a violation of the first
principle of scientific investigation.
For many decades, it's been
held that a comet is a leftover
from the primordial formative
phase of the solar system.
That phase is typically
counted in billions of years,
and more often than not, the comet
theory will be stated as fact
simply because the idea is
popular in the scientific media.
And so we read that...
"Comets are often referred to as 'dirty snowballs'.
They are left over from the formation of
stars and planets billions of years ago".
This popular message blurred a crucial
distinction between what is known
- the undisputed facts -
 and a theoretical supposition.
So, we're told a story ...
"Comets are basically dusty snowballs
which orbit the Sun. They are made of ices,
such as water, carbon dioxide, ammonia
and methane, mixed with dust.
These materials came from the time when
the solar system was formed".
In this case, the faith in a theory
is ironic, since no fact about comets
has even remotely substantiated a
comet's origins billions of years ago.
And, there are dozens of reasons
not to believe that idea.
So, it's encouraging to see a sliver of doubt
now creeping into official comet science.
We see it, for example, in the
science magazine Sky and Telescope:
formation in the solar system
about 4.6 billion years ago".
'Suspected'.
That's a refreshing use of language
actually describing the present situation.
Always remember that today's textbook theory
of comets arose prior to the space age.
And where interpretations differ,
the first reference should be
the factual bedrock of comet science,
not theoretical suppositions.
With this in mind, we offer here a
comparative analysis of two models:
1) the standard model; and
2) the electrical model.
Both models are sufficiently explicit to
invite a wide range of scientific tests
where the inherent predictions
of the two models
can be readily compared
to objective findings.
Standard Model of Comets
The standard model, largely
unchanged since the 1950's,
sees comets as a window to the
formation of the solar system.
Here these bodies are composed
of the primeval matter
from which the Sun and
the planets formed,
perhaps holding keys to
the origins of life.
A comet is a dirty chunk of ice,
and it's visible displays are
due to warming by the Sun,
such that vaporized water ice and other
volatiles erupt as jets from the surface.
As we found in our first
electric comet documentary,
the standard model did not fare well
in the course of the space age.
Taken as a whole, the failure is confirmed
by the direct testimony of leading
comet investigators as they confronted
a continuing stream of surprises.
Together, these surprises
add dramatic support for
an alternative perspective
- an electric model.
Electric Model of Comets
The electric model starts with the
evident electric field of the Sun,
a massive electric potential across
the volume of the heliosphere.
In this view, comets possess
accumulated charge.
And they move on distinctly
elliptical orbits -
that means, they periodically plunge
through the Sun's electric field,
and as they enter regions of different
charge these bodies discharge electrically.
To place this summary in it's historical
context, the door must stay open to a new
(and perhaps unsettling) truth
about planetary history.
When we observe planetary
motions today,
we see highly stable and
predictable orbits,
as if the planets had moved
this way for a billion years.
But, it has not always been so.
Our confidence on this point comes from
the consistency of global testimony.
It seems that every
culture on Earth
preserved vivid memories of
world altering catastrophe.
And the agent most
commonly cited is a comet.
Irrespective of
differences in language,
the cultures describe a monstrous
form attacking the world.
And these descriptions consistently use
the local words and symbols for a comet.
Well, this is ground
we've already covered,
but we cannot afford to ignore a
consistent and global human pattern,
no matter how challenging to
conventional opinion today.
Converging human testimony from around
the world assures us that Solar System's
history was punctuated by episodes of
instability and interplanetary violence.
Comets, asteroids and
meteors originated in
the electrical excavation of surface
material from planets and moons.
As we've documented in earlier episodes
of this series, the most notable
players in these events were our two
closest planetary neighbors today:
the planet Venus
and the planet Mars.
For this reason, our reconsideration
of comet theory requires
that we address the worldwide
memories of planetary upheaval.
Comets are not
what we've been taught.
Yet, recent investigations of
comets can take us directly
to this extraordinary
conclusion.
Standard Model of Comets
One of the most telling milestones
in the history of comet science
was the Deep Impact Mission
to Comet Tempel 1.
But, here is a
remarkable dilemma.
As occurred in all prior
visits to comets,
no appreciable water ice was seen on
the surface of this active comet.
From the first disclosures of dry
cometary surfaces, theorists speculated
that such surfaces simply hid the icy,
watery content beneath the surface.
Then, in response to solar warming,
subsurface pockets of water vapor formed,
exploding through the crust
to create the observed jets.
Of course, the envisioned rupture of the
surface would expose the presumed ice below.
But, as occurred in
all visits to comets,
no detection of Tempel 1
subsurface ice was ever reported.
Nevertheless, mission scientists
tell us that infrared readings
did detect substantial water
ice in the ejecta cloud.
"Though ice was not observed on the surface in the impact region,
strong absorptions near 3 µm (micrometer) due to water ice are
detected in IR measurements of the ejecta from the impact event."
The enigma deserves investigation.
What happened at the surface and below
the surface at the moment of impact?
Most NASA scientists interpreted the
fast-moving cloud as vaporized silicates.
The cloud was self-luminous at an
estimated 1000º to 2000º Kelvin,
and the low angle of the impact and
blast propelled ejecta downrange.
The infrared readings of the ejecta
occurred about 3 seconds after impact
as the cloud came into the
view of the infrared camera.
These readings show what NASA scientists
describe as a narrow beam of water.
This water column was easily distinguished
from the rapidly moving dust cloud
and was very close to vertical
directly over the impact site.
That's a bizarre contrast to the
trajectory of the dust cloud.
"The highly collimated water ice-rich component
corresponds to a low-velocity, high-angle (i.e.,
near vertical), ejecta cloud above the impact."
How did a vertical column of water
get instantaneously separated from
an explosion of dust, heated to over
1,000ºK and propelled downrange.
The Electric Comet model
offers an answer.
The heated silicate cloud
would be ionized (a plasma),
a conductive pathway for an
explosive electric discharge.
The evidence indicates the discharge occurred
between a negatively charged nucleus
and a surrounding region
of positive charge.
An abundance of hydrogen ions gathered at,
or close, to the surface of the nucleus
would provide the necessary
conditions for two things:
first, an instantaneous electrical
breakdown, or discharge, on impact;
and second, an equally instantaneous
electrochemical response to the discharge.
Consider what is already known
from laboratory experiments.
In a condition of electrical breakdown
hydrogen ions from the solar wind,
combining with the
oxygen and silicates
can produce an abundance
of hydroxyl, and/or water.
This very process has
been proposed
to explain the enigmatic
water on the planet Mercury.
"...Oxygen-containing surface rocks could release water
through sputtering by protons from the solar wind."
The Electric Comet models suggest that
the detected column of water directly
over the impact site occurred along
the path of an electric discharge,
and that always means roughly
perpendicular to the surface.
Water created explosively,
electrochemically, in the ejecta -
even if no water lay beneath the
dry surface of comet Tempel 1.
This intriguing answer takes us
deeper into the infrared readings.
The conventional model
predicted that comet water ice
would contain substantial
quantities of dust.
This dust content would be
expected to show up as refractory
particles in the ice of the
collimated ejecta plume.
But amazingly, the ice particles
themselves were free of dust.
"These pristine materials consist of very fine grained (~1 ± 1 µm)
water ice particles, which are free from refractory impurities."
It seems the instruments measured
virgin water, water freshly formed,
as one would expect from the
instantaneous electrochemistry
of water production from
hydrated silicates.
This very point is emphasized in a
recent analysis by Dr. Franklin Anariba,
a specialist in electrochemistry at the
Singapore University of Technology and Design.
"Data from the infrared readings of the impact ejecta suggest that the
explosive event may have triggered electrochemical production of water
along an electric discharge pathway directly over the impact site."
Allow this possibility into discussions
of comet science, in particular,
the unsolved mysteries of missing
water and water creation by comets,
and the picture
changes dramatically.
"The question that must be asked is whether the water
detected in infrared readings of the Deep Impact ejecta
was the byproduct of electrochemical reactions..."
"...driven by a potential difference between the comet and the solar flux:
vaporized silicates transacting with a concentration of hydrogen ions
from the Sun, localized on or around the nucleus."
When we follow this possibility, the
missing water on the surface of Temple 1
becomes an affirmation of
the Electric Comet model.

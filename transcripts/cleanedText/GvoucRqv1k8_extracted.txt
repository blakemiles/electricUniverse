The world of science is in the midst of
an accelerated changing of paradigms.
What I mean by paradigm is a set of
metaphysical assumptions, or a worldview,
by which all subsequent observations and reasoning
are interpreted. Physics is what we think about.
Metaphysics is how we think about it.
For example, for the past two centuries,
scientists have assumed that the present is the key
to the past. Before that, they assumed that the past
was the key to the present. The assumptions
are a free choice; the consequences are not.
We're mostly unaware of the paradigms
that shape the way we think, and when
they change we become confused. We 
begin to doubt values and ideas that
we've taken for granted. We begin 
to recognize falsifying evidence.
We begin to consider alternative explanatory 
ideas. Familiar relationships fall apart.
We no longer know what to think.
Metaphysics overshadows physics.
With the previous worldview in doubt, we
have few benchmarks to judge new ideas.
As with beginning to assemble a jigsaw
puzzle from a pile of pieces, we must
push pieces around to find what 
fits. We need to play with them.
I'll use as an example the differences
between the Electric Universe - EU model
of cosmology, and the Standard Model.
The EU model assumes that electricity
and plasma ideas are the most
important for explanatory purposes.
The Standard Model assumes that gravity
and gas ideas are the most important.
Discussions of the differences between
the models often seem confused by lack
of clarity and how we think about the ideas.
Some of it seems to arise from imprecision
in the use of such words as observations,
data, evidence, facts, and theories.
People tend to use those words
interchangeably, but they can be applied
more carefully to mark distinctions in the process
of knowing. I think of observations as groups of
nerve activations, and data as strings of electrical
on-off signals without interpretation by some
theory. They are the immediate responses
of detectors, whether biological or
electronic, to stimuli. Noting the colors of a traffic
light and holiday lights, or the number a meter
needle points to, are all observations.
Evidence is a group of observations or
data selected to be relevant to a
preconceived, but evolving idea of the
phenomenon that's of interest.
Evidence is ambiguous; it can be relevant
to several different phenomena and its
meaning will be different with each one.
Observations of red light are relevant both
to traffic signals and to holiday lights,
but you won't get a ticket for not
stopping at a Christmas tree.
Still, evidence isn't arbitrary;
a light is red and not green.
A meter needle points to three, and not to eight.
Facts are evidence interpreted by a theory.
The theory provides the meaning.
For the theory of traffic signals, red
means stop. With a theory of circuits,
a meter reading of 3 means 3 Volts.
Evidence tells you that something is,
theory tells you what something is.
Facts make sense of evidence. A 
theory is a set of interrelated ideas
that are constrained and shaped by facts,
but that also define and determine what
facts are. Theories and facts are inter-
related. Facts can't exist apart from
the theory that they support,
and it also gives them meaning.
This is what is meant by the
phrase, ’facts are theory-laden’.
Conversely, theories are fact-laden.
These are not independent processes, but
different emphases on a single, evolving
process of making sense that's circular,
iterative and reflexive. ’Making’ is a creative act
that involves imaginative interpretation; it's an
intrinsic aspect. ’Making sense’ is not simply
seeing what's naively there. A successful ‘making’
results in a narrative or story that is
coherent, consistent, and corresponds with
the theory's interpretation of the selected 
evidence. These definitions are soft; they add
clarity to the usual vagueness, but 
don't entirely eliminate it. Additional
confusion arises from thinking that
Electric Universe ideas are simply added
on to accepted ideas, of what's called the Standard
Model. This has been called the inertia of prior
belief. Rather, EU ideas are founded on
different selections of observations and
data - different evidence - and the different
interpretations of evidence - different facts.
We observe lights. We select for our evidence the
ones in the sky that appear to move around the
Earth. We call them stars. Before 
Newton, the interpretation that
made sense of this evidence was that 
the stars moved in perfect circles, in the
perfect heavens by their intrinsic nature.
After Newton, the idea of gravitational
force replaced that geometric idea.
With gravity, things have an intrinsic
property of mass, whose nature is 
to attract other mass with an inverse
square of the distance relationship.
With ideas of electrically active plasma,
things have an inherent property of
charge, whose nature is to attract
opposite charge and to repel 
like charge, while inducing spin.
Mixing these ideas, is like mixing 
water and dirt - you get mud.
The EU model has a different cognitive
framework from Newtonian and
relativistic mechanics. We must unlearn
several assumptions that we usually take
for granted without being aware of them.
We presume that space is dark and empty,
or practically so. It's empty because
it's dark. We don't sense anything, so
there must not be anything there.
But now that scientists have invented
sensors that detect stimuli outside
our biologically limited ranges, radio,
infrared, ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma ray
telescopes and so on, we know that space
is full and bright. It's full of radiating plasma.
The inertia of prior belief leads us to think
that the few atoms and particles
in space behave as a familiar gas.
We take it for granted that mass and
velocity are the important parameters
and movements are determined by collisions.
But a century of experimentation with
plasma has shown that the primary
characteristics are electromagnetic -
Birkeland Currents, double layers, cell
formation, pinch effects, sorting of
constituents, multiple velocities,
evolving instabilities, electrically
versus thermally generated radiation.
We never question that the weak force of
gravity dominates. But again, both lab
experiments and observations in space
have shown that plasma forces can be many orders
of magnitude greater than those of gravity and gas.
For example, the arms of spiral galaxies
should show that the stars move more
slowly with distance from the center if they
are orbiting a central gravitating mass.
Doppler evidence shows them to have
about the same velocity, as if the galaxy
were being stirred from the edge.
One EU model speculation is that a
galaxy is a transverse pinch in a giant intergalactic
Birkeland Current with multiple filaments.
The filaments twist around the axis and
their location around the periphery of
the galaxy drives its rotation. It's more like
an electric motor than a mechanical clock.
Marklund Convection builds up
quasi-neutral plasma that spirals away
from the peripheral filaments.
The increased ion and current densities
push the plasma into glow mode and
generate stars and secondary pinches.
Think of a ring galaxy with somewhat
evenly spaced hot spots, hydrogen-2 regions
near the edge. The hot spots would be where the
filaments cross the intergalactic pinch plane.
Keep in mind that this is a simplistic
illustration for the purpose of
contrasting an idea of electrically- driven,
far from equilibrium resonant motion,
with the unquestioned idea of inertial
gravitational rotation at energy equilibrium.
Real galaxies are surely more complex.
We also take for granted that
equilibrium conditions prevail,
fully specifiable and represented
mathematically with continuous functions.
In contrast, plasma conditions are often
far from equilibrium and discontinuous.
An excess of energy flows through active
plasma, and some of it is dissipated in
the evolving instabilities and radiation.
Conditions are better represented by
the mathematics of complexity, with
discontinuities, bifurcations,
resonance states and emergent orders.
The EU model is not the Standard Model of a
four-dimensional non-linear geometry, relativity,
or a differential calculus of continuous variables,
Newtonian mechanics and ideal gas theory.
It's not the hypothetical and
metaphorical abstractions of
mathematical model making. It's observed behavior,
putting the empirical back in empirical method.
And it's not a finished theory. Only a
handful of experimenters have been
looking into the nature of plasma for scarcely a
century and their investigations are also permeated
with the vagueness I'm describing.
The unconscious assumptions of familiar
gravity and gas thinking prejudice
everyone's judgment and often can only
be corrected over time by trial and error 
processes. The EU model is a work in progress.

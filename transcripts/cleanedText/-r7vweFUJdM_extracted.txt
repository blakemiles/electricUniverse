We begin with a brief history of geometry.
Why is it that within every great philosopher
astronomer, or scientist, there lies a great 
geometer? It seems that the geometer turns
astronomer, or astronomer turns geometer, and 
vice versa. The classic definition of geometer is a
mathematician whose area of study is geometry.
Now think about it. You have Plato and
the Platonic solids; the sound of the
spheres or Musica Universalis; and the
theory of first-principle-geometry being
taught that all atoms and material is
formed out of nested Platonic solids spinning.
You have Archimedes and Archimedean
solids as well as the Archimedean 
spirals. There are others, such as the
pre-Socratic philosopher Anaxagoras
from around 467 BCE who theorized his
vortex motion of the Universe in his book, “The Nature
of Things”. Johannes Kepler was a strong believer in
geometry and tried to prove the five platonic solids
must be related to the structure of the Universe.
This idea was announced in his cosmographic mystery
published in 1596. The mathematical study of vortices
continues with James Clark Maxwell's vortex analogy of
the electromagnetic field and Lord Calvin’s theory that
atoms were vortex rings in an all-pervading ether.
There are so many more examples like
Pythagoras, Euclid and the father 
of geometry, Apollonius of Perga.
It seems that the spiral shape is at the
core of the structure of the Universe.
The whirlpool or the water spiral is a
part of worldwide folklore and it is a
magical and religious symbol for the origins of life
and energy. Whirlpools are considered gates to the
netherworlds. Ancient lore has it that whirlwinds
provide circuitry for gods, demons and witches.
In the old testament, whirlwinds are
described as a direct connection to us,
mere mortals. For example, ”Then the Lord 
answered Job out of the whirlwind.”
And “Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.”
In 1835, here we have Eugenio Beltrami and
the Beltrami vortex. This is the geometry of what we in
the Electric Universe refer to as Birkeland Currents.
Also what Don Scott did the math of a
force-free field-aligned current and the
same exact behavior as Marklund convection, as well
as the German concept of the ether ”zitterbewegung”.
In physics the zitterbewegung, jittery
motion in German, is the predicted rapid
oscillatory motion of elementary particles.
Speaking of electromagnetism being the
primal organizer of elements along
cylindrical coaxial filaments, will hop
directly into artist Dr. Walter Russell’s work.
You can see the same, or similar things,
as Birkeland Currents, and the multiple
vortex of tornadic winds that Andy Hall
describes in his “Eye of the Storm” series.
We also have Viktor Schauberger's work,
here showing longitudinal vortexes. What's more is it's
showing the double spiral longitudinal vortexes here.
Now observe the similarities of the
Doherty set, even down to the toroidal
construction of the double helical minimal energy
filament itself. So, what exactly is the Doherty set?
The Doherty set is an emergent, first
principle, magnetohydrodynamic geometry.
Magnetohydrodynamics is the study of
the magnetic properties and behavior of
electrically conducting fluids. Examples 
of such magnetofluids include plasmas,
liquid metals, salt water and electrolytes.
How can we validate what the Doherty set is?
Easy, by using the inverse square law.
The inverse square law shows that light,
electromagnetic radiation, gravity, and 
electricity, all obey the same scaling rule.
The Doherty set is, among other things, a 
series of cascading spherical pressure gradients.
The projective super geometry is a simplex.
But it is nonetheless doing only one thing,
which is repeating the initial Bessel
function, iteratively, over and over again,
like a beating drum, recursively building
up progressive geometry, along an
interconnected chain-like so-called space-
time or more accurately, a plasma fractal.
Yes, Birkeland Currents are fractal.
A fractal is a curve or geometric figure,
each part of which has the same statistical character
as the whole. Fractals are useful in modeling
structures, such as eroded coastlines, or 
snowflakes in which similar patterns recur at
progressively smaller scales, and in
describing partly random, or chaotic
phenomena, such as crystal growth,
fluid turbulence, and galaxy formation.
The Doherty set can be thought of like
the Mandelbrot set, but instead of
exploring the complex and imaginary fields and
fractions, this scalable geometry exposes plasma, or
ether, or what mainstream cosmologists refer to
as the just mentioned space time, to be fractal.
Speaking of fractals, let's look at the Mueller set.
The Mueller fractal is the basis of global scaling
developed by Hartmut Mueller. We can 
observe the similarities here and
how octaves as well as harmonies of
sound also abide by similar scaling laws.
So one might intuitively assume that
fundamentally, on every scale there must exist this
wave-nested-within-wave behavior and 
indeed, that is exactly what the Doherty set is.
Is it possible, that in a Universe of electromagnetic
induction, the Doherty set is the master key of
electromagnetism itself? And in the big picture,
perhaps the geometry of the Electric Universe model?
I met professor Donald E. Scott at the
Thunderbolts EU 2017 conference, for the
sole purpose of showing him
my cartographs and geometry.
Don was baffled and exclaimed that I
discovered it before him, which we will
find out. Many people were on to this idea
before us, so I then gave my whole body
of work to Don Scott for a review and he said
quote, ”Buddy, I have examined (I believe all) the
links and YouTube videos you sent me.
They are quite impressive because you
are clearly able to include the wild
complexity of what the interior
structure of a Birkeland (force-free,
field-aligned current) would look like,
if we were able to get inside one.”
”Nice work. I see that you are aware of
the complex structure that my model
says is inside a Birkeland Current.
But, in another sense the overall
property is quite simple: it is a set of
concentric spirals whose pitch angle increases
smoothly and continuously with radial distance.”
It is important to understand that the words ‘helix’
and ‘vortex’ are not the same. They are not synonymous.
A helix is a twisting spiral path, wrapped around
a cylinder. Example. A rope wound around an
infinitely long pipe. That is the shape of a Birkeland
Current. On the other hand, a vortex is also a
twisting spiral path, but it is like a rope wound
around a cone. It is a finite length, not infinitely
long. All vortices come to a point. They
are not like a Birkeland Current, many of
which are light years in length.
Marklund convection is a physical process
that goes on in a certain class of Birkeland Current.
It depends on there being actual charged particles
and electric fields present to interact with each
other. A process is very different from a shape,
but a shape can also be many processes.
Now, let's compare all of this to the
spiral Periodic Table of Elements. Here's 
Walter Russell's Periodic Table of Elements.
And here is the Doherty Periodic Table of Elements.
Have a look-see at the meandering of the
wave crest and wave trough.
”We are all electric creatures floating
in the electric sea of this electric 
universe. In more simple words,
we might say everything in the Universe
is trying to become every other thing;
and every condition of everything is trying
to become every other condition.” The Universe
indeed seems to be mimicry on all scales,
everything becoming everything else. Lest we forget
James Clark Maxwell himself was a great
geometer. Just look at the skills of this
cartographer. He is a map maker and an excellent
one at that. We are all mapping it out in one way or
another. Ah yes, hopf fibrations, spinors, and twistor
theory which fundamentally use Maxwell's equations.
Look at the similarities there. We have to do a brief
on British physicist Tony Skyrme, or at least his
work on skyrmions which are theorized
to be the structure of ball lightning.
”These objects are quite intricate from a
geometric point of view,” said Dr. Sugic.
"They resemble a complex system of interlocking 
rings, with the hole forming a particle-like structure.
What’s particularly interesting is 
the skyrmion's topological properties -
they can be distorted, stretched or
squeezed, but will not come apart.
This robustness is one of the properties that
scientists are most interested in exploiting.”
If this is true, and these structures
are inherent in the Doherty set,
this gives more credence to the predictive power of
the set to show off the inner and outer interactions of
skyrmion behavior, and a seemingly
infinite amount of applied combinatorics.
What these examples show, is magnetic and
electromagnetic behavior exhibiting precise geometries.
We can even think of it as a 
toroidal node, a filamental Universe.
It is all double helical, but it is helical
because of its toroidal construction,
and this idea is true on all scales. ”Most 
of the so-called laws of nature are habits.”
Idea and memory is constructed within the
self-descriptive circuit, along with being and form.
The field creates the form. Higher order magnitudes
of this integrated information system build up
cascading morphic resonance, or morphogenetic 
fields. These are quaternion, just like the
construction of baryonic matter and cell 
growth, as well as multiplicity in living systems.
In mathematics, the Cayley-Dickson construction
named after Arthur Cayley and Leonard Dixon,
produces a sequence of algebras over 
a field of real numbers, each with twice
the dimension of the previous one.
The number of filaments, nested inside of
filaments, nested inside of filaments, is
a Cayley-Dickson construction. This nesting
behavior is indicative of coaxial cables and filaments
as well. Getting back into it, we have Benoit
Mandelbrot and the fractal revolution which directly
led to the telecommunication and computing age with
the introduction of fractal antennas.
Nature is fractal, communication is
fractal, electricity is fractal. Think fractals,
filaments, frequencies – f f f. In music,
three f’s is a fortissimo, meaning very, very 
loud. I find it very pertinent, because this is
indeed a very loud message to the world.
There is a fractality to everything. We
are the break in the symmetry. Iterative,
constructive and destructive feedback
loops integrate coherent harmonic
circuitry. Worded differently,
coherence or consciousness in the ether is geometric
and is composed of a series of fractal feedback loops.
As self-organizing systems, our integrated 
information circuitry is inter-scalar.
This is a gestalt-type of thinking - the
parts are related to the whole and the
whole is related to the parts type of ideation.
Geometry, and especially the Doherty set
play an interdisciplinary role in our lives, everyday
phenomena, and the progression of human knowledge.
It is self-evident that geometry is a critical
component of the Electric Universe model of cosmology.

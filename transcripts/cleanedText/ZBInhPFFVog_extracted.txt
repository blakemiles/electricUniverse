The Sun is the source of all power on
Earth.
The SAFIRE Sun generates energy,
comparable to the Sun's photosphere.
Imagine being able to tap directly into
the Sun for power.
[Music]
The SAFIRE technology was designed and
built to replicate the atmosphere of the
Sun in a laboratory on Earth, and to test
the Electric Sun model.
[Music]
These are the factors we control. These
are some of the things the SAFIRE lab
is now capable of.
[Music]
[Music]
These are some of our recent discoveries.
[Music]
In our tests and experiments, we have
found no disparities with the Electric
Sun model.
In fact, all the evidence to date,
indicates that electricity is the primal
force in the universe.
[Music]
SAFIRE is a nuclear plasma reactor,
designed to reproduce the atmosphere of
the Sun in a laboratory. A wide array of
instruments provides real-time data of
the chamber conditions, allowing a level
of control not available in most
reactors. Optical spectroscopes, mass spec
and Neutron detectors,
bolometers, thermocouples, infrared and
UV cameras, 4k digital cameras and
patented gimbal-controlled Langmuir probes,
which can monitor electrical conditions,
while also recording optical and mass
spec data.
[Music]
Telemetry can move the Langmuir probes
throughout the chamber, accurate within
0.02 millimeters.
[conversation]
All data is sent to the SafCom
Control where it is captured and
catalogued for later analysis.
[Music]
The SAFIRE team has discovered the key
to obtaining and sustaining high energy
plasmas. SAFIRE can create, control
contain, and repeat any number of plasma
regimes.
The hot plasma self-organizes and
develops its own electromagnetic
containment field.
[Music]
How does it work?
[Music]
We introduce hydrogen into the chamber.
The anode is a metal alloy. The power
going in is electrical. The reaction
produces high energy levels, which
translate to thermal heat. The heat
creates steam to run a turbine, to
generate electricity. The hydrogen can be
reused. The output is electricity,
the majority going to an external grid
and the rest routed back to the power
input. To date, after the reactions, all
measurements and analyses show this to
be a clean process, producing no negative
radioactive side-effects. In fact, note
that nuclear radioactive materials are
not required.
[Music]
SAFIRE is mixing elements at the
atomic level. What you are looking at is
a patented design that uses atomic
hydrogen in a self-organized plasma.
[Music]
The atomic hydrogen interacts with the
other elements in the chamber, causing
nuclear reactions that are transmuting
elements, from one to another.
And these are the elements that SAFIRE
produced as a consequence of the nuclear
reactions.
What you are looking at here, is an
experiment, run over several hours. We
were adjusting the chemistry to get
different results; the aim being to
explore higher energy levels. On this day,
the rise in temperature over time was
what we were intending, and yet it still
exceeded our expectations.
Three separate analyses had been done by
experts in computational fluid dynamics.
All three predicted that with 100% input
power, we would reach the thermal limit
of the chamber, and for three years these
predictions had been accurate. But with
our new adjustments and using only 7%
input power we very quickly reached the
thermal limit.
It was the elemental transmutations that
were responsible for the rise in
temperature over time, that was almost 14
times what was predicted.
The Tokamak and ITER reactors draw many
millions of watts of power, in an attempt
to contain collisional plasmas to obtain
fusion. At a cost of billions of dollars,
huge international projects have been
trying to contain plasmas, utilizing vast
arrays of superconducting magnets. So
far, this has been unsuccessful. Fission
reactors split the atom and although
they have an efficiency of around 35%,
they also produce radioactive waste. This
radioactive waste is being buried in the
ground,
or stored in facilities at enormous
expense. None of it is benign; some of it
is still deadly, even after a half-life
of over a million years. So, how is
SAFIRE different?
Self-organizing systems are a natural
process occurring throughout nature.
SAFIRE forms its own electromagnetic
containment field into a self-organizing,
high-energy plasma and unlike fission
reactors, SAFIRE is stable, controllable
and has no environmentally dangerous or
detrimental side effects. It uses
hydrogen as the primary catalyst, the
most abundant element in the universe.
[Music]
Studies done at MIT have shown that when
radioactive waste is exposed to hydrogen
isotope nuclei, the decay rate of the
radioactive material can be accelerated,
even to the point of neutralizing the
radioactivity. SAFIRE creates an
environment where hydrogen nuclei
interact with other elements, creating
double layer shells.
Within these shells, electrons, ions and
molecules are trapped by powerful
electromagnetic fields.
This is where radioactive material would
be exposed to the hydrogen nuclei to
remediate the radioactivity of that
material.
[Music]
SAFIRE can also use radioactive
materials as fuel. Elemental
transmutation will remediate the
radioactive waste back into base
elements and render it benign.
[Music]
Right now there are 450 successful
nuclear fission plants on the planet.
Imagine if they could produce energy
without creating radioactive waste.
SAFIRE is an international team which
has been collaborating with individuals
from Orion Energy,
Lockheed Martin, U.S. DoD, Los Alamos,
Lawrence Livermore Labs, Space Propulsion
Consultants, the University of Toronto
and many more.
[Music]
SAFIRE technology is capable of
releasing high levels of energy. To
convert this energy into usable
electrical power, is a relatively
straightforward engineering project.
Designs have already been initiated for
a power generation prototype.
Orion Energy will commercialize the
SAFIRE technology into three key
markets: 1) clean energy production, 2) heating
and 3)remediation of nuclear waste. Each of
these markets represents a trillion
dollar industry over the next 10 years.

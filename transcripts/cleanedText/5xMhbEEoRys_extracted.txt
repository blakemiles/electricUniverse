Welcome to Space News from the Electric
Universe brought to you by The
Thunderbolts Project at Thunderbolts.info.
Astronomers are reporting their
observation of the so-called brightest
and furthest pulsar ever observed from
Earth. Using data from the European Space
Agency's XMM-Newton satellite, the
supposed spinning magnetized neutron
star presents a major challenge to the
consensus ideas about such theoretical
objects. Identified as NGC 5907 X1 the
”pulsar” appears to shine with the
brightness that is a thousand times
greater than the object’s theoretical limit.
To gain a perspective on just how
stupendously bright the pulsar appears
to be, a phys.org report states, “In one
second it emits the same amount of
energy released by our Sun in three and
a half years.” As the lead author of a
paper on the object states,  “This object is
really challenging our current
understanding of the accretion process
for high luminosity stars. It is 1,000
times more luminous than the maximum
thought possible for an accreting
neutron star. So something else is needed
in our models in order to account for
the enormous amount of energy released
by the object.” The mystery for
investigators is not simply the object’s
brightness, but also the speed at which the
”pulsar’s” alleged spin rate
increased over a period of 11 years. As
phys.org reports, “The same relative
acceleration in Earth's rotation would
shorten the day by five hours in the same
time span.” What is a so-called neutron
star? Scientists tell us that the
material left over from a supernova
explosion of a massive star collapses
gravitationally, forming an incredibly
small, yet massively dense star mostly
composed of tightly packed neutrons. A
rotating neutron star is said to emit
regular pulses of radio waves and other
sources of radiation, called pulsars. But
the hypothesis of the neutron star was
not a predictive theory that was
composed and then verified through
observation. Rather, the hypothesis was
invented in the nineteen sixties after the
completely unexpected discovery of radio
pulses from the constellation Vulpecula. In 1968 it
was the world-renowned astrophysicist
Thomas Gold who proposed that  the
source of the pulses was a rapidly
rotating star acting very much like a
lighthouse, with the light beams becoming
visible on Earth with each revolution of
the star. The extraordinary speed with
which such an object is said to rotate
is sometimes many times faster than a
dentist's drill. However, in recent years,
with finer technological data have come
numerous discoveries that in effect
falsify the neutron star hypothesis. As
reported in previous Space News episodes,
this is not the first instance that
a so called pulsar’s apparent brightness
has exponentially exceeded its
theoretical limit. Other behaviors have
proved equally puzzling, including the
discovery reported in 2013, of a pulsar
that switches suddenly and unpredictably
between radio and X-ray emissions. The
lead author of a paper on that
discovery said at the time, “The people
creating models will have to rethink
what we are discovering here. When we
look now to what is so far published in
papers, nothing at this moment can
explain what is happening.” But is the
hypothesis of a mechanically spinning
lighthouse of sorts really the only
explanation for pulsars? If a crisis in
cosmology exists, is it a coincidence
that institutional science continues to
try to explain stupendous
electromagnetic phenomena through purely
gravitational mechanism? In the case of
so-called neutron stars and pulsars the
disciplines of plasma physics and
electrical engineering do offer
theoretical alternatives. It has been
suggested that a more useful analogy to
pulsar flashes is the complex radio
signals induced in Earth's ionosphere by
powerful lightning. This clue could help
to explain the evidence inexplicable in
the standard model of pulsars switching
from radio to X-ray
emissions, since lightning can produce both.
In fact, scientists attempting to explain
this puzzling switching of emissions, are
considering changes in the star’s
magnetosphere, which does bring them
closer to the electrical interpretation.
In fact in 1995 the renowned plasma
physicist Anthony Peratt and co-author
Kevin Healey published a paper, ”Radiation
Properties of Pulsar Magnetospheres:
Observation, Theory, and Experiment.” Peratt and
Healy examined well over a dozen pulsar
anomalies yet to be explained by the
standard lighthouse model. They state:
”There yet exists no self-consistent
theory to describe the Pulsar
electrodynamics.” Using electromagnetic
particle-in-cell simulations, the team
investigated a, “Magnetospheric disk
field-aligned current transmission line
system as the origin of the observed
radiation.” With external wave excitation
by as yet an unexplained source, this
model does not require a rotating object,
or the lighthouse effect. Rather, it in
effect states that an electrical
discharge occurs close to a star which
then travels along the magnetic field
lines outwards, where it meets a disk of
matter surrounding the star. Where it
meets that more dense matter, a kind of
short circuit occurs and the signal is
reflected as in transmission lines in
electrical engineering theory. In fact, in
a Space News interview, retired professor
dr. Donald Scott has suggested that the
ideal analogy for a pulsar’s flashes is
not a lighthouse, but rather a strobe
light. A strobe light is a small ball
containing a plasma driven by a simple
electrical circuit. As seen in this
picture it can consist of nothing more
than a resistor, a capacitor, the voltage
source, and a glass tube. In the 2015 Space
News, “The invention of the Neutron Star,”
professor Scott explained the analogy in
space as follows, “If we have a pair of
stars, a binary pair of stars out in
space and if they're closely spaced
there may very well be a plasma bridge
between them
and the resistance in the relaxation
oscillator is the resistance of that
plasma bridge, and so the capacitance value
depends on the surface areas of the two
stars and if one of the stars is [at a as]
being driven by an external current to
higher and higher voltage, clearly this
kind of oscillation is possible. Also,
voltage pulses can bounce back and forth
along a plasma bridge; if we have a
plasma bridge that connects the two
stars and we get a voltage pulse that
goes from one to the other, it can bounce
back again and there's all sorts of
possibilities for reflections of pulses
on high-voltage power transmission lines.”
But in institutional science today,
theorists seeking to gain a better
understanding of “neutron stars” tend
not to be specialists in electrical
engineering and plasma physics. Always
the assumption is that the detected
light pulses are produced by spinning
magnetized neutron stars, even though
said objects remain entirely
hypothetical and the predictive record
of the hypothesis grows increasingly
poor. The mantra of self-styled skeptics
is that extraordinary claims require
extraordinary evidence. Astrophysicists
freely acknowledge that the neutron
star, if it exists, would be one of the
most exotic objects in the known
universe. But an ongoing series of theory
shattering discoveries have transformed
the neutron star hypothesis from exotic
to extraordinary, to perhaps impossible.
However, as in countless other fields of
space science discovery, real
alternatives await in our Electric
Universe. For continuous updates on Space

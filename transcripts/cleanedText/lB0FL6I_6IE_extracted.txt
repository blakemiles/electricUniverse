We first began exploring the crisis in cosmology in 2021.
Since then, it has only gotten worse. The word ‘crisis’ as we
use it here, does not refer to crisis in the traditional sense.
Such as a natural disaster or physical danger.
I am referring to crisis in the Kuhnian sense, meaning a stage
at which a leading scientific paradigm breaks down due to
the accumulation of anomalies and contradictions that the
prevailing model cannot adequately address, as well as an
unwillingness to question the existing model and/or
explore alternatives. Now, since I began the series, I have
received numerous messages from individuals in other
fields, such as archeology, geology, biology, virology, and
even history, telling me that the same thing is happening
in their field as well. This suggests that model breakdown
is presently widespread and is happening
beyond cosmology and beyond the hard sciences.
While it is not possible to explore each of these crises
individually in the scope of one video, it is possible to
conjecture a possible underlying cause for all of 
the crises. Arguably it has to do with the nature of
predominant paradigms. Thomas Kuhn’s work revealed that once
a paradigm becomes deeply entrenched and institutionalized,
it becomes dogmatic, hegemonic and unyielding to falsification
and change. However, his work does not deeply explore
why this happens. In today's show, we will begin to explore
the why and the how. Drawing on my background in critical
discourse analysis, I posit that a predominant
paradigm, meaning an institutionalized paradigm that is
officially entrenched and accepted, functions as a form
of power, insofar as it operates as a dominant discourse.
In order to flesh out what this means, let's define 
our terms. Generally speaking, ‘discourse’ refers to
the communication of ideas. As a noun, discourse is
defined as any form of written or spoken communication or
debate. And as a verb, discourse means to speak or write
authoritatively about a topic. There are four traditional modes
of discourse. They are' ‘narration’,
’description’, ‘exposition’, and ‘argument’.
To define these briefly, narration is story-
telling. At its simplest, ‘description’ tells us
what things are like according to the five senses. It is a
form of describing what is observed. ‘Exposition’ is the kind
of writing and speaking that are used to inform.
The final mode of discourse is ‘argument’.
The purpose of argument is to convince through logic.
Argument is typically expressed as a theory or hypothesis and
involves persuasion. Now, while there are several
definitions of paradigm, the most common is quote “a
framework containing the basic assumptions, ways of
thinking, and methodology that are commonly accepted
by members of a scientific community or field”, 
end quote. By this definition, a paradigm will
necessarily contain each of the aforementioned modes
of discourse. In this way, a paradigm can be understood
as a type of discourse. Indeed, the word ’paradigm’
and ‘discourse’ are often used interchangeably.
And a predominant or entrenched paradigm therefore 
can be understood as an official or dominant discourse.
As the name suggests, dominant discourse is the language and
actions that appear most prevalently within a given society
on a given topic. It is the official and officially recognized
narration, description, explanation, and communication of a
particular idea or topic. Dominant discourse entails
the ultimate emergence of one discourse as dominant
among other competing discourses, and this requires 
power. In critical discourse analysis, we know
that dominant discourses or dominant paradigms, reflect
the beliefs and ideas of those who have the most power in
society. This is partly because the meaning-making
apparatuses are traditionally in the hands of the
powerful. Simply put, those with the most power are able to
define the narrative. And once this narrative becomes deeply
ingrained and institutionalized, it is taken for granted as
true, or obvious. According to CDA, a problem with dominant
discourse is that it can become so ingrained within
a society that few people challenge it. Without these
challenges, quote, “...few new ideas enter the
mainstream. The society thus may stagnate
and fail to progress.” End quote. Because it has the
power to define the parameters and move the goal posts, a
dominant discourse or paradigm narrows and limits the
response to the discourse, and furthers the uncritical
participation by individuals within it. While a dominant
discourse may be brought in scope, such as in the case of
a broad scientific paradigm for instance,
it narrows and/or reduces the public's
options for dealing and interacting with it.
In addition quote, “...even when people want
to challenge the dominant paradigm, they may fail to do so if
they lack the power to get their message... far enough into the
public eye.” End quote. Now it cannot be overstated that
the power to widely disseminate ideas, especially new ideas,
is linked to money and funding. This is 
especially true in the field of cosmology.
As plasma physicist Eric Lerner points out in an open letter
on cosmology published in the new scientist on May 22,
2004, the development and dissemination
of alternative cosmological theories and
models has quote,”...been severely hampered
by a complete lack of funding. Indeed,
such questions and alternatives cannot even be freely
discussed and examined. An open exchange of ideas is lacking in
most mainstream conferences.” End quote. Lerner goes on to
lament that quote, ”...virtually all financial and experimental
resources and cosmology are devoted to Big Bang studies.”
End quote. In addition, all peer review committees
that control funding are quote “...dominated by supporters
of the Big Bang. As a result, the dominance of the Big
Bang within the field has become self-sustaining - irrespective
of the scientific validity of the theory.” End quote.
The American theoretical physicist and philosopher Sean
Carroll published a response to Lerner's letter only one
week later, on May 29, 2004. In his response he brazenly
maintains that funding alternative research is a waste
of time, since the Big Bang theory is so well 
established. Carroll states that quote, “...at what point
does a scientific theory become so well - established that
it's no longer worth listening to alternatives. There's no
easy answer. Scientific theories are never
‘proven’ correct; they simply gather increasing
evidence in their favor, until consideration of
alternatives becomes a waste of time.” End quote.
And when exploring whether or not the scientific
community should devote a fraction of funding to consider
alternatives to the Big Bang, Carroll responds with an
emphatic no, stating that funds are finite and quote,
”...we have to use them the best we can.” End 
quote. He maintains that the chances that the
basics of the Big Bang model are wrong,
are quote, “...so infinitesimally small that
it's just not worth the bother.” End quote. Now, given the
growing inconsistencies with the Hubble constant and the
contradictory observations that are coming back every
day from the James Webb Telescope, Carroll may have been
forced to temper his stance somewhat if he were writing
this today. Returning to Carroll's letter, in response
to Lerner's point about the lack of alternative ideas
allowed at major conferences, Carroll boldly admits that
quote, yes “...young people who disbelieve in the Big Bang are
unlikely to get invited to speak at major conferences, or get
permanent jobs at research universities.” End 
quote. Carroll's response to Lerner is a perfect
example of dogma and gatekeeping in science, and sounds
more like something one would expect a politician to say.
In order to be truly empirical and to
honor the principles of falsifiability
and open debate which (if we recall from the previous show)
are supposed to be the driving principles of science, a
scientific community should, as a general
rule, allocate a percentage of funding to
exploring alternatives to the prevailing model,
and/or testing the veracity of that model.
This is why Carroll's comments and the candid nature
with which they are delivered, are so shocking. How can a
scientist claim that we have come to the end of the road
with respect to our quest for empirical knowledge and
exceptionalism and superiority of the Big Bang mirrors
claims by politicians and political theorists about politics
and governance. For instance in the book,
“The End of History and the Last Man” American
political scientist Francis Fukuyama argues that liberal
democracy has proven to be a fundamentally better system than
any of the alternatives. As such, liberal democracy
represents quote-unquote, “the end of history.” In
other words, liberal democracy is the best and final political
paradigm and thus there can be no alternatives, ever.
Talk about circular arrogance and self-interest. How can
anyone who call themselves a political scientist, declare
that history ends with their particular model of 
government? The irony of the claim that Western
liberal democracy is the best and final form of government
for all countries everywhere, is evidence of the reality
that many Western liberal democracies are presently in
a state of utter chaos and societal collapse or decline.
For instance, the United States, with its exemplary and
enviable constitution, has been in decline for decades and is
currently plagued by the chaos and confusion of
government-sanctioned identity politics and relativism run
amok. In addition, the U.S has one of the highest
poverty, unemployment, incarceration, mental health and
addiction rates in the western world. These are all signs
of a culture in deep crisis and let us not even begin to
mention the role of the mainstream media in all this.
As is the case with standard cosmology,
rather than address crisis and breakdown, those presently in
power in the United States tend to double down on a broken
and failing model. Whether we are talking about
the crisis in cosmology or the crisis in Western
culture, reluctance to question a broken model or system,
reflects the dogmatic, hegemonic and unyielding nature of
institutionalized ideas and predominant paradigms,
including within the institution of science.
As the American economist Thomas Sowell once noted
quote, ”Some things must be done on faith, but
the most dangerous kind of faith is that
which masquerades as ‘science.’” End quote.
Sowell has also observed that oftentimes,
what makes an idea or theory correct is
the fact that people's careers depend on it not being wrong.
And he has stated that quote, “It takes considerable
knowledge just to realize the extent of your own
ignorance.” End quote. One can also argue that it takes
considerable wisdom. The Philosopher Socrates was
once told by the Oracle at Delphi that he was the
wisest person in all of Athens, to which he replied something
along the lines of, ”Nobody knows anything and I know that I
know nothing. Thus, if I am wiser than others,
it is only because I recognize my own ignorance.”
This statement by Socrates can more or less be interpreted
as, “The wisest person is the one who knows that he know
nothing.” It is similar to a Chinese proverb
that translates to quote, “The wise man knows
he knows nothing, but the fool thinks he knows it all.”
End quote. Now, we can probably assume that Socrates
did indeed know that he knew many things and was very wise,
but the implication or lesson of his statement is that we
should never stop learning, and never stop seeking. That just
when we think we know, there is so much more to discover.
Another way to say this, is that we don't know what we don't
know. And this is why we must never stop seeking, especially
for those who claim to be scientists. So, how do we go from
the humble wisdom of ancient philosophy to the dogmatic
arrogance of present-day science and social science?
The answer is very complex and cannot be
explored in one show, but much of the problem lies in
industrialization and the related specialization of knowledge
and science. Since industrialization, science and
scientific peer review, funding has become increasingly
specialized and linked to capitalist enterprise and
big business. This growing government-science-business
alliance demands and forces specialization and
acquiescence to particular dominant ideologies and
interests. For instance, the unquestionable
greenhouse theory of atmospheric change
currently directs everything from city planning to
corporate investment. Some examples are the city planning
initiatives known as green cities, and more recently,
15-minute cities. These are official initiatives that aim
to make municipal developers and businesses conform
to particular social environmental interests.
Now, when policy demands consensus in science and
dictates what type of science is acceptable, and when
institutionalized science is happy to oblige, then 
we are no longer dealing with objective science.
This suggests that there's a growing relationship between
institutionalized science and institutionalized power.
If scientific change was merely about gradually
shifting scientific perspectives that come about due to
model falsification, as Austrian-born philosopher Karl Popper
and others have claimed, then why was Galileo imprisoned
for life for his new perspective on cosmology? And why 
was Italian philosopher and cosmologist Giordano
Bruno burned at the stake for his? Both of these men
promoted alternatives that challenge the cosmological
narratives of the catholic church, which was 
the dominant power structure at the time.
It should be noted that many believe that Bruno was executed
for his views on religion and not cosmology. But it stands
to reason that his oppositional cosmology did not
help his case. Now, while predominant paradigms and
power structures no longer burn opponents at the stake
or sentence them to house arrest for life, they do still
demonize and mock opponents and critics. For instance, in
his response to Eric Lerner's critique of Big Bang cosmology
and the lack of funding for alternative theories and models,
Sean Carroll goes as far as to call Lerner dumb and quote,
”...a crackpot who claims that the Big Bang
has no empirical successes.” End quote.
It should be noted that, in addition to Lerner, the open letter
in cosmology was signed by 33 scientists, the first among
them being Halton Arp. Halton Arp was an American
astronomer and critic of the Big Bang, along with
other observational astrophysicists, Arp
maintained that redshift observations of
galaxies and quasars contradict the Big Bang theory's
hypothesis that redshifts are caused by universal cosmological
expansion. This is one of the hallmarks of
the crisis in standard cosmology. Many of its
assumptions and suppositions are contradicted by
observational data. Now, are we to believe that a
credentialed and highly regarded astronomer and
observational astrophysicists such as Halton Arp is
dumb or a crackpot? Of course not. What Arp and others are
actually being condemned for, is daring to criticize and
oppose the predominant cosmological paradigm.
When a scientific paradigm and its
gatekeepers appear far more interested in self-preservation
and forced consensus than empirical observation and
debate, then we are no longer talking about science
and are firmly in the domain of predominant power.
However, despite the present state of science,
and cosmology in particular, there is reason to hope.
If we recall from previous shows, in the ’Paradigm Shift’
cycle, crisis is followed by ‘Model Revolution’ and eventually
’Paradigm Change’. While it may take decades,
or even centuries, for the change to happen,
once a prevailing model is at the crisis stage,
Revolution and Paradigm Shift are inevitable.
Indeed, it is the crisis that triggers the eventual 
revolution. In this respect, one can argue that the
crisis in cosmology is actually an opportunity. As one 
viewer pointed out in a comment to the previous show,
the Chinese word for crisis is a combination
of the words [danger] and opportunity.
According to ancient Chinese philosophy, opportunities often
arise from crisis. With respect to science, this suggests
that crisis or model breakdown, is also an 
opportunity for innovation and breakthrough.
The current cosmological model has given us a hundred years
of darkness: dark matter, dark energy, black holes - these
still unproven concepts have done little to
help us understand the nature of the universe.
While theories like general relativity have helped to usher
in an acceptance and celebration of paradox and absurdity.
Both within cosmology and in the broader culture.
The Standard Model ultimately views the
universe as dark, random, disconnected and 
incomprehensible. As such, it offers little hope or meaning.
So, how might a different cosmological model impact 
society? The answer to this question depends on
the nature of the new model and its world view.
One alternative that presently exists,
and which has a radically different perspective than
the present Standard Model of cosmology, is the Electric
Universe model of cosmology. The EU model posits that
electricity is the driving force in the cosmos and also
that countless electromagnetic fields connect all things
in the universe at all scales in a complex dynamic
structure. This notion of an integral connectivity
is especially interesting and thought-provoking.
The idea of a force that permeates all things from the
most infinitesimal to the most massive or galactic and
connects all things, is one that should pique our interest.
Not least because it hints at a far more cohesive universe
than we are led to believe exists. This has 
both practical and philosophical implications.
It is impossible to know which model might one day replace
the Standard Model. But one thing we can say for certain is
that we have not reached the end of history with respect
to cosmology and our understanding of the universe.
Far from it. Like Socrates and the ancients,
it may be wise to concede that there's still so
much that we do not know and so much to discover.
It is an interesting and exciting time to be alive.

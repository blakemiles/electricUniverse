How big is space?
Of course the question
demands refinement
since the term ‘space’ merely describes a
region that is empty of visible content.
When we consider for instance the
space between the Earth and the Sun,
it's a distance of just
over 90 million miles.
When we consider the distance between the
Sun and the outer edge of its influence
called the heliopause,
it stretches to a degree that the
human mind finds hard to comprehend,
to about 11 billion miles.
The nearest star system
beyond our solar system
Alpha Centauri is about 24
trillion miles from Planet Earth.
Within the Milky Way galaxy, at
least 200 billion stars inhabit
the roughly 100,000 light-years of
space the Milky Way encompasses.
And beyond the Milky Way,
the Hubble telescope has already revealed
an estimated 100 billion galaxies
with many billions more
waiting to be discovered.
In other words, space
is a big place.
One might think that within
that unfathomable vastness
for objects to suffer the same fate
as automobiles in busy traffic
would be an exceedingly
rare occurrence.
Nevertheless, a cosmic
collision is a process
that astronomers and
astrophysicists routinely propose
to try to explain countless data at
all scales throughout the cosmos.
In our own solar system, the ravaged
surfaces of planets and moons
supposedly testify to random
impacts over eons of time.
We do see types of craters that are
reproduced in impact experiments.
However, we also see endless varieties
of so-called ‘anomalous’ craters,
including straight-edged
polygonal craters,
pristinely graded and spaced
chains of highly circular craters,
craters made of concentric rings,
aligned craters,
so-called bull's-eye craters,
and the consistent preferential
appearance of smaller craters
on the rims of larger craters.
That all of these craters are routinely produced
in experiments with electrical discharge
remains a fact completely unacknowledged
and unexplored in planetary science.
A cosmic collision is a process that
institutionalized science has sanctioned for decades.
As is sometimes said: if
your only tool is a hammer,
you see every problem as a nail.
Thus, today in the
astronomical literature
objects smashing together for
some reason is routinely proposed,
even in vast rooms of space where
the odds of such collisions
are almost incalculably remote.
One of the clearest examples of
this can be seen in comet science,
in the ad hoc theories that astronomers have
proposed to try to explain a growing enigma.
When the nucleus of Comet 67P was first
imaged by the ESA's Rosetta spacecraft,
scientists were puzzled by its
double-lobed or "rubber duck" appearance.
The two lobes of the comet which
are joined by a neck region
raised questions about the
comet's origins and history.
The ESA team considered
two hypotheses.
One was that localized erosion of a single
object formed the distinct narrow neck.
The other was that a low-speed collision
between two fully formed comets,
each of which formed from accretion
in the "early solar system,"
produced the distinctive shape.
Scientists eventually settled
on the collision hypothesis
in part because of the extraordinary
layering of the nucleus's rocky material
which in many regions appears indistinguishable
from sedimentary or igneous rock on Earth.
As investigator Matteo
Massironi stated,
"It must have been a
low-speed collision
in order to preserve such ordered
strata to the depths our data imply."
Investigator Bjorn
Davidsson said,
"...the striking structural
similarities between the two lobes
imply that despite their
initial independent origins,
they must have formed through
a similar accretion process."
However, a more recent
scientific study in 2018
argues that 67P's formation
was much more recent,
a mere millions rather
than billions of years ago.
As reported by phys.org,
"Comets which consists of
two parts, like Chury,
can form after a catastrophic
collision of large bodies.
Such collisions may have taken place
in a later phase of our solar system,
which suggests that Chury can be much
younger than previously assumed.
This is shown through computer simulations
by an international research group
with the participation of
the University of Bern."
Unlike earlier proponents
of the collision hypothesis,
the investigators believe that
67P could not have survived
for billions of years in its
current double-lobed shape,
so they suggest that a catastrophic
collision destroyed a number of comets
from which some of the material immediately
coalesced in the vacuum of space
to produce 67P's
double-lobed nucleus,
as illustrated in the virtual
reality animation on your screen.
In response to this hypothesis, these
major points must be emphasized.
First is the truly
incredible failure,
both experimental
and observational,
of the accretion hypothesis to explain
the rocky bodies in the solar system,
from planets down to
asteroids or even comets.
As briefly described in a
recent Washington Post article,
"According to the traditional story
of the origin of the solar system,
the planets formed
slowly from accretion,
as particles in the circumstellar disk
clumped together to great pebbles,
then slightly larger spheres, on and on
until they reached their current size."
But when scientists try to re-create this
story with computer models, it breaks down.
Rather than growing, these incipient planets
tend to splinter after reaching pebble size.
How could this process result in bodies
the size of those in the asteroid belt,
let alone whole planets?"
The next problem is the incredible
improbability of cometary collisions.
This improbability is highlighted on
an official NASA webpage entitled
'Where Do Comets Come From?'
It states of the Kuiper Belt and
the hypothetical Oort Cloud,
"Each of these regions
contain billions of comets,
but they have so much room
in the vast room of space
that they get no closer to each other
than we on Earth do to the Sun."
A comet nucleus is typically no more than
a few to several kilometers in diameter.
If comet 67P's double-lobed form
were a lone or even rare occurrence,
then perhaps one could be tempted
to accept the collision conjecture
as a miraculous one-time event.
However, it is an astounding fact
that the double-lobed appearance
does not appear to be rare at all.
Although relatively few comet
nuclei have been imaged to date,
the number of bodies that have similar shapes
to 67P has grown increasingly daunting.
As noted by University of Arizona
investigator Stephen Schwartz to space.com,
"Although the number of comets for which
we know their shapes is still few,
the tendency so far is for them
to be bi-lobate or two-lobed."
The comet Halley,
comet Borrelly,
comet Hartley,
and more recently radar images
of the Comets 8P Tuttle
and comet 45P/HMP have all been
suggested as so-called contact binaries.
And of course, comets are not the only rocky
bodies to display the double-lobed shape.
Numerous asteroids are
also double-lobed.
As described by Lance Benner of
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
"Radar imaging has shown that
about 15% of near-Earth asteroids
larger than 600 feet have this
sort of lobed, peanut shape.
There must be a process that forms
the double-lobe naturally."
And two of the five moons of the dwarf
planet Pluto, Kerberos and Hydra,
also display forms which
astronomers can only imagine
resulting from the
collision of two objects.
In this view, relatively
routine collisions
in the unfathomably vast rooms
of interplanetary space
caused colliding
objects to stick together
rather than fragmenting or
simply repelling each other.
However, as longtime viewers
of this series are well aware,
experiments with electric arcs routinely
produce fused or double-lobed spheres
as seen on the screen in Dr. C.J. Ransom's experiments
to replicate the trillions of spherules
called blueberries on the surface of Mars.
The similarity to Comet 67P and other
double-lobed bodies is self-evident.
Of course every high-resolution
image of a comet nucleus to date,
as well as the more recent
radar images of comet nuclei,
reveal that comets are as far from
"dirty snowballs" as one could imagine.
Their terrains are dry, rocky,
blackened and geologically complex.
The complex layering
of Comet 67P,
which astronomers can only attribute
to accretion and collisions,
has also been seen on
other comet nuclei,
including Tempel 1 in 2005.
This was an explicit prediction
of the Electric Universe theory
which also proposed that comets, as
well as asteroids and meteoroids,
were electrically torn from the
surfaces of planets and moons.
It's not the position of the Electric Universe
that cosmic collisions simply never occur.
We do see examples of craters
on planets and moons
that may be best explained
by kinetic impacts.
But given how common the appearances of
double-lobed rocky bodies in our solar system,
including and
especially comet nuclei,
astronomers must confront the actual probability
of collisions forming those tiny bodies.
Again, a comet nucleus is a
minuscule celestial object
and as noted by astronomer and specialist
in celestial mechanics Tom Van Flandern,
"The mean distance between comets in the
hypothetical Oort cloud is 1 billion km,
so collisions and accretions
have negligible probability..."
Again, the double-lobed
appearance is stunningly common
among the comet
nuclei imaged to date.
Just how commonplace could
cometary collisions have ever been
at any time in solar system history
to produce this prevalent form.
This strange and
unfounded conjecture
is now the standard
interpretation in comet science
while no effort nor resources have
been devoted to even examining
the genuine alternative hypothesis
that the Electric Universe has offered.
In a forthcoming episode,
physicist Wal Thornhill will
explore "doubleness cosmology"
where stars and planets will
tend to be formed in pairs
and galaxies begin life with two "plasma
sumps" in close orbit about each other.
It seems that objects formed in
interplanetary Birkeland currents
will also begin life in
pairs which may coalesce,
like the central bulge
in a barred spiral
which has a peanut-
shaped cross section.
So asteroids and comets may
be expected to be found
with the same double-lobed structure
due to their electrical birth.
The world of astronomy may inevitably
confront a collision of cosmic proportions.
Not a collision between tiny bodies
in the unimaginable vastness of space
but rather a collision
with reality.

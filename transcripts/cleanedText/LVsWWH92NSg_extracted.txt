New scientific reports from Nasa's
Insight mission reveals startling data
about the planet Mars. Data which
challenges some fundamental ideas in
planetary science. In late November of
2018, the Insight Lander touched down on
the red planet's surface. One of the most
surprising discoveries for investigators
came in April of last year, when the
Lander detected a rumble of seismic
activity. According to investigators, to
date they've detected a total of 450
quakes with an average magnitude
roughly the equivalent of a 3 to 4
magnitude earthquake. The discovery
is highly significant, since space
scientists have previously ruled out the
possibility of plate tectonics in the
Martian interior - the hypothetical
mechanism that geologists have long
believed causes earthly quakes. As noted
in the February report by Smithsonian
magazine, “mysterious is the origin of
these extraterrestrial trembles. While
earthbound quakes arise when our
planet's tectonic plates grind up
against one another,
Mars lacks the same internal
architecture, leaving researchers puzzled
about the source of its quakes.” However,
as is often the case in the space
sciences, the notion that plate tectonics
cause earthquakes, is a questionable
hypothesis, mistaken as fact. Indeed, the
existence of seismic activity on Mars,
is just one among several reasons to
explore new theoretical pathways in
Earth seismology. For decades, a number of
scientists have proposed that the
Earth-Sun connection plays a major
role in triggering earthquakes. Some of
the evidence that seems to support this
view, includes the apparent correlation
between sunspot activity and earthquakes.
Along these lines, it's been proposed
that changes in the geosphere result
from a temporary intensification
in Earth's magnetic field.
In 2020, geoscience has yet to explain a
host of strange phenomena that have been
observed for many centuries preceding
large earthquakes, including mysterious
low-frequency electromagnetic emissions,
rapid unexplained changes in the
ionosphere, major temperature anomalies
seen in satellite images, the observation
of so-called earthquake lights from
ridges and mountain peaks, and
unexplained animal behaviors, including
migration several days before a
destructive quake. As early as 2003, Dr.
Friedman T. Freund addresses these
anomalies in his scientific paper: rocks
that crackle and sparkle and glow,
strange pre-earthquake phenomena,
published in the Journal of Scientific
Exploration. Dr. Freund proposes an
explanation for earthquakes which would
actually place the phenomenon in the
realm of semiconductor physics. In the
paper, Freund states that rock acts like
what is known as a p-type semiconducting
material when placed under stress. Deep
within the Earth “positive holes”
are liberated and flow to the Earth's
surface, collecting there without being
reabsorbed, which is the proposed
mechanism behind earthquake lights. In
the 2013 paper, Nature of Pre-Earthquake
Phenomena and their Effects on Living
Organisms, Dr. Freund offers a simple
summary of his hypothesis, which could
explain some of the anomalous earthquake-
related animal behaviors. “Earthquakes are
invariably preceded by a period when
stresses increase deep in the Earth.
Animals appear to be able to sense
impending seismic events. During build-up
of stress, electronic charge carriers are
activated deep below, called positive
holes.” “Positive holes have unusual
properties: they can travel fast and far
into and through the surrounding rocks.
As they flow, they generate ultra-low
frequency electromagnetic waves. When
they arrive at the Earth's surface, they
can ionize the air. When they flow into
water, they oxidize it to hydrogen
peroxides. All these physical and
chemical processes can have noticeable
effects on animals.” In
the Electric Universe,
the electrical nature of the Sun itself
provides the missing link between
sunspots and earthquakes. The Sun is
connected to the larger electrical
circuitry of the galaxy and the same
electric discharges to the Sun that
cause sunspots can affect our planet’s
ionosphere. As physicist Wal Thornhill
explains in his 2005 article, “Electric
Earthquakes”, “The ionosphere forms one
’plate ‘of a capacitor, while the Earth
forms the other. Changes of voltage on
one plate will induce movement
of charge on the other.
But unlike a capacitor, the Earth also
has charge distributed in rock beneath
the surface. And if the subsurface rock
has become semiconducting because of
stress, there is an opportunity for
sudden electrical breakdown to occur
through that rock.” Thornhill proposes
that underground processes occurred
similar to those found in atmospheric
lightning. The small-scale traveling of
charge results in precursor
electromagnetic effects, perhaps similar
to the so called stepped leaders between
cloud and ground with lightning. However,
larger earthquakes may involve a vast
electric circuit from below ground,
through the atmosphere, to the ionosphere.
In other words, Thornhill suggests that
the Earth stores internal electrical
energy, which can trigger subterranean
lightning which may cause deep
earthquakes. In this view, massive
disturbances of the ionosphere,
accompanying major earthquakes, are
expected. The Martian environment is of
course very different from Earth's. On
our planet, Birkeland currents entering
the poles, spark aurorae and modify our
planet's magnetic field.
However, Mars is said to have no global
magnetic field and its atmosphere
is extremely tenuous - only about
0.5%as dense as Earth's. When
solar storms impact Mars, the result can
be a global aurora which NASA's MAVEN
spacecraft observed in 2017, along with
radiation levels at the planet's surface
that more than doubled previously
detected levels. In recent years,
scientists have observed
other dramatic atmospheric and geologic
events, which have coincided with impacts
from solar protons storms at Mars. For a
number of years, astronomers have puzzled
over dramatic dust plumes, sometimes seen
erupting up to hundreds of kilometers
into Mars's upper atmosphere.
As we reported in 2016,
scientists studying Hubble Space
Telescope images of Mars, found an
apparent correlation between one such
plume and the likely arrival of a CME at
Mars. The lead author of a Nature paper
on the Martian plumes said of the
discovery, “There is a coincidence of both
events at Mars, the CME arrival and
plume observation. Therefore, it seems
plausible there was a relation between
both events.” The New Scientist report
states of the finding, “One possibility is
that plasma could be interacting with
ice grains or dust lower down in the
atmosphere and electrically charging
them, boosting them higher, but it's not
clear how the effect would be big enough.”
In fact, dust storms on Mars which
sometimes last for months and engulf the
entire planet, as well as the towering
dust devils which reach the size of
Mount Everest, remain unresolved
mysteries. Again, with an atmosphere only
about 0.5% as dense as Earth's, how
is the dust excavated from the surface
and held aloft in the near vacuum of
Mars’s upper atmosphere?
What accelerates the winds and dust, up
to speeds greater than 250 miles per
hour? And why should the storms be
composed of packed congregations of dust
devils, as seen in this image from the
Mars Odyssey mission? For well over a
decade, NASA investigators have noted the
tremendous electric fields associated
with the dust devils. From the Electric
Universe perspective, dust devils and
tornados, both on Mars and on Earth, are
themselves forms of electrical discharge.
The Electric Universe has always
predicted that the Martian ionosphere is
electrically charged even though, unlike
Earth, it has no thunderstorms. This
viewpoint is outlined in the 2005 TPOD,
’When Dust Storms Engulf Mars’. “On Mars,
electrical effects will reach directly
the ionosphere to the surface without
the ameliorating leakage via storm
clouds that we see on Earth.
Unlike radiant energy from the Sun,
electrical energy can accumulate in the
‘planetary capacitor’ for some time,
with a potential for planet-altering
events when the atmosphere finally
’breaks down’ and massive discharge
activity is initiated.” On Mars, as on
Earth, could an electrical circuitry from
beneath the ground, to the atmosphere, to
the ionosphere, be driving seismic
activity? Of course, planetary science has
only begun exploring the Martian
environment, so from any vantage point
surprising revelations are to be
expected. However, the discovery of
seismic activity on a world with
”no plate tectonics,” is not a surprise to
proponents of the Electric Universe. But
it might serve as a call to planetary
scientists, to begin exploring
theoretical alternatives, such as those
offered by the Electric Universe.

In pop culture media, force fields are portrayed in
a silly way. In Dune movies, personal force field
armor was portrayed as a covering of all but
impenetrable glowing cubes. In Star Trek, force fields
are portrayed as almost impervious shell-type
shields, and in Star Wars is being manipulated by
the mind. Really? Let's think of two
objects in space that attract each other.
If there is nothing between them, why would there
be any diminishment with increased distance?
Heidegger said “Nothing nothings”. In other 
words, nothing isn't something that can do
anything. So how is it intellectually
responsible to posit distance in nothing,
as making any real difference?
The lack of intellectual rigor in
science regarding the nature of a force field,
appears right up front in the dictionary definitions.
One such is that it is a computational 
method. Another is, it's a map of force.
Webster's dictionary defines field as a
special charm, aura, or spirit that can
influence anyone in his presence. Then
defines it redundantly as something
resembling a force field. In contrast 
to these nebulous offerings, the
Electric Universe paradigm defines
the force field in concrete terms,
something that can be easily visualized.
This issue needs more clarity, which
starts with better conceptions and more useful
definitions. A great mistake consistently being made
in science, is the failure to recognize
the existence of dipolar ether particles
and their role in physical phenomena.
Is not a force field a certain volume
of dipolar ether particles, that are
affected electrically, to stand ready
to transmit one of the two forces,
attraction or repulsion, upon
any object that makes contact with them?
Here is another question that should
have been asked long ago. If there is 
no particle medium that supports a field,
what is the material or concrete explanation,
not just the mathematical description,
for the drop-off of the field intensity in
a field where the distance is increasing?
Keep in mind two metaphysical principles: Number
one, there is no such thing as nothing. It's just
a mental construct. And two, real physical
reality can always be visualized or portrayed.
In other words, if it cannot be visualized, it 
isn't real. Given that we live in a material world
of matter and that the basic units 
of matter are what we call particles,
physical science always includes dealing
with units of matter or particles.
Thus we need to think of a force field
as something tangible and not as
something theoretical, mathematical or non-
material. However, when we feel a substance
with our fingers, it is not the atomic
matter that we feel, but it is the electric
repulsive force from the material. Is this 
not a violation of what was just claimed? No.
In the EU model, force is always transmitted by
contact, or across distance by branching chains
of the ether particles in contact.
Thus, in a field the number of particles
that distribute the force is increasing
by the distance - the square of the
distance or the square root of the 
distance. The force gets spread over
more particles and is diminished in intensity.
Anybody that has ever broken a rack with
a cue ball in a game of pool or billiards, knows that.
We know there are two overarching realms
of reality: the physical, which is the
realm of tangible substance, material
things, body, brain, flesh and the sensory
equipment etc. This is the domain of science.
Then there is the greater spiritual
realm which is the realm of mind, spirit,
meaning, creativity, artistry and 
all the other non-material aspects,
like mathematics and logic. This is the
domain of philosophy and its subset, theology.
In the EU we start with basics or fundamentals,
which include particles, charge, and force.
Let us remember that mass and matter are not the
same thing. The current thinking is that there are
two kinds of particles or packets that can
be filled to various levels with mass/energy;
two types of charge, positive and negative; 
and two kinds of force, attraction and repulsion.
The developments that we find in the physical
universe are built on this tripartite foundation.
And along with motion, spatial dimension,
size, shape, and structure, account for
what we see or find in the material realm.
Electricity, magnetism and gravity are
secondary aspects or phenomena,
and are always associated with a field.
Simply, particles can carry mass,
energy, charge and dipolarity.
A magnetic field is always produced by charged
particles in motion, even in permanent magnets.
An electric current is always charged
particles flowing, or transmitting charge.
On the other hand, in the EU paradigm 
a gravitational field is produced by all
particles because they all have some dipolarity.
Therefore in the EU thinking, a field is not just
a mystical or mathematical con-
struct, but really designates a
specific volume of matter including
neutrinos, ”carrying or supporting the field.”
These have a force effect through
increasingly branching chains of contact,
upon other material objects or particles of 
matter. This is very simple and straightforward,
easy to visualize or imagine.
Another question is this.
Given that physical science deals with
material, hasn't there been far too much
phenomenological or mystical thinking that
has crept in the back door of physics theory?
Without a medium of ether to carry 
the field, some theoreticians get so
discouraged that they want to do away with 
the whole concept of a field - dismiss it entirely.
Wal Thornhill agrees with the premise
quote “...that the ether, in the form of
normal matter, that is neutrinos,
can be regarded as the polarizable
dielectric substrate that transfers the
direct electric force (which includes
magnetism and gravity) and
also the slower transverse
electrical disturbance of
electromagnetic waves.”
Just consider the two cases whereby
the field intensity falls off by the
distance or by the square of
the distance in a radial field.
This is simply because the number of
ether particles in contact, carrying the
force, gets increased and the intensity
gets spread out, or diluted by the
increasing number of the particle chain branches
carrying the field out to that distance.
Nothing mystical here at all.
These two formulas, involving the
distance or its square, are
mathematically simplified or idealized.
The true calculation for any specific
case in the real world of even just two
bodies, would be hopelessly complicated.
Therefore, practically a field consists of a
certain volume and somewhat quantifiable
number of neutrino/ether/matter
particles surrounding the field
generator, where the force of the field
is still detectable by contact
with the remote particles.

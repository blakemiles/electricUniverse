Science portrays that our corner of the
Universe is nothing special. At the heart
of the assumption lies the Copernican
principle which states that humans on
Earth are not privileged observers of the 
Universe. Not only is our solar system highly
unusual, but our Sun is not a run-of-the-mill star. It
is a yellow dwarf star which, you may think, together
with white dwarf stars, should be common
elsewhere, but unfortunately this is not
the case at all. And instead, red dwarf
stars are by far the most common star in
the Milky Way and they present some rather large
problems referred to as the Red Sky paradox.
Most stars in the Universe are red dwarf stars; they
outnumber stars like our Sun by a factor of five.
According to mainstream astronomy, these stars also
last about 20 times longer in comparison to our star.
This means that none have reached 
the end of their Main Sequence lifespan
during the assumed age of the Universe.
Here, I must caveat both of those, as
there is a different way of looking at this
problem, which we will explore in a little while.
So, let's return to the Red Sky paradox.
If red dwarf stars are the most common
star, and are also so stable, we should 
also not consider ourselves to be special.
The very fact that we are not orbiting a red dwarf
star, but instead the not-so- common yellow dwarf,
and yet we have not found any other forms 
of intelligent life elsewhere in the Universe.
This presents rather an interesting
problem that is dubbed the Red Sky paradox.
A new paper attempts to examine this in more 
detail. As solving this paradox may provide
guidance for targeting future remote life-sensing
experiments. Red dwarf stars are an attractive
prospect for the search for extraterrestrial 
life. They emit less energy in comparison to
our Sun, which would mean any planets
orbiting them would need to be closer to
the star in order to reach the habitable 
temperatures. In the paper, the author
outlines four possible solutions to the Red Sky 
paradox. Resolution I - An Unusual Outcome.
The first possibility postulates that
nothing is different about the emergence
of intelligence between yellow dwarf stars and red
dwarf stars. We are simply an unusual member by
finding ourselves around a yellow dwarf star.
If the rate at which life emerges around
both types of stars is similar, then Earth is an
outlier with a hundred-to- one chance of forming.
This does however, create tension with
the Copernican principle. Resolution II -
Inhibited Life under red sky. Here, the idea is that
red dwarf stars create environments that are not
supportive of life compared to yellow dwarf 
stars. Consequently, life evolved far less often
around red dwarf stars. They estimate that this
could be as much as a hundred times less likely.
We know that red dwarf stars have the
highest flare rate of any star type, and
because the planets would need to be
much closer to the star, due to the low
output from these types of stars, it puts any planet
in the firing line of these massive super-flares.
Resolution III - A Truncated Window for complex 
life. The concept here is that life has not had enough
time to emerge around red dwarf 
stars. The reasoning for this is that
terrestrial worlds forming in the main
sequence habitable zone of red dwarf
stars, will be subject to an initial
phase of higher radiance, potentially
pushing them into a runaway greenhouse state
that persists even after this phase is over.
Resolution IV â€“ A Paucity Of Pale Red Dots.
Here, the idea is that planets forming
around red dwarfs may be more 
uncommon, especially in the habitable
zone, compared to yellow dwarf stars.
Currently, around 16 percent of red
dwarfs have exoplanets that are
rocky, but maybe this is not the norm.
These surveys sample the most massive
and brightest red dwarfs, but what if the
smaller ones, of which we know very little, don't 
have any rocky planets in their habitable zone?
Since the low-mass red dwarfs are the most
common, this could mean that the habitable zone
rocky exoplanets are a hundred times
less common around red dwarf stars in
comparison to yellow dwarfs. In this case,
intelligent life is rare amongst the cosmos and spawns
universally between red dwarfs and yellow dwarf 
stars. This would mean that the vast majority
of known Earth-sized temperate planets
around red dwarf stars are somehow
inhospitable to life, or that they 
rarely host habitable worlds.
Now, there are some immediate questions
that this research raises. Firstly, why
are red dwarf stars so much more common than yellow
dwarf stars? The mainstream explanation here is that
they are so small, and have such low mass,
they evolve very slowly. An estimation
puts their main sequence lifetime at a hundred
billion years. This, they claim, is why there are many
red dwarfs. Bigger stars come and go as slowly
the number of red dwarf stars grows and grows.
In the Electric Universe, stars are not thermo-
nuclear, but instead, are electrically powered.
So, if this is the case, why would we see
more red dwarf stars than yellow dwarf stars?
The assumption is that the type of star
is not determined by what stage it is on
on the mainstream's idea of the evolution 
of a star. Instead, it is determined by the
electrical input and the environment the star
resides in. Red dwarf stars are just receiving a
lower input compared to a yellow dwarf star,
which in turn receives less compared to a blue star.
As the input changes, it can cause a star to change
from a red star all the way up to a blue star.
Observations show that stars do seem to 
undergo sudden changes after brightening events.
So, why would we see more red dwarf stars in the
Electric Universe? I see that there are three different
ways of explaining this. The First - Stars form in
pinches along filaments. Research shows that these
stars can be ejected from the central filament.
I have done a separate video on the slingshot
mechanism which you can find
on my channel: See the Pattern.
This means that as stars are initially
born at the heart of the filament, they
start near the highest current density and will burn
bright blue. Depending on the kick they gained from
the filament, they will slowly start to
move further away from the central axis,
where the current density steadily decreases,
meaning they will become redder in color.
The Second option - Although most stars are created
close to the center of the filament, the filament
itself is not stationary and could move slowly
over time. This means that most stars will not end
up being close to the center, and over
time, as it migrates, more stars would
have reduced current density due to their location.
And lastly - High-powered stars are more likely to
experience electrical stressing. In 
simple terms, this means that the
incoming current is too great for the surface
area of the star to be able to deal with.
There is a significant excess of charge.
In some cases, this can lead to the star
splitting in two, a process referred to as fissioning.
The two smaller stars would end up with a greater
combined surface area to deal with the current.
This process could also impart a kick to either
one, or both of the stars, once 
more leading to it moving further
away from the highest current density location of
the filament. It is also possible that a combination
of these factors is at play, rather than just a
single one. The next question is the question of
where intelligent life is likely to develop.
Here, it is interesting to point out that
the article only focuses on the contrast
between a yellow dwarf and a red dwarf star.
What about the other star types? Larger and
brighter stars are probably less hospitable,
but what about the cooler stars? If 
we examine brown dwarf stars, you
will quickly realize that these are just as
common, if not more common in our Milky Way.
The problem until recently has been detecting them,
as they are even fainter than red dwarf stars.
But new studies reveal that the Milky
Way is filled with brown dwarf stars.
Again, here the three possible reasons
I outlined for red dwarf stars would
equally work for explaining why brown dwarf
stars are more common than yellow dwarf stars.
But surely, life could not survive around a brown
dwarf star. They are cooler and smaller than red
dwarf stars, but also seem to show strong flaring
events. This is often how they are actually detected.
Certainly, if you look the goldilocks
zone, which is where they consider life
to be habitable around a star, this 
is almost on top of the star itself.
At first glance, this would appear to be a non-
starter. But the assumption here is that life
starts on the planet. Brown dwarfs are similar to
our gas giants, and now scientists have suggested
that life could survive in the upper
layers of a brown dwarf atmosphere which
have temperatures and pressures similar to Earth's.
This could then provide a springboard for life to
migrate to planets that could
have been ejected from the star.
Is it possible that planets and life could exist 
within the plasma sheath of a brown dwarf?
This is not something that I have
investigated yet, but it is one of the
Electric Universe theories that the
Earth was once part of Saturn, which at
the time was a brown dwarf star.
Within the envelope could life evolve
and would this hide their existence from our
 view? Could this be a different way of
explaining why we have not
discovered life elsewhere?
There are many open questions this concept
raises that are worth considering further.

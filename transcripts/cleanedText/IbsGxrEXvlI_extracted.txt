On August 6, 2012, the NASA rover Curiosity
touched down on the planet Mars
to begin the latest investigation
into the Martian environment.
It seems that NASA's
scientists are most curious
about whether Mars could have
ever supported microbial life.
Beyond this, much discussion in the science
media has centered on internet hoaxes
and misunderstandings that have
duped many in the general public.
Based on the NASA press
releases one is left to wonder,
do any real mysteries remain
for Curiosity to explore.
Well, it is true that there's a great
deal of rumor mongering on the Internet
and this gives NASA officials
an opportunity to correct
misinformation and to be
more informed on the subject
than those who are
spreading the rumors.
But there is an irony
in all of this.
Here on the surface of Mars today,
we have a rover named Curiosity
and this Rover is a witness to
stupendous technological achievement
but the irony is that within the theoretical
sciences today curiosity is absent.
Here we have a laboratory
in space, the planet Mars
which offers such a unique opportunity
for discovery in the sciences.
But the questions
are not being asked.
Just consider for example the mystery
of the Martian profile as a whole
where you have such a split
personality, completely unexplained.
Two hemispheres so
radically different.
In the North, virtually
no craters.
In the south dense cratering.
How could that be?
We make assumptions about
planetary evolution
and hold on to those assumptions for
decades after they've stopped working.
The mysteries surrounding
Martian geology
may run far deeper than the general
public have been led to believe.
The key piece of evidence
is the shape of the planet.
The northern hemisphere is actually
lower than the southern hemisphere
and it's not just that that planet was
somehow squeezed into an odd shape.
The definitive consideration
is the crustal depth
for reasons that no planetary
scientist has explained.
The crust of the northern
hemisphere has been excavated.
It's been eaten
away, up to 6 miles deep.
And there is one force only that could
achieve hemispheric excavation of a planet.
That force is electric discharge in an age
of planetary instability and violence.
A reconsideration of Martian
geology could challenge
many of the underlying assumptions
of planetary science.
Planetary scientists have long maintained
that you can date the surfaces
of rocky planets and moons
by counting craters.
This would make the southern hemisphere
of Mars a billion years older
than the northern hemisphere.
But if Mars was engulfed in the
electric discharge in the past,
one of the first questions to ask
is whether that pervasive cratering
in the southern hemisphere could
be explained by electric arcs.
And electrical experiments by plasma scientist
C.J. Ransom of Vemasat laboratories,
showed that production of
craters by electric arcs
can also generate the telltale markers
that you see on the planet Mars,
including the central darkened
bumps of so many craters
and the general darkening of
the heavily cratered terrain.
These are not patterns that would
be expected from random bombardment
by rocky bodies from space
over a billion years.
The cratering patterns created by high-energy
plasma discharge to a solid surface,
may help explain the many
anomalous crater forms on Mars.
It really is a fact that textbook theory does
not account for Martian cratering patterns.
Bizarre hexagonal
craters for example.
A hexagon is a common trademark
of electric discharge.
So-called bull's-eye craters
where one crater centers on
another beyond all probability.
Craters with towering central peaks
that terminate in another crater.
Finally, terraced crater
floors. Then crater walls.
Huge mesas sitting squarely
within a surrounding crater.
Sharply scalloped walls as seen in the
case of the famous Victoria crater.
Also the endless strings of
craters or crater chains.
And what about craters with central
spherical domes, incredibly enigmatic.
Is it a coincidence that Dr.
Ransom got exactly the same form
in electric discharge
to a Martian type soil.
The cratering mysteries on
Mars are just the beginning
and if NASA will open the door
to an electrical interpretation,
a different picture of Solar System
history is certain to follow.

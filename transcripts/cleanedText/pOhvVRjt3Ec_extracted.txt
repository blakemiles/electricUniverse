As many of you viewers of these
Thunderbolt videos are aware, in 2015 I
was able to complete the derivation
of a mathematical/physical model of a
so-called force-free current, also
sometimes called a field-aligned current.
What motivated this project was my
earlier interest in determining the
exact shape of those electric plasma
currents that flow from the Sun,
the awesome distance of some 93 million
miles to supply power, to light up
Earth's auroras. Christian Birkeland
predicted the existence of these flows
way back in 1908. Only when satellites
detected the magnetic signatures of
electric currents in the auroras
in 1973, was Birkeland's hypothesis
irrefutably validated, though for another
couple of decades, many astronomers
resisted the implications of his
discovery and some still do. They don't
like the idea of electricity up there.
The flows he discovered are now called
Birkeland Currents in his honor. My 
model is described by a set of five
equations that can be used to produce
three-dimensional images of both the internal,
and the external, appearance and the
workings of a typical Birkeland Current.
It's based on answering a very simple
question, “If we have a moving plasma cloud
consisting of positive and negative ions,
protons, electrons, and other particles
such as neutral atoms in otherwise
completely empty space, and we leave it
absolutely alone - we don't touch it, what shape, what
structure, if any, will this stream attempt to take on?
What forces will these moving charges
impose on each other, and how will they
respond? What will the result be?”
The derivation is a fairly complex one
that involves some fancy vector calculus,
but the structural shape that results is
elegantly simple, and testable. It turns out that
the flow is essentially a cylindrical tube that
contains plasma moving in co-axial,
spiral, that is helical paths. As we get
farther away from the central axis of the
flow, the pitch angles of those spiral pathways
gradually increase. This produces an
intertwined internal structure that has several
self-maintaining properties. Nothing leaks out of the
resulting flow, for one. And this immediately explains
why BC’s can maintain their integrity
over distances of millions of miles, and
now we think perhaps even millions of light 
years. One of the unique properties of any
Birkeland Current can be seen by viewing a
cross-section of the structure of the model.
This clearly shows counter-rotation.
There are clockwise flows at certain
radial distances out from the center axis,
and counterclockwise rotation at other
distances. We have known for many
years that Birkeland Currents power the
auroral displays we see in the night sky,
but were counter-rotating plasmas observed?
It was quickly discovered that, yes counter-
rotation is often seen in Earth's auroras.
And it's also seen in NASA videos of the poles of
several of the planets, especially Saturn and Jupiter.
This is evidence that what we're saying is
correct, that counter-rotation does exist in these
Birkeland Currents. It seems that the
coaxial counter-rotation property is a
unique property of Birkeland Currents. No
other natural process that we are aware
of produces it. So, in my mind the
race was on to find more examples.
If you see coaxial counter-rotation
anywhere, keep your eyes open for the
Birkeland Current that causes it.
Birkeland Currents can carry electrical
charges in both directions, much like a
coaxial cable carries normal electrical
currents, here on Earth. When we 
power up a light bulb, it takes two wires,
one to carry charge from the voltage
source to the light, and another wire to
carry those charges back to the ground
terminal of the source, to complete the
circuit as it's called. When charges
are delivered to Earth by a Birkeland
Current, they work their way down to the
surface from the top of the atmosphere.
Quite often that journey results in the beautiful
auroral lights. But sometimes also they create other
visible discharges in the Earth's high
altitude plasma, such as the so-called
elves, sprites, and gnomes seen 
by the pilots of high-flying aircraft.
Thinking about the now accepted fact
that Birkeland Currents power the auroras
and recognizing that those auroras 
often exhibit coaxial counter-rotation,
I wondered if the wind patterns high above
Earth's poles also behaved in a similar way.
There's an internet website
called earth.nullschool.net
that shows wind and water patterns
in Earth's oceans and atmosphere.
If you go to that site, you can click on the 
word “Earth” to bring up the menu and
select “HD” - high def, and then pick “Mode”
equals “Air”, “Animate” equals “Wind”, “Height”
equals “10” hPa (hectopascals). This 
is at an altitude of approximately
35 kilometers; that's the highest level
that the earth.null school gives us.
Set “Overlay” to “Wind” and “Projection”
to “O” and in the image click and drag the
Earth's Northern hemisphere down to
show the North Pole. Then go over to the
control line of the menu and change the
date, I think it's the second symbol, to
Year 2022, Month of January – 01, and date – 08.
If you click on any wind flow, you will see
its direction and velocity in the 
upper left. To close the menu click
on the word “Earth” and you can see the whole Earth.
Hannes Alfven said that moving plasma,
when it contacts neutral gas, can drag
the gas along with it. With that in mind
and using the right-hand rule, point your right
thumb in the direction of the axial current,
and then your curved fingers will show the direction
of the magnetic field and the moving plasma.
Doing this, we see that the Birkeland
Current's central axial current is moving
positive charges up and out of the North Pole.
If you turn the Earth over by dragging the Pole
with your mouse, you can see a similar,
but much weaker current emerging
from the South Polar region. The 
Earth in its orbit is closest to the
Sun in January. At that time its North
Pole is pointing away from the Sun. The
Electric Universe model presumes the Sun
is charged to a higher voltage than its
surroundings and therefore, there will be
an electric field radiating outward from it.
With those facts in mind, we expected
that in January, there might be a strong
inward current from the higher voltage neighbor-
hood of the Sun entering the Earth's South Pole,
and outward at the North Pole flowing away from
the Sun. Similarly, it was thought that in June
there might be a slightly weaker current
going into the North Pole and out the
South Pole. Weaker because we're farther
away from the Sun. Nothing even remotely
akin to that was observed; that was 
not seen at all. Well what was observed:
monthly examinations were made by
sampling the earth.nullschool.net
website video images over a five-year
time span, June of 2014 through June of
2019, and the important observed results
were actually two. The first was during
the northern hemisphere summer;
that's called aphelion. Earth is as
far from the Sun as it gets. Current enters 
into both the North and South poles. Th
The second thing that we observed was
that during the Northern hemisphere
winter, that's called perihelion, Earth is closest
to the Sun, current is directed out of both the
North and South poles. What should we make 
of this? How do we interpret it? What's going on?
From December through February, the
Northern hemisphere winter, perihelion,
Earth is nearest the Sun and according
to Electric Universe theory, it should be
picking up positive charge in this
higher voltage region. But we see from
our observations that the Birkeland
Current is directed out of both
hemispheres during this time. Earth 
is therefore losing positive charge
via the Birkeland Current during this period.
Just the opposite of what we might think.
Six months later, a similar surprise 
awaited us. Earth in its elliptical orbit is
farthest from the Sun then, at its aphelion, 
around the 4th of July and thus at its
greatest orbital distance. The Sun's 
electric field is producing a lower
voltage neighborhood there.
Therefore Earth ought to be dumping
positive charge out into that lower
voltage neighborhood. But if we look at
the nullschool.net site, it's clear that the Birkeland
Current is dumping positive charge into Earth.
Now, this unexpected behavior of the Sun-
Earth BC was observed at every single
one of the observed aphelion-perihelion times
during the five years we observed the site.
What could the explanation be for what we 
observed? After considering this apparent
contradiction we came, after much thought, to the
following conclusion. There is no contradiction.
There are two different processes going on.
One, Earth when it's closest to the Sun in
January, is indeed collecting charge,
just as the EU theory says it should.
And it does this from all possible directions
through the extremely large surface area
of Earth's toroidal, that is to say
doughnut-shaped plasmasphere that
completely surrounds the Earth. The
charges come from positive-charged
interplanetary plasma through
which the Earth is moving. And two,
but during this same time we've observed
that the Birkeland Current stream that
directly connects the Sun to Earth's poles,
is removing positive charges from Earth.
The Birkeland Current is acting like a
pipeline that carries charge directly
out of two comparatively small cusps in
Earth's magnetosphere near its poles,
back towards the outer coronal region of the Sun.
So, both these processes are going on simultaneously.
Therefore, this newly discovered
Birkeland Current mechanism apparently
works to stabilize Earth's net charge
over the course of the year. It's a
natural compensating negative feedback
mechanism which tends to neutralize, or
at least minimize, any seasonal variation in Earth's
net charge. The Birkeland Current supplies positive
charge when Earth is losing it from its
surrounding plasma, because it's passing
through the low voltage region, and then
the Birkeland Current removes the excess
charge Earth is taking on while it's
passing through the Sun's high voltage
region and is collecting charge. This 
counter-flow of charge, provided by
the Birkeland Current that directly
connects the Sun to Earth, effectively
counteracts any fluctuation in Earth's
charge that might otherwise perturb its
orbital stability. The Birkeland Current
also provides a return path for all of
the electric charge delivered here by
Coronal Mass Ejections and the solar
wind. It doesn't pile up on Earth. Where does 
it go? It goes back to the Birkeland Current.
There are many instances of such
automatic negative stabilizing feedback
mechanisms in astrophysics. An 
obvious one is the ability of a
Birkeland Current to self-repair itself
from any damage done by a perturbation
in one or more of its current density components. 
Anyway, there are a variety of things
that one can see by manipulating the
menu choices of this excellent website.
One of the most informative is to get an
image on a date when the 10 hectopascal
flow is quite regular, circular or at
least smooth. We can suggest one out of
the bunch might be December 17 2014. That's 
2014-12-17. Then select a series of lower altitudes.
Higher hectopascal pressure levels mean
you're going down, and the pressure in
the atmosphere is getting larger. So, go
down to 70, 250 and go all the way down
to the surface. Anyway, notice that the
farther down, the closer to the surface
we get, the more chaotic, less smooth and
regular, and slower, the patterns become.
It makes sense because if you place
the mouse pointer over a wider, closely
spaced faster wind flow, you can 
left- click and measure its velocity.
Generally the higher our altitude, the 
faster and more regular the wind flows are.
This demonstrates that the Birkeland
Current which is quite well-formed as it
comes through space, drives the flow at its
highest 10 hectopascal level, way up at the top.
This flow frictionally drives the air at
the next lower level and so on. The
lowest levels experience frictional
contact with the geographical surface
features and this breaks up the smooth,
almost circular global flows, and reduces
their velocities compared to what we see at the
higher levels. What this makes clear is that Earth's
polar wind patterns are driven from
outside electrically, and not by any
surface or internal Earth-bound processes or
dynamos - the favorite word of astronomers when
they don't know what's going on. The 
main outside source of these polar winds
is quite obviously the varying strength
and polarity, that is to say direction,
of the Birkeland Current system of
electrically charged particles that it
delivers here both to and from the Sun.
In other words, we now have undeniable
scientific evidence of cause and effect.
Solar Birkeland Currents cause patterns
in the polar winds which affect
the weather on the planet.
Yet another verification of the 
Electric Universe model of cosmology.

Welcome to Space News from the Electric
Universe, brought to you by The
Thunderbolts Project at Thunderbolts.info
In a recent Space News episode,
we reported on two 2016 scientific studies
that each serve potentially fatal blows
to the hypothesis of dark matter.
The first of these studies, reported in
September of last year, found that the
acceleration and the rotation curves of
both spiral and irregular galaxies could
be explained by visible mass alone with
no Dark Matter necessary. Professor of
physics and astronomy David Meritt says
of the findings: "Galaxy rotation curves
have traditionally been explained via an
ad-hoc hypothesis that galaxies are
surrounded by dark matter. The relation
discovered by McGaugh at al. is a serious,
and possibly fatal, challenge to this
hypothesis, since it shows that rotation
curves are precisely determined by the
distribution of the normal matter alone.
Nothing in the standard cosmological
model predicts this, and it is almost
impossible to imagine how that model
could be modified to explain it, without
discarding the Dark Matter hypothesis
completely." Another study reported in
December presented a statistical
analysis of mini spiral galaxies, and
found a so-called "unexpected
interaction" between dark matter and
ordinary matter. A co-author of the study
states: "Most dark matter, according to
the most credible hypotheses, would be
non-baryonic or WIMP. It would not
interact with ordinary matter except
through gravitational force. Our
observations, however, disagree with this
notion." In this episode, physicist
Eugene Bagashov analyzes additional recent
studies that raise even further doubt of
the Dark Matter hypothesis and he
explores the growing scientific case for
dark matter alternatives. Following the
recent Space News episode featuring
astronomer Barry Setterfield,
I'd like to briefly review some of the
other recent studies regarding the
dark mater hypothesis. First of all, there
have been news from several experiments that
theoretically could detect processes
involving dark matter particles. For
example, the team of researchers working
with Fermi Space Telescope indicates that
there are no signs of dark matter
particle annihilation nor decay. These
processes should take place if dark
matter particles could interact not only
gravitationally but also perhaps through
weak nuclear force. The gamma-ray flux,
measured by the Fermi telescope from low
Earth orbit, over the course of several
years, so far have not shown the evidence
for any significant Dark Matter presence.
Experiments on and below the surface of
the Earth have also failed to detect any
specific Dark Matter processes. There
have been news from PANDA X experiment in
China. They've used 300 kilograms of liquid
xenon to detect the collisions of its
atoms with the supposedly present dark
matter particles and over the course of at
least 66 days, haven't detected any single
event. At the same time the article
published by the team of experimenters,
claims that this laboratory at present is
the most sensitive to dark matter on
earth. Another similar experiment called
LUX is also using liquid xenon and it
also have recently reported the complete
absence of events of Dark Matter
candidate detection. 20 months of
observations, from October 2014 to May
2016, had yielded zero observed events.
Third experiment, using the same
technique, is Xenon 100. 477 days of
data taking have not resulted in a
detection of a single dark matter
particle interaction. The Large Hadron
Collider, which once was a big hope for
finding lots of what is called new
physics, has also not produced any new
findings in the recent years. What it
does now is basically refining the
previous measurements with more and more
statistics and putting more and more
strict constraints on the theoretical
physicists' proliferative imagination;
speaking of which I would like to
remember a story from the end of 2015
when there was a message from
experimenters at LHC stating a
possible detection of a two-photon peak
at the energy of around 750 Giga electron
volts. This was quickly followed by
literally hundreds of papers submitted
by theoretical physicists, each stating
his own hypothesis on what this peak might
stand for. Some of the versions included
possible Dark Matter connection, but
perhaps the most embarrassing was the
fact that this peak just disappeared a
few months later after accumulating more
data. It turned out to be just a
statistical artifact. But the social
phenomenon of these theoretical physicists
to rush has itself turned into the
object of public and scientific
attention, including some jokes and
sarcastic publications. In the previous
episode of Space News on dark matter,
Barry Setterfield has already made the
point that there is a more or less
suitable mathematical alternative to the
Dark Matter hypothesis, the Modified
Newtonian Dynamics or MOND for short. In
the recent years
other theories have also appeared. Some
of them are quite eclectic, trying to tie
various physical concepts with
gravitation. I think the most interesting
of them is the so-called entropic or
emergent gravity. It seems that a few
people were developing it even earlier but
the most popular version of it nowadays
is the one proposed by Erik Verlinde.
In his paper, published in 2010,
he states that the amount of information
associated with matter and its location
could be measured in terms of entropy.
Changes in this entropy, when matter is
displaced, lead to an entropic force
which, as he shows later, takes the form
of gravity. So its origin lies in the
tendency of the system to maximize its
entropy and is thus thermodynamic in
nature and isn't actually a result of any
fundamental force of nature. I'll remind
that, today, four forces are considered to
be fundamental and that is electromagnetism,
gravitation, weak and strong nuclear
forces. In case of Verlinde's theory,
the fundamental interaction that leads
to emergence of gravity would most likely
be electromagnetic. He also gives
examples of other emergent forces such
as osmosis and similar entropic forces
in colloidal systems where the
fundamental interaction is clearly
electromagnetic since all the mechanical
forces, such as pressure or elasticity,
are electromagnetic in nature. Now I'll
try to explain, in simple terms, how I
interpret the basic idea of Verlinde's
theory. Let us consider,
as an example, the system
of two point masses, A and B. We always might
draw a sphere centered on one of those,
for example A, with the radius equal to
the distance from A to B. In this case,
the mass B would lie on the sphere. Such
a system might be treated in
informational sense. That is, for example,
the position of the body B with respect
to A, might encode some information.
Let's say we'd divide the whole sphere in
100 sectors of the same area and each
sector would correspond to some number.
Then the current position of the body
B on the sphere would point at one of
those numbers, thus giving us the
according information. Let us now
consider another case when the body B
is slightly closer to the body A. Now we
might repeat the same drawing procedure
but soon we would find that the number
of sectors, that we might divide the
sphere in, is actually less. If we try to
keep the same area of sectors it is
obvious that we couldn't fit the same
amount on the smaller sphere. So the
amount of information that we might
encode in this the smaller system became
less. Thermodynamically, this means that
the entropy has increased and the system
now might provide less ordering. So the
system with masses situated closer
together is thermodynamically more
stable and it is in this
direction that the evolution of the
closed system would go. And there is an
effective entropic force that arises to
guide this evolution. It is possible to
formally derive the according equations
and Verlinde does that in his
paper. In my opinion, the idea is quite
interesting and, at the very least,
deserves a careful and thorough
analysis. However, there are some problems
and perhaps the weakest part of this
theory is its reliance, at least in
mathematical terms, on the so-called
holographic principle and AdS/CFT
correspondence. Both of those are pretty
specific theoretical conjectures and are
highly speculative in nature. Anyway, what
interests us here in the given context
is that, based on his own approach,
Verlinde seemed to have succeeded in
acquiring equations that are practically
identical to Milgrom's MOND equations
for large-scale gravitating systems such
as galaxies. And more than that, in
December of 2016, there appeared a
publication that claimed incredibly
accurate confirmation of Verlinde's
predictions for the case of gravitational
lensing. Of course, the very
phenomenon of gravitational lensing is
somewhat doubtful though Verlinde's theory
could actually shed more light on its
nature. If gravitation is not even a
fundamental force but some emergent
effect, maybe this would also concern the
propagation of electromagnetic waves. That
way or another, the theory is there and
the publications that seem to suggest
its practical value are starting to
appear. So now, not only we don't register
any dark matter particles but we also
have at least three alternatives to Dark
Matter hypothesis itself. First one comes
from plasma dynamics, the second one is
MOND and the third one is Verlinde's
emergent gravity. In my opinion, it is a
very good situation for science as such
and one should try to encourage the
existing controversy since it is the
controversy that is the real life of
science.
This actually brings hope for the
academia as a whole with its dogmas of
settled science and possibly could even
serve as a sort of a pivotal point for
the scientific revolutions in other
areas in the coming years. With the
current political situation in both the
European Union and the United States, as
well as the imminent stock market and
banking system crisis, it is entirely
possible that they would spark major
scientific debates in the areas that only
recently were considered to be totally
settled. But as the scientific
institutions would try to adapt to the
new reality and shifted financial flows,
the situation would become different. In
my opinion this provides a certain
opportunity for many alternative schools
of thought, including the Electric
Universe paradigm.

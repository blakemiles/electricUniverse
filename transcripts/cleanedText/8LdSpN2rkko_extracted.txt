NASA's Juno mission to
the gas giant Jupiter
has provided data
that could rewrite
much of planetary science.
According to NASA scientists,
the conventional theoretical models
on the planet’s auroras,
its atmosphere, its interior
and its magnetic field
have found no support
at all in the mission’s findings.
The consistent theme in all of the surprises
is the extraordinary and conventionally
unexpected electromagnetic
energies the spacecraft detected.

Managing Editor Stephen Smith
offers a succinct overview
of the most significant discoveries
from this historic mission.
NASA launched the Juno mission
to Jupiter on August 5th, 2011.
After travelling out
past the orbit of Mars,
the spacecraft returned
for a gravity assist from Earth
on October 9, 2013, and then
headed out to deep space.
Although Juno was invisible
to the naked eye,
its arrival allowed scientists
a unique opportunity.
Since it was only 600 km
above Earth, NASA was able
to track its passage through
Earth's electric field using
the Van Allen probes.
Formally known as the
Radiation Belt Storm Probes,
the Van Allen satellites were
launched in an effort to understand
how the Sun and
near-Earth's space interact.
They do this by interpreting
the behavior of
Earth's radiation belts
and the way that high speed
electrons and ions, otherwise known as plasma,
are guided or confined by magnetic fields.
The two spacecraft are in highly
eccentric orbits, passing each other
and dipping in and out
of the belts many times,
allowing them to understand and
disregard effects of their own
presences in orbit as well as
filtering out spatial anomalies.
It was the small electrical effects
of the Juno probe on the belts
that allowed the Van Allen mission
to see it passing by.
Plasma is often described
as the fourth state of matter.
However, since observations
confirm that it makes up
more than 99% of the universe, it
should be reckoned the first state.
It is only been in the
last one hundred years
that scientists have given
credence to the possibility
that we might be living in a dynamic
solar system where electricity
plays an important role.
It is evident that the Sun's
electric field extends for
billions of kilometers influencing
the planets in their motions
as well as how they interact
with each other.
Since plasma is a charged substance in motion,
it generates an electric current.
An electric current flowing through plasma
creates a magnetic sheath along its axis.
If enough current passes through the circuit,
the plasma sheath will glow,
sometimes creating a number of
sheaths within it.
The sheath is called a double layer.
According to Electric Sun theory,
an electric field focused on the Sun
accelerates charged particles,
the faster they move, the stronger the field.
However, the interplanetary electric
field is extremely weak.
No instrument is yet able to measure the
voltage differential across 100 meters
but the solar wind acceleration over
its tens of millions of kilometers
does confirm that the Sun
has an electric field.
The Van Allen detector showed that over time,
the capabilities of future space missions
will increase; taking detailed measurements
of interplanetary electric fields
may not be so far off after all.
Juno entered orbit around
Jupiter on July 4th, 2016.
Jupiter is the largest planet.
It is so large that all the other planets
could fit comfortably inside it.
Jupiter rotates in 9.9 hours,
causing its diameter to be
9,275 kilometers more than the distance between
its poles and this is due to centrifugal force.
Since there are radiation belts
around Jupiter similar to the
Van Allen belts that surround Earth,
but thousands of times greater in strength,
Juno's electronics are
housed within a titanium shell so that the
energetic particles trapped around Jupiter
won't interfere with its systems.
As previously reported, Jupiter's moon
Io dissipates more than 2 trillion watts
as it revolves through Jupiter's
electromagnetic fields.
The electric charge flow creates lightning
in the planet's upper atmosphere
as well as intense aurorae
at the poles.
Recently, mission scientists announced
that Jupiter is even more electrically
active than they predicted.
Instead of a 5-Gauss magnetic field,
Jupiter measured levels as high as 9 Gauss
and this is compared to
Earth's 0.5-Gauss field.
The field is also quite irregular,
suggesting to astrophysicists
that there might be a non-conformity
in Jupiter's core.
According to a mission team
member Jack Connerney,
"Jupiter's magnetic field is
spatially complex, and there were
deficits of up to 2 gauss elsewhere.
We may need many more orbits
to resolve this."
Conventional theories assume that
the universe is electrically neutral,
so when observations confirm electrical activity,
localized phenomena are invoked.
So called 'tidal forces' and 'volcanoes'
are said to cause the activity on Io,
rather than the several million amperes
charge flow between it and Jupiter.
In the case of Jupiter's rings,
charges detected in the ring plane
were said to be caused by sunlight shadow rather than
by an electric circuit between Jupiter and the Sun.
According to a 2008 press release from JPL,
Jupiter's rings are electrically charged.
However, astronomers proposed that Jupiter's
moon Io is kneaded like dough by Jupiter's gravity
causing charged particles to be ejected
by its volcanic plumes.
The ion flow is an electric
circuit, to and from Jupiter.
More than 8 years ago, TPOD addressed
Io's 'volcanic plumes'.
It was shown that they're actually
plasma discharges from the moon to the gas giant.
Some planetary scientists have begun
to acknowledge an electrical connection
after Io's footprint was seen in
Jupiter's polar aurora.
All four of Jupiter's largest moons
were discovered to leave their marks
in the aurora, in the shape of tails
flowing within the plasma column.
Later, when NASA launched New Horizons
on a mission to study Pluto,
the plumes of Tvashtar, a gigantic
volcano supposedly, were found to be
filamentary in structure with indications that
they are actually coronal arc discharges from
electric hotspots,
linking Io with Jupiter.
One of Juno's most important discovery
was that Jupiter's atmospheric bands are
deeper than previously thought.
Those cloud bands cannot be
penetrated by visible light.
However, microwave detectors allow Juno to see
as deep as mission coordinators want to look.
The satellite is currently searching
a little over 400 kilometers
below the surface of the cloud tops, and
as mentioned in other pictures of the day,
the slight differences in layers suggest
that they are dynamic and constantly evolving.
During the same flyby while
observing Jupiter's aurorae,
Juno's electromagnetic data began to
diverge from what NASA team members predicted.
It was nuch stronger.
Jupiter's magnetic field is far more
complex than they previously assumed.
That flow of electric charge
causes aurorae at the poles.
Since Jupiter is
obviously electrical,
the basic physics of charged
objects in motion
generating electromagnetism
should be the focus of study.
Jupiter's magnetosphere is so powerful
that it extends for nearly 650 million km
reaching even beyond Saturn's orbit.
The most energetic of the trapped
electrons in its magnetosphere
emit radio frequencies.
In 1955, that radiation led to the discovery
that Jupiter has a magnetic field.
It should be noted however, that the
maverick scientist Immanuel Velikovsky
predicted the electric field of Jupiter
in October of 1953.
As mentioned, rotating charged bodies
produce dipolar electromagnetic fields.
Whenever there are regions
of opposite charge,
double layers form and
electric fields develop.
An electric field, no matter how weak,
accelerates charged particles.
This could explain why the
atmospheric bands are so deep.
Jupiter's electric field accelerates
plasmas at different rates.
Rather than a theoretical liquid
metallic dynamo inside Jupiter,
it is more probable that the planet is acting
according to other well-known principles of physics.
Rotating charged bodies produce
dipolar electromagnetic fields,
whether they are gas giants
or rocky planets.
Why some planets like Earth and
Mercury possess magnetic fields
while Venus and Mars do not,
demands further investigation.
However, the basic physics of charged
objects in motion is not debated.
What is debated by Electric Universe
advocates is what drives the Jovian powerhouse.
According to a recent press release,
"...convection currents...stir the interior
and produce the swirling clouds and storms...
they are strong enough to generate Jupiter's
magnetic field by a process called dynamo action."
Dynamos were described more than a century ago
and fluid dynamic equations are inadequate when
electromagnetism and plasma
environments are considered.
Using models that are kinetic in nature,
with activity limited to induction of
the movement of solid matter, solves
none of the enigmas Jupiter presents.

Welcome to Space News from the Electric
Universe, brought to you by the
Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info
Wal, I love the topic of supernovas
for the Electric Universe for a couple
of big reasons. Number one, as I mentioned
earlier, it was well over a decade ago,
that you wrote your own scientific paper
which explains supernovas as a type of
electrical discharge. And this paper was
peer reviewed and published in the
IEEE Transactions on Plasma
Science. People who call themselves
skeptics of the Electric Universe have
always demanded more peer-reviewed
material and yet I have to wonder how
many of these “skeptics” have ever
bothered to read the aforementioned
peer-reviewed paper. And number two, in
recent years, there have been several
supernova discoveries which, according to
the scientists making the discoveries,
are not merely surprising, but rather
they “break all the rules” and they
upend all conventional thought on the
very nature of stars and of supernovas.
The standard story of a supernova of
course is that when a star has exhausted
its nuclear fuel, it will gravitationally
collapse and then a rebound effect
produces an explosion. Well, a little over
two years ago, there was a supernova
which science media dubbed the
”zombie star” because it appeared to first
explode well over half a century ago and
then more than 50 years later, it
appeared to “come back to life” and
explode again. Here's what phys.org wrote
on this story a couple of years ago. “The
finding, published by Nature, completely
confounds existing knowledge of the
star’s end of life. Somehow this star
exploded more than half a century ago,
survived, and exploded again in 2014.” And
the lead author of a paper on the
finding said “This supernova breaks
everything we thought we knew about how
they work.” Now as I see it, here's the
real taproot of the
 “crisis” in cosmology, which
we've been referring to for over eight
years on this series. It's not that
discovery is sometimes, or actually quite
often, surprising or mystifying for
astronomers. Anyone can be surprised by
discovery, especially when we're talking
about the incredibly complex nature of
the remotest phenomena observed
throughout the universe. No one, including
proponents of plasma cosmology in the
Electric Universe, can claim to have all
of the answers. But the real essence of
the “crisis” is that very simply,
discovery doesn't change anything.
The aforementioned supernova quote
”breaks everything astronomers thought
they knew about how supernovas work.”
That's not according to me, it's not
according to Wal Thornhill, it's
according to the scientists who made the
discovery. Today, what indication exists
that any new theories of supernovas and
of the nature of stars are actually
being considered. Science is simply
moving forward as if nothing has changed.
That's right. There are a bewildering
number of categories of supernovae, and
new ones are being found that don't follow
the rules. The electrical model of stars
on the other hand, put forward by Ralph
Juergens, has been successfully tested
by the SAFIRE experiment, and it shows
that plasma double layers, or sheaths, are
formed around all bright stars. And a
feature of double layers is that they
can explode suddenly under stress, and
throw over the star's galactic power
switch. When that happens, the
electromagnetic energy stored in the
local galactic circuit, is suddenly
unleashed, like an arc welder on the
star’s surface. That's why a supernova can
briefly outshine its entire galaxy. The
nearest recent supernova, 1987a in the
Large Magellanic Cloud, a dwarf galaxy
satellite of the Milky Way, is only six
times more distant from us than the
center of the Milky Way and showed
glowing features of a star circuit with
its three coaxial rings of pearls,
defining the characteristic hourglass shape
of a plasma pinch. So, when this short
circuit occurs at a star, the circuit
itself is trying to deliver more power
suddenly to the star itself and the
circuit in this case became visible, and
is still visible. Supernovae type 1a are
used as standard candles by astronomers
and their faintness used as one measure
of the distance of remote galaxies. I
said earlier, Halton Arp showed quasars
with high redshift are connected to
nearby galaxies, which means that the
redshift is not a measure of distance. He
went on to show that redshift is a
measure of the lower energy and
youthfulness of an object, and not that
it is moving away from us at high speed.
In other words, the universe is not
expanding; there was no Big Bang and in
the case of the lower-than-expected
brightness of the supernovae type 1a in
these youthful objects, that is due to
the lower energy of the quasar itself,
having been recently born from the
center of an active galactic nucleus. The
Nobel prizes for this discovery were
awarded, based on an assumption. That
assumption is incorrect.
Very good. Well Wal, moving on to
another example of a high-energy
electromagnetic phenomenon on an even
larger scale: in late 2019 NASA released
a new image of a feature which has been
dubbed the “cosmic candy-cane,” near
the center of the Milky Way galaxy. This
image is extremely interesting for a
number of reasons from the Electric
Universe vantage point. A NASA press
release says that the cosmic candy-cane
”...spans 190 lightyears and is one of
a set of long, thin strands of ionized
gas called filaments that emit radio
waves.... the GISMO instrument detected the
most prominent radio filament in the
galactic center, known as the Radio Arc,
which forms the straight part of the
cosmic candy-cane. Scientists say the
filaments delineate the edges of a large
bubble produced by some energetic event
at the galactic center, located within
the bright region known as Sagittarius A
about 27,000 light years away from us.
Additional red arcs in the image
reveal other filaments.
And a member of NASA's GISMO team says
of the image “It was a real surprise to
see the Radio Arc in the GISMO data. Its
emission comes from high-speed electrons
spiraling in a magnetic field, a process
called synchrotron emission.” Of course
plasma cosmology proposes that something
very different from a black hole is
actually at the center of the Milky Way,
and in fact of all galaxies. So, what are
your thoughts on what we're actually
seeing in this image? The cosmic
candy-cane is actually composed of
parallel current filaments, which are
drawn together because the electric
current is flowing in the same direction
along parallel conducting paths. And all
of this kind of phenomena were described
and explained decades ago, by plasma
cosmologists. But because of the specialism
that exists in science these days,
the specialists in one field having
developed their own story, do not like to
have it disturbed by paying attention to
someone else with a parallel story. Even
if that parallel story explains the
observations, without having to invent
dark matter, dark energy, black holes, and
all of the other paraphernalia that
current standard cosmology has invested
so much time and money in. Filamentary
structures at the center of our galaxy
are part of the circuit of the galaxy itself.
The electric current flows in, in the
form of mostly fast electrons, into the
center of the galaxy and they spiral in
to form what's known to plasma
cosmologists as a plasmoid,
which is a tiny doughnut-shaped
electromagnetic phenomenon, which
occasionally, when it becomes too dense,
too many particles jammed into the small
space at the center of the galaxy, it will break down and
emit jets along the axis of the doughnut. Now all of these
things are seen and explained by plasma
cosmology, but ignored by those who
control the funding. Wal, speaking of
big funding in the world of science, last
year there was a major announcement that
garnered international news headlines,
when scientists announced the first-ever
detection of a collision between a
hypothetical neutron star and a
hypothetical black hole. But last month,
the first papers were released on this
alleged event, and what they're reporting
is that a scan of the region of space
where the hypothetical collision took
place, has literally revealed nothing.
Here is a snippet from a sciencealert.com
report on this development. It
states “Last year, the LIGO and Virgo
gravitational wave detectors pinged with
an entirely new kind of collision: not
two neutron stars, not two black holes,
but a neutron star and a black hole
together. Scientists were thrilled: this
could be the first time we've ever
witnessed such a binary system.” “Now after
poring over the corner of space in
which the collision took place, an
international team of astronomers has
seen the aftermath - or rather, the lack of
one. Using some of the world's most
powerful astronomical instruments, the
collaboration found not even a brief
flash of light associated with the
collision.” And the report also noted that
the papers were still awaiting peer
review. Now Wal, since we have challenged
the very existence of neutron stars and
black holes, why don't you explain why a
failure to find evidence of a collision
between these types of objects is a
predictable outcome from the Electric
Universe perspective. The standard model
is having extreme difficulties because
the physics they are using is missing.
There is no explanation of gravity or
their equations; there is no
definition of mass, or energy, in physics
today, which is an incredible indictment
when you think of the amount of money we
spend, chasing various rabbits down holes,
that are invented by these standard "modelists."
The idea of a black hole, in fact, is one
of these tricks that mathematicians use
of reifying objects and phenomena that
involve infinities. The idea that you can
continually compress matter to form a
black hole, is based on a total lack of
understanding of
gravity, and also a total lack, as I said,
of a definition of the mass of an object.
In fact, even our encyclopedias and
textbooks on physics will confuse the two
words ‘mass’ and ‘matter’ as if they are
equivalent and, in fact, often the words
are used interchangeably. But mass is a
property of matter. It is not equivalent
and E=mc2, that well-known,
that misunderstood equation, says that
mass is related to energy. In other words,
mass is an energetic variable. So, this
gives you some idea that modern physics
lacks any firm foundation and we can
blame Einstein and those who have
followed him, for this situation. Because
his theory of relativity made each
independent observer, no matter how they
are traveling, the center of their own
private universe and this of course is
impossible. Physics, before it left the
rails, was blessed with absolute
standards of space and time, which meant
that you could define things sensibly. We
have not been able to do so ever since
the theories of relativity were
introduced. The fundamental error with
black hole theory is that gravity is
only an attractive force. But as some wag
said, only an idiot would design a
universe with an unbalanced force. The
Electric Universe says no, there is only
one force in the universe; it is the
electric force. Gravity, magnetism and the
nuclear forces, are all manifestations of
the way matter responds to the electric
force. And a fundamental issue there is
the idea that subatomic particles,
protons and electrons, and so on, have
structure themselves. Since they have
electrical structure, they will deform in
the presence of an electric field. And we
know this, simply because particle
accelerators seem to increase the mass
of a subatomic particle in that
accelerator. In other words, you apply a
force to that particle and the energy is
absorbed by that particle, in deformation.
It changes shape from maybe a sphere
into an ellipsoid, a football shape, and
in doing so, it absorbs energy. Rather
than accelerating, it is absorbing energy,
and that's where E=mc2 comes
from: it's very simple. So, when we talk
about the effects of a black hole, we are
talking about energies which manifests
as if the object had the mass of 70 Suns,
but instead, we may be looking at a
system which is responding to
electromagnetic forces and not that of
gravity. So, this is where one of the
fundamental errors comes in, when people
talk about black holes at the centers of
galaxies with millions or billions of
times the mass of our Sun. No, what
we're talking about is an object, a
compact object, the most compact form
of electromagnetic energy storage known
in the laboratory. And so, it's that
energy which manifests as if it has that
kind of mass. The interest in a merger
between a neutron star and a black hole
is obvious, because the neutron star
signal can be used as accurate as an
atomic clock and therefore, as the orbit
decays, it spins faster and faster around
the black hole. We should be able to see
a Doppler shift in the signal from the
neutron star. The problem with this
particular report is that it assumes
that the change in the signal frequency
is due to an orbital motion. But then
again, the signal from a neutron star, is
not well explained ,since it requires an
object that has never been shown to
exist, that is a star made completely out
of neutrons, and also, no other thought
has entered the heads of those theorists
as to how you might produce such a well
stabilized signal: the pulse from the
pulsar. But plasma physicists once again,
the plasma cosmologists, decades ago,
showed that not only the steady signal,
but also the glitches and other fine
structure in the signal, can all be
explained in termsof a magnetospheric circuit of a star.
One of the most accurate signal sources
known in the laboratory, is known as a
trapped-ion signal, and the plasma
cosmologists were able to show that a
stellar magnetosphere could act as a
trapped ion oscillator. So, when the
astronomers, using their standard
thinking about neutron stars and black
holes, couldn't find the black hole, all
that's showing is that the
magnetospheric circuit of the pulsing
star, was changing. Not that it was
orbiting a black hole. Well, Wal you've
now more than laid the foundation for
this last item I'd like to discuss. And I
think that this piece, perhaps more than
anything we've talked about today,
emphasizes your points about astronomers
and astrophysicists reifying
things which are not physically
real. So, let me read briefly from a
Popular Mechanics piece entitled: “This is
wild. Astrophysicists can see Stars twisting
Space and Time.” It states, “A team
of astrophysicists from around the world
has been following an unusual pair of
spinning stars for almost 20 years, and
now they say the binary system is
persuasive evidence of frame dragging. in
a new paper in Science, the researchers
say the white dwarf and neutron star
that spin extremely fast together, form
an edge case to demonstrate relativity.”
Wal, I literally have nothing to say
about space and time being physically
twisted by these stars, so I throw it to
you. One of the aspects of these two stars
is that “one is a white dwarf, the size of
the Earth but 300,000 times its density;
the other is a neutron star which, while
only 20 kilometers in diameter, is about
100 billion times the density of the
Earth,” the press release says. This is
sheer nonsense.
White dwarf stars are not understood; even
Eddington when he produced the standard
model of stars, said they seemed to be
operating on some different principle. A
white dwarf is simply a star that has a
corona which is dim and white.
It doesn't have a bright photosphere.
So it's discharge is a different part of
the gas discharge spectrum and it is not
the size of the Earth; it is not
300,000 times its density; it
is a normal star. The neutron star of
course, a hundred billion times the
density of the Earth, is sheer nonsense.
You cannot compress matter like that;
gravity doesn't behave in that way; it is
merely a case of extending an equation,
like that of the stretching of a spring.
After you have stretched it so far, the
spring is broken, the equation no longer
works. As I mentioned earlier, the notion
of mass is not explained at all in
modern physics and therefore you cannot
tell what the density of an object is by
measuring its gravity. So, the whole model
of this orbiting system, is invalid. The
report goes on to say, the tiny neutron
star is the pulsar, meaning it emits a
steady beam of light that can be tracked
as it spins. Like when the Sun's
reflection off a metal object points
directly in your eyes, as you walk past.
This is a simplistic model that makes no
sense, when you consider that the star
has to spin faster than a dentist's
drill in some instances. So, monitoring
the frequency of these spinning pulses
led scientists begin to make an overall
picture of how the neutron star is
orbiting;  it does not. Once again, as I
mentioned earlier, the pulsing signal
from a star is not due to it spinning.
It is due to the fact that it is a
magnetospheric circuit that behaves like
an atomic clock. It is a trapped-ion
oscillator, which is a very stable
oscillating system. The report goes on:
”All pulsars are useful for research into
astrophysics because of the way their
size and density makes them behave
extremely.” The extreme density is only a
mathematical result of an invalid
physical model. So, the pulsar is not
locked in a tight and extremely fast
orbit and therefore the so-called
evolution has nothing to do with the
gravitational system. The report finishes
with: “All of this means that for the
first time, astrophysicists have recorded
evidence of the predicted phenomenon of frame
dragging. If space-time is colloquially
indeed a ‘fabric,’ it's an elastic one,
where spinning objects receive that
stored energy back from the fabric of
space-time itself.” That has nothing to do
with physics. Space and time are
non-physical concepts. In classical
physics, space and time are absolute. So
you cannot treat it as a fabric; it's not
elastic; and spinning objects cannot
store energy in this imaginary fabric. It
goes on to say: “ The orbit of the two
stars continues to drift and change, like
a spinning figure skater who accelerates
by pulling in their limbs. It’s is this
change in speed and orientation that
let scientists observe the frame
dragging....” That is an assumption of what
the signals mean. “This detection is
consistent with an evolutionary scenario
in which the white dwarf accreted matter
from the pulsar, spinning up the white
dwarf to a period of less than 200
seconds.” This seems an incredible piece
of work by the white dwarf accreting
matter from something that is so highly
compressed and held together by gravity.
How is it going to accrete matter from
it? I think the game is given away in the
last paragraph: “Scientists have longed
for evidence of frame dragging in the
wild, so to speak, because the idea could
explain a lot of things we don't
understand yet about relativity, gravity
itself and forces that affect everything
from celestial objects to subatomic
particles.” Of course, but you're not going
to find the answers by fiddling with non-
physical ideas and no definitions of
gravity, mass, energy. We stopped doing
physics over a century ago.
So, the scientists may continue to long
for evidence of things, but when
their interpretations are so far
removed from reality, the answers are
always going to be a puzzle.

Ears ring, windows rattle, the dog hides
under the bed. You've heard it before.
Thunder from an arc of electric discharge,
or from a passing supersonic jet.
One doesn't hear jets much anymore, but
in the good old days, I used to, when
F-100 afterburners lit over the desert.
Booms from 20 miles away.
When you rub feet on the carpet and touch a
doorknob, you get a spark and hear a snap.
That's the same thing on a tiny scale.
Think about the power it takes to make a
boom that travels miles with
the energy to rattle windows.
If you're really close, in the mountains
on some high windswept ridge,
lightning is terrifying. Lightning’s 
shockwave will blow trees and
rocks apart like dynamite. On 
rocky peaks, especially granite
boulders, you can find the scars. If you know
what you're looking for they're easy to spot,
but if not, a magnetometer betrays their 
signature. Where I live, I find rocks the size of
buildings split apart, chunks 
the size of houses tossed away.
It's quite obvious past lightning was
more powerful than we see today.
It's the explosive blast - the Arc Blast -
a sonic wave that blasts outwards in
all directions at the speed of 
sound like a wall of heavy air.
It does not move the air with it but
rolls through it just the way an ocean
swell rolls through the ocean. It 
compresses and decompresses the air
it moves through, instantly raising its
temperature and pressure, then dropping
it in the next instant. There's another
effect in the shock wave, called ionization.
It's the inevitable result of higher
temperature and pressure, because, to put
it in conventional terms, it means more
atoms colliding, knocking electrons free.
But it's really more than that. A shock
wave generates current. The condensate in
a cloud is an electric conductor. The dipolar
molecule of water aligns with electric fields.
Dipoles attract and drops form. Charge 
moves when this happens, meaning current.
Current in a cloud is called “bound” current.
If you don't believe me, question this:
why do governments use electricity to modify
weather? And how could they unless there is
something in the cloud to carry current?
Watch this Fox 13 show from Tampa Bay
which discusses how Dubai uses electricity to make
rain. In other words, a shock wave is a plasma.
It may be a weak plasma, like the sonic
wave produced by a fighter jet that
condenses water vapor, or it may be a
sheet of electric current that spits
lightning of its own, like the shock wave of a
hydrogen bomb. If you are fortunate enough to see a
rocket launch or a re-entry, you may
witness shockwaves that are sufficiently
ionized to glow in the upper atmosphere.
For perspective, realize there are no
shining ions traveling with the shock wave 
bubble. The bubble is moving through the air,
ionizing and exciting atoms as it goes,
generating a current in the shock wave.
Shock waves are electric. The sight of glowing
shock waves in the black of space is surreal.
It gives you an idea of what
the ancients saw in the sky.
Meteors also generate shockwaves. The
Chelyabinsk event produced a shockwave
that injured many people. The 
Tunguska blast reportedly knocked
people off their feet several miles away.
Now imagine a world in chaos, where winds
shrieked at supersonic speeds. One need
not ascribe to Velikovsky to imagine
such a thing, because every mainstream
theory of impact and accretion or
whatever is in favor today, would 
necessitate periods of chaotic atmosphere.
Supersonic winds would have happened at
times regardless of what science-based
creation theory you ascribe to. Any 
big meteor impact would do it. Even
the creationist’s seven days must have entailed
some wind. Besides that, we have planets in our
solar system with supersonic
winds right now: Jupiter is one.
To assume supersonic winds and shockwaves
occurred, and should therefore have left
their mark on Earth, is perfectly 
sound logic in any cosmology.
Yet you don't hear shock waves mentioned
much by geologists. They make theories
and wave their hands about tectonic forces
without finding what does the pushing,
but they don't say much about sonic shock 
waves. They use sonic waves as a tool,
and they recognize micro-fractures in quartz,
and shock cones in rocks due to meteor impacts,
but virtually nothing about the winds that
would result, or the effect of the sonic waves.
Previous articles have shown that shock
waves produced by supersonic winds left
tetrahedral-shaped mountains with 
flat triangular-faced mountain flanks.
The evidence shows that Earth was
embroiled at times in a maelstrom of
winds that actually shaped the surface of the
planet. The primary mechanism for triangles you
see so ubiquitously in mountains is a
region of the shock wave called the
”separation bubble”. When a 
supersonic wind shears across a
surface and meets an obstruction, it
lifts to ride over the obstruction like
a wing, because a high pressure zone
forms in front of the obstruction.
This high pressure zone is called the
separation bubble, because it separates
the supersonic flow from the ground,
forcing it to change direction. Wind flow
in the following diagrams is left to
right unless it's shown otherwise.
It's called a bubble because in
ideal conditions it forms an actual
tetrahedron-shaped bubble of high
pressure, low-velocity air surrounded by
low pressure, high-velocity air. The 
bubble wall or "membrane” is made of
shearing and reflected shock waves. They
are a predictable, inevitable, measurable
boundary layer effect caused by the drag
of supersonic wind over a surface.
If you've read my past articles on 
this subject, you'll note I call the
separation bubble a low-pressure low- velocity 
zone. That was a mistake. So, this is meant to
correct the record and give some more
detail on them because they are the most
tangible, accessible, reproducible, and
compelling evidence for Velikovsky's
theories in existence. I don't
 say that lightly, but it's true.
Shock wave tetrahedrons are more abundant
than rock art that can be compared to
plasma instabilities. Comparisons 
of petroglyphs to simulated
instabilities are simply shrugged off as pareidolia,
anyway. They also don't depend on interpretation
of tiny points of light from a zillion miles 
away or guessing about the nuclear
process inside stars, or atoms. They don't
depend on reinterpreting mythology,
equations, or the validity of anyone's physics.
Shock waves are well known by classical
physics and applied science. Shock 
wave tetrahedrons cover our planet.
In fact, some aspects of plasma
instabilities and astronomical “Z-pinch”
nebula are due to shock waves. Some
petroglyphs depict atmospheric shock waves too.
Sonic shock is essential science in the
Electric Universe and I'm confident Hannes
Alfven would agree. In a plasma, shock waves 
and currents are coherent. Shock waves
generated during past cosmic upheaval
on Earth interacted with solid ground in
whatever matter they touched.
They echoed from solid surfaces and
shear zones. They vibrated and wobbled
and crawled across the earth, making
piles of debris we call mountains. They
interacted in patterns of constructive
and destructive interference and
resonated in harmonic frequencies.
They left those patterns in
the mountains for us to see.
Shock waves are, after all, plasma sound 
waves. They are tangible, falsifiable, and
accessible. They can be reproduced.
I've been noodling how to make a solid
tetrahedron in a wind tunnel.
The problem is getting adherence.
If dry powders or sands are used, they 
won't stick. If wet anything is used it'll make a
mess. Nature doesn't care about messes
and splatters stuff everywhere. But a wind
tunnel is an expensive piece of
equipment that doesn't stand well to
supersonic sandblasting. Magnetic dust
and magnet won't work to adhere a
tetrahedron, because the dust
would take the shape of the magnet.
I can't get an ionized supersonic wind
generator without a Chinese electric
turbine and so far the Chinese aren't
answering my calls. Neither is NASA.
Funny, it's the same phone number. I think
maybe a big drop of glue or epoxy could
be used as the obstruction in a wind
tunnel if it were performed while tacky.
It should mold to the shock wave
separation bubble without flying away.
Anyway, it's not an easy problem. But wait, 
nature provides proof. We don't need a
wind tunnel, the atmosphere
itself is our laboratory.
Iron meteors enter Earth's atmosphere
at supersonic speeds. Friction with the
atmosphere melts and ablates the iron.
Ablation patterns provide the proof of
shock wave tetrahedrons. Look at figure
10 and the several other images to follow
which show molded iron shock
tetrahedrons at the tips of flow
patterns made by separation bubbles.
This is tangible proof made in conditions
similar to theory. This piece of data is a start
to prove science as we know it is mostly wrong.
Well, okay, hugely wrong. Massively 
wrong. These meteorites should
be prima facie evidence of Electric Earth Theory.
This is a meteor of iron with an ablated
face caused by its supersonic
entry into the atmosphere.
Heat, pressure, and supersonic shock 
waves molded this face. The supersonic wind,
impacting the meteor head-on, segregated
into bubble-like pressure regimes. Low-
pressure zones where wind velocity 
was greatest created scoops and divots.
High-pressure zones segregated these air
flows, leaving sharp dividing ridges and
triangular separation bubbles where
the airflow separated from the meteor.
The smooth divots are impressions of
flow streams, and the triangles appear at
their tips. The change in direction 
as airflow separated from the object,
created separation bubbles which molded
the fluid iron. Molten iron was pushed
from the divot like pudding, and held in
the high-pressure separation bubble,
molding it to form, in the form of the
bubble. Look closely and you'll find
where some tips broke off. The entire 
divot is, in effect, the separation bubble.
It is literally bubbles formed with skin
effect from shock waves that hold
tension like a bubble’s film. It creates 
Y-shaped structures around a
”triple point” where shock waves and bubbles
meet, sometimes called the “Lambda Structure.”
In the case of mountain building, winds
laden with dust passed into the bubble,
and were heated, compressed and slowed 
to a stop passing through the shock wave.
The ground was statically charged and
adhered the dust, mud, sand, stuff falling
from outer space or whatever the wind carried.
Hence the dust piled in the shape of a
bubble - a tetrahedron. Take 
a look at the similarity in these
tetrahedrons formed by a hot 
blast of air in South America
to the ones along the
edge of the meteorites.
Really, it can't be more obvious. It's
visually apparent how a non-rotating,
down-burst wind layered the dust in
a consistent pattern of tetrahedrons
formed by separation bubbles where the
wind impacted and deflected from the land.
This was made by a blow-torch aimed
at the ground - the hot exhaust of a
mesocyclone that churned in a plasma
storm of Jovian proportions. The side
of the tetrahedron facing the wind will
be a perfect isosceles triangle if the
wind strikes normal to the object.
If the wind hits obliquely, is interfered
with by adjacent shockwaves, is sub-
sonic, or transient in its velocity or if the
dust load deposited doesn't fill the entire
separation bubble, it will deform the tetrahedron.
You are not suffering from pareidolia. A triangle
is a triangle, and that is what you're seeing.
We could be scientific and take
measurements to prove these are triangles,
but I think we can use common sense. Here
are more examples of tetrahedrons formed
on iron meteorites. The size 
of the separation bubble
depends on the size of the object
because that determines the area of wind
moving past the object and 
therefore the size of the shock wave.
So, the bigger the meteor, the bigger the
tetrahedrons. The constituency of the
rock also affects the roughness of the
surface, whether it's chunky or smooth, as
they say. Regardless of many variables,
the triangular face of separation
bubbles are distinct and appear exactly where
they should if one traces the wind patterns
Jeez, somebody out there 
must have noticed this before.
I'll bet there's some obscure,
mustachioed PhD at the Upper-Siberian
Institute of Aerodynamic Widgets who
knows all about this. Please call me.
In a completely different circumstance,
lightning-generated shockwaves also
produce tetrahedrons. The next 
four figures are photos of an
iron-bearing rock that has been struck
by lightning, partly melted and vitrified,
with raised triangular layers where fluid
metal was trapped by separation bubbles.
The lightning left a yellowed, chemically
altered trail where it surface-
conducted to a shoe-shaped pool where
the rock melted. The arc likely met some
discontinuity, or crack in the rock where
it burrowed in, creating a hot spot.
Cutting beneath the skin of the rock
created an arc flash that trapped
triangular sheets of molten rock in the
separation bubbles, pointing outward from
the center of the blast, shown in the following
images. The final image shows a track of very
small triangles marching out of the molten puddle.
The amplitude of the triangle is related
to the cross-section of the wind that
created it. What this little trail of
arrowheads means is that a very narrow supersonic
jet stream blasted from the lightning bolt
and made this channel in the rock, and
you can see exactly the path it took.
Can you find any other tetrahedrons
surrounding the track outlined?
They are aimed perpendicular to the
narrow track and larger amplitude. I
counted six good-sized ones, but
 there are a bunch of small ones, too.
The arc channeled a narrow, focused jet,
while at the same time, shock waves
blasted outwards in a diffuse wave that
produced larger amplitudes. There is also
a second lightning track from the bottom
right corner. There are shock patterns
that correlate with a blast from each lightning
track. For global-scale winds, separation
bubbles become quite large. Figure 17
gives you some idea of scale.
The separation bubble that creates a
mountain is just the very foot of a
shock wave structure much more
complex than a simple tetrahedron.
There are flow paths in, around, and
behind the separation bubble that all
leave their mark on the ground. If the
wind keeps blowing dust at supersonic
speed, the tetrahedron formed in the
separation bubble blocks the air, forming
a new obstruction to the wind, and a new
separation bubble forms in front of it,
trapping more dust that layers in the
triangular shape of its windward face.
This blankets the tetrahedron face with
layer after layer of deposit with each
pulse of the wind. Each pulse of the wind
may carry different constituents of dust and
charge, so each layer deposited 
has its own characteristic chemistry.
It is exactly the same way wind makes
sand dunes, except supersonic shock waves
are rigid and straight and make sharp
angles instead of soft curves.
Sand dunes are formed in the high pressure
low-speed zones beneath an undulating wind,
and the troughs are low pressure high-
speed zones. The high-speed winds carry
the sand to the low-speed zones, and
that's why they appear in waves. Static
electricity plays a role in sand dunes, too,
lofting and adhering the sand, and so it
does with shock waves. Each layer's
chemistry reacted with adjacent layers.
The matter laid down still swam with free charge.
Migrations and recombinations focused at
the layer interfaces, still hissing and 
vibrating with shock wave echoes,
where dissimilar matter made reactions,
drawing ions from the surroundings.
Charge built an electric field across
these interfaces in the way a capacitor
makes an electric field. Seams 
became hardened and mineralized,
and sometimes evacuated by gases evolved
from reactions that channeled caverns as
they expanded. The electric field, transverse
to the seam, is why most quartz veins grow
transverse across rock seams. They 
are the electrical expressions left
by shock waves and electric fields.
The consensus theory of hydrolyzed
silica migrating into rock seams by
hydrothermal action isn't entirely wrong,
but it misses the role of electricity and how it
would accelerate the pace of crystal formation.
It also misses the role electricity
plays in the migration of conductive
metals into quartz veins and a number of other
things. Shock waves took different polarities.
They generated lightning. They connected
ground to cloud in a sheet of plasma
current. They ionized air, water vapor, and
dust. They melted metals. They vibrated
and electrified the ground. They segregated
airborne matter with electrostatic filtration.
They compressed matter in geometric
shapes and charged it with current to
fuse it together. They formed plasma
networks of active circuitry. They
patterned the wind in diamonds that 
glowed, with sparks shooting through.
They turn biological beings to jelly. Shock 
waves are a pathway for discharge, a
current generator, and a capacitor across
the walls of shock “membranes.”
They are a big piece of Earth’s circuitry
and a principal action of nature.
They are the most obvious, prolific,
and easily defined proof that Earth was
formed, and still performs as an electrical body.
And they are one of the most beautiful.
After all they produce these mountains.
I want to give special thanks to
Stefan Ahmala, who took the photos of
the rocks in Finland.
Stefan discovered Thunderbolts recently,
and like most of us, arrived here because
he knew the rest of the world is crazy.
Stefan is very enthusiastic, and
immediately recognized these rocks 
for what they are and contacted us.
Wouldn’t you know I was writing an article
on tetrahedrons when his photos arrived?
Well, that is how things resonate in the
Electric Universe, isn't it? We are all
the same ether. It is what is. We 
can either resonate in harmony, or
make destructive interference.
That's our free will.

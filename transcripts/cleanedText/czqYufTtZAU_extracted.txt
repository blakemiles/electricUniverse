Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe,

iIt's one of many enduring
mysteries in solar physics,
”Why is the Sun's lower corona hundreds 
of times hotter than the Sun's photosphere?”
For many decades, scientists have
sought an answer to the puzzle,
though always doing so within
the confines of the standard
thermonuclear model of the Sun.
Recently the ESA and NASA Solar Orbiter
spacecraft returned to scientists on Earth
the closest images of the Sun taken to date.
Some mission scientists are speculating
that the images may reveal clues to the
problem of coronal heating. A 
principal investigator, astrophysicist
David Berghmans points to what he describes
as ”campfires” in the images. He states,
”The campfires we are talking about 
here are the little nephews of solar flares,
at least a million, perhaps 
a billion times smaller.
When looking at the new
high-resolution EUI images,
they are literally everywhere we look.”
A NASA press release on the images states,
”It's not yet clear what these campfires
are, or how they correspond to solar
brightenings observed by
other spacecraft. But it's
possible they are mini-explosions known as
nanoflares-- tiny but ubiquitous sparks, theorized to
help heat the Sun's outer atmosphere,
or corona, to its temperature 300 times
hotter than the solar surface... To 
know for sure, scientists need a more
precise measurement of 
the campfires’ temperature.”
Ironically a 2016 phys.org report
entitled, “The Mystery of Coronal Heating”
emphasizes how wildly inappropriate the campfire
analogy is in any attempt to explain the Sun's hot
corona. The article states, “Imagine standing
around a roaring campfire, roasting s'mores.
You feel the warmth of the flames as the
marshmallows crackle.
Now back away. You get cooler, right?
That's not how it works on the Sun. The
visible surface of the Sun has a
temperature of 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.
Backing away from the inferno
should cool things down,
but it doesn't. Instead the 
Sun's upper atmosphere
or corona sizzles at
millions of degrees-
a temperature 200 to 500 times higher
than that of the roaring furnace below.
For more than a half century, astronomers
have tried to figure out what causes
the corona to be so hot. It is one of the most
vexing problems in astrophysics.” As he's done in
previous episodes, we asked Dr. Donald Scott
to explain why the Sun's super-hot corona
has always been a predictable
feature of the Electric Sun model.
It is as if just about every couple of weeks recently,
some official arm of the astrophysics community
issues a press release that reveals just how
far off-track the mainstream really is. it's
almost getting to be like a press
conference where the interviewers
throw out softball questions to the
speaker, who's waiting for them and hits
them out of the ballpark. Now,
I don't know if I’ll be able to hit this
one out of the ballpark, but it's
not exactly like that, because
we here in the Electric
Universe Thunderbolts Group
never know what these
folks are going to say next
to demonstrate how uninformed and
uneducated they are in the areas
in which they claim to be experts. So, we
have to be ready for just about every
anything that the “Fortress astrophysicists”
put out. And they really do live in a
fortress; it's a closed shop
and they refuse to acknowledge
we exist. So, anyway, for example
there have been a couple of these press
releases in recent days, and I think it's
crucially important that we respond to them.
About two weeks ago on July 16th,
ABC News, and I said, oh ABC News. No,
that's the Australian Broadcasting Company,
not the American Broadcasting Company,
released a press release entitled, “Solar
Probe Snaps Closest Ever Pictures of the Sun
Revealing Campfires on the Surface” and I
thought that, when I said, you got to be
kidding. Well, let me quote from the press
release. ”...the discovery of thousands of tiny
solar flares that scientists have
dubbed ‘campfires’, offering clues
about the extreme heat of the
outermost part of its atmosphere.”
Let me end the quote there. Of course,
I want to talk about their use of the word
’campfires’, but also, this 
last gratuitous comment
that they hung on the end of that first
sentence, about ‘clues’ that they see about the
extreme heat of the Sun's outer atmo-
sphere, which of course is its corona, the
lower corona, shows they still haven't figured out
the cause of the lower corona's extreme temperature.
For decades they wondered why there was
this extreme jump in temperature as you
came out of the Sun and up into the
corona. Well one of the most basic and
important contributions of the Electric
Universe is Ralph Juergens’ Electric Sun model
which was published back in the 1970’s.
Juergens’ model inherently explains the
high temperature of the lower corona,
and many other phenomena about the Sun
that the gravity-only mainstream still finds
enigmatic, because it's electrical and they
can't explain it electrically. They refuse
to. Juergens and the rest of us in the
Electric Universe have been, and 
continue to be, completely ignored by
the power structure,
called ’accepted astrophysics’
or I call it ’fortress
astrophysics’.
We have presented dozens of Space News videos, just
like this one, that discuss and explain the temperature
anomaly that worries them so, as 
being completely understandable as
the result of the acceleration of positive 
ions, electrical acceleration of positive ions,
leaving the Sun, that collide with
more static ions and neutral atoms just
below the corona. Their use of
the word ’clues’ to me is very
interesting, because it sticks out.
It implies to me that they see
this still as a mystery. If it wasn't a
mystery, you have clues to mysteries, but
you don't have clues to things that are
very explainable by accepted theory.
Juergens published his paper back in the late
1970’s. Where have they been for about 40 years?
This was a 28-page paper containing much
evidence that the Sun's photospheric surface
is, was, is highly electrical in nature.
But astrophysics’ public relations people
certainly love quaint and
whimsical phrases like,
’campfires on the Sun’. Maybe they think
of themselves as being so much more
informed than the rest of
us, that they have to talk
down to us as if we were children. Or do they
actually think there might be big campfires
burning up there on the Sun?
Anyway, they included several images,
and one is a multiple image. It does 
indeed show some bright points
on the main photospheric layer.
But Juergens discussed these,
back in 1979, saying they were
fountains of electrons called spicules,
in the Sun's chromosphere, being ejected
upward in a self-regulating plasma
mechanism, to maintain a strong
electric field at the photosphere,
that produced that self-same change in
the temperature that bewilders them so.
Anyway, it involved creation of
what is now called a ‘double layer’.
Irving Langmuir, scientist,
an American scientist had
discovered and published his work
on the double layer requirement
back in the early 1930’s, and been awarded
actually the Nobel Prize in 1932 for doing it.
But these guys have never heard of it.
Anyway, many images of the Sun obtained over
many years, many decades actually, 
show bright spots just like this, and in many
diagrams of the various 
solar layers, you see
these spicules, these 
fountains of electrons.
What we see on the Sun, are the 
various forms that plasma creates there.
Nothing more. Anyway, many photographic
images that have been taken over the years,
show bright spots, and were 
these people unaware of it?
These new photographs were taken, I guess,
very close to the Sun, but they're no
better than many other
photographs we have of
this same phenomenon. Spicules are thin,
elongated jets, a few hundred kilometers
wide. They reach up to six
thousand kilometers in height,
and they can move around at speeds of
more than 100 kilometers per second.
And spicules are found 
all over the solar surface,
but they can be observed and photographed
most easily near the limb of the Sun.
The bright spots also may just be
locations, where the streams of incoming
electrons, are stronger, 
denser. But wait a second.
Didn't they realize the word ‘campfires’,
that that was actually seriously used by
astronomers in the 19th century in another
embarrassingly long period of time, when
they had no answer to the
question of why the sun is so hot?
And why it doesn't burn out?
These were the years around
the beginning of the 20th century, when atomic
energy was being developed; you know the Curies
and all that. So, they desperately
latched on to this atomic fusion
process, in a last-ditch effort, like a drowning
man grabs a life ring, to explain the Sun's
tremendous and apparently ever-
lasting stream of output power.
But why do they reuse
that word again now?
You would think they'd be
embarrassed by it. They ought to be.

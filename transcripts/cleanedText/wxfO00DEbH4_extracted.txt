so what are the advantages of this force
of gravity
is derived from a universal force law
it's based on real finite sized
particles not point particles
doesn't involve any known approximations
it's a contact force is expected by
natural philosophers
it describes
the curling spiraling motion of
planetary orbits
that our cross r cross v term produces
that spiraling type motion
does the same thing in electrodynamics
when you have currents flowing they also
spiral
it satisfies mach's principle because
all of the
charges in the universe can be taken
into account as far as uh all the
vibrating dipoles as far as uh max
principle is concerned
uh
it explains more phenomena than any
previous gravitational force theory
it eliminates mass as a fundamental
quantity
uh oh
it explains why inertial and
gravitational masses are equal
i haven't done the force of inertia but
we'll do that next
for the force of inertia we'll take the
force between a unit charge
over here on the right and a vibrating
neutral electric dipole
we'll do the same kind of calculation
that we did for the force of gravity and
i'm not i'll just show you what it looks
like if i write it
like newton would have written it
we get the f equals m a term like newton
had but we get a second term
this term goes as r across r cross a
and
i don't have time to show you all the
data that but a very famous
british
engineer named eric leithwaite the
inventor of the high-speed electric
train
he did gyroscope experiments and he
found that term
and for finding it
all of his contracts with the british
government were canceled his membership
in the rural society was revoked
and he was declared a heretic
but his trains still worked they're in
they're in germany and japan and they
should have been in great britain and uh
and there's nothing wrong with his data
now that we have the proper theory for
the force of inertia we know there's a
second term
now there's some other things that this
can explain
this also agrees
the mass the f equals m
a the m there is the same m
if you write it out in electrodynamic
constants as for gravity it also is
decaying producing a 2.7 degree kelvin
causing background radiation
it
now tells us something about spiral
galaxies that we didn't know
that is
the outer arms of spiral galaxies the
mass of the atoms is different
than the mass at the center because the
outer arms decay faster than the center
so
we expect to see
that this data here
the green line here shows what newton's
law and that's also einstein's general
relativity theory would predict for the
velocity of the spiral arms as a
function of distance from the center of
the spiraling
galaxy the
blue data
are what is actually observed and the
green or lighter green line yellow line
above is what you would expect from the
decay
of the mass and conservation of energy
for the outer arms so we don't need dark
matter we don't need dark energy
our formula for gravity our electric
formula
does it all
you

The American Southwest is
an ideal testing ground
for the hypotheses of
Electric Universe geology.
Geological textbooks tell us that
the hallmark breathtaking features
of these desert regions formed through slow
erosional processes over eons of time.
But laboratory experiments with electrical
discharges have opened new theoretical pathways
that enquirers in increasing numbers
around the world are following.
A remarkable contributor to the
burgeoning field of EU geology
is Thunderbolts colleague Andrew Hall
whose articles and video presentations
have explored new electrical
interpretations of desert geology.
In part one of his
three-part presentation,
Hall presents his detailed analysis of
the stunning features in Canyonlands,
a dramatic desert
landscape in Utah
beginning with the discussion of the
amazing formations called the Arches.
In summer of 2016 following EU
conference in Phoenix, Arizona,
EU geology researchers visited
Arches National Monument
in the deep reaches
of Canyonlands, Utah
where the Green and Colorado rivers
channel through the Colorado Plateau.
Arches National Monument is an astonishing
place for anyone interested in EU geology.
By conventional reckoning,
the high desert plateau
was carved into fantastical
arches and hoodoos
after millions of years of
subtle water and wind erosion.
To the EU researchers, however, it
was evident the land was zapped,
carved and seared by electrical storms
that could have happened last year,
so fresh looked the
marks of evidence.
The Arches' formation tells a story
which explains one of the key phenomena
that shaped the
face of the planet.
The phenomenon is called
sputtering discharge.
So let's take a look
at what that is.
Sputtering discharge, as
used in manufacturing,
is a dark to glow-mode
current in plasma
used to deposit thin films of
material onto a substrate surface.
It's analogous to electroplating,
or galvanic reaction in a fluid.
An electric field accelerates positive ions
in plasma to collide with a source material,
which breaks molecular bonds,
eroding the source material.
This is what the term
"sputter" refers to --
the breaking away of particles
in the source material
which then drift in an electric
field to coat the substrate.
The source material is the cathode, and the
substrate is the anode in the circuit.
The material exchange is
performed by electricity.
Manufacturers often use magnetrons
to shape and control the current
and improve material transport efficiency
with external magnetic fields.
The point to be made, however, is that
high voltage, low current in a plasma
will erode or etch
away a cathodic surface
and plate itself in layers
on the anodic surface.
This is a process that
shaped Canyonlands.
To fully understand these canyons,
however, first we must understand domes,
because the canyons are
carved from a dome.
The entire Colorado
Plateau is a dome --
or rather, a series of domes
overlaying each other.
The domes are composed of sedimentary
layers of limestone and sandstone.
The layers are stacked for the most
part evenly and flat, like a layer cake.
This basic layer cake
structure is capped
with the Rocky Mountains on the East
and carved into canyons on the West,
while it's shot through with
the Lichtenberg-patterned,
vertically cut gorges of the
Colorado and Green Rivers.
The dome structure of the plateau
and the canyons carved through it
is primarily the result of a natural
sputtering discharge process
created during intense
electrical storms.
Of course, in this case, we're speaking about
storms created in a past environment
when Earth's electric field
was amplified to the point
the entire
atmosphere was ionized.
Imagine the atmosphere stirred into a maelstrom
lit with streamers of glowing plasma.
Where lightning crackled, not only
in the sky, but across the land,
and mountain tops glowed with coronal fire
under swirling clouds of dusty plasma.
It would have been surreal.
A place where streams of wind
became electric currents.
Where high and low-pressure zones
acted like battery terminals,
and mountain tops became electrodes drawing
machine-gun lightning from the sky.
Anything standing in the wind would have
hissed and snapped with coronal fire.
Dust in the air would
have acted strange, too,
as the energy of free electrons collided
and overpowered weaker atomic bonds,
ionizing matter, causing it to act like a
ferro-fluid under the influence of a magnet.
Ionic species segregated,
forming unipolar winds
that tore past each other
in opposite directions,
creating shear zones of
intense electrical discharge
and vortex winds of
supersonic speed.
The inside of Earth would
have been in turmoil as well.
Hot magmas spewing from volcanic
vents. Aquifers boiling.
Explosive eruptions of steam from deep
underground, pocking the landscape with holes.
Even arcs would erupt --
lightning from the ground --
caused by buried pockets of charge
where minerals and water ionized.
The winds, dust-laden and electric,
deposited the Colorado Plateau,
plating a cake across the
western half of North America
in the same way semiconductor manufacturers
layer circuitry onto silica wafers.
The stratified layers are
interspersed with magma flows,
petrified forests, inland seas, and
dinosaur boneyards of different ages
that indicate it formed in a series of events
that likely recurred over millions of years.
To create the Canyonlands, the
voltage potential had to reverse
and eat away at landscape
newly laid down by the storm.
Under the electric field
of an electrical storm,
the surface of the earth
becomes positively-charged.
It becomes the anode in the circuit where
lightning strikes from the negative cloud base
and where rain falls.
In primordial ionic storms like
those that formed the plateau,
rain did not fall, but silica did,
as dust in the air fell and
adhered in layers to the dome.
Inland seas, or layers washed over by
tsunami generated by the storm itself,
became covered over with more layers of
dry overburden as the storm progressed.
This left a moist layer, like icing
in the center of the layer cake.
This icing layer then ionized
under intense bombardment
from sputtering discharge
in the eye of the storm
and created what is known as barrier discharge
in the moist layer beneath the ground.
Which brings us back to
Arches National Monument,
proof that the canyons were carved
by sputtering discharge,
aided by barrier discharge, in
a moist layer of the big cake.
This image tells
most of the story.
A band of rock that looks
tortured and fluid,
as if it were boiled
mud when it solidified,
sandwiched between smooth, more-
or-less even layers of stone.
The canyon floor is flat,
which is surprising
if one accepts the consensus view that
canyons were made by water erosion.
Water erosion leaves deep
channels and vee-cut valleys,
not flat floors.
This closer image shows the
fluidity of the layers.
At the top, the overburden rock
barely sinks into the sagging layer
beneath it that turned plastic
because it was still solid.
The plastic layer beneath sagged
but didn't compress, and
maintained a consistent thickness.
Below that on the bottom,
the 'boiled mud' layer fluidized
completely and squeezed like toothpaste.
What turned this bottom layer fluid and
caused to sag beneath a solid overburden
was electrical current. A
barrier discharge current,
where no gaseous atmosphere was
present to ionize into plasma,
but instead, the moisture and
minerals in the layer ionized,
generating a subsurface current.
The moist layer ionized
and charged species pooled
into a plasma-like mud the
electric field wanted to lift away.
The electric currents
boiled the moist layer,
and it began to foam and arc into the drier
and electrically resistant overburden.
When sputtering removed the
surrounding overburden,
pressure released and vapors expanded,
making gas bubbles that raised the arches.
Hardened pinnacles formed where mud boiled up
in convective blossoms of hot ionization.
One can see how the moist
layer boiled and heaved,
while currents arched and thrust upward,
trying to break through the overburden rock.
But in this area, it was unsuccessful. The
traces of barrier discharge remain in the rock.
The empty, flat canyon floor, where the
overburden and moist layer were carried away
is where the discharge broke
through to complete the circuit.
Arches is a display of etching, or Electric
Discharge Machining (EDM) stopped in process.
The wet layer was boiling off
due to the current in it
and lifting away with the
overburden when the process stopped
leaving these
arches and hoodoos.
It likely stopped when the sputtering
glow current suddenly jumped to arc mode,
and lightning struck, dissipating the charge
built-up in the wet, 'boiled-mud' layer.
Sputtering discharge is typically
used in manufacturing
to remove only
micro-meters of material.
The ion bombardment on the
surface of cathode material
only shallowly penetrates to break atomic,
or molecular bonds and release particles.
So how could such a process remove
hundreds of feet of solid sandstone?
Well, one reason is the strength of the
electric field at work on the charged species.
In the primordial storm
we are discussing,
the electric field would have been
billions, perhaps trillions of volts.
The electromotive
force of such a field
applied to any large pool of charged
species could lift a mountain
and the other reason
is diffusion of charge
through a thousand feet of dry, sandstone
overburden, to ionize the wet layer.
The section of the dome overlaying the wet
layer acted as a solid-state semiconductor,
coherent with the
intense electric field.
Charge diffused through
the silica layers
in a manner to be discussed in more
detail in Part Two of this article.
But solid state electronics
are the way to evaluate
how charge diffused
through the landscape.
The wet, ionized layer then underwent a
process called heat spike sputtering.
Heat spike sputtering occurs when diffusing
ionization causes secondary reactions.
The secondary reactions
occur in the wet layer,
which is highly
conductive and volatile.
Currents heated the material
and that caused thermal liquefaction,
melting, and steam micro-explosions.
In Canyonlands, when the wet layer
ionized, it induced currents
which heat-spiked, discharging from
the wet layer to the layer above.
The arches and bubble-like pinnacles
in Arches National Monument
were created by heat-spike sputtering
and bubbles of micro-explosions
as the 'boiled mud' layer ionized, vaporized,
and discharged into the overburden.
This short film produced
by diveflyfish on YouTube
helps visualize the process
of diffusion through rock
and the process of barrier discharge
that caused the 'boiled-mud' layer to boil,
and in it, Jim Hamman, the creator of
diveflyfish and an EU contributor,
employs a high voltage Tesla circuit to
generate current through a granite block.
There are two things to
note as you watch the film.
First, note how the flow of electricity
diffuses through the entire granite block.
Instead of channeling directly below the
electrode in a narrow stream like an arc,
it flows out the full footprint
of the crystalline granite block.
The external electric field of the circuit
is diffusing charge through the granite
as it would in a
solid-state body.
In the tense electric field surrounding the eye
of the hyper-storm that etched the canyons,
currents also diffused through
the dome matrix in this way,
ultimately ripping out mountains
of earth in the blink of an eye
as currents boiled and
liquified the wet matrix below,
similar to the plasma tornadoes
that are swirling in the gaps
between the electrodes
and granite in the film.
Second, note the plasma tornadoes that bridge
the gap between the block and electrode.
They are not in bright arc mode
but are filaments in glow mode.
The plasma tornado currents are in the air
gap where the air has ionized to plasma.
In the Arches, there was no air gap between
the ionizing wet layer and the overburden,
so the discharge was a barrier
discharge coming from the 'boiled mud'.
The currents flowed around the
boiling, bubbling, foaming heat-spikes
to fuse and harden the less conductive overburden
in its pattern of arches and pinnacles.
Jim's experiment demonstrates how
current diffuses through granite
which demonstrates how ground
currents can diffuse in natural rock.
Watch towards the end of the clip, arcing
begins in hot spots to eat through the granite
collecting the current
into single arcing paths
and starving the diffusion
currents around them.
There are many other evidences of sputtering
discharge in the Utah Canyonlands.
In Part Two of Sputtering Canyons,
we'll examine some more.
Thank you!

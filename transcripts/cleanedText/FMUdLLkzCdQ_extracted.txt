Today, comparative mythologist
Ev Cochran continues his series on his
lifelong research into the themes and
archetypes of world mythology. In
previous discussions, Cochran has
explored the extraordinary identities of
planets in myth, including Mars as the
warrior’s hero, and Venus among other
identities, as the mother goddess, the
great comet and the fire-breathing serpent.
The reconstruction that Cochran and
colleague David Talbot have produced,
leaves none of the global archetypes
unaddressed. Archetypes which could only
exist as the result of real celestial
events, witnessed and experienced by
ancient peoples. Previously, Ev
presented his investigation into ancient
Egyptian traditions, which describe the
Sun appearing atop a lotus flower at the
time of creation. According to both
Talbot and Cochrane, such traditions
describe a particular phase in the
history of the polar configuration, one
in which Mars, as Horus, was positioned
in front of Venus as the lotus flower. In
this episode, Ev continues his discussion
on the lotus flower in myth, a symbol and
probably linked to the Sun gods of
various cultures. A familiar image in
ancient Egyptian iconography finds the
Horus child seated atop a lotus flower.
According to Eric Horning, the Dean of
Egyptologists, the Sun God on a lotus
blossom, was an image of the first
emergence of shapes at the creation.
James Allen offered a very similar
summary of this fascinating thematic
pattern, noting it was from this flower
that the Sun could blossom into the
world. Why an infant sitting atop a lotus
should be an archetypal symbol of
creation is rarely addressed and has yet
to receive a satisfactory answer.
Predictably, Egyptologists
identify the Horus child with the
present Sun, but they essentially ignore
the fundamental role of the Lotus. At no
point do they ever seriously
address the elephant in the room
namely, where in all of heaven is a lotus
flower to be found in the immediate
vicinity of the present Sun? The motif is
attested in other cultures as well. In
ancient India for example, we read that
”The world Lotus originally blooms in
response to the rising of the Sun ‘in the
beginning’.” Here is in ancient Egypt: the
blossoming of the Lotus is explicitly
placed at the time of beginning. In other
words, creation. Analogous traditions are
evident in Mesoamerica where the sacred
Mayan text known as the book of Chilam
Balam describes the Sun as residing
within a four-petaled flower. “Four-fold
was the plate of the flower and the Sun was
set in its center.” So too in a hieroglyphic
Mayan script, the Sun is depicted as a
four-petaled flower. The Mayan Sun
sign in turn, finds a remarkable analog
in ancient Mesopotamia, where the Sun was
represented as a four-petaled flower. To
bring the argument full circle,
this particular image forms a close
structural parallel to the Egyptian wnb
flower described as follows. “The wnb
flower is none other than the primordial
lotus from which the Sun emerges at dawn
in the east.” We see many examples of
similar imagery in ancient artworks and
religious iconography
from around the world.
We asked Ev how one might distinguish
between depictions of four-petaled
flowers, which can be explained in
familiar terms, versus depictions of
celestial phenomena. Naturally, it's
important to pay careful attention to
context. In prehistoric artwork, such as
those from the famous passage tombs at
Loughcrew, Ireland, four-petaled flowerlike
forms appear alongside a wide variety
of suns and starbursts, a sure indication
that celestial forms are being depicted.
So too in Mesopotamia four-petaled flowers
are routinely depicted in conjunction
with a recumbent Crescent, and
alongside four-rayed stars, thereby
confirming their fundamental affinity.
Equally important is the fact that the
so-called Ra sign also appears in
conjunction with a recumbent Crescent.
All modern scholars, except for Talbot
and myself, accept that the image
depicted in Fig. 6 is that of the
present Sun. If we grant that the
four-petaled floral forms are celestial
in nature, how can we rule out the
conventional view that the present Sun
is being depicted? A systematic analysis
of the respective artworks and
mythological traditions, will inevitably
point to a catastrophic context of the
archetypal theme of the blossoming Sun.
The myths of various cultures for
example, make the central heart of this
or that God suddenly blossom into a
Sun amidst great fireworks. It is this
cataclysmic background that alone can
explain the otherwise anomalous fact,
whereby in numerous ancient languages
words for ‘to blossom’ or ‘to flower’ also
denote ‘fire’. The Greek word ‘anthos’ for
example, denotes ‘flower’, but also the fire
stolen by Prometheus. The same linguistic
connection is found in the new world,
especially among the Aztecs where words for
‘to flower’ also mean ‘fire’. Witness the
following finding offered by the
anthropologist Jane Hill: “The
metaphoric association of flowers and
flames is very widespread in.. Aztecan
languages. The metaphor of the blooming
flower as ‘bursting into flame’ can be
reconstructed as a lexical item meaning
’blossom, bloom’ for Aztecan. Given the
striking association between flowers and
fire in ancient testimony, we asked Ev
how it can be explained in terms of
natural science. The Aztec myth of
creation provides the all-important clue.
There a scab-laden nobody named Nanahuatl
hurls himself into a great funeral
pyre, whereupon he's enveloped in fire
and suddenly blossoms, while becoming
transfigured into the Sun. While this is a
singularly informative mythological
tradition, analogous traditions
will be found around the globe. Pericles’
fiery death within the funeral pyre
atop Mount Oeta offers a familiar example.
Such archaic mythological traditions
preserve remarkably accurate memories
of extraordinary planetary events of a
catastrophic nature, the likes of which
are virtually impossible to imagine
today. Events which profoundly shaped
the course of ancient civilization. At
our last EU conference in Phoenix I
presented a number of slides that are
particularly compelling. Witness the
image presented in Fig. 7, dating
from about 3,000 BC. It depicts a four-
petaled rosette with what appear to
be four dots, or points of light between
the petals. As I have documented,
analogous images will be
found around the globe,
typically in celestial context. In many
examples the four-petaled flower is
replaced by a four-rayed star as in
Fig. 8 from Mesopotamian and Fig. 9
from Mesoamerica. Students of Archaeoastronomy
astronomy will recognize the latter
image as the Lamat sign, widely
acknowledged to have something to do
with the planet Venus. Granted that such
images depict celestial forms, and it is
quite impossible to believe otherwise,
the question is how to explain the four
dots between the rays of the central
star. Readers who are familiar with Tony
Perat's plasma experiments,
will immediately
recognize these dots as a classic
signature of synchrotron radiation, as
documented in the high-energy discharge
experiments conducted by him. This is but
one of many clues, albeit a
particularly important one, pointing to
the incredibly powerful electromagnetic
forces associated with the polar
configuration, as witnessed by ancient
sky watchers around the globe.

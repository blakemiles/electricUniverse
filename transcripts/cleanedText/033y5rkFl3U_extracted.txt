You just entered the
theater of an alien sky.
If the words and images seem strange
to you, there's a reason for this,
our world was once a
vastly different place.
To experience this, won't hurt
you, and there is nothing to fear.
The Lovely and Terrible Goddess
In all of the discourses in this
series, one question has dominated.
The question concerns the monumental
civilizations that emerged
so suddenly and unpredictably,
just a few thousand years ago.
As scientists and historians
delve into the early cultures
from ancient Egypt
and Mesopotamia,
to China and the Americas,
the greatest challenge is
almost never addressed,
how do we explain the mythic
archetypes, the global patterns?
As we've noted repeatedly in this series,
not one of the early civilizations
was free from this remarkable
sub structure of human thought.
A profound sense of connection
to the earliest remembered time,
called the first time.
A time of celestial splendor when
visible gods ruled the heavens.
A lost paradise or
golden age on Earth.
A towering temple or city
or kingdom in the sky.
A celestial Heliopolis,
Sumer, or Jerusalem.
A model in heaven to inspire construction
of sacred dwellings on Earth.
A cosmic mountain rising
along the world axis
as if to support the luminous
dwelling of the Gods.
A primeval Sun God at the summit,
not the body we call Sun today,
but a power claimed to have ruled the sky
in a former age of gods and wonders.
Why did Greek chroniclers so consistently
identify the celestial founder of the golden age
as Kronos, the Latin
planet god Saturn?
And for what unearthly reason
would Greek astronomers
have also named this very
power as Helios, the Sun?
It is all preposterous,
and yet the collective memories still
tug at us, calling us to remember,
pointing to patterns
of historical fact
that challenge every common
opinion today about the past.
The archetypes are the permanent
backdrop to every civilization on Earth.
We know that all of the early cultures
obsessively feared a fiery serpent, or dragon
whose attack on the World brought
humanity to the edge of extinction.
And how strange that story tellers
everywhere knew also the story
of a cosmic warrior rising
to subdue that very monster.
These are not just loosely defined
expressions of human anxiety.
As we've seen: the details are concrete
and the parallels are worldwide.
The pervasive theme of the attacking serpent
or dragon must have an explanation.
Mere accident of human thought
could never have achieved the global
influence of this human memory.
No intellectual mistake
could be greater
than ignoring this convergence
of human memories.
The remembered events are not
occurring in our own time.
Today's world, today’s sky, could not have
provoked a single mythic or symbolic archetype.
And that's the heart
of a profound mystery.
The archetypal sub
structure exists
and has been documented across
hundreds of global themes.
This can only mean that
something fundamental
and indispensable to scientific
understanding, has been overlooked.
To follow this question into the
heart of the ancient world,
it's well worth considering
one archetype in particular,
taking us back to the first stirrings
of the great civilizations.
I'm referring here to the
aged mother goddess.
In particular the polar opposites expressed
in the goddess's underlying identity.
How did a mythic archetype,
a goddess revered as the source of
life and light and feminine charm,
come to display a darker aspect
as a world threatening monster,
the prototype of
the wicked queen?
A goddess originally celebrated
as the exemplary star,
the beautiful Queen of Heaven?
What could account for the
transformation of that very goddess
into a shrieking witch or hag,
whose wildly disordered streaming
hair stretched across the sky?
Cross-cultural comparison
has answered the question.
The paradoxical opposites take us back to
one and the same power in the heavens.
The Love Goddess and
the Terrible Goddess
turn out to be not just one
and the same mythic figure,
but one and the same
planet, the planet Venus.
In fact, the only planet among five visible
planets to be given a feminine identity.
Don't believe in accidents;
that paradox has never been
resolved and will not go away.
It requires something
yet to be recognized
in standard treatments
of the mother goddess.
Just consider,
the horrifying Medusa figure was
a classic symbol of terror,
but Greek historians
and poets knew
that Medusa was originally
a form of stunning beauty.
That's the paradox
in a nutshell,
and it traces to the very
beginnings of civilization,
where in ancient Mesopotamia,
we observed the transformation
of the Sumerian
love goddess Inanna
into a shrieking dragon
attacking the world.
The same transformation occurs in
ancient Egypt in the story titled
"The Destruction of Mankind."
Here we see the beautiful
goddess Sekhmet
transformed into the fiery
world-threatening Uraeus serpent.
How are we to explain
this ancient paradox?
Such unsolved mysteries invite
us to question our assumptions.
And one assumption in particular has
held students of planetary history
in its grip for well
over a hundred years.
That assumption
began as a guess,
and it remains just a guess across the
20th century and into the 21st century.
The theoretical
assumption proclaims:
“As today, so before.The present
is the key to the past.”
Call it the
Uniformity Principle:
nothing to see here.
It just assumes that the positions
and relative motions of the planets
have remained constant
for millions of years,
even billions of years
some would say.
Today, this uniformity principle is
the greatest obstacle to discovery.
It systematically precludes any
understanding of our more ancient past.
Even in the face of overwhelming
evidence to the contrary,
the Uniformity Principle deflects our
attention away from the collective memories
that drove the emergence of
the early civilizations.
No mistake could be more costly than
to ignore the global consensus,
the archetypal substructure beneath the
surface details and contradictions
of the archaic cultures.
This substructure is a bedrock
of cross-cultural agreement,
and it requires us to consider
events that are not occurring today.
The Uniformity Principle cannot be valid
in approaches to ancient history.
Our purpose in this series is to show
that every known mythic archetype
finds its place in the emergence
and catastrophic evolution
of a gathering of planets
close to the Earth.
No selective
perception required.
We've called this ancient planetary
assembly the Polar Configuration.
This gathering of planets
was the centerpiece
of the anciently remembered
Age of Gods and Wonders.
Within this framework, the global
imagery of the mother goddess
connects us directly to the
origins, the dynamic activity,
and the ultimate fate
of the Venus goddess.
One planet alone
meets the acid test,
drawing our attention to the
electrically discharging sphere
seen visually in front of and close to
the center of a much larger sphere,
named in the astronomical
traditions as the planet Saturn.
And within the very same
context the Venus goddess
stood in a profound alignment with the
smaller, darker and reddish sphere,
named globally as the planet Mars,
the prototype of the warrior hero.
That's the mother goddess paradox that we
will explore in the two episodes to follow.
Always look for the
underlying form!

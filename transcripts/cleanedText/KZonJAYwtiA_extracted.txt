In Part 1 of the cosmology of the Electric
Universe, we looked at how the electrical
systems of the Earth and the planets exist
in the larger electrical body of the Sun.
Do we stop at the body of our Sun? No of course,
we do not. The Sun lives within a larger world.
The Sun lives inside the galaxy.
This, of course, is not a picture of our
galaxy because we cannot take a picture of
our galaxy any more than a cell in your liver
could take a picture from the outside of your 
body. We do have decent evidence to believe
that our galaxy looks something like this.
When we shift up in scale, we can ask
what's the relation of each star to the
larger galactic body of which it is a part?
Every star is transforming galactic currents
and fields. In our schematic, we picture
current coming from the galaxy and being transformed
by the stars, and we must allow that stellar
transformation of galactic energies is
just as complex as what we are learning
about the electrical transformations taking place on
planets. In other words, my little drawing is very
inadequate but it does convey the main
point: stars transform galactic energy.
So, are we done with our picture? No!
Our most excellent engineers and
astrophysicists have given us
a larger view to contemplate.
In this picture, which is a computer
generated picture, each dot, each tiny dot
represents galaxies and clusters of galaxies.
This is the large-scale structure of our Universe.
And you might not be surprised to 
learn that this filament-like structure
was a complete surprise to standard 
cosmologists. But it was predicted by Electric
Universe theorists. Gravity cannot
explain this structure, but electricity,
and the flow of electricity does predict 
this. Keeping our theme of each world
eating and transforming energies from the larger
world it lives in, we can see that galaxies are
transforming energies from, well it's hard to say
from what, we're kind of at the limits of what
we can talk about. But we can say 
something like, ‘galaxies transform
the great currents and fluxes that course
through our universe as a whole’. Coming back
to our own human scale. All plants, all 
animals, all humans, transform energy
that comes from the Sun. This is rather 
obvious. Plants turn sunlight and minerals into
leaves and fruits, animals digest the fruits
and the leaves, and we humans eat all of it.
We only move and think and feel
because of the flow of electricity
in our bodies. If it were possible to
stop the flow of charged particles and
electric fields within us, then our thoughts,
feeling and sensations would instantly stop.
I am studying the electrical connections
that exist between one living creature
and another, or exist between every plant
and animals and the Earth. Or between
living creatures and other planets. Or even the
connections between an individual man or woman
and the Sun. All of this is my field of study. As a
closing note, since I said that cosmology must also
include our aspirations, what does this new
cosmology say about our yearnings and our hopes?
In a better cosmology, we would recognize that
caterpillars do sometimes turn into butterflies,
and buds do sometimes turn into flowers, and 
the sperm and the egg do sometimes become
babies. These transformations are part of our
life and part of every aspect of the living
Universe. The Electric Universe model says that
the brightness of a star is a function of how
much galactic current it is transforming.
Bright stars are transforming a lot of
galactic energy, dim stars transform little.
Maybe the stars we see burning more
brightly, are actually doing more work for
the galaxy and the brightness is really
more of a side effect, a consequence. The
bright stars in the sky are literally responding
to some galactic need that requires more energy.
And we can go one step further because
we know that some stars completely transform
into a supernova, putting out for a short time
more energy than the entire galaxy.
In the old view, this is an accident,
and unconnected to anything else going on in the
galaxy. But in a better cosmology, we can see
that the supernova is a star that has taken a 
huge leap in its ability to transform galactic energy.
A supernova is burning so incredibly brightly
because it it has found a way to be much more
useful. The Crab Nebula was once 
an ordinary star, doing ordinary work
for the galaxy. And then something 
changed. And it has since been churning out
prodigious amounts of super-high frequencies.
What is the purpose of these enormous
energies, at these very high 
frequencies? We don't know,
but I do know that these supernovae play
an important galactic function and I know
that a similar transformation is possible 
for you and me at our own scale.
We could actually take a leap and be
much more useful to the world around us.
We could start emitting much more energy
at much higher and finer frequencies.
This promise is one of the reasons I
pursue the Electric Universe paradigm.
In closing let me say that I do
not think electricity explains
everything, but including electricity 
in our explanations, provides a much
more coherent view than using gravity
to explain everything. I personally think
as we try explaining how galaxies and Suns
behave, we will have to be open to including
other forms of energy that are 
beyond light and electricity.
I also want to remind us all that hubris
is one of the lowest places we can go to
intellectually. Hubris, a form of 
arrogance. This knowing that I'm right,
believing I have explained everything,
and then being offended when my
brilliance is questioned; believing
that human understanding can
penetrate the ultimate degrees of truth,
all this is hubris. And let none of us
fall to that level. And besides, hubris
makes us all quite boring and oh so tiresome.
In this truly exciting adventure, a lot of
what we are proposing might be totally wrong,
but I know that a lot of what has
been proposed is totally right,
more right than things have
been for many years in science.

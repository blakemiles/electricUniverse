Victory for one theory should
mean defeat for its rival.
A European Southern Observatory press
release boasts, “Pulsating Star Mystery
Solved” Cepheid variables
are stars whose rates of
pulsation vary with their
luminosities: the brighter the star,
the longer it takes to complete a
cycle of variability. It’s called
the period–luminosity relationship.
By timing the period of pulsation, the
absolute luminosity of the star can
be calculated. By comparing that quantity
with the star’s apparent brightness,
the star’s distance can be determined.
Edwin Hubble’s discovery of Cepheids
in the Andromeda galaxy in 1924 was
the key to proving that the “spiral nebulae,”
formerly thought to lie inside the
Milky Way, were actually independent
galaxies far outside the Milky Way. Until
now, two theories that predict properties
of Cepheids have been in conflict.
The press release explains: “Predictions
of their masses derived from the theory of
pulsating stars are
20–30% less than
predictions from the theory of the
evolution of stars. This embarrassing
discrepancy has been known since the 1960s.”
The newly discovered Cepheid is a member
of a binary system in which the two stars pass
in front of each other as seen from Earth.
This configuration enables astronomers
to measure not only variations in their
luminosities but also their orbital
velocities. From these measurements,
the stars’ masses can be determined
with unprecedented accuracy. The press
release states, “The mass of the Cepheid
is now known to about 1% and agrees
exactly with predictions from the
theory of stellar pulsation. However,
the larger mass predicted
by stellar evolution theory
was shown to be significantly in error.” Also
significant is this last result is passed
over without further comment.
One can presume that the aforementioned
“embarrassing discrepancy”
has paralyzed advocates’ abilities
for critical thinking. The discrepancy can
only be embarrassing for an
orthodoxy of belief which admits,
with false humility, that
Cepheids are “not fully understood.”
The admission thinly hides the
implied obverse that Cepheids are
“almost entirely understood,” a
scientific conceit rightly deserving
embarrassment. That the result
confirms the stellar pulsation theory
necessitates that it falsifies
the stellar evolution theory. If
astronomers were philosophically honest,
they would declare the theory nullified in
accordance with Karl Popper’s
1959 proposal of falsification
as a criterion to distinguish a
scientific theory from a pseudo-
scientific one. Falsification
was to be a “convention”
that required scientists to agree not to adjust
a theory to accommodate test results but,
when falsified, to start over with
searches for alternative theories.
Falsification is not a property of a theory
that justifies acquiescence in orthodoxy,
but a convention that enables
opportunities for discovery
of new theories and the
overthrow of conceptual
monopolies. But in view of past perform-
ance, stellar evolution theory will simply
be “adjusted.” A substantially different
theory will be put forward with the same name
in order to maintain the
illusion of continuity
and the cumulativeness of conceptual
progress. The only continuity will be the tenure
of advocates; the only cumulativeness
will be in their power and salaries.
The conceptual claim is fraud-
ulent. In the Electric Universe,
variations in luminosity are caused by
oscillations in the currents powering the
stars and are likely “atmospheric” effects.
Mass is proportional to the charge on a body
and may be unrelated to the oscillations
unless they deposit or remove charge.
The process is “hardly at all
understood” and is an opportunity
for discovery and development. When
Cepheids are used as indicators for the
distances to nearby galaxies, a necessary
assumption is that mass is invariant
throughout the universe. But if 
mass varies with charge, each
galaxy—and therefore each star in it—could 
have a different charge distribution with respect
to the intergalactic plasma. Each
galaxy could have an idiosyncratic
period-luminosity relationship for Cepheids,
rendering them unusable for determining
distances to other galaxies. Halton 
Arp’s discoveries of connections
between high-redshift quasars and
low-redshift active galaxies have already
brought “ultra-luminous” objects at
great distances back to being “normally
luminous” objects at much closer
distances. The objects may even be
“under-luminous” and located at nearby
distances. With both redshift and Cepheids
thrown into doubt, astronomers are left
with no reliable way to determine distances
to galaxies. Astronomy is 
once again open to new
fundamental insights. The
ornate knowledge with which the
Queen of the Sciences has 
proclaimed herself to be draped
is turning out to the invisible. Perhaps
she should not have paraded herself so far
down the street without an
alternative theory at hand.

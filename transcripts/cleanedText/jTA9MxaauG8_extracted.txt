Welcome to Space News from

For almost three years
on this channel,
we have reported on the
theory-shattering discoveries
from the European Space Agency's
Rosetta mission to Comet 67P.
While science media celebrated the first-ever
landing of a space probe on a comet nucleus,
the actual findings of the
mission ultimately falsified
the more than half century old,
"Dirty Snowball Comet" hypothesis.
Increasingly fine images
of the Comet's surface
provoked deeper and deeper expressions
of surprise from investigators.
The most notable surprise was that the comet
was, in the words of one ESA scientist,
"dry like hell" and its
rubble-strewn terrain
seem to bear a greater resemblance
to the American Southwest
than the slowly sublimating snowball
envisioned by Fred Whipple.
But proponents of the
Electric Universe theory,
as it is proposed by the chief
principals of The Thunderbolts Project,
were not surprised by the
geology of the comet nucleus.
The tortured and complex cometary terrain seems
to fit perfectly with the radical theory
that comets were excavated by electrical
discharges from planets and moons.
No geological feature on the comet was
more surprising than its sand dunes,
a planetary feature that is
thought to require an atmosphere
that can produce
mechanical winds.
The initial response of some scientists
around the world was borderline disbelief.
As planetary geologist and blogger Emily
Lakdawalla wrote in October 2014,
"Other features are odd because they look
familiar and yet have no right being on a comet.
I've called them 'rhythmic ridges' but to
pretty much everyone who looks at them,
they look like sand dunes.
Which are just plain impossible
on a body that has neither
atmosphere nor much of any gravity."
The comet's sand dunes
were not the only evidence
for the seemingly impossible
"winds" acting on the comet.
In fact, images revealed well
over a dozen rocks or boulders
which appeared to have so-called streaks
of wind trailing away from them.
ESA scientists first attempted to explain
these features by proposing that
the comet's jets were somehow creating
sufficient "winds" to transport dust material.
Investigators gave this
ad hoc theory the name,
"Localized Gas
Driven Transport."
Later, scientists proposed an
even more extreme process,
similar to saltation
in Earth geology.
Today, investigators are proposing
yet another strange process
to explain the
comet's sand dunes.
A Phys.org report describes the research
published in February of this year.
It states,
"The formation of sedimentary dunes requires
the presence of grains and of winds
that are strong enough to
transport them along the ground.
However, comets do not have a dense,
permanent atmosphere as on Earth.
Faced with this unexpected
finding, the researchers show
that there is in fact a wind
blowing along the comet's surface.
It is caused by the pressure
difference between the sunlit side,
where the surface ice can sublimate due
to the energy provided by the sunlight,
and the night side."
However, a scientific basis exists why
none of the strange mechanical processes
investigators have
proposed are necessary.
In the Electric Comet Theory, as proposed by the
chief principals of The Thunderbolts Project,
a comet's environment
is far more dynamic
than the standard "Dirty
Snowball" theory ever suggested.
It has always been the Electric
Universe position that electric fields,
acting on the comet nucleus, will shape
surface material in dramatic ways
that cannot be explained
in standard reasoning.
A powerful test of
this story came
with NASA's 2005 "Deep Impact"
mission to the Comet Tempel 1.
Mission scientists had believed
that the comet would only lose
about one third of a meter
of depth in each orbit.
But when the Stardust's next spacecraft
reimaged the Tempel 1 nucleus in 2010,
it found that the wall of a prominent
mesa had retreated about 35 meters.
The astonishing
excavation of material
was precisely focused at the location
of mysterious pixel saturations;
which, according to proponents
of the Electric Universe,
was the focal point
of electrical arcs.
A key point about the sand
dunes on the Comet 67P
is that ESA scientists have
confirmed that the dunes are active
and are seen to change over
a period of 16 months.
This follows previous reports of astonishingly
rapid changes on the Comet's surface.
In September of 2016, scientists reported
that, over a period of six weeks,
they witnessed mysterious erosional
markings appearing and expanding
at rates exponentially faster than
predicted by standard comet theory.
As one mission scientist stated,
"These spectacular changes are
proceeding extremely rapidly,
with the rims of the features expanding
by a few tens of centimeters per hour.
This highlights the complexity of
the physical processes involved."
These discoveries confirm an explicit
prediction from an earlier Space News episode,
which stated that electric
fields, acting on the comet,
would reconfigure surface material
with unexpected rapidity.
Electrical activity could profoundly
reconfigure the dust layers
in the course of the
next few months.
Electric fields acting on the comet
can also produce ionic winds,
similar to those produced
by air purifiers.
In this series; we have
repeatedly referred
to the experimental research
of Billy Yelverton,
who has produced countless familiar
geological features including sand dunes,
simply by applying electric fields to
plates of dust and other materials.
It's especially puzzling that
scientists continue to propose
strange exotic mechanisms to explain
winds acting on the comet's surface.
When increasingly mainstream research confirms
tenets of the electrical interpretation.
As noted in the previous
Space News episode;
a recent NASA-funded study affirmed
that electrostatic dust transportation
occurs on airless
bodies in space,
and is responsible for many
heretofore puzzling features
on planets, moons,
comets and asteroids.
A Phys.org report on the study
states for the findings,
"[They] bring closure to a long-standing
issue of electrostatic dust transport,
explaining a variety of unusual phenomena on
the surfaces of airless planetary bodies,
including observations from the Apollo era
to the recent Rosetta comet mission."
The article continues,
"The movement of electrons in the
tiny spaces between dust particles
can generate surprisingly
strong charges and forces,
which can lift and move dust
particles off the ground.
In addition to single particles,
clusters of dust were lofted,
which showed that electrostatic processes may
be responsible for the Rosetta detection
of fluffy dust particles released
from the surface of Comet 67P.
These laboratory observations
reveal that dusty surfaces
can become smooth due
to dust mobilization
and could help explain
the 'dust ponds'
like those seen on asteroid
Eros and Comet 67P..."
Unfortunately, it seems that countless
assumptions about our solar system
and the universe as a
whole continue to endure
even in the face of
revolutionary discoveries.
The assumption of charge neutrality
in space has been refuted.
Comets discharge electrically because
they experience voltage spikes,
passing through regions
of changing potential.
And the assumption that comets
are icy primordial leftovers
from the solar system's infancy 4.5
billion years ago is now also refuted.
Indeed, regardless of how comets form,
the comet's environment is so dynamic.
How could one possibly hope to accurately
document the comet's history and origins,
tracing back a
billion plus years?
The Rosetta comet mission was a
remarkable technological feat
and a historic
human achievement.
Yet, how will history judge institutional
science and its enduring beliefs
about one of nature's greatest
mysteries, the comet?

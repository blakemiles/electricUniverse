The James Webb Space Telescope has been
sending images to Earth since July 2022
and has already delivered a startling
finding: seeing galaxies orders of magnitude
brighter in the early Universe than
astronomers had anticipated.
The Webb telescope was designed to see
deeper into the infrared spectrum of
light than the Hubble Space Telescope.
Infrared light does not get as scattered
by dust and filament clouds as does the
visible light spectrum. Consequently,
photographs of deep space, using the
infrared spectrum, reveal many more
stars hiding in the haze of outer space.
Additionally, there is a redshift factor.
The older the galaxy, the faster it is moving
away from us, making the Doppler effect
on the light waves coming from deep space,
stronger the faster the receding velocity is.
The Doppler effect is familiar to us in the
change of pitch of a train's horn as it passes by.
As the train moves away from us, the
sound waves are stretched out, making the
horn's tone lower. In the case of light,
the Doppler effect lowers the received
light frequency towards the red end of
the visible spectrum, and if pronounced
enough, into the invisible infrared part of the 
spectrum. In order to photograph galaxies that are
so old that the redshift has moved to
visible light wave spectral lines into
the infrared range, the telescope’s mirror
and imaging chips are engineered to be
sensitive to red light and rays that our eyes 
can't see. In the standard model of cosmology,
evolutionary cosmologists say the first stars formed 400
million years after the so-called Big Bang and the first
galaxies then formed a few hundred
million years later. High redshift values
are a measure of the age of a galaxy, and
the degree of shift that the Webb telescope
is showing, implies that the galaxies
existed 180 million years or less after
the Big Bang, a clear violation of the
theory. A galaxy of 180 million years old
is considered young in a universe that is believed to be
over 13 billion years old. Following Webb's findings that
surprisingly mature galaxies are located 
in a very young part of the universe,
theorists and observers have been
scrambling to explain them. Reaching back
to a comparatively young 180 million
years after the theoretical Big Bang, the
telescope found some galaxies with large
fully formed disk-like structures that
were not expected to exist so early in cosmic history.
Stacy McGaugh, cosmologist Case Western
Reserve University, was quoted in the
September 14, 2022 Scientific American
saying, “We should see lots of these
little protogalactic fragments that have
not yet merged to make a big galaxy. Instead,
we're seeing a few things that are already big galaxies.”
Early proto-galaxies are expected to be
small, dim, and thinly populated fuzzy
blobs of stars, but what is seen are
fully formed and evolved galaxies, well
defined with spiral arms, and many times
the size and energy of our Milky Way galaxy.
The Einsteinian gravity-fed Standard
Model of the Universe's evolution is
falling under the wheels of increasing
observational resolution factors, greater
levels of detail from which to extract
predictive patterns. This is science in
action, doing what it is supposed to do,
make new discoveries, not validate old ideas.
This is the Platonic underpinning of
scientific method, the replacement of old
hypotheses by new and better ones.
When science refuses to be updated, it
ceases to be science and begins to resemble an
authoritarian cult, a collection of fetishes.
Mainstream astronomers, instead of being
excited about new discovery, act like
they were caught flat-footed and not at
all happy about a 10 billion dollar
investment that appears to have paid off.
When Michael Boylan Kolchin, theoretical
astrophysicists, University of Texas Austin
said in Science Journal, 12 August 2022,
”No one was expecting anything like this.”
One can only ask, why the heck not. The
entire point of science is to toss obsolete ideas
into the dustbin of history. This is precisely what
scientists should be prepared to expect.
It is unsure whether current galaxy
formation models need a revision, or
abandonment. One can only marvel at the
kluging of band-aid concepts to paper
over observations that were unexpected.
The invocation of dark matter and dark
energy in the face of the failure of
Einsteinian empty space to account for
the high rotational speeds of galaxies,
seems more like a parlor conjurer’s
’rabbit in a hat-trick’ than a science
eager for a better understanding, even if
it dynamites cherished canards like the
Big Bang Theory and black holes.
Models hold that gas clouds should be
far slower to coalesce into stars and
galaxies than is suggested by the Webb’s
galaxy-rich images of the early universe,
less than 500 million years after the Big Bang.
In questioning the validity of Big Bang,
Paul J. Steinhardt, Professor of physics,
Director of the Princeton Center for
theoretical science in Scientific
American, September 28, 2017, calls for
reconsideration of the cosmic inflation
theory, or Big Bang as it has come to be
known. He states, “The cosmology community
has not taken a cold, honest look at the
Big Bang inflationary theory or paid
significant attention to critics who
question whether inflation happened.”
But even before the experts could start
incorporating the Webb telescope data
into their interpretive frameworks when
the first Webb telescope pictures were
only days old, astronomers from the
University of Edinburgh in Scotland,
announced that they had found a galaxy
with the incredible value of 17z. That
value would indicate that this galaxy
had a redshift of 17, which would mean
this galaxy existed only 220 million
years after the Big Bang. The galaxy
CEERS-1749, but popularly called
Schrodinger's Galaxy, shows in addition
to its unusual age, a huge mass which means
that there are a lot of stars in the galaxy.
So, the oldest galaxy in the universe is
anything but a small cluster of stars
that might have formed shortly after the
Big Bang. With 5 billion solar masses,
Schrodinger's Galaxy is about five times
more massive than our Milky Way.
Schrodinger's also exhibits an enormous
luminosity. The galaxy’s brightness is much
too high for one that existed only 220
million years after the Big Bang.
Tomamaso Treu, Professor of physics, UC
Santa Barbara, echoes the consensus of
consternation when he said in the October
2022 Astrophysical Journal Letters,
”Somehow, the universe has managed to form
galaxies faster and earlier than we thought.”
The Webb telescope images from NASA also
unexpectedly reveal for the first time
barred spiral galaxies located at a time
when the universe was a mere 25 percent
of its present age. Barred spiral
galaxies, similar to our Milky Way, are
considered to be a mature, not a young
galaxy type, in fact to have evolved from
normal spiral galaxies, making them an 
older and more evolved galaxy type.
Garth Illingworth, Professor of Astronomy
and Astrophysics, UC Santa Cruz, in the 9
August 2022 issue of Science Journal,
exclaimed, ”This is way outside the box of what
models were predicting.” One can only hope that
the new box Illingsworth and his colleagues are
busily constructing, will be one capable of expansion.
It will be interesting to see how the
’engine of orthodoxy’ integrates this new
data which is very recent, and not fully
metabolized by the ‘ivory tower’. Whatever the outcome,
it is certain that the cosmological discourse will
gravitate away from Einstein's ‘space-is- empty’
gravity model. Since that hypothesis has been defended
for decades as unquestionable truth by
the vast majority of cosmological
theorists, the new data is causing these theorists
to panic. Based on the published literature right
now, the Big Bang makes 15 wrong
predictions, and only one right one,
the abundance of deuterium, an isotope of 
hydrogen. In the 27 July, 2022 Nature Journal,
Alison Kirkpatrick, Assistant Professor,
Department of Physics and Astronomy,
University of Kansas, Lawrence, appears to
be not having much luck wrapping her
head around the new Webb data.
Quote, “Right now I find myself lying
awake at three in the morning and wondering
if everything I've done is wrong....”
Dr. Sabine Hossenfelder, Research Fellow,
Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies,
has been wondering the same thing. Even
before the Webb data entered the fray in
this panel discussion from 2021
sponsored by The Institute of Art and
Ideas.  “...and that's exactly what I mean
when I say we have a problem with theory
development. Because you have all these
theorists, they literally guess their
models and it just leads nowhere. And I really think
that theoretical physicists have to have a hard look at
their methods of theory development,
and throughout what didn't work. We talk
about the scientific method as if it was
a fixed thing. But it's a living and
evolving thing and what counts as good
science at one point in history,
might no longer count as good science a hundred
years later.” Dr. Hossenfelder is an example of a
scientist doing what they should all be
doing: protecting the scientific method
and its process of hypothesis formation.
Will this predictive failure of the
accepted cosmology reinvigorate discussion towards
alternative cosmologies? What I mean specifically are
the steady state theories of William
Duncan MacMillan, Hermann Bondi, Thomas
Gold and Fred Hoyle. And of course,
the Electric Universe model of Wal
Thornhill, Don Scott, Dave Talbot, Ev
Cochrane, Dwardu Cardona, Michael
Armstrong and Mel Atchison, to name a few.
Perhaps a cosmology of the future is
already here, although not yet acknowledged in the
mainstream. The field is entirely wide open for
those curious enough to invest the energy to think.
The EU model of cosmology represents a
change in the categories of astrophysics,
and most important the methodology of
thought, which must drill these new ideas into
the lockstep mind of conventional science.

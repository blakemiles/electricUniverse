You've just entered the
theater of an alien sky.
If the words and images seem strange
to you, there's a reason for this.
Our world was once a
vastly different place.
To experience this won't hurt you
and there is nothing to fear.
Sekhmet: The Ranging Eye of Ra
Throughout this video series we've claimed
that the origins of world mythology,
ancient symbolism
and magical rites
lie in human memories of
extraordinary natural events.
It was from the emerging
commemorative practices
that the ancient civilizations
themselves arose.
And so we've repeatedly emphasized
that the reconstruction offered here
is far too specific to allow us to make
up stories or to make up explanations.
The evidence will either
be there in unique detail
that the reconstruction demands
or it will not be there.
Our explanation lies in a congregation
of planets gathered close to the earth
long before the rise of
observational astronomy.
And that means before any of these
bodies were even named as planets.
We've called this celestial
formation The Polar Configuration
and we've identified many of its varying
forms as electric discharge activity
between these bodies.
Extraordinary events in the sky provoked
an explosion of human imagination,
now discoverable as story content
within every ancient culture.
In the course of these presentations it
should also become clear that no archetype,
no global theme could ever be explained
by natural events in our own time.
Things occurring today provide
no referent whatsoever.
The impact of this human experience requires
that we follow the instincts of a detective,
noting things too
consistently out of place.
And we must never forget that
the more unusual the detail,
the more compelling is the
improbable convergence of testimony.
Our claim is that the link
of the mythic archetypes
to the evolution of the
polar configuration
requires that we uncover the concrete
reference beneath the imaginative symbols.
Amongst the cross-cultural
points of agreement
is the repeated identity of the
mother goddess as the planet Venus.
This identity is not
just worth following,
it is a window to a
mind-altering human experience,
a story that reverberated through
history for thousands of years.
The paradoxical identity of the
mother goddess with life itself,
her role as the great protectress,
but also as a world destroyer,
can only be explained at the level of
concrete origins beneath that symbolism.
The discharge streamers of Venus and
effusion of mythic power and glory
were the animating
life of heaven
seen in mythic terms as the luminous
heart and soul of the universal power
we've identified as Saturn.
But the connection runs in two directions
since the discharging sphere of Venus
was also interpreted as the protective
shield of the warrior God, named as Mars,
who occupied the impenetrable spot as if
protected from the sky darkening clouds
or celestial armies of chaos.
When the heavens fell into disorder, the
sky itself became a mythic battlefield.
Swarms of debris, seen as rebelling
hordes, appeared to overtake the world.
It was in this context that the most active
and spectacular form of the goddess emerged,
affecting every ancient culture's ideas about the
meaning of war, conquest and magical defense.

But was the goddess a divine weapon
launched against rebelling powers
or was she herself the provocation,
the feared destroyer of cosmic order?
Human imagination would stand
in competition for millennia
but more fundamental than the
interpretation was the underlying event
and our purpose here is to see the events
through the lens of global patterns.
Ironically, it is the
competing interpretations
that confirm both the patterns and
the events that provoked them.
Confirmation comes wherever,
without the underlying event,
the global patterns would not be
conceivable, not even be possible.
Egypt: "The Destruction
of Mankind"
In the presence of the goddess' visible
power, enemies were scattered.
Dark clouds of chaos gave way
to a blast of fire and light.
The rebelling hordes of heaven
fled from its onslaught.
One of the most dramatic illustrations
of this archetypal theme
is the Egyptian legend called
The Destruction of Mankind.
The myth says that the
primeval sun god Ra
had grown aged and perhaps
a bit weary of humanity.
It recounts how, in that remote
time, the children of Ra
had rebelled against the god.
In response to the rebellion,
Ra sent out his powerful eye
to take vengeance on a
disrespectful world.
The agent of the conflagration that
followed was the goddess Sekhmet.
Not just a goddess, Sekhmet
was the far-famed eye of Ra,
the Utchat, the giver of life
and the great protectress,
the very heart and soul of
the primeval sun himself.
Egypt: The Eye of Ra (Utchat)
as the goddess Sekhmet
Enigmatically, Sekhmet also possessed
both a leonine and a serpentine form,
a remarkable parallel to the
Sumerian Venus goddess Inanna,
who displayed the same forms in her
role as the terrifying radiance
in the center of the god An, the
overarching ruler of the sky.
This is no coincidence,
these mythic forms reveal no
relationship whatsoever to today's sky
but they are not
accidental, not random
and they direct our attention to
the archetype of the great comet,
the human experience from which the
female comet archetype descended.
The comet as the eye, heart
and soul of a great king.
Comet as a star with disordered
hair or leonine mane.
Comet as a cosmic serpent
and the comet as a sign or an
agent of world destruction.
And so we find a remarkable
juxtaposition of comet attributes
in the titles of the
Egyptian goddess Sekhmet,
called the Beautiful Eye
of the primeval sun.
She was the Great Flame or Flaming
One, the Destroyer by Fire,
the Destroyer of Rebellions,
the Rulerof Serpents
and the Ruler of Lions.
Strangely, all of the well documented
goddesses in Egypt were like Sekhmet,
called the eye of Ra,
suggesting an underlying identity entirely
outside natural experience today.
And no goddess figure
in ancient Egypt
tells this story of the sun god's
eye more vividly than Sekhmet
whose very name derives
from the root Khem
signifying a blast of glory or majesty, the
essential character of the eye-goddess.
Sekhmet entered the conflagration
displaying a trail of fire.
The texts say, "Behold
me, men and gods!
I have come into being as the
Lady of Glorious Appearings....
my flame is behind me.
It is a flame which drives
away on its account.
The tip of its flame crosses
the land from the sky...:
No one at all can approach her, the
streams behind her are flames of fire."
In fact, the Egyptian traditions
constitute a remarkable parallel
to Sumerian descriptions of a
world in fear and trembling
at the tempestuous radiance of
Inanna, identified as Venus.
Sumerian Inanna (Venus) with her
foot on her alter ego, the lion
Precisely the same way, Sekhmet appeared
as a flame of fire in her tempest,
instilling terror on Earth and
threatening to destroy the world.
"I am mistress of the flame",
the goddess announces,...
"The fear of me is in their hearts and
the awe of me is in their hearts.
The flame makes
his enemies fall.
It is a flame moving before the wind
of the sky to the end of the earth."
Surely it is no coincidence
that the great flame in heaven,
taking the form of
a fiery serpent,
found its symbolic place on
the crown of kings in Egypt,
exactly as we've seen
in ancient Mesopotamia.
It was the headgear of the king
that reflected the protective role
of the explosive majesty
most dramatically.
In later times, when Egyptian
armies confronted foreign nations,
these peoples were seen as
barbarians outside the gate,
they were the terrestrial counterparts
of the primeval chaos themes
and so the king invariably called
upon the shining majesty of Ra,
remembering how the eye-
goddess, in her rage,
had destroyed rebelling powers
in the sky in former times.
In considering this theme, the critical
steps will require comparative analysis
of an incontrovertible
historical pattern.
The ancient story of the goddess
says the explosive glory of heaven
was the story of
the great comet.
In this experience we find the
origins of the astronomical language
and symbolism of comets around the
world, there is no other explanation.
And so too, the attributes
of the celestial glory
are the defining attributes of the
planet Venus as mother goddess.
And as we continue our series,
this truth can be verified
in the astronomical lexicon of every
well-documented culture in ancient times.
In their essential details, the
global story of the great comet
is the story of
the planet Venus.
Always look for the
underlying form!

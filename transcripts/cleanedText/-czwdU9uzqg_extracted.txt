It's an iconic image symbolizing
the sum of Mankind's deepest fears,
the specter of an enormous rocky 
body impacting our planet.
In popular fiction, including
best-selling books and
blockbuster movies, the notion of a
planet-destroying asteroid on a
trajectory to Earth's orbit is routinely
presented as not just possible,
but ultimately inevitable.
Planetary scientists have
told us for many decades
that a giant meteoritic impact caused
the extinction of the dinosaurs and
should be regarded, along with
anthropogenic global warming, as the
greatest threat to the futurity
of our planet and species.
In fact, in recent months,
numerous science headlines have
emphasized the urgency with which many
scientists perceive this threat.
June 30th of this year marked the annual
celebration of Asteroid Day, and science
websites marked the occasion by arguing
the need for greater funding for
planetary defense.
It appears that this posture has
greatly impacted public opinion.
According to a recent poll by
The Associated Press and the NORC
Center for Public Affairs Research,
Americans now say that the number one
priority for the U.S. space program
should be defense against asteroids,
comets, and meteors.
However, behind the perceived
threat that asteroids and
other cosmic intruders pose, are numerous
beliefs that have remained unchallenged,
since even prior to the Space Age, the
notion of an enormous Rock slamming into
our planet is indeed very frightening.
After all, the surfaces of rocky planets
and moons in our solar system are
absolutely riddled with craters, which,
according to mainstream science are the
result of countless kinetic
impacts over eons of time.
However, as we will see, for decades
science discovery has demanded
an entirely new way of seeing so-called
'impact craters' as well as the origin and
nature of comets, asteroids, and
meteoroids, and the history and future of
our own planet.
Let us consider first what we should
actually expect if an object
such as an asteroid or comet closely
encounters a planet.
On only two occasions in
modern times, scientists
have had the opportunity to
anticipate such an event.
In 1994, when the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9
approached the planet Jupiter,
and again in 2014, when the comet
Siding Spring approached Mars.
In both instances, the actual observed
interactions between the comet and
planet were so unexpected, they should
have forced a reassessment of the very
foundations of Comet theory.
Prior to Shoemaker-Levy 9's encounter with
Jupiter, some astronomers predicted that
the fragments of the comet were too
small to have any significant effect
when they hit the gas giant planet.
The Comet's co-discoverer, the late Eugene
Shoemaker stated, "There's a chance we
will see very little."
Likewise, the renowned astronomer
Brian Marsden stated,
"It's going to be tough to see much.
I don't think there's going to
be a very large explosion."
But as we have repeatedly 
outlined on this series,
the comet's apparent electromagnetic
influence on the Jovian environment was
vastly more dramatic than Standard
Theory can ever explain.
The anomalies included unusual
and energetic auroral
activity, immediately after the
"impact of the largest comet fragment" as
well as the disruption and amazing
brightening of radiation belts and
unexpected X-ray emissions.
As Michael Klein of JPL
stated in an analysis of
the event, "Never in 
23 years of Jupiter
observations have we seen such a rapid
and intense increase in radio emission...
Extra electrons were supplied by a
source which is a mystery."
In contrast, what planetary
scientists had actually
expected was that dust debris from the
comet would cause the radiation belts to dim.
Satellites tracking the comet
fragments unveiled yet another mystery.
Some so-called collisions that 
were projected to occur
just beyond Jupiter's limb, which should
have been invisible to all but the
Galileo spacecraft, were seen by
telescopes on our own planet.
As NASA's Dr. Andrew Ingersoll
stated at the time,
"In effect we are apparently seeing
something we didn't think we had any
right to see."
In other words, the electric comet
theory would predict dramatic
discharge activity high in Jupiter's
ionosphere prior to the comet fragments
striking the 
upper atmosphere.
And this is exactly 
what was observed.
The electrical nature of the event was
confirmed by the 3,000 kilometer high
vertical jets seen above Jupiter's
clouds, which then fell back to the
planet to form these mysterious
crescent-shaped dark features.
Simply put, the error is 
to view both the planet
Jupiter and approaching 
comet fragments
as electrically inert.
The electrical nature of the
event is at least partly
affirmed by the data from NASA's Juno
mission to the gas giant, including the
discovery of electrical potentials in
the millions of electron volts which
drive Jupiter's aurorae, and a vastly more
powerful magnetosphere than standard
theory had ever imagined.
The Electric Universe theory
has always stated that
most comet activity comes from the comet
which acquires a "negative charge
with respect to its environment in its
outer reaches of the solar system,
discharging electrically as it enters a
more positively charged domain."
In the case of Shoemaker-Levy 9, when it
encountered the incredible magnetosphere
of the planet Jupiter, the discharges
were unusually catastrophic.
Similar lessons can be gleaned
from comet Siding
Spring's encounter with Mars.
NASA's MAVEN spacecraft
measured the effects of the
comet on the Martian atmosphere.
According to a NASA report, "Debris
from the comet added a temporary and
very strong layer of ions to the
ionosphere, the electrically charged
layer high above Mars."
MAVEN team member Jared Espley 
said of the comet's stunning
influence, "We think the encounter blew
away part of Mars's upper atmosphere,
much like a strong solar storm would... The
main action took place during the comet's
closest approach, but the planet's
magnetosphere began to feel some effects
as soon as it entered the outer
edge of the comet's coma."
In fact, the Electric Universe prediction
of a negatively charged comet dust tail
was recently confirmed.
In late 2018, scientists
studying the "weird
striations" in the dust tail of comet
Mcnaught, were amazed to conclude that
the dust is "electrically charged,"
and its motion is dramatically 
affected by the solar wind.
Of course, even though some asteroids
have occasionally, and to the complete
surprise of space scientists, produced
cometary displays including collimated
jets, they are not typically nearly as
electrically dynamic as comets, nor does
our own planet have nearly the
electromagnetic energies seen at a gas
giant such as Jupiter.
Yet in our electric universe, any intruding body
that enters our planet's atmosphere from
far away will be differently charged and
can thus discharge electrically.
Testimony to this fact can be seen in the 
dramatic flaring and explosion of a meteor.
In fact, in recent years
mainstream science has begun to
recognize the electromagnetic phenomena
intrinsic to meteoritic displays.
This includes the unusual radiophonic noise
that eye witnesses have reported for
many centuries in association 
with meteor sightings.
While mainstream science still
imagines that a meteor's
bright glare, flaring, and disintegration
is the result of chemical ablation and
atmospheric pressure and heating, abundant
evidence suggests these phenomena also
involve electrical discharge activity.
As argued in a 2005 Thunderbolts article by
Michael Armstrong and Jim Payette, on the
famous Peekskill meteor, "One proposed
explanation, with which the Electric
Universe would agree, is that meteors
trigger the formation of instabilities
in plasma layers. The energy of the
flickering and flaring, as well as of the
low-frequency radiation, comes more from
the ionospheric plasma than from the
meteoroid. The meteors 
that we've come to
think of as 'burning up 
in the atmosphere'
may instead be the targets of mini-
thunderbolts from the ionosphere."
In fact, this viewpoint finds
support in the most
renowned meteor explosion
in modern times.
In 1908, in a remote region of
Central Siberia, a blue-white fireball,
which some described as brighter than
the Sun, exploded with the force of a 10
to 15 Megaton hydrogen bomb.
The explosion felled some 60 million
trees across an area of 2,000 square
kilometers; yet some trees 
near the blast center
were not burnt and a ring of burnt trees
circling the epicenter was left standing.
The thunderous sounds were accompanied
by a shock wave to knock people off
their feet and broke windows
hundreds of kilometers away.
The explosion registered on seismic
stations across Europe and
Asia, and as far away as Britain
meteorologists registered fluctuations
in atmospheric pressure.
The resulting pulse of air
pressure circled the Earth
twice, and astronomers observed for
several nights afterwards a glowing red
haze in the upper atmosphere, but they
were not aware of the cause at the time.
Curiously, as noted in the Australian
Journal of Astronomy in 1993, the Sir
Douglas Mawson expedition in Antarctica
reported an extensive auroral display a
few hours before the Tunguska event.
Many historical accounts also exist of
strange weather including lightning and
thunder and even seismic activity well
before the devastating explosion.
Despite occasional claims to the contrary,
no impact crater for the intruding body has
ever been found nor the remains of an
impactor, though some have occasionally
claimed to have discovered 
Tunguska meteorite fragments.
Nevertheless, Tunguska remains
officially classified
as the largest impact event 
ever recorded on Earth.
In our Electric Universe, the
energy released from an
intruding comet, asteroid or meteor, is
not limited by its mass and kinetic
energy but also the electrical energy
due to its charge differential with Earth.
This viewpoint also finds support
in the largest meteor explosion to have
happened on Earth since Tunguska.
In 2013, in Russia, initial 
estimates coming from the
Russian Academy of Sciences stated that
the space rock weighed only about 10 tons.
However, based on infrasound data
from as far away as Greenland and Africa,
the rock's estimated size 
increased by about 1000 times.
In other words, the actual 
energies produced in the event
were exponentially higher than the
visual evidence would have suggested.
Although the explosion shattered windows
and produced other structural damage, and
many hundreds of human beings were injured,
not a single person was killed in the event.
From the Electric Universe
perspective, intruding comets and
asteroids do indeed pose 
a threat to human life,
but the havoc these bodies might wreak
will likely be limited to localized disasters,
perhaps a series of Tunguska-
like events producing regional
devastation with falls
of sand and dust.
Perhaps electrical craters, fires, and
earthquakes, but not necessarily any
single impact crater at all.
Indeed, we cannot overemphasize the need 
for planetary scientists to completely
reassess the theory of
planetary cratering.
The craters we see on planetary
surfaces routinely defy impact theory.
Instead, we see unique forms that
have been reproduced in decades of
laboratory experiments with electrical
discharge; including crater chains, weird
hexagonal craters, craters with
concentric circles, impossibly huge
craters, aligned craters, and 
so-called bull's-eye craters.
The massively cratered surfaces
we see on rocky bodies
like the Moon, Mercury, and the dwarf
planet Ceres, were not the result of
periodic impacts over eons of time.
We have proposed they were the result of
interplanetary electrical discharges in
a relatively recent epoch
of planetary instability.
Ironically, it was these
catastrophic events recorded in
prehistory which embedded in human
consciousness the fear of Doomsday's
inevitable reoccurrence.
But in our Electric Universe, the utterly
hopeless projections of Standard
Cosmology,
from our Sun's nuclear fuel extinguishing
and the Sun collapsing, to the ultimate
fate of the Universe, ending in a big
freeze or heat death, to a giant space
rock smashing into our planet and
obliterating human life; are not only not
inevitable, they have little to no
scientific foundation at all.
In our Electric Universe, doomsday is a
traumatic memory in need of healing, and
the future of Mankind, planet Earth, and
indeed the entire Universe, remains
unwritten.

Welcome to Space News from
the Electric Universe,
brought to you by The
Thunderbolts Project™
at Thunderbolts.info.
In a recent Space News episode, we
began the first of a series of reports
that challenge the very underpinnings
of consensus scientific theory
on the nature of stars,
including our own Sun.
Ever finer technological data continues
to provide increasing opportunities
to test the respective predictions
of the Electric Universe theory
versus those of the
Institutional Science.
As Wal Thornhill explains in the
first of this two-part episode,
new discoveries all point
toward the perhaps
inevitable confirmation of
the Electric Star theory.
Scientists don't
understand stars.
Not a single feature of
the Sun is predictable,
based on the standard
model of the Sun.
We can't see inside the Sun except for a peep
through the holes punched in the photosphere
we call sunspots
and there we don't see energy trying
to escape from inside the Sun.
It's cooler down there.
That's why the
sun-spots appear dark.
But as usual, a model once adopted
as a standard becomes a belief.
Stars are believed to be isolated
thermonuclear campfires in the sky
that eventually burn out.
All data must be fitted somehow to
the model or discarded as an error.
The operative word is "somehow."
No alternative
model is possible.
That is how we, fallible mortals,
apply the scientific method.
Many who are familiar with the
Electric Universe have said to me
they can't watch
astronomy programs
because the blatant
misinformation makes them angry.
The programs begin with a litany of
"facts", most of which are baseless.
For example, a popular online lecture
in physics enthuses, and I quote,
"A star is born when nuclear
fusion ignites and produces heat.
The star is formed first when
matter falls in gravitationally,
matter attracts each other, and falls in and
heats up to tens of millions of degrees
― then nuclear fusion produces
energy and the star is born.
Our sun was born about
5 billion years ago."
So goes the myth!
There is not a single
fact in any of this.
It ignores the recent evidence of
stars being born in molecular clouds
along glowing current filaments.
It doesn't match the story!
The discovery shows dust and
gas is efficiently scavenged
over many light-years towards
the current filament.
Unlike weak
gravitational collapse
which is limited in range and directed
radially inwards, towards a center of mass.
Any rotation of the cloud inhibits gravitational
collapse, giving time for the heat,
generated by matter spiraling
inwards, to be radiated away.
Nuclear fusion in stellar
cores, composed somehow
of the lightest element hydrogen,
is the improbable claimed result.
The fusion model of stellar energy was
grasped at, more than a century ago,
simply because it seemed like the
only option for an isolated star
producing prodigious energy
for unimaginable time spans.
Yet, as our project manager and chief
engineer of the SAFIRE experiment,
which is designed to test an electrical
model of stars, pointed out,
"The steady shining of countless stars
in the night sky requires they be lit
by a simple controlled process."
The hydrogen bomb model applied to stars
is not simple, stable or testable.
If it were the answer, a night sky
should resemble a fireworks show.
Meanwhile, our experimental attempts to
force nature to conform to our beliefs
have led nowhere in the
quest for fusion power
― like the Sun.―
Clearly, scientists
don't understand stars;
their birth, how they shine
and their supposed death.
Recent reports highlight
this obvious fact.
Phys.org's reported on September
12 last year and I quote,
"Stars form within the dense regions
of diffuse molecular clouds,
but the physical processes
that determine the locations,
rate, and efficiency of star
formation are poorly understood.
Recent thinking envisions an
approximate two-step process:
first, a network of dense filaments
form, due to large scale turbulence,
and then fragmentation into cores
occurs as gravity starts to dominate.
In the dense gas, the structure
formation is affected by motions
induced primarily
by three processes:
supersonic turbulence, self-gravity,
and magnetic fields."
The words "Poorly understood" are
code for, "We have no idea."
There is no known way that supersonic
turbulence and magical magnetic fields
can produce the many light-years
long, constant-width,
glowing filaments and their
structured magnetic fields.
Astrophysicists are ignorant of Hannes
Alfven's prediction, made decades ago,
that stars would be formed
precisely that way,
by powerful scavenging of matter
along magnetically pinched
galactic current filaments
inside molecular clouds.
The reason given by
one astrophysicist;
"We know there's electricity in
space but it doesn't do anything."
Such is the dysfunction of
narrow specialism in science.
So a star is not formed when
matter falls in gravitationally
and matter doesn't fall in and heat
up to tens of millions of degrees.
The electrical accretion process
stratifies elements radially,
according to their
ionization potential.
It produces cool cores of heavy
elements, like beads on a string.
But nuclear fusion in a cool,
heavy element core is impossible.
So it makes far more sense that stars
are a cosmic electrical phenomenon
involving their photospheres.
Fusion occurs on the
Sun, not in it!
All stars produce the heavy elements seen
in their spectra by warm plasma fusion
and neutron capture in
their photo- spheres.
In contrast of the brute force
approach of particle physicists
requiring incredible pressure
and millions of degrees.
Earlier in May last year, there
appeared a groundbreaking paper
in the journal Astronomy
And Astrophysics,
which showed a slingshot effect in a
star-birthing filament of the Orion Nebula.
These glowing filaments snake
about inside the nebula
like the radiant filaments
in novelty plasma balls.
The stars are formed while
moving with the filament
but as the star gets more
massive it is slung out,
ready formed and switched on as the
glowing filament accelerates away.
This may help explain the
size limit of stars.
Stars are the electromagnetic
offspring of electric galaxies.
So nearby stars have rotation axes
that line up closely with each other
because they are all spun up along the
same, rotating, electrical umbilical cord,
known as a Birkeland Current.
Do we have evidence for the alignment of
spinning stars born in the same event?
Yes we do, and as usual it
has mystified researchers.
On March 14th this year, John Ross in the
Australian national newspaper reported,
"Australian astronomers studying
stars' internal upheavals
have opened a new fault line in theories
about the universe's formation.
Researchers monitoring 'starquakes'
― the stellar equivalent of earthquakes ―
have found a startling symmetry in dozens
of swollen stars known as red giants.
The findings open a new mystery around
the formation of clusters of stars
from swirling clouds
of molecules and gas.
Co-author Dennis Stello said these gas
clouds rotated on their own internal axes.
Astronomers had assumed the initial
spin orientation would become scrambled
by the colossal turbulence generated when
they coalesced into families of stars."
"The results were
unexpected," said Dr. Stello.
"We found that the spins of most of the
stars were aligned with each other.
Previously it had been assumed
that massive turbulence
would have scrambled the rotational energy
of the clouds where the stars were born,
and prevented this alignment."
This statement shows characteristic
blindness toward earlier evidence
that also doesn't fit the
accepted story of star birth.
So the published paper doesn't refer
to the filamentary star-birth paper,
where the answer to the
mystery clearly lies.
Specialists tend to ignore other
specialists, even in their own field,
when findings are off the
edges of their belief map.
Such is the dysfunctional
state of modern science.

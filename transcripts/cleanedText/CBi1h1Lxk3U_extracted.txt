Newton, Einstein, Darwin and the
other early explorers of science,
discovered the new world of
fundamental laws of reality
and the scientists will come
after them are mere colonists.
Continuing this line of thought,
John Horgan writes in the end of science
that the late comers have only two choices,
to apply those fundamental discoveries in
the construction of derivative theories
or "...to pursue science in a
speculative post empirical mode
that I call ironic science...
Ironic science offers points of view,
opinions, which are, at best, interesting,
which provoke further a comment.
But it doesn't
converge on the truth.
It cannot achieve empirically verifiable
surprises that forced scientists
to make substantial revisions in
their basic description of reality."
Horgan classifies most modern
theories as ironic science.
Super string theory
and the inflationary Big Bang,
and punctuated equilibrium.
This interesting opinion provokes me
to make a couple of further comments
a "basic description" of reality is not
the same thing as fundamental laws.
Fundamental laws or generalities
reality is concrete.
A description of reality
asserts among other things
which fundamental law applies
in which real situation.
Between the laws and reality
lies the description
in which scientists select
which laws to apply.
The accepted description
of reality in astronomy
asserts that only the law of
gravity applies in space.
The law can be Newton's
or it can be Einsteins,
but it cannot be Darwin's
law of evolution.
A description of astronomical
reality based on Darwin's law
probably wouldn't make any sense.
But the point is that one law
is selected and another is not.
Even the particle physicists who
lately have invaded astronomy
select only certain
fundamental laws
on which to construct their basic
description of atomic reality.
This business of selection is so
simple as to be not worth mentioning.
But not mentioning it leads
to not paying attention to it
which leads to skipping over it
in the occasional circumstance
when it may be important.
My next comment of course
is that it's important now.
Horrigan and the scientists he interviewed
for his book have overlooked a deeper irony.
While the theories of ironic
science have been unable to
"achieve empirically
verifiable surprises".
Experimental and observational
science has produced a flood of them.
Nearly every discovery
of the space age
from the Van Allen radiation
belts around the earth
to the high velocity
winds around Neptune
has been pronounced
as a surprise.
And the surprises have been
surprising precisely because
they haven't verified the prevailing
basic description of reality.
One might think a reasonable
plan in this circumstance
would be to take a second look at the
fundamental laws selected for one's description.
One doesn't have to resort to anything as
ridiculous as consider in Darwin's law.
For instance the laws of electromagnetism
have been lying around for over a century
mostly ignored except by a
few electrical engineers
because you "can't get charged
separation in space".
The problem is that scientists
are like the horse led to water,
neither the failure of ironic science
to achieve empirical surprises
nor the failure of achieved empirical
surprises to verify the accepted description
can force scientists to drink basic
provisions if they don't want to.
Selection is the result
of wanting to choose
and if you want to
defend a theory
you can always find
expedient excuses.
Almost nothing outside the solar
system and a lot of things inside it
don't obey either Einstein's
or Newton's law of gravity.
e.g. The stars in the arms of spiral
galaxies revolving about the same velocity
instead of slowing down with
distance as gravity predicts.
To make these observations fit the
gravitational description of reality
astronomers have chosen to
hedge the fundamental law
with a thicket of ironic opinions and
points of view that are not empirical.
There might be appropriately
configured halos of unseen dark matter
outside the galaxies that
produce the observed velocities.
This avoids the necessity
of questioning fundamentals,
but it turns the basic
description of reality
into an imaginative fantasy
that is explanatory
but neither verifiable
nor falsifiable.
Modern theories with
appropriate adjustments
can explain everything
and anything
just as psychoanalysis
with childhood trauma.
The dark matter of the mind
can explain any behavior.
However the point of science
is not merely to explain,
but to find out which explanation
is actually the case.
For that you need more than one
explanation from which to choose.
This object might
be a black hole,
that object might be dark matter,
having disallowed competition from
fundamentally different theories.
There's no way to tell if those
objects might be something else.
Verification alone is inadequate.
You need to search for alternatives
and to test them to gain reliability.
Planting more hedges of ad-hoc hypotheses
around the fundamental law of gravity
may appeal to ironic scientists.
But other scientists
mostly outside astronomy are more
inclined toward empirical results.
The new field of plasma cosmology has
admitted Maxwell's laws of electromagnetism
to the description of
astronomical reality.
The properties of electrical discharges
applied to the phenomena of space
by such pioneers as Birkeland,
Langmuir
and Alfvén explained the new
discoveries without ironic fantasies.
The revised description
expects the observations
that are surprising to the
standard gravity only version.
And this electrical description is
directly verifiable in plasma labs.
Dark matter and 10 dimensional
super strings are not.
The reality we think we see
is constantly being revised
by what we actually see of
a partially known reality.
Usually the revisions
are superficial,
but there have been times
in the history of thought
when the revisions have
reached to the basics.
Plasma cosmology hasn't
discovered a new fundamental law
it merely replaces one law
- gravity -
with another
- electromagnetism -
but the effect on the basic
description of astronomical reality
is as great as if a new
law had been discovered.
We think we see an
entirely new reality
this shouldn't be a surprise!
The Space Age has brought substantial
revisions in instrumentation
allowing us to sense the entire
electromagnetic spectrum.
From radio wavelengths
to gamma wavelengths.
For the first time
in human history
we are not restricted to an
anthropocentric sensory viewpoint.
The Space Age has also brought
substantial revisions in location
allowing us to sense the cosmos from
positions off the Earth's surface.
For the first time
in human history,
we are not restricted to a
geocentric positional viewpoint.
We should expect these
revisions in basic viewpoint
to be accompanied by a revision in the
basic description of the reality viewed.
The ultimate irony would be that
in the face of our liberation
from an anthropocentric
and geocentric viewpoint.
We would be unable or unwilling
to liberate ourselves
from a traditional way of
thinking about reality.

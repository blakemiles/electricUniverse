A new scientific paper attempts to explain
a mystery at our planet's South Pole.
A team of investigators from
the British Antarctic Survey
discovered a localized area where the Antarctic
Ice Sheet is melting surprisingly quickly.
Using radar, they found that some of the ice
in a 3 km thick layer appears to be missing.
They have proposed that the heat
source causing the melting is
"unusually radioactive rocks"
combined with unusually hot
water from deep underground.
Lead author Dr. Tom Jordan
says of the investigation,
"Our results were
quite unexpected,
as many people thought this region of
Antarctica was made of ancient and cold rocks,
which had little impact
on the ice sheet above.
We show that even in the
ancient continental interior,
the underlying geology can have a
significant impact on the ice.
But a clue to the actual cause of the
anomalous ice melting might be found at the
"surprisingly hot poles of other
planets in our solar system."
As we've pointed out
in countless episodes,
physicist Wal Thornhill made the seemingly
outrageous yet successful prediction
that the freezing cold
North Pole of Saturn,
which had been deprived of
sunlight for more than a decade,
would have a "hot spot" similar to
the one at the planet's South Pole.
In 2007, a surprising warm spot was also
found at the South Pole of Neptune.
The Electric Universe
theory has always stated
that the Sun is primarily
an electrical phenomenon
and electric currents flowing
from the Sun to planets
has implications for many
atmospheric phenomena
including the tremendous
winds of gas giant planets
and also jet streams and
weather patterns on Earth.
In recent years, professor Dr. Donald Scott
has developed a model of the structure
of a type of electric current
called a 'Birkeland current'
which can be identified visually
by its unique counter rotation.
Critically, this counter rotation has
been seen at the poles of Saturn,
Jupiter,
Neptune,
and in our own planet's Auroras.
Of course, the question
is speculative
but we asked Dr. Scott if an
incoming Birkeland current
could be the cause of the anomalous
ice melting at the South Pole.
It's always interesting how relatively
often new "surprising discoveries"
are being made that might be explained
better by the Electric Universe ideas.
Much better than by accepted models
of whatever it is being observed
and I'm just sort of amused by the
way that classic standard scientists
will lurch and grab on
to whatever is nearby
except they never think about looking up
and say gosh, could it be electrical?
And so, using radar to look down through
3 km of ice, the British team found that
some of the ice covered an area that's
twice the size of the City of London.
Now, this is a pretty big
area, pretty big volume.
And that ice appeared to be missing,
there's a big hole in there.
One explanation for the missing
ice, their explanation,
was that there may be a radioactive rock deposit
there that is supplying heat from below.
Now I guess it's certainly possible that
there's a radioactive rock deposit below
where the ice has melted
but the Antarctic ice pack has
been growing in recent years
while the Arctic ice
pack has been shrinking.
So if there's any difference at all
between the Arctic and the Antarctic
then it seems as though the
Antarctic is getting colder and
that makes the melting of this ice
even more anomalous, I guess.
So and the question is,
why is there a region deep down under the
southern growing ice pack that's melting?
Well, after, if you think about it a
minute, we know that the polar regions,
both north and south
of the Earth,
are regions where Birkeland currents
are coming in from the Sun
and they impinge down through
the Earth's magnetosphere.
Several years ago, NASA said that the
amount of current was unexpectedly high,
somewhere around
650,000 amperes.
Now, 650,000 amperes is a lot of, to put
it in the vernacular, a lot of juice.
It's a lot of electric
energy there.
Amperes is not energy but it can
produce a great amount of heat.
OK, that's fine but why should that produce
more melting at one pole than at the other?
The answer may lie in the fact that
the northern Arctic polar region
is a layer of ice floating
on top of a saltwater ocean.
And salt water is an excellent electrical
conductor, that's my main point.
Ice is a good conductor and maybe
it's not quite as good as salt water
but it's a pretty
good conductor.
Well, the difference in the
South, in the Antarctic,
is that the ice pack is sitting right down
a smack on top of a continent of Earth,
Earth's material.
There is a continent down there,
there's no Southern Ocean.
Instead of where the Arctic Ocean
is, there's an Antarctic continent.
And the material that
the Earth is made of
is generally not nearly as good an
electrical conductor as salt water or ice.
So if you think about what's
going on, if you consider the
path that maybe a Birkeland current
might take as it comes in from the Sun,
comes down through the magnetosphere
down vertically into the Earth.
And by the way, we've got
some very nice video
of the counter-rotating currents in the Aurora
Borealis that is certainly supporting evidence
that indeed that's what's happening
so that Birkeland was quite right.
Anyway, if that current comes down through the
snow and ice and then into Earth and rock.
Now in the North it flows
through ice and saltwater.
Now each of these cases we can think of the
electrical properties of those two layers
through which the current flows.
Well, the current flows
through one resistor of,
if you think of those as
layers as being resistances,
and the current and each of
those resistors is the same,
the same amount of currents,
the same amount of amperes.
The two resistors both have
fairly low resistance values
when at the South Pole one of the resistors,
the ice pack, has relatively low resistance.
But the earth and the rock is a
very much higher resistance.
So just to get technical
for a second,
when electrical current flows through
two resistors connected in series,
energy is liberated
in each resistor.
The expression is familiar to many
people who had physics course.
Power equals I²R.
The I²R is the amount of electrical power
that's released in the resistor R.
So the current is the
same in both resistors
but the resistance of each of
these resistances is different.
So the amount of heat, and
this is the punchline,
the amount of heat produced
in each of the two resistors
depends linearly on their
resistance values.
So if the current, same
current flows through,
one of the two resistors is the low
resistance and one is a high resistance.
The low resistor will not get very
warm but the high resistance one will.
And so, Birkeland currents have been
passing down into the Earth for millennia.
So is that the cause
of the hotspot?
Maybe, but the thing that makes me think
that maybe it might indeed be correct,
is that there is the difference
between what happens at the two poles
may well be explained by the difference between
the electrical properties of the paths,
the two paths that the polar
Birkeland currents have to take.
At least it seems like a
more reasonable answer to me
than just postulating and groping
around and say, oh my god,
what causes it must be a
radioactive rock down there.

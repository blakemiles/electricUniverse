Today, physicist Wal Thornhill
concludes his three-part presentation
on the early science results from NASA's
Juno mission to the gas giant Jupiter.
As previously noted, like countless
other recent space discoveries,
the mission findings are challenging, not
only long-held assumptions about Jupiter,
but also consensus theories
of planet and star formation
and the history of
our solar system.
On the question of Jupiter's internal
structure and composition,
Thornhill offered the provocative
thesis that Jupiter is hollow.
In this episode Thornhill presents his
predictions for forthcoming Juno revelations,
including the mystery of what lies
beneath the planet’s Great Red Spot.
We begin with some further
explanation of electrogravity.
Of course, the idea of a hollow Earth
with an inner surface like a geode,
is a formidable challenge to our entrenched
belief that the earth has a dense core.
It's a belief that can only
be overcome by explanation,
by demonstration and by willingness
to consider the evidence.
Consider for a moment that the
electrogravity model presented here
applies equally to
any spinning object,
where the heavy nuclei in each atom
are offset radially from the spin axis
to form tiny radial
electric dipoles.
This is the simple reason why inertial
mass is equivalent to gravitational mass.
The centrifugal force is not
a fictitious or pseudo force,
it's identical to gravity.
It's the reason why a spinning Space
Station, like the one famously modeled
in Stanley Kubrick's landmark film,
”A Space Odyssey”, produces its own gravity.
This raises the question how someone in
the space station knows they are spinning.
Only by looking out of a window
and seeing the stars sweep past.
The so-called fixed stars are the reference
standard for all motion in the electric universe,
because the electric force of gravity
connects all matter in the universe,
practically in real time.
That's why gyros are used
for inertial navigation,
because they tend to lock
themselves gravitationally
to the matter in the
rest of the universe.
Think about it.
In a universe of countless negatively polarized
stars and planets repelling each other,
a gyro has a positively
polarized rim
which is attracted to all
of those celestial bodies.
Sadly, those who have demonstrated what
seemed to be anti-gravity effects of gyros,
have not had any useful understanding
of gravity from physicists
to explain what
they were observing.
Most significant was Professor
Eric Laithwaite’s 1974-75
Royal Institution’s
Christmas lecture,
finally posted online in December
2013, which I recommend watching.
As for willingness to
consider eyewitness evidence,
scientists at the Royal
Institution behaved predictably
by refusing to broadcast the
remarkable lecture on the grounds
as the Royal Institution
website says and I quote,
”Laithwaite appears to have used various
engineering approximations in his calculations
on the behavior of gyroscopes.
And when told by professional mathematicians
that once the calculations were done rigorously
there was no discrepancy,
he refused to believe them.”
These are the same
professional mathematicians
who can't define mass or
energy in terms of matter
and have no sensible model of
the real nature of gravity.
Laithwaite was only one
of three people since 1945
to deliver more than one series of the
Royal Institution’s Christmas lectures.
His first series was the first to be
televised on the new BBC-2 channel.
Back to Jupiter's
origin and composition.
Decades ago the plasma cosmologists and
Nobel prize-winning plasma physicist
Hannes Alfvén predicted that stars would be
formed along Birkeland current filaments
inside molecular clouds.
He famously said, “Gravitational systems are
the ashes of former electrical systems.”
Infrared Space Telescopes
have recently confirmed this,
but no acknowledgment has been
forthcoming from settled astrophysics
because of their taboo
against electricity in space.
The electric universe simply adds that both
stars and planets are formed in the same event.
The cosmic lightning
characteristically snakes about
and is observed to toss the newly
formed bodies out laterally.
But collisions are avoided
by repulsive gravity.
The thousands of crazy exoplanetary
systems are simply explained
by the inward gravitational pressure
of all other bodies in the universe
against a repulsive gravitational
force of the nearest dominant body.
Hot Jupiters, orbiting their
star closely, is not a puzzle.
When we get rid of the gravitational
accretion and merger by collision myth.
On the question of the
composition of Jupiter,
plasma physicists have shown
that Birkeland currents
draw the heavy elements towards
the centers of celestial bodies
and the gases form their atmospheres,
with hydrogen and helium outermost.
So, the composition of Jupiter can't
be assessed from its atmosphere.
Jupiter is not mostly
hydrogen and helium.
All of the issues raised, mean Jupiter is
a solid shell, composed of heavy elements.
It will have structure, both on its
external and internal surfaces.
Jupiter is not as Scott said of
the simplistic standard model,
”boring and uniform inside.”
Anywhere you look will
not look the same.
So let's return to
Nasa's teleconference.
Scott Bolton, Juno principal
investigator said,
”There are motions deep inside Jupiter
that people hadn't anticipated
and the gravity field
is consistent with that.
What we were really
looking for was a core,
whether there was a
compact core or no core,
and instead what we found was
that it looks really fuzzy.”
”There may be a core there and it may be
very big and it may be partially dissolved...
that came as a big surprise
to us, that there was no core.
These mysteries extended to
our magnetic field experiment.”
Jack Connerney, Juno deputy
principal investigator, said
”On Earth the compass doesn't deviate
much from the north-south direction.
On Jupiter the magnetic field was
both stronger than we expected
where we expected
it to be strong
and it was weaker
than we expected
where we expected it to be weak.
”There are small spatial variations which
indicate we may be very close to the source.
So it may be above the metallic hydrogen and may
operate in the molecular hydrogen envelope.”
The electrogravity model
of hollow celestial objects
removes any idea of planetary magnetic
fields being generated by internal dynamos.
That hypothesis has never been able
to successfully model the complexity
and variety of planetary magnetic
fields found in the solar system.
It doesn't work for the Sun either.
As Faraday found, magnetic fields are
intimately associated with electric currents,
but electro-gravity is also
associated with magnetism.
Both forces have the same origin in the
distortion of protons and electrons.
The earth shows a connection
between the two forces
which requires a fundamental
reinterpretation.
The simplest explanation for
a dipole magnetic field
aligned roughly with the
axis of rotation of a planet,
is that the planet carries a surface
charge which constitutes a current.
This was considered for the
origin of the earth's field
but it was rejected because the
electric current of 10^9 amperes
required, seemed too high
because the charge it implied
would generate a tremendously strong
electric field at the earth's surface
which doesn't exist.
However, there is a clear air electric
field of about 100 volts per meter.
The problem with this argument is that
to measure voltage requires a reference
and the earth or ground is
considered our reference voltage.
And it is clear that the earth
has plenty of electrons
to carry the return current
of our Power Networks.
But the fundamental error comes from
the belief that stars and planets
can be considered electrically
neutral in space plasma.
This has been proven incorrect
in the case of the Sun,
where numerous electrical
double layers or plasma sheaths
have been found in the
interplanetary plasma
that reduce the electric
field between them.
The earth has plasma sheaths in the ionosphere
and magnetosphere which do the same thing.
So the 100 volts per meter
measured in the lower atmosphere
doesn't give a true picture
of the charge on the earth.
Venus's lack of a magnetic field
could be down to its ultra-slow rotation,
but it leaves Uranus’ and Neptune’s oddly
offset magnetic fields unanswered.
It seems more probable that the
cool solid shells of planets
retain some of their
nascent magnetic fields,
when the ambient field of their
birthing Birkeland current was at its peak.
Planetary rotation can
also be understood
as an imprint of the rotating
Birkeland current filament.
The slow retrograde
rotation of Venus,
its heat and lack
of a magnetic field,
argues for a different,
recent birth.
The global myths of Venus as the
archetypal comet, match this idea
and introduce an alternative birth process
for smaller rocky planets and moons
by a process of electro-gravitic
expulsion from a much larger body.
This proposal makes sense of the large
numbers of satellites of the gas giants
and the spectacular
icy rings of Saturn
which are of very recent origin.
Finally a word about
Jupiter's Great Red Spot.
Its continued presence for centuries is another
argument for a solid body beneath the clouds.
It's giant tornadic form is that of a
continuous electrical discharge vortex
from an elevated surface feature
acting like a lightning rod,
which could be the birth scar
of one of Jupiter's moons.
The Juno spacecraft is due to
observe the Great Red Spot closely
on its next close
encounter with Jupiter
where I expect even greater gravitational
and electromagnetic anomalies
to be found associated
with the spot.

In recent months, according to a
number of scientific reports, the dusty
winds and sand dune formations on the planet
Mars have grown even more mysterious.
For decades, the Martian winds have 
puzzled planetary scientists on Earth.
The atmosphere on Mars is of
course incredibly rarefied.
It's only 0.6% as dense as 
Earth's, and yet on Mars,
incredible dust storms vastly more
powerful than anything ever witnessed on
Earth, sometimes engulf 
the entire planet.
These dust storms are sometimes composed of
vast congregations of so-called dust
devils, or dust tornados reaching
as tall as Mount Everest.
All over the Red Planet, countless 
strange wind-driven features
also present huge mysteries.
These include so-called sand dunes which
are very different from earthly sand
dunes in important ways.
In some instances, the dune
features appear to be
permanently frozen in 
to the terrain.
In August of 2003, the New Scientist article
"All Eyes on Mars" remarked on this and
several other Martian 
geological oddities.
It states, "Mars is proving more
enigmatic than ever at the moment.
The latest images of the Martian surface
taken by NASA's orbiting Mars Global
Surveyor have revealed profoundly
mysterious landforms that have left
geologists scratching their heads.
The features include a combination of
surprisingly stable dunes, canyons
without craters and 
rapidly eroding ice caps.
All point to amazingly fast
processes taking place on the surface.
Mars has changed considerably in the
past few thousand years -- in some places,
even the past two years. 
Yet nobody knows why.
Unraveling the mystery will require
a radical leap in theoretical thinking,
says Michael Malin, the geologist 
in charge of the MGS camera."
However, 16 years after these remarks
were published, the required
"radical leap in theoretical 
thinking" has yet to occur.
Planetary scientists today
remain confined to the theoretical
toolkit which only recognizes the
geological processes of wind and water
erosion, plate tectonics, periodic impacts
from space, and volcanism, as the basic
forces shaping 
planetary surfaces.
But as we shall see, standard geology fails
to explain either the processes occurring
on the Red Planet today nor the ones
that devastated its surface in the past.
This point is made emphatically if we
examine just one type of geological
feature on Mars, 
the sand dune.
Earlier this year, NASA's Odyssey 
orbiter stunned planetary
scientists when it captured images of a "dune
field" with a roughly hexagonal shape.
The dunes are found on
the floor of the crater Terra
Cimmeria which appear in a heavily
cratered southern highland region of Mars.
Perhaps tellingly, another dune
field, also at least partly hexagonal, can
be seen in a nearby crater.
As planetary scientists have
noted, the dunes and
"ripples" that appear on Mars's
high southern latitudes, are thought to
be stable and so they suggest the dunes could
essentially be fossils of ancient Martian winds.
But as an EarthSky report on the 
puzzling dunes asks, "What about
the hexagonal shape? Are we surprised?
Yes and no. Hexagons can be found in other
places in nature. Another striking
example is the jet strean formation at
Saturn's North Pole, which is a massive,
near-perfect hexagon centered at the
pole itself. It's 
absolutely astonishing."
As those who have followed the Electric
Universe theory are well aware, the
hexagonal shape of any feature seen in nature
may give an essential clue to its formation.
Hexagonal craters are seen on
rocky bodies throughout the solar system;
including Mars, Mercury, the dwarf planet
Ceres, and the asteroid Vesta.
One hypothesis planetary scientists
have proposed
is that in each and every instance
meteoritic impacts have struck fault
lines which have collapsed over time
eventually producing the hexagonal form.
But of course, this strange reasoning would
not account for the hexagonal dune field.
However, as we have repeatedly
noted, the hexagonal form is seen rather
routinely in craters produced by electrical
discharge machining in the laboratory.
On the aforementioned hexagon
at Saturn's North Pole, the mystery for
planetary scientists has 
only deepened over time.
For several years, scientists
on earth had pointed to the appearance
of hexagons in simple fluid dynamic
experiments as the ideal analogue
explaining the Saturnian 
hexagons formation.
But as we reported last year,
scientists studying data from NASA's
Cassini spacecraft were amazed to
discover that the hexagon reaches
hundreds of kilometers higher in Saturn's
atmosphere than was previously thought.
This is problematic because, as
noted in a Sciencealert report, "...since
wind conditions change dramatically with
altitude, the fact that the hexagon shape
persists so much higher than the cloud
tops is a baffling conundrum."
And yet the Electric Universe theory has
always proposed that the hexagon formation is
ultimately produced by an external
electric current entering at the pole.
In fact, it was this reasoning that led
physicist Wal Thornhill to predict in
2005, that Saturn's North Pole would have
a "hot spot" which would match the
one already discovered at 
the planet's South Pole.
When this prediction was
confirmed in 2008, it was to the
astonishment of planetary scientists,
since the pole had been deprived of
sunlight for 
over 12 years.
For decades, the chief principals of The
Thunderbolts Project have proposed that experiments
with electrical discharge provide the
greatest potential for understanding
both past and current geological
phenomena in our solar system.
As we have noted many times, in addition 
to producing varieties of "weird
craters" seen on rocky bodies, electrical
discharge in the laboratory also
routinely creates both dust levitation
and plumes of ejected material,
as seen in this experiment 
by Jacob Gable.
And ionic winds which can organize
dust into dune-like patterns, as seen in
this experiment 
by Billy Yelverton.
These experiments could also provide insight
into what actually drives the incredible,
towering dust devils, and planet-
encompassing dust storms on Mars today.
Planetary scientists do indeed recognize
that tremendous electric fields are
associated with the 
giant dust devils.
Although they believe that the electric
fields are generated by grains of sand
and dust rubbing together.
However, this begs the question, with such
low atmospheric pressure and so little
force in the Martian wind, how does one account
for the dust particles leaving the surface?
Physicist Wal Thornhill
suggests a fundamental confusion of
cause and effect among 
planetary scientists.
He writes, "...in an electrified
universe charge is already separated on
the macroscopic scale and the movement
of air in a dust devil is an effect of
charge recombination, not a
cause of charge separation."
The hexagonal dune field on 
the planet Mars may have been
indeed formed in the past by the same
type of electrical discharge that
ravaged much of 
the Martian surface.
As Wal Thornhill explains, "No amount of
theorizing based on slow evolutionary
geological principles will explain how
the giant canyons on Mars are so young
that they have no 
craters in their walls.
The very formation mechanism of Valles
Marineris is a mystery to geologists.
However, if we make use of the forensic
evidence from the past, the formation of
Valles Marineris was witnessed by modern
humans in late prehistory. We don't need
to theorize. Mars, the God of war, was
memorialized as the heroic figure in a
celestial battle fought with
thunderbolts. Mars was struck and a
visible scar remained. For the scar of
Valles Marineris to be seen by the naked
eye requires that Mars 
was about 100 times
closer to the Earth than it is on its
closest approach today!"
Indeed in our next episode, we will explore
why Mars's identity as the God of War
is the ultimate key to understanding the
events which make Martian geology so
mysterious to this day.

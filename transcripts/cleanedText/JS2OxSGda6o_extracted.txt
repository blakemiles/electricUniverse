In part two of this presentation, physicist
Wal Thornhill continues his discussion
of the recent discovery of the so-called
shocking electric wind at the planet Venus.
As described in the previous episode, the
electric wind is said to be sufficiently strong
that it can strip an entire planet
of all its water components.
The co-author of a study on the
Discovery said of these findings,
"It's amazing and shocking. We never
dreamt an electric wind can be so powerful
that it can suck oxygen right out
of an atmosphere into space.
This is something that has
to be on the checklist
when we go looking for habitable
planets around other stars."
But as Wal Thornhill explains, neither this
nor countless other surprising discoveries
has freed planetary scientists from their
ideas about the history of the solar system,
including the notions of how life arose on
Earth and could arise on other planets.
I answered in detail in
June 2004 the question,
why doesn't Venus have much water,
in my article - Cassini's homecoming.
It was written to coincide with that amazing
spacecrafts' arrival at the rings-giant Saturn.
The simple answer is that Venus hasn't been
around long enough to lose an ocean of water
so its puzzling heavy carbon dioxide atmosphere
requires a very different explanation.
Likewise, it is nowhere admitted that,
according to the standard model,
the Earth should not have oceans of water
either, because hydrogen would have been
blown out of the inner Solar System
early in the Sun's assumed career.
However, all observations in the
Space Age saw the Solar System
to be a blended family of odd
bodies, each with their own story.
Nothing is to be gained by
trying to force fit them
to a centuries-old
evolution-in-place theory,
with all of the hypothetical collisional
drama occurring billions of years ago.
That might make us feel safe, but
it has nothing to do with science!
Meanwhile, gravitational systems as presently
understood, are inherently unstable.
Something is seriously wrong!
So, back to these electric winds, stripping
planets of oceans and atmospheres.
Velikovsky's identification of Venus as an
electrically discharging comet was spot on.
The problem of how comet that
size can end up in the most
circular orbit of any of the
planets, has had to wait
for the electric universe explanation of
the electrical nature of mass and gravity.
It provides the essential feedback mechanism
to establish and maintain clockwork stability.
As a comet, Venus was
discharging massively
as a cathode in the solar discharge
and swiftly circularizing its orbit.
As a planet, Venus still discharges five
times more strongly than the Earth.
The electrons leaving Venus drag along positive
oxygen ions to a degree that was unexpected.
But the euphemism "electric wind" means
an electric discharge, like an air ionizer.
It's an electric current.
This is confirmed by the
twisted magnetic flux ropes,
known more correctly as Birkeland
currents by plasma physicists,
identified in the
cometary tail of Venus.
That tail still stretches to tickle
the Earth at inferior conjunction.
That's a mechanism that
determines the spacing of orbits.
It's true that this gradual loss
of atmosphere and water over eons
poses a problem for life
on earth-like planets.
It shows the folly of assuming,
in typical geocentric fashion,
that life in the Universe is to be found in a
narrow Goldilocks zone about a bright star.
It's not a good
situation to be in,
either for the establishment of
life or its long-term survival.
The electric universe shows
instead that all stars
are a form of low pressure electrical gas
discharge phenomenon in a galactic circuit.
Red stars of all sizes are those that have
expanded their glowing plasma sheaths,
in order to collect enough electrons
from the interstellar plasma
to satisfy their
discharge requirements.
That's why red giants are
observed to expand and contract
in response to changes in
their electrical environment.
But it's inside the glowing red
spheres of brown dwarf stars
that orbiting satellites find
conditions best suited for life!
Every square meter of each satellite's
surface receives the same radiant energy,
there are no seasons.
Most significantly recent observations
show, water and other molecules
necessary for life are found in
the spectra of brown dwarfs,
and those molecules will mist down on the
satellites, establishing oceans and atmospheres.
Significantly, ferns are
adapted to misting rain,
and red light is the most
conducive to photosynthesis.
And water which is
essential to life,
is activated electrically by
infrared light or warmth.
So, it makes sense that brown dwarfs should
be considered as the most likely candidates
for cosmic wombs, not
bright stars like the Sun.
This raises many issues in the search
for life elsewhere in the Universe.
Perhaps most important is that the
search for extraterrestrial intelligence
or SETI is doomed to failure
because radio waves
cannot penetrate the glowing
plasma shell of a red star.
And the chances of intelligent
life, happening to survive,
being torn from its brown dwarf
womb in a capture event,
like that suffered by the
Earth and Mars, seems remote.
In fact, Mars stands as mute testimony to
the devastation that we narrowly avoided.
It is our closest relative in the Solar
System and shared the same cosmic womb.
This much is made remarkably clear by applying
a forensic approach to all of the evidence
available from human observations
of the skies over millennia.
Of course, none of this information is
deducible from the narrow deductive
perspective of a modern cosmology,
which has no interest in history
and denies any electrical involvement
in the celestial mechanism.
Thankfully, in this age of
instant global communication,
we may not have to wait
centuries for a paradigm shift.

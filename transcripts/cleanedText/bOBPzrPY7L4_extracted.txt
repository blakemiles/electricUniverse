Solar System Formation, Quantum
Vibration and Natural Disasters
Good morning everybody!
So today are we talking about
a very interesting topic
of solar system formation, quantum
vibration and natural disaster.
What motivates me into this research is
mainly the topic of natural disaster.
I would like to be
able to predict
when all those major natural
disaster will occur in the future.
And that leads me to understanding the
connections between space weather
and all the climate change and
many other activities on Earth.
And that also leads me to
conducting more intensive research
on how solar activities arise.
And also go all the way into
how the solar system would form.
So hopefully this will be an
interesting topic to discuss
and be beneficial
to everyone here.
So I would like to start
with the term simplicity.
So in order for human
to understand anything
and be able to implement
what they understand,
it starts with really
simple concept such as,
if we understand
how the bird flies
we can actually imitate birds
and build a flying machine.
If we understand the
wheel, how the wheels work,
we create can create a vehicle.
So in this case we want to understand
how natural disasters occur
and we have to use the simple
concept to understand this.
So what means simple?
It means it's simple to be observed.
Anyone can observe
what I observed.
Through all the perceptions
that everyone has.
And also in terms of natural
disaster observation,
it just apply simple
observations such as
rain, floods, tornado formations,
earthquakes, volcanic eruptions.
And these are natural
observations.
There's more artificial observations
that human have come up with.
Such as fluctuation of magnetic fields,
electric fields and all kind of stuff
which are the
secondary observation
that not many people can observe
such change by themselves.
It relies on
scientific instruments.
Same thing for the Sun.
The natural way to
observe the Sun,
well, back like hundreds of years
thousands of years, is (to) sunspots.
And of course, using
really simple instruments,
scientists and astronomers can
generate a sunspot index.
It's called sunspot number.
And that can be highly beneficial to
understand the Sun, simple as that.
In addition to a
more complex index
such as solar flares,
geomagnetic storm
or coronal hole, coronal
mass ejections and so forth.
And of course, it has to be simple
to reproduce and verify it.
Just like I have mentioned.
It has to be natural.
Something everyone can do.
It's not too expensive to do it.
So we don't need billions of dollars
to prove something the way it is.
It's just how we see things.
And of course, what we
see is what we get.
It's a direct conclusion based
on direct observations.
We can also conduct physical
experiments just to confirm
that we understand the behavior
of what we tried to observe.
And of course, this is based
on personal experience
that began where, you know,
from our child ages to now.
So in order to work in the right
direction, we need the right perceptions.
And in order to do that I need to rely
on the teaching from great philosophers
and scholars around the world
that's living
today, in this room,
as well as those, you know, that lived
in the past thousands of years.
And they all come to
really the same conclusion
when we want to observe something. That
everything has to happen for a reason.
They have to have
cause and effects.
And of course, how did you
find cause and effects?
In general sense, we use the
term "Dependent origination",
that all things arise in dependence
upon multiple cause and condition.
Not a single one.
For example, I was born.
I cannot be born by myself.
I relied on my
mother and my father.
And of course my father and
my mother cannot be born
if they don't have air, food
and water supplying to them.
So everything depends
on each other.
There's no single isolated island
of anything that's causing something.
So everything is all-conditioned.
And of course we want to study something
and to be pretty much neutral or not biased.
We always, we always see something
in dualities, just like we see a coin.
These always have two sides.
And of course, we see
things the way it is.
Simple to say, but what I mean is,
everything is subject to change.
For example, this
universe. The assumption
that this universe is electrically
neutral is also impermanent.
Same thing for an electrical
bias. It's also impermanent.
There's nothing really constant or
staying the same way without changing.
And of course, since
everything is conditioned,
there's no something dictating
everything ultimately.
So there's no true essence
in what we actually observe
and that, in general sense,
is called concept non-self.
So next...
Okay, so now we go to the
topic of quantum vibration.
The simple concept of this term.
I refer to the minimum amount of physical
entity involved in an interaction.
So in in this case, what we
can do in this universe
is all about changing.
Depending on what we are actually
looking at and pay attention to,
there's always at least two states that
we can define of what we observed.
For example, if we look at charge,
we can see positive charge
and negative charge.
If we want to look
at electricity,
there are electromagnetic
and electrostatic.
You want to study wave,
there's two type of waves. There's
transverse wave and longitude wave.
If you want to look at
(how) matter movements,
it can be perceived as
contractions or expansions
and also can arise from chaos
into order and vice versa.
And this is just some example of what
you can see and perceive in reality.
And all this exists in
all state of matter;
plasma, gas, liquid, and solid.
And of course, all these
properties exist in space
or someone can call this vacuum.
It's an ever-changing
environment.
So next we're going to the main
concept of this presentation.
So I need to get, obtain some guidance
from one (of the) great scholar here,
which is Nikola Tesla.
One of his quotes is, "If you want to
find the secrets of the universe,
(we) think in terms of energy,
frequency and vibration."
And of course, in this conference we refer
energy, want to focus on electrical energy.
So we're going into the, the first experiment
of how we try to create a plasma ball,
okay, using electrical potential.
This is a brute force way
to create a plasma ball
so we can learn and understand how we, how
the plasma behaves as a spherical shape.
So in this case we
have a tube, vacuum tube.
We supply 9 kilo-volts AC power into
the one electrode at the center,
and there's one side on another plate. And
then we start by vacuum the tube out
so we create an easy
condition to produce plasma.
So from here just pay
attention to the video here.
So the power is already
supplied to this tube
and of course, once
the condition is right
you have a plasmasphere created
in the center of the chamber.
So this looks very
much like the Sun.
But of course, the Sun has more
complex behavior than this.
So one I want, the one I want to
show you is, you can see the plume
that's showing up here?
And that's, kind of, similar way that
we observed in this plasma ball.
So the point I'm trying to make here is
that, if you wait a little bit longer,
we want to change the conditions
surrounding this plasma ball
and see how the plasma ball
behave according to this change.
In this case we leak the air,
you can leak the air inside this
plasma ball, this plasma chamber.
And if you wait a little bit more, you'll
notice something change to this sphere.
So right now, it's
not changing yet.
Let's keep observing
a little bit.
Now started to change.
See how activities
start to increase
so that's when we have more massive
gas leaking into the system
(and) so the different plasma
density in the chamber.
And you could also notice the uniform
glow at the edge of the plate.
So from here we go
into conclusion.
This is just not the whole
complete picture of the Sun
but I, the point I try to make here is
that the Sun is not the Sun by itself.
The activity of the Sun was not dictated
from the thing that's come from inside.
But in this case it does have the
outside influence of the activity.
So during, the high vacuum pressure chamber,
it looks like high solar activity.
And there's more filaments like it
because there's more gas inside.
It's more electrical discharge,
activities become more frequent.
And of course, you have more magnetic
fields -- you have more currents.
And this called is solar
maximum, in pinyin,
of course and of course we produce
high X-ray emissions, more frequency
and of course high
number of sunspots.
On the other hand, in doing
the low vacuum pressure,
the plasma will
become more uniform
and it's really similar to the
low solar activity cycles.
And it looks they have less filament-
like electrical discharge activities,
weaker magnetic field, all those
flux lines are less present.
Would be, we can define as a
strong electric activity.
Solar minimum, low X-ray emission.
So of course, in this we find
a low number of sunspots.
So this is going to one of the factors
that I actually used for understanding
how this plasma density affects the
Sun as well as the Earth in general.
So next slide...
Of course, if you want to compare this
to the outer edge of the solar system,
this is what I believe, something using
a really cheap way to generate it.
It looks like a heliopause to me.
I believe, this is very similar to what
Ralph Juergens maybe had visualized,
maybe.
And he, what he said is the Sun itself is
the focus of cosmic electrical discharge.
So we just do just that.
But this is a brute force way to fuse the
plasma into the center of the sphere.
And of course, there's more efficient
way to do that. It's the resonance system
So now we move through...
going through more factor details
of how we can create a system
that mimic the Sun through
quantum vibrations.
Now, I introduced the terms
frequency and vibration.
And of course to do, to understand this and
maybe hard to do in plasma, plasma medium.
I choose to learn this type of behavior
from the work from dr. Hans Jenny,
which is, what he does is, he made an experiment
on a membrane full of very fine powder.
He put acoustic wave perpendicular
to this mat diaphragme
so it created vibrations
on this diaphragme.
So from here, you start to see that material
started to condense at the center of the things
and you see it looks
spherical, just like the Sun.
And of course, if you zoom inside, you
start to see circulations, convection
that is occurring in
this half-sphere shape.
If you look carefully, you see that
kind of look like nanoflares as well.
And of course, once we
increase the frequency,
the sphere cannot sustain by just
being, remaining static, it starts to spin.
And of course, once
the frequency changes,
there's an alteration in frequency,
you start to see eruptions.
Some chaotic process
going on in the sphere.
It could happen over a short
period of time as well.
And of course, the spin can
change when the frequency changes.
And of course anyone (who) interested
in learning more about this video,
you can find it on YouTube.
So from here, we learn the properties
of what happened in space
using the vibration of sound.
And I will tie this later back to how
the electric properties work later on.
So in this case we look at
internal behavior of this sphere.
We started to observe that
through quantum vibrations,
its arising of the spherical shape with
circulation and convection properties.
And if you look at the Sun,
we see this acting the same way.
We see meridional
circulations inside the Sun.
And of course it has, this things
seem to have explosion and ejection.
It's really similar to
the way the Sun behaves,
that is, having active regions
and coronal mass ejection.
So I believe what happened is
there are some frequencies
that tie into such
activities of the Sun.
And if you look into
external behavior,
we see that the sun spins, just like the
way this spherical ball had rotation.
And of course it produces, it seems like
ejecting mass, just like the Sun does.
And of course, it looks like a
Parker spiral in the larger scale.
And this can be compared to
one of the ALMA telescope
that observed the red giant
star R Sculptoris.
Of course, last but not least, one of the properties
that we can observe is standing wave.
And this is the mode that I
would like to talk about today
and this mode really resembles the
orbital plane of the solar system.
And if you want to look back into
time to other star systems,
you start to see a resonant ring that was
observed in HL Tauri protoplanetary disk.
And of course, we go
into conclusion here.
Observations
Of course, changing vibration frequency
creates various types of activities
That's applied to
objects in space.
Such activity matches with the characteristic
of the Sun and the solar system,
part of it.
And of course, organisation of matters
is resulting of vacuum vibration.
It could be done at
resonant frequency,
so that's how we reinforce the energy
into condensing it into the matter.
You can call that order
arising from chaos.
And of course, energy used to create
and sustain the sphere alone,
ultimately comes from
the surrounding.
And of course, there's two
types of wave patterns
that we can observe from
the previous experiments.
One is a spin which is a spiral wave
and the other is a standing wave.
And I will pay more attention
to the standing wave behavior.
So such standing wave behavior
can be observed by experiment.
Simple experiment
just as this one
which is plasma discharge tube.
So by having vacuum and producing
ejecting high-voltage into the electrodes,
you start to see
columns of plasma.
And that looks pretty much
like a subperiodic structure
when it starts to stabilize.
So now it will become
stabilized in the video.
You start to see a lot of columns just like
we observed in the HL Tauri protoplanetary disc.
So next, we extend this understanding but
it may be a little harder to do in plasma
so we go back to solid
prop, solid model
using soundwave again.
So now we take a look at how we can
create organized system using soundwave.
And this is a, this is experiment called
center, Circular Centered Chladni Plate
which you can check
online as well.
So in this case we have
a plate, a solid plate.
A center of it ties to
the speaker below.
It puts a lot of small particles.
As we change the frequency, those
particles they automatically organize
around the center
of the focus point.
And this looks pretty
much like the Asteroid belt.
So by increasing the frequency,
you start to see
that the matter
or that scattering around this
plate start to be more fine
and create a more defined circle.
Such as the one shown here.
So the more frequency you put
in, the more rings it creates.
So it, for me it looks pretty
much like our solar system.
So we move to the next slide.
More three-dimensional wheel relies on Argonne
National Labs using acoustic levitation.
In this case of course, we see
that, put a spherical foam
and it seems like it's
suspended over the air.
So you see, notice the vibration
that occur in these spheres.
Of course, the sphere will be in the
node where it's the most stable.
And of course, it moves
with frequencies.
So it looks pretty much
like our Solar System.
In our case we want to study about
how the Sun translates power,
transmits power into the Earth.
And of course, if it looks
really similar to these things,
what we should observe is
that, if the Sun vibrates
then the planets will
vibrate. Simple as that.
But what kind of
vibration is this?
We talk, we all talk about
longitude wave for all along.
So I want to continue in
this mode of propagation
so we construct a model of resonant
coupling in the solar system.
We assume the Sun is the
center of solar system
and of course, through
standing wave effects
the Earth's probably in the
third node of vibration.
So we assumed the distance is about
149,600,000 kilometers away
and assume this mode of propagation
travels about speed of light
so that's eight times, 3 times
(eight) 10 to the power of 8 m/s.
So that turns out to be
about 3 mHz of vibration.
So what's important
about this frequency?
If we take a look at the
helioseismic activity,
this is using GOLF instrument.
This instrument is installed in Soho,
so what we measure is the p-mode.
It's acoustic pressure wave of the
Sun at the surface of the Sun.
And at that time the scientists wanted
to look into interior of the Sun
and what they have found
is the resonant frequency of such
mode occurs right around 3 mHz.
And in general terms, few physicists
like to call this "5 minute oscillation".
So,
and of course what
happened on Earth?
It might be really difficult to
detect such frequency vibration.
It has to be excited to a large
event such as earthquake.
So in this case, we look
at the earthquakes.
The great Chilean
earthquake happened in 1960.
And of course, what we observed
is about the same frequency spectrum
occur when the earthquakes occur.
So we have helioseismic monitoring
station spread across the globe
and measuring the, how the Earth is
vibrating according to the stimulation.
And we found one of the fundamental
modes falls between 1 to 5 mHz.
And of course, such
vibration doesn't end here.
It goes into the comet as well.
In comet Hale-Bopp, scientists have
observed interaction of comets
with the surrounding plasma
right around the same frequency.
In this case, the coma will have
the same vibration frequency
around about 3, 2
to 3 mHz.
Actually, it should be like
2 to about 4 mHz
with the center
around this frequency.
So next, if we understand that
how vibrations actually interact,
I mean how the energy interacts, among the
objects in space in the solar system,
we should be able to
construct a model
of energy transmission
based on resonance system.
So it relies on Tesla invention.
One of the power transmission of
his patent, it's filed in May 15, 1900.
So it consist of two spheres, two
balls of spheres, conductive spheres,
inside can be dielectrics.
And of course, it ties to great
spiral, to the pole of this thing.
So we call this the
Sun and the Earth.
And of course, by having a
generator tied to the primary,
start to see, I can, I did a
laboratory experiment on this.
So in this case we
have the generator.
We should see it at the
center of this video here.
I cannot simulate 3
milliHertz vibration
so I use 3 megahertz, about 1
billion times higher in frequency.
50% duty cycle is
in an square wave
and of course, this thing connected to
the primary side of the transformer
which in this case can represent
something coming out from the galactic,
from the galaxy.
Of course, there's a spiral, flat spiral
core connected to the core of the sphere.
And of course one side
goes into the secondary
and go to the pole
of another sphere.
And of course, we tap the
power from the outside core.
And that's go to a LEDs.
In this case I use 6 LEDs.
Please notice the
brightness of the LEDs
because we're gonna do some,
playing some interaction gears.
There's 4 different types of things you can
do with the system to modulate the power.
One is to modulate the potential
or power of this generator.
Second, see the LEDs when
we change the frequency.
Of course this LED doesn't light up.
It's only lit up when it's peaked.
So at resonance.
At 3 megahertz.
At other resonant frequency,
at other frequency
it doesn't match with
this characteristic.
So another way to
modulate the power
is to detune the capacitor which
is the spherical ball here.
I used my hand as
a demonstration.
So when I have a hand or something
that moves approaching this spherical ball,
you see the LEDs start to dim.
So it can modulate the power
of the transmitter side.
For example with this ball, if hand represented
a CME, it passed through the Earth,
you start to see fluctuation
of these LED lights as well.
So this ball can represent
an open plate capacitor.
If you have some
secondary effects,
secondary plate will be
formed automatically in space.
And of course, it can be outer from,
from the external environment.
From all these observations...
So four major approaches to
modulate Earth's electrical environment.
One is to modulate the entire solar
system, galactic generator amplitudes.
Second is to modulate the
galactic generator frequency
and that ties to how, (to) the
variation of 11-year solar cycle.
The third is to change plasma environments
around the local generator sphere,
it's called Sun.
Either through
celestial body passage,
just like how the comet
approaches the Sun...
Of course, we also observed some
heliocentric planetary alignments
seem to have some effects
on solar activities.
As well as other types of
alignments of bodies in space.
And the third, sorry,
the fourth is the change in the plasma
environment in the local receiver sphere
through wave propagations. One
is the longitude and transverse wave
We can also have particles propagation
that modulates the upper atmosphere
such as coronal mass
ejection and solar wind.
And also of course, if there's
a heliocentric alignment,
they have to be
geocentric alignments.
Because the Earth is considered
another resonant cavity
And of course of some significance,
celestial body passage
could affect some electrical
properties around the Earth.
So that's called a local
change in plasma environment.
From here, and this is another
just something I ensure you
that when the comets
approach the Sun,
of course you got
the eruption occur.
So I believe this is something
due to the cavity being detuned
due to the plasma
environment change,
so just like the way I put my
hand close to the spherical ball
so the capacitor is detuned,
the whole circuit is detuned.
So from all
these observations,
now all the properties allow all types
of plasma waves to exist in space
in addition to an electromagnetic
one; which is electrostatic
and of course the thing
that I want to address
is the one that has
no magnetic field.
So for the electromagnetic wave propagation
it's called B, vector B here, is none
for electromagnetics
or light wave.
But for the electrostatics
now, there something exists
that could explain a
lot of phenomenons
which cannot be explained using
conventional understanding
such as Ion acoustic
wave, Plasma oscillation.
And I believe this
exists in space as well.
And I'm going to show you some
evidence of existence of such wave
in terms of, the connection
with natural disaster,
the thing I've been done
in the past 6 years.
First we go to the case study
of the Nepal earthquake,
magnitude of 7.8, occured on March
21st, sorry March 25th 2015.
During that time, if you
track the sunspot number,
we see that the sunspots
reach 10 weeks local maximum.
On March 19, approximately.
March 20 or 19.
And of course, we observed changing
climates during that time.
Those who live in equator attract, the
temperature during the time is extremely hot.
Near equator, about 24 to 48
hours before the earthquakes.
And those who have
observed such thing,
they know that earthquakes have a strong
ties to sudden change in the weather.
Of course, in the inner epicenter we
see extreme cold and windy condition.
If you ask the Nepal people, before,
right before the earthquakes.
If you look in space,
what we see is a strong coronal mass ejection
occuring between March 20 to March 23rd.
We've got M4 X-ray
flares on March 21st.
And of course, low level
of geomagnetic storm.
If we understand such connection,
that geomagnetic storm can be either ineffective
in terms of understanding the disconnection.
And of course during that time
we observed geocentric alignment
between Earth, Mercury and Mars.
We look into the timelines of
how this natural disaster arise.
We start from April 21st.
We observed non-Earth-directed
coronal mass ejection.
So again, the coronal mass
ejection in this model
is a symptom of a fluctuation
in resonant frequency.
It's happened to be right
at the peak of the sunspot.
So it highlighted in
the arrow area here.
Of course, during a time we have a Nepal
foreshock magnitude of 5.1 earthquakes,
we have a great volcanic
eruption in Chile,
largest eruption in many years,
and of course (we) followed
by another CMEs.
You can see that all this events
happen almost simultaneously.
Just like a travel
at speed of light.
And of course, about 3 days later
we observed the main shock,
earthquake in Nepal magnitude of 7.8.
A 3 days period, it matches with the speed of the
solar wind travel from the Sun to the Earth.
So the next case study is one
of the really famous case.
It's a Japan earthquake between
March 7 to March 11, 2011.
What's special about this case is that if you
look at the sunspot number graph on the top,
you see that's the highest sunspot
number in the last two years.
And it's also not only that.
It rise up rapidly almost expensed
exponentially in the past 30 days.
So this is highly significant
events to pay attention to.
And it reached the
maximum on March 8th.
During March 7, of course, we see
a massive coronal mass ejection
as well as
we see expansion of coronal holes
starting from March 7 through March 10.
If many of us have read
some literature, we also see
ionospheric heating around this time-
frame before the earthquakes in Japan.
Of course, there's a foreshock, happens
almost simultaneously within the day
of the high solar activity
events in terms of sunspots.
You see Japan foreshock
around 7.1 magnitudes
and then about 3 days later you got a
main shock of earthquakes. Magnitude's 9.1.
So again, it matches with the
speed of solar wind.
But again, if we pay attention
only to the direction of CMEs,
some must may have missed such an
opportunity to predict the earthquake.
And the last but not least is if
something happened during the maximum,
there's always something going
to happen during the minimum.
In this case, on December 23rd
between December 23rd 24th, 2004,
sunspot has switch to
10 weeks extreme minimum.
Around December
17 to December 28.
If we look at the
coronal mass ejection,
it became the most extreme and the
most intense on the 23rd of December.
Again, it's not (an)
Earth-directed CME.
And of course, if we looked
into the coronal hole data,
you see a sudden expansion of coronal
holes facing the Earth during that time.
And it started around
the 24th of December.
You zoom into the graph, you see the
same thing, same pattern repeated.
You got CME precursor, global
foreshock occuring on the 23rd
and of course the main shock
followed two and a half days later.
So we've got two effects here.
One is a simultaneous reaction
between the Sun and the Earth,
pretty much approaching
the speed of light,
and the other is the propagation
that takes about 2 to 4 days afterward.
So conclusion here is
that I propose a theory
of quantum vibrations and in
relation to solar system formation.
Such theory may help explain various
characteristics of the Sun and its surrounding space
as well as understanding how the
Earth interacts with the surrounding.
The evidence of quantum vibration can
be found in helio-seismic activities
and geo-seismic activities as well
as in comet interaction with Solar wind.
Of course, it suggests that the longitude wave
is, exists in space in both vacuum and plasma.
And there's an engineer that has
proved that the speed of light,
the longitude wave has
trouble at speed of light
which are going to
be mentioned later
in the next slide.
And of course the earthquake,
I'm talking about a very
strong significant earthquake,
or high frequency earthquake
that happened during one, some days.
It seems to be a direct evidence of
longitude energy vibration in space.
And of in course longitude
power coupling,
strong earthquake can occur without
the presence of geometric storm.
And it solved the mystery of
why we see strong earthquake
when there's no geomagnetic
storm in some cases.
I would like to (give) thanks to

vibration connection experiments,
same thing for Nassim Haramein.

Throughout our solar system, on rocky
planets, moons, asteroids, and comets
we see evidence for events never discussed
in standard geological textbooks.
We see carpets of highly circular,
cleanly cut craters and crater chains,
in defiance of the notion of periodic
bombardments shaping these rocky topographies.
We have suggested
that these features
have been carved by high-energy
electrical discharges,
a hypothesis supported by decades
of laboratory experiments.
On our own planet, we also see abundant
evidence for the geological influences
of a kind of cosmic lightning.
In these episodes, we are considering
that the complex processes
in electrical discharges
may help to explain
the extraordinary geology
of the American Southwest.
In the previous Space News,
Thunderbolts contributor Andrew Hall
proposed that a process known
as sputtering discharge
produced the amazing features in
Utah's Canyonlands called the Arches.
Today, Hall presents his case that
the same electrical processes
produced countless of the
spectacular, sharply cut features
seen throughout the
Colorado Plateau.
In Part 1 of
Sputtering Canyons,
we discussed Arches National Monument
and evidence it was formed
by a complex sputtering
discharge process.
That process involved a thermal spiking, barrier
discharge in a layer of wet sandstone.
In Part 2, we'll take a broader look
at some regions on the Colorado Plateau
where similar sputtering
discharge took place.
One of these is Monument Valley.
Monument Valley was formed
by sputtering discharge
that almost completely etched a
layer of the original dome away.
What is left are the lonely pinnacles
and buttes iconic to Western movies.
The reason these pinnacles
and buttes are left standing,
while the same layers of
sandstone etched away around them,
is due to preferential
sputtering.
Preferential sputtering is normally
associated with sputtering an alloyed metal
where one element in the alloy
sputters more efficiently,
eroding away faster than the
other alloy metal.
In Monument Valley, the buttes and pinnacles
left standing were portions of the dome
that resisted sputtering because of
a difference in charge density.
They were like the inefficient
alloy in the metal.
The part of the dome that lifted
away, did so when the wet layer --
the icing in the layer cake --
became a charged,
hot ionized mud.
A sheet of high charge density
developed at the base of the mud
with an attraction
to the clouds above --
and like an electromagnet
picks up a junk car --
the storm's electric field lifted away the
overburden to dissolve in electric winds.
The buttes and pinnacles are remnants that
didn't have the same charge in their wet layer,
so they didn't get pulled
away by the electric field.
The reason is: they were
struck by lightning.
In the dark mode, drifting plasma
current that causes sputtering,
there's always the
potential to spark.
Manufacturers are careful to avoid this
because it will flaw the finished surface,
it leaves imperfections.
The pinnacles and buttes are
these types of imperfections.
They were parts of the dome
where an arc or many arcs struck
and dissipated built-up charge.
It altered the ground charge
beneath the strike zone
so the electric field couldn't
pull the material away.
Therefore, the buttes and pinnacles
were preferentially -- not sputtered.
In the parlance of the
semiconductor industry,
the charge layer was doped by the
presence of water and minerals,
which gave it an
excess of electrons.
When lightning struck, it depleted the
charge and left an excess of "holes,"
or the absence of electrons
which canceled the attractive force
of the sputtering discharge.
The evidence for
this is manifold.
To begin, consider the cap rock
formations and spires found on buttes.
Butte tops aren't flat.
They generally have something like a
step pyramid, dome or pinnacle on top,
which is where lightning
discharge struck most intensely.
Notice in the images
below the pyramidal caps.
The rock below the caps is darkened
significantly more than the adjacent stone.
Not only is there black patina,
but there is also more redness to the
rock itself in streaks below the caps,
with deep vertical fracturing.
The charge depletion from lightning,
and the subsequent recombination of
the most severely depleted
zones beneath where it struck,
heated, shocked and hardened the rock
more in these areas than in others.
The step pyramid structure or
terracing on canyon walls and buttes
is another evidence
of sputtering.
Each sedimentary layer has different
compositions of minerals and moisture,
differentiating the dielectric
property of each layer.
The zone of charge depletion
under lightning strikes
spreads out in a conical
diffusion pattern,
but the cone is
stepped or terraced
because there is a step voltage
across each dielectric layer.
Where there are towering cliffs
with sheer vertical walls,
it's because a monolithic layer
with a consistent dielectric
caused a single
large voltage step.
Where there is very hard rock,
the edges we'll find are
torn in chunky blocks.
The flat, smooth breaks are not the result
of millions of years of erosion of any type --
wind, rain, ice, exfoliation,
or flowing water.
Any of those actions would
have the opposite effect,
roughening the surfaces
and rounding the edges.
These rocks have such smooth, flat faces,
and sharp, angular, undercut edges
because they were broken
by mechanical shearing
as the neighboring rock
was ripped away.
Evidence of shearing is especially
evident on monolithic walls.
Sharp-edged breaks are everywhere,
leaving smooth, flat faces,
hardly roughened, or rounded
by any act of erosion.
Arching fissures are
evidence of spalling,
where the material
tore away in flakes,
cupped upward in the
direction of shear.
The arches often show
concentric creases
where flakes broke away in smaller
sections deeper into the rock.
One can see the same type of
concentric flaking in broken glass.
In some places, the canyon walls
have that look of broken glass
but in others it looks more like the
broken end of a brick of hard cheese.
Perhaps a well-aged Parmesan --
stiff, dry and flaky,
but with a low shear strength.
There is almost always a thin layer
of hardened rock at the interface
between each terrace.
This is where charge accumulated at
the boundary layer of the strata
and the current hardened the charged sheet
of rock more so than the surroundings.
Each dielectric layer spreads
charge to the interface of its layer,
driven by the electric field, to balance
the voltage drop across that layer.
So a charged sheet develops at
the interface of each layer,
and a step voltage
to the next layer,
which creates a surface
tension at the interface,
which makes the
rock hard and dense.
What is sandwiched between is
often loosely consolidated.
Pinnacles in this region, Monument
Valley, occur in two different types.
There are fulgurites, like the
burnt shard of Agathla peak
which are the direct
result of lightning
striking the earth and boiling up the
crust in an electromagnetic blister.
These types of pinnacles were discussed in
Lightning-Scarred Earth, parts 1 and 2.
Sandstone pinnacles are
where lightning struck
and altered the charge
in the rock beneath it,
creating an electrical 'shadow'
to sputtering discharge.
They are literally the
shadow of lightning strikes.
Now, the footprint of a brief
strike, comparatively speaking,
produces a narrow
cone of protection.
How the cone slopes and steps depends
on properties of the rock layers
and the electric field potential,
but more sustained,
or potent striking
begins to diffuse charge
depletion outward from the cone,
forming nodes or star-like
breakouts, formed horizontally.
Still larger accumulations of
strikes diffuse charge further,
and these nodules break out into
'wings' or dikes of charge depleted rock.
The shadow footprint grows
as arcing continues,
elongating charge depleted
zones into wedges
with dikes growing out
the tips and edges.
This is actually the beginning
of a fractal dendrite,
as lightning bombardment soaks
the charge from the ground
diffusing outward in branches and creating
a depleted zone protected from sputtering.
If the process were to continue before the
surrounding sputtered away completely,
the dendrite nodules would grow and branch
in ever smaller fractal repetitions,
like branches of a tree.
As adjacent rock is struck,
the depleted zones connect into networks
of wedges, ridges, and pinnacles.
Generally, the pinnacles and buttes
left on a dome are layered flat,
but in some areas
buttes display a dip,
a slant to their slope,
indicating horizontal winds
influenced the deposition.
Sputtering follows
the voltage gradient,
and so carves away from the lightning
depleted zone in alignment with the strata
because the voltage gradient
follows the dielectric layers,
cutting at 90 degrees
to the dip angle
and leaving a straight-edged, non-
vertical wall like this mountain.
If this mountain were eroded by conventional
notions of wind rain and mass wasting,
the rock would obey gravity
and erode in a vertical wall.
It's in details like this that
prove electrical formation.
What we see in the stepped
pyramids and terraced canyons
is the result of two types of charge
transport in a solid-state matter.
One is called drift ionization caused by
the external electric field of the storm,
and the other is called
diffusion current
caused by differences in charge density
within the material of the dome itself.
Drift current is the flow of charge created
by the external electric field of the storm,
which primarily drives the
ionized region downward,
vertically through the
layers of sandstone.
Drift currents obey Ohm's Law.
Diffusion currents obey Fick's Law,
which is related to Ohm's Law
but accounts for
variations in charge density
that causes ionization to migrate from
a region of high charge concentration
to a region of lower
concentration.
No external electric field is
needed for diffusion current
because the difference in charge
concentrations creates a gradient
between those regions that results
in a local electric field.
And that's what this
diffusion responds to.
It's the primary process that
migrates charge horizontally --
spreading through each
layer of sandstone.
What gets carved away by sputtering
leaves distinct scalloped edges
in very dry, low
conductivity material?
The scalloping is a fractal
phenomenon of electrical diffusion
that repeats the scallop
shape in ever larger scallops.
In wetter environments, it's not as
apparent, or it may be totally absent,
because water diffuses
charge more evenly,
which creates smoother,
rounder surfaces.
Compelling evidence the scalloped and
terraced walls are a result of charge diffusion
is shown in this image, where the
archetype of all fractal shapes emerges --
the Mandelbrot Set.
Although it's not a computer perfect rendition
of the Mandelbrot Set, it's nearly so.
It's a naturally generated fractal based
on the same mathematical relationships
of iterating
three-dimensional motion
that governs electrical charge diffusion
in solid-state electronics.
It appears on this canyon wall
with nodes and vine-hair-like
structures growing outward
in exactly the same formation and
orientation as the Mandelbrot Set does.
The implication is obvious.
The shape of the canyon walls, the
terracing, the fractal repetition of form --
everything known about
applied physics dictates
this is the result of electrical current
diffusion on a continent-scale semiconductor
under the influence of a
gigantic electric field.
The physics is not
only laboratory proven,
it's been used to make every
semiconductor device ever manufactured.
In fact, geophysicists and
even Hollywood CGI artists,
simulate geologic forms like
watersheds and river systems,
canyons and mountains,
using the fractal geometry
of electrical diffusion.
So, what is being described here has
been acknowledged by consensus science.
The scientific conclusion that these landforms
are the result of electrical diffusion
caused by an intense electric
field influencing Earth's crust,
in an event and the manner
Electric Universe theorists
have described since
Immanuel Velikovsky
is scientifically unavoidable.
Yet avoid it they do --
consensus science, that is.
To quote from a Wikipedia
article on diffusion,
"Analytical and numerical models
that solve the diffusion equation
for different initial
and boundary conditions
have been popular for studying a wide
variety of changes to the Earth's surface.
Diffusion has been used extensively in
erosion studies of hillslope retreat,
bluff erosion, fault scarp degradation,
wave-cut terrace/shoreline retreat,
alluvial channel incision, coastal
shelf retreat, and delta progradation.
Although the Earth's surface is not
literally diffusing in many of these cases,
the process of diffusion
effectively mimics
the holistic changes that occur
over decades to millennia."
Let me just repeat
the last sentence.
"Although the Earth's surface is not
literally diffusing in many of these cases,
the process of diffusion
effectively mimics
the holistic changes that occur
over decades to millennia."
So, what they're saying is they
think it's just a coincidence.
Rather than conclude in a
proper scientific fashion
that electrical current diffusion has
a role in shaping the landscape,
they conclude it's just
an amazing coincidence.
One hates to be critical to
hard-working geophysicists
but to have an empirically proven
answer staring you in the face
and ignore it in favor of
a preferred narrative,
is what a politician
does, not a scientist.
The idea that diffusion
"mimics the holistic changes
that occur over decades to
millennia" is really absurd.
Diffusion is caused by charge transport
from higher to lower concentrations.
Conventional erosive forces of water, wind
and ice act on the land from the outside in,
not from the inside out.
Diffusion is an
inside-out process
from the atomic level outward as
charges migrate from atom to atom.
So there are notions
that violate physics
but they call it a
coincidence instead.
Fortunately, in the EU we
like to deal in truths.
So in Part 3, we'll examine a few more
examples of sputtering canyon evidence.
Thank you.

You've just entered the
theater of an alien sky.
If the words and images seem strange to
you there's a reason for this.
Our world was once a vastly different
place.
To experience this won't hurt you and
there is nothing to fear.
The subject of this video series is the
ancient experience of towering
celestial forms that
are no longer present.
Worldwide testimony points to
planets extremely close to Earth
and gathered in close congregation.
We've called this gathering of
planets the Polar Configuration
because it was centered at the celestial
pole, around which the heavens visually turn.
The huge sphere of Saturn filled the circumpolar sky.
Close to the centre of Saturn stood
another body, the planet Venus,
discharging electrically, the streamers of
this discharge stretching upward across
the face of Saturn. And seen in
front of Venus was a smaller, darker
reddish sphere, the planet Mars.
At a critical juncture, a crescent cast
by light from the Sun,
appeared on Saturn rotating in an awe-inspiring cycle of day and night.
That's because the axis at the Earth was
aligned to that of the assembled bodies,
causing the configuration
to rotate visually
above observers in the northern
hemisphere, exploding into life at sunset,
the beginning of the
archaic day of the gods.
Yes! The claims are outrageous,
but also extraordinarily specific leaving
no doubt as to what the ancient evidence
should look like, in stark
contrast to all common opinion
about the ancient past. From a single
snapshot of the configuration,
seen here, we can work backwards to the
first appearance of these bodies out of
an undifferentiated cloud
or sea of dusty plasma. We can follow the
configuration's evolution through phases
that range from quasi-stability
to earth-shaking catastrophe. In these
presentations, we will suggest that all of
the mythic and symbolic archetypes
can be explained by the
presence of these bodies,
their electrical exchanges
in a plasma medium,
and their relative movements
in relation to each other.
Intense electric discharge formation
stretched between the gathered bodies,
transitioning from one form to another.
First to emerge was the triangular, or
threefold, discharge form of Venus -
interpreted mythically as
the name of the creator,
or 3 goddesses in one,
a widely acknowledged
archetype still unexplained. Here three
goddesses reveal their triangular form
with their entwined fingers, but the
variations on the ancient theme are almost
endless. And the initial
three-faced form is inseparable
from the identity of
Venus as the emerging,
radiant Great Star. The ancient astronomies
name the components of this dynamic
configuration as planets.
Different sizes and colors, and changing
relationships to each other.
The shock comes from seeing the described events
in the demanding terms of 3-dimensional perspective
where relative movement said the bodies dramatically
alter the visual appearance of the configuration.
No room for arbitrary explanations. With
the later displacement from it's polar
position, the configuration was seen
well into the southern hemisphere.
Electric discharge forms metamorphosed
violently above human witnesses
providing us with a stunning
comparison to plasma instabilities
seen in laboratory experiments.
Our message comes down to
one overriding conclusion:
Things anciently remembered bear no
similarity to the commonly accepted
picture the ancient sky.
In a former time, our world was
indeed a much different place ...

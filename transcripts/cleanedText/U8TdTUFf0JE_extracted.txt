Welcome to Space News from
the Electric Universe,

Thunderbolts Projectâ„¢

For nearly half a century, the chief
principals of The Thunderbolts Project
have been presenting a scientific case for
relatively recent celestial catastrophes
in the inner solar system,
within human memory.
These events were
recorded in the myths
and storytelling of ancient
man in prehistory.
The dramas reverberating through generations
and shaping the earliest civilizations.
The catastrophes were
electromagnetic in nature.
Planets seen in the earthly
sky discharging electrically,
the Thunderbolts of the gods.
But what about more recent
disasters in the AD time periods?
Disasters that also may have
been triggered by fundamentally
electromagnetic phenomena
in the solar system.
In recent episodes, Thunderbolts
colleague Peter Mungo Jupp
has explored the voluminous evidence
for the electrical nature of comets.
As Jupp has noted,
it is an unlikely coincidence that
mankind viewed comets for millennia
as harbingers of
doom and destruction.
In modern times, we witnessed the spectacular
influence of a comet on a planet
in Shoemaker-Levy 9's close
encounter with Jupiter.
In this episode, Jupp offers
the provocative conjecture
that such an encounter between our
own planet and a cometary intruder
may have caused an AD disaster that caused the
death of tens of millions of human beings,
the so-called plague
of Justinian.
Thomas Short, writing in the 18th
century, chronicled the many calamities
that had decimated mankind
over the last 4,000 years.
Earthquakes, plagues, pestilence,
incredibly overwhelming floods.
But as you read through
this curious book
you were intrigued by the number of
comets associated with these dramas
unmatched in modern history.
In the early century of the
present era, the Romans at one time
counted 50 comets
in their skies.
This is unheard of today. With the skies
over Rome at the end of a bloody era,
that only in recent centuries
has become stabilized,
can there be bones of
truth in this mythology?
They're invariably connected
to the major disasters
and up until the 1800's mankind
held a fear of comets.
What happened?
Then the age of reason struck and incredibly,
the number of highly visible comets shrunk.
Has something happened?
Eventually, by the end of the 20th
century, it became scientific dogma
the Comets were dusty snowballs.
How incredibly wrong this early
scientific theory has been proven
by modern science and its
observation of comets!
So we've seen the dramatic effects comets
can have on at least Jupiter and the Sun.
But what about the planets
and particularly Earth?
Have comets in the past had
dramatic effects on Earth?
And this is where we come to plague, war,
flood, earthquakes, pestilence and famine.
Has in fact the cosmos; in the form of
comets, the Sun, planets in disturbed motion,
all the outer reaches of the universe;
affected Earth and caused chaos?
Has in fact this
occurred on the Earth?
Have comets caused the
demise of civilizations?
Claude Schaeffer documented at least
six destructions of civilizations
prior to the Christian era
spanning at least 2,000 years.
But did later lower scale calamities
also affect civilizations?
I suspect yes.
So now let's go the first of
these more recent deadly events.
1500 years ago, a pungent plague
nearly exterminated mankind.
The Emperor Justinian from Constantinople
gave his name to this empire wrecker.
Thomas Short wrote, from 560 AD
a plague raged for 52 years
the like of which has
never been seen before.
Conventional wisdom maintains
this war by plague
began in Ethiopia and was carrried by
ship-borne rats to Europe and beyond.
And we don't forget with our new
knowledge of bacteria and viruses
being carried by vectors
far above the earth,
this theory of deployment
has been questioned.
Our pertinent scrutiny ask not only
what caused this exterminating plague
with its incredible and
unmatched virulence
but whether some parallel catastrophic
events had a similar foundational driver.
How Deadly was the
Justinian Plague?
It was totally
chaotic in nature.
It's struck in many different seasons
with its virulence and invasiveness
change from city to city
and amongst every age group and gender
it was ruthlessly indiscriminate
and even if you survived,
no immunity was guaranteed
upon the next episode.
Death was usually within three
days from multiple causes,
buboes and high fever,
carbuncles and suicidal madness.
But quick and immediate death.
The mortality rate was horrific
when compared to modern experiences
of plague or any other pathology.
Short says, for instance, than in ancient
Constantinople, that's Istanbul,
10,000 people died a day
when the plague struck.
Placing this dreadful scourge aside
and examining parallel events,
we find some remarkable
coincidences.
During this plague period, no less than
9 highly visible comets were seen.
Weird, blood-colored flashing skies
and strangely multiple suns
often accompanied
this scenario.
Also associated were 10 incredibly
destructive earthquake storms,
for instance Antioch
200,000 dead,
and 7 worldwide mega famines.
Accompanying this were totally
chaotic and unseasonal weather
with cataclysmic inundations
by water, wind and temperatures.
Now this stage, I emphasize,
these famines and other dramas
were not normal occurrences.
For instance on several occasion, Short
notes, the famines were so devastating
that women horrifically ate or
sold their own children to survive.
In the widespread earthquakes
whole towns were swallowed up
and lakes formed and cities burned.
Was this perhaps from methane seepage
or massive lightning storms plasmoids?
Are these parallel
events associated?
The possibility of an Electro-universe
connection should be considered.
For instance, what drives
the virulence of bacteria?
Stimulation of growth and degradation
by ions, neutrons, electrons
and the spectrum of electromagnetic
radiation are claimed from various sources.
That's what place do not only solar events
have to play in bacterial invasiveness
but possibly of mankind's
classically dreaded Comet.
Comets, although they travel fairly
well-defined elliptical orbits,
are virtually
undecoded phenomena.
Some passed by the Sun
harmlessly, some disintegrate
and break into many sections,
such as Shoemaker-Levy 9
when it collided with Jupiter.
Others grazed by the Sun
with little known effects. Whereas occasionally
some bury themselves into Sun
and appear to translate to coronal
mass ejections on the opposite side.
The factors governing this seemingly, but
probably not, chaotic behavior is a mystery.
Have we come to understand
they are negatively charged,
somewhat like a mobile z-pinch?
They must therefore interrelate
to other electrets.
But the methodology of this
behavior is merely speculation
and certainly Shorts' novels
show anecdotal evidence
and suggest just this
inferred behavior
of these 9 spectacular comets that
occurred during the Justinian plague.
Now equally we're satisfied
that earthquakes
are shaped in some way
by electrical phenomena.
It's always been a puzzle to where
do an earthquake comes from.
The energy comes from the stored
electric charge within the earth.
If a discharge takes place
beneath the earth
then you must get effects on
the surface that are felt
and the earthquake is
one such consequence.
- Right, so it's just like thunder
- Underground, yes
Finally, weather is more and more being
seen as an electrical phenomena,
certainly by EU advocates.
In addition, chaos theory maintains that
outside attractors establish a new harmonic.
These constantly adjusting perhaps radically
adjusting electromagnetic influences
are the central cause of heavily
chaotic unceasing and extreme weather
such as floods.
This in turn causes dramatic
famine and drought.
From all these possibly related events
Short quotes, "two-thirds of all people died."
This is a summary from one of his
primary sources, The Chronicle Magdeburg.
This Justinian plague was preceded often by the
appearance of several suns at the same time.
Other times, the Sun was quite darkened.
A comet appeared a whole year together
adding forth its beams like swords.
The heavens seemed all the flame
and several other medias fell.
Nowadays we automatically dismiss
this evidence from a bygone era
as fanciful, exaggerated
and primitive.
But there's bigger questions
here. Could these cosmic dramas
that influence weather
also be driving plagues,
locusts, inundations, earthquakes
and the very wars of mankind.
And the big unanswered question, comets.
Historically, always feared
in man's history of legends.
If a comet can hit
Jupiter, Shoemaker-Levy 9,
or a comet can cause the
Sun to have a massive CME,
could not they too be involved
in this cosmic drama
that affects weather,
plague and earthquakes.
Unanswered questions
needing more investigation.

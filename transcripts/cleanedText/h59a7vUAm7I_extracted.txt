What causes energetic emissions from
galactic cores? According to a recent
press release, there is a so-called
"supermassive black hole" at the center of
the Milky Way that is tearing stars
apart and flinging the remains into
space at speeds of 10,000 kilometers per
second. The shredded stars then coalesce
into planet-sized objects with masses
that can exceed 2Ã—10^37
kilograms, or as much as ten
Jupiters. It is not from observational
data that the concept is derived. It is
from computer models designed to
simulate someone's idea about what might
be going on with the supermassive black
hole Sagittarius A (should such a thing
exist). Eden Girma, an undergraduate
student at Harvard University wrote: "A
single shredded star can form hundreds of
these planets-mass objects. We wondered;
where do they end up? How close do they
come to us? We developed a computer code
to answer those questions." There are
thought to be thousands of "free- floating"
planets wandering through space.
Why? It is because of how stars and
planets theoretically form.
Protoplanetary disks, as consensus
understanding sees them, are prone to
collisions among their evolving clumps
of matter until they settle down into
stable arrangements. Some of those clumps condense
into gas giants or rocky bodies, while others
are destroyed. However, astronomers
believe that many of these new planets
are subsequently expelled from their
systems.
The literature suggests that
free-floating planets might exceed the
number associated with stars. The ultimate
answer, though, is that they do not know.
As the announcement from Harvard
University states: "those newly minted
planets are probably different from
those that evolved 'naturally'". The
researchers borrow a term from Carl
Sagan, and state that they are made of
"star-stuff", so their ingredients
will not be the same because different
parts of exploded stars will form
different planetary objects. The question
is, how to tell them apart?
There are significant problems with both
ideas, protoplanetary evolution, as well
as black holes, in general. Black holes
cannot be seen by the most powerful
telescopes and radiation sensors, but
astrophysicists continue to maintain
that they exist because of their effects.
They assume that matter is accelerated
and compressed until it is
"spaghettified" or stretched inside the
so-called "event horizon" until it is torn
apart and reconfigured into more "rogue
planets". Since almost all (more
than 95%) of galaxies are said
to be home to one or more black holes,
they might all be shooting
"spitballs" at us from vast distances.
Since matter spins around a black hole at
extreme velocities, consensus opinions
state that it heats up from friction,
generating X-rays and ultraviolet light.
It is those emissions that are
interpreted as indirect evidence for
black holes. Previous Pictures of the Day
take issue with both aspects of this new
computer model. The terminology, itself,
is highly speculative and ambiguous.
Protoplanetary discs and gravitational
tides, for example, are invoked in order
to explain how stars are destroyed and
remade. To say that X-rays and
ultraviolet light in space are created
in gravity fields is to betray an
ignorance. Experiments in the laboratory
create those energies by accelerating
charged particles in an electric field.
There is no experiment that can provide
evidence for matter collapse to
"near infinite density". Rather, Bennett
pinches (or z-pinches) in plasma-
state material
form plasmoids that then become stars.
When the electric flux inside double
layers within galactic circuits gets too
high, there is a sudden "short circuit" that
draws energy from the surrounding space.
That energy could be concentrated from
hundreds of cubic light-years and then
discharged in a burst of cosmic
lightning, generating X-rays or flares of
ultraviolet light. X-ray radiation from
a plasmoid in the Milky Way's heart is
the same as from stars undergoing strong
electrical stresses. A plasmoid is a
charged particle accelerator, so electrons
spiral in the electromagnetic field and
give off X-rays. The diffuse currents then
flow toward the galaxy's equatorial plane
and spiral back toward the core. In an
Electric Universe, electromagnetism is
more than able to create celestial
phenomena, without the supernatural
physics of supermassive black holes.
Plasma discharge events are commonly
known to generate high energy light. The
greater the electric charge flow, the
higher the frequency of light will be
emitted. Supply enough power and even
gamma rays are released.

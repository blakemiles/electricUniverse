You've just entered the
theater of an alien sky.
If the words and images seem strange
to you there's a reason for this,
our world was once
a vastly different place.
To experience this won't hurt you
and there is nothing to fear.
Twin Worlds-
-Above and Below
Egypt: The god Atum, remembered
as the creator and primeval sun
In our previous episode we considered
the Egyptian stories of creation,
an original unity named as the god Atum
gave way to a separation,
a division into regions
above and below,
but lacking any
concrete referent
most translators render the two
regions vaguely as heaven and earth
or Heaven resting on an ambiguous
horizon or twin peaked mountain.
A global archetype:
"The separation of heaven and earth"
Global variations on the ancient
theme repeat this remarkable idea
and in-numerable
interpretations of the theme
have been published in both
popular and academic media.
Under the common interpretation the ancient
language itself is left permanently obscure
whereas in the most ancient
sources highly concrete forms
and a spectacular shift in the cosmic
environment are consistently emphasized.
In this series of Discourses we follow
a different line of interpretation,
we can act ancient myths and global symbols
to extraordinary formations in the sky.
The so-called creation has
long been misunderstood;
creation was a remembered event when
visible powers revered as gods,
appeared to construct a vast
habitation in the Heavens.
In the language of the myths
an emergence occurred,
a differentiation and clarification of
form where no form previously existed.
The language for the original
condition typically emphasizes chaos
- not in the usual meaning
of that term today
but in the sense of dimness, fog or clouds,
celestial waters, a pre-dawn glow.
No implication of turbulence, no
hint of conflict or wars of the gods
all of which came later; the first
meaning of the word chaos was formless.
In the Egyptian stories,
the creator Atumn
was immersed in the boundless
waters of the deep
- originally inactive and
lacking any distinctive form.
Then in the acts of creation
he acquired external limbs
through the explosive ejection of
visible outflow called words of power;
the text say the God gave birth to himself
through this acquisition of external form.
Words of Atum: "I am alone in the night. Icreated
my own creation, gave birth to my own beginning."
More specifically, as we've noted in
our reconstruction of these events,
this form was provided by
the God's lower limbs,
his resting place, his
perch - the cosmic pillar.
The pillar is in fact a center
piece of antique creation stories
and it connects us to the
archetypal sub-structure,
a foundational human experience from
which all of the ancient cultures arose.
It's here that we encounter the so
called separation of Heaven and Earth,
the words are all too familiar but
nothing close to an explanation
or even an accurate use of words has ever
appeared in scholarly studies of this theme.
We've offered a testable explanation
in our historical reconstruction
- based on the earliest
astronomical traditions.
It begins with an ancient gathering
of planets close to the Earth.
We've called this planetary
assembly the Polar Configuration
and our claim is that the early
cultures recorded its distinctive forms
with every tool
available to them -
long before a language of stable
planetary motions was even possible.
Given the specificity of
our visual reconstruction
it can be readily tested against
a vast cross-cultural consensus.
The cosmic mountain or pillar consistently
meant the resting place of a visible power
remembered the world over as the Creator,
the figure named also as a primeval Sun
and identified in the early astronomical
traditions as the planet Saturn.
But in the prior historic context the
monumental cultures knew these powers
simply as the ruling Gods.
So as we've seen, the Egyptian
priests could declare -
"The Great God Lives Fixed in the
middle of the sky Upon his support."
and this central power Atum could
announce with perfect consistency -
"I am raised aloft on my perch
above yonder places of the Abyss".
In the original mythic context the
Abyss meant the cosmic waters,
the primeval ocean of Nu, the very
waters penetrated by the cosmic pillar
to give Atum both his resting
place and his external form.
In our reconstruction it is the
crescent arms of the pillar God,
standing out in a critical phase
of the Polar Configuration,
that visually divided the great sphere
of Saturn into upper and lower regions.
By following that surprising conclusion the
ancient sources will never disappoint us.
And so we find in this archaic symbolism
the origins of the Atlas theme;
a theme coming down to
us in many variations
but here too conventional treatments of the
subject lack any content and actual experience,
that's why the ground we've covered in
earlier Discourses is so essential.
In the daily revolution of this crescent we
see the original form of the cosmic twins.
Just as the twins to the
left and right signified
contrasting positions of the
crescent in the daily cycle,
so did the symbolism of above and below in
the same cycle of an archaic day and night.
Archetypal crescent of the Polar
Configuration in its "midnight" position,
the supreme moment in the archaic "day"
Here we discovered the archetypal
meaning of the Egyptian words Neter Ta
- the divine land, God's land - designated
as two lands, more accurately -
the twin lands, since as we should expect,
this symbolism is inseparable from that
of the cosmic twins -
we've also discussed.
In this case the emphasis is on
the revolving crescent positions
above and below in
the daily cycle.
In Egypt the meaning of these
opposing crescent positions
was localized in the symbolism
of Upper and Lower Egypt;
the original inspiration lay
not in terrestrial context
but in sacred cosmography symbolically
projected onto geography,
the cosmic map of the holy land
in the sky was the prototype
reflected in sacred temple
cities and kingdoms on Earth
- always directing our attention
back to the twin powers of Heaven.
The celestial model was by
no means limited to Egypt,
all mythic archetypes
traced to a unified source;
sometimes complex but always
leaving an imprint, a signature,
a fundamental and lasting
contribution to human thought
and religious practices
the world over.
Central star, axial pillar and revolving
crescent in the Polar Configuration
For the Sumerians and Babylonians the agent
of the cosmic separation was the giant Enlil,
in a fashion he was really similar
to that of the Egyptian Shu,
Enlil divided a primeval unity into
two regions--one above, one below.
The word for that unity was AnKi, a combination
of the very words for above and below,
An; The Above and Ki; The Below.
As in the story of
the pillar God Shu
the Sumerian priest declared
that it was the pillar God Enlil
that separated An and Ki.
This curious theme is
well worth following;
how did it happen that in so many
creation accounts the world over,
a fabulous pillar arises to separate an
original unity into upper and lower divisions.
Such memories coming down to us from
every corner of the ancient world
can only reinforce
our conclusion
that the mythic archetypes
originated in an unfamiliar world,
virtually no connection whatsoever to the
celestial environment we experience today.
In all of this a key consideration
must be driven home;
the ancient star worshippers did not just see
a giant sphere in the Heavens above them,
they did not just see a Heaven reaching
column appearing to hold that sphere aloft;
the polar configuration had a
central definition
including the vertical column's
universal link to a revolving crescent.
Follow today's common
assumptions and the entire idea
of such a concrete global
theme is preposterous
and yet as we explore the ancient context
letting words mean what they say,
the implications become
ever more clear.
Always look for the
underlying form!

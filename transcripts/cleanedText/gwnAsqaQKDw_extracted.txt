21st century astrophysicists
hold to an astounding belief
that purely gravitational
phenomena are the cause
of unfathomably powerful electromagnetic
energies and emissions in deep space.
Consensus scientific theory maintains
that mechanical and kinetic processes,
collisions, explosions, gravitational
collapse and heating
produce mysterious magnetism which
causes the measured electrical effects.
From the extraordinarily
densely packed neutrons,
which are thought to compose
magnetized spinning neutron stars
which produce pulsing
radio and X-ray emissions
or supermassive stars
going supernova
collapsing into black holes and producing
extraordinary gamma-ray bursts
or the nearly infinite
compression of matter
that is thought to
constitute a black hole,
these theoretical phenomena
have been exhaustively codified
through mathematical modeling
and supercomputer simulations
and imposing sums
of taxpayer money
have been spent on the most
sophisticated technologies
resulting in tweaks to the models
rather than testing alternatives.
What experimentalists observe
in nature and the laboratory
is of secondary importance in
gravito-centric cosmology
whose symbol of genius
remains the mathematician.
No clearer example of this can be seen than
in the standard astrophysical interpretation
of the largest scale lightning
observed in the universe.
As we will see,
lightning is indeed
the only valid interpretation
of the spectacular phenomena.
In our recent installment
of our series,
The Top 10 Reasons the
Universe is Electric,
we discussed the "mysterious
nature of cosmic jets".
From the light-years long filamentary
jets of so-called Herbig-Haro objects
to extra-galactic radio jets that stretch
for hundreds of thousands of light-years
and even beyond,
what mechanism is capable of
producing these high energy jets
across such
spectacular distances
and what confines the jets
and prevents the material from
dispersing in the "vacuum of space"?
Astrophysicists have never
successfully explained the phenomena
and a new scientific
report only underscores
the desperate need for
new theoretical pathways.
On October 16th, 2017, the website phys.org
reported on the cosmic jet of a quasar
that stretches for an
incredible 300,000 light years.
The report begins by misrepresenting a
popular theory as an unassailable fact.
It states,
"Quasars are galaxies with massive
black holes at their cores."
From this one belief it seems inevitable
that only confusion can follow.
The report describes
scientists' ongoing struggle
to explain the X-ray emissions of the
collimated bipolar jets from quasars as follows,
"Even after more than two
decades of study, however,
there is still no clear conclusion
as to the physical mechanism
actually responsible for
the X-ray emission."
On the jets' electrical nature, a vital clue
is found in the report's following statement,
"Both the magnetic field strength
and the particle velocities
are (remarkably) quite constant all
along the length of this jet..."
Of course, both the constancy of the jets'
particle velocities and magnetic field strength
are the undeniable
hallmarks of lightning.
However, since astronomers
hold to the unbending belief
that electricity causes
nothing in space
including unfathomably
powerful electrical discharges,
the confusion only deepens with
ever finer technological data.
A perfect example can be seen
in a 2015 NASA Hubble report
which describes a so-called shock collision
of mysterious knots inside a "black hole jet".
A Hubble time-lapse video
shows the knots in the jet
which form like
"pearls on a string".
The report begins,
"When you're blasting through space at
more than 98% of the speed of light,
you may need driver's insurance.
Astronomers have discovered for the
first time a rear-end collision
between two high-speed
knots of ejected matter."
The report continues,
"Such extragalactic jets
are not well understood.
They appear to transport energetic
plasma in a confined beam
from the active nucleus
of the host galaxy.
The new analysis suggests that shocks
produced by collisions within the jet
further accelerate particles and brighten
the regions of colliding material."
Of course, the collimated
and knotty form of the jets
are the well-documented signatures
of electrical discharges in plasma.
As we will see as we continue,
it is not a coincidence
that both stars and galaxies
form like pearls on a string
and the plasma filaments
connecting galaxies
are now a subject of growing
scientific investigation.
In the Electric Universe it is not a supermassive
black hole at the center of a galaxy
but a doughnut-shaped
object called a plasmoid
which unlike a black hole has
a proven physical reality.
In plasma laboratories on Earth,
a plasmoid is an ultra-high
density energy storage phenomenon.
Electric currents flow equatorially
inward to the plasmoid
where energy is stored
electromagnetically.
The Electric Universe
model proposes simply
that so much concentrated energy
is stored in the galactic plasmoid
that it may be the
compact source
whose mass is attributed to
a hypothetical black hole.
As the plasmoid's charge density increases
along the axis of the "doughnut",
it creates the well-known plasma
feature called a double layer
which can explode or
release energy axially
in the form of cosmic jets and
other spectacular emissions.
The scalability of plasma phenomena is of
course paramount in cosmic investigations.
The Nobel Prize winner and father
of plasma cosmology Hannes Alfvén
proposed that plasma phenomena can be scaled
to an incredible 28 orders of magnitude.
In fact, in 1986 Alfvén spoke
at a NASA sponsored conference
on the astrophysical role
of double layers.
He stated,
"Double layers in space should be classified
as a new type of celestial object
(one example is the
double radio sources).
It is tentatively suggested
that X-ray and gamma-ray bursts
may be due to exploding
double layers."
In the aforementioned
NASA report,
the authors proposed that heating
and mysterious magnetism
are responsible for the jets'
velocities and collimation.
They state,
"One theory is that material
falling onto the central object
is superheated and ejected
along the object's spin axis.
Powerful magnetic fields constrain
the material into a narrow jet."
But of course, super
heating alone
does not explain the origins and
extraordinary velocities of the jets;
and why the magnetic field should
exist at all to confine the jets
remains completely unexplained
in standard theory.
As we've outlined in
many recent episodes,
cosmic scale magnetic fields
were, until very recently,
considered to be "not important"
in standard astrophysics.
So it's not surprising that countless
scientific reports in the last decade
feature expressions of surprise
and perplexity from astronomers
who are detecting magnetism
everywhere throughout the cosmos.
The perplexity must continue
until astronomers integrate
a simple law of physics:
electric currents
produce magnetic fields.
Today we are seeing the inevitable confirmation
of the electrical nature of cosmic jets.
As we've reported previously,
in 2011 a team of scientists
measured the electric current
in the jet shooting
from the galaxy 3C303.
They estimated the strength of the
current at 10¹⁸ (10 to the 18th power) amps
or the equivalent of a
trillion bolts of lightning.
Of course, the team still holds to the
theory that a supermassive black hole
ultimately produces the
spectacular electric current.
But, as we've also
recently reported,
at an even greater cosmic scale
it has become undeniable
that the electrical cosmic jets
have nothing to do with black holes.
In 2016 a Royal Astronomical Society press
release reported the discovery that
"...supermassive black holes in a
region of the distant universe
are all spinning out radio
jets in the same direction..."
A lead investigator, professor
Romeel Dave said of the findings,
"This is not obviously expected based on
our current understanding of cosmology.
It's a bizarre finding."
The problem for proponents
of black hole theory
is that, at these incredible
cosmic distances,
no mechanism exists to affect
the directionality of the jets.
Unfortunately, rather
than pausing to question
the very existence of the
hypothetical black holes,
which have never been
observed by anyone,
the researchers proposed the ad-hoc theory
that the spin alignment of the galaxies
must have somehow occurred
in the early universe
causing the black holes to
spin in the same direction.
But in the Electric Universe, such cosmic
alignments are in fact predicted and required
if the dominant organizational
force is electromagnetism.
Space, across the vastest
cosmic distances,
has a substructure of
twisted-pair current filaments
with stars and galaxies forming
along them like pearls on a string
and having their spin axes
aligned along their filament.
Science discovery continues
to confirm this prediction.
In 2015, scientists using the
Herschel Space Observatory
reported the detection
in unprecedented detail
of filamentary structures
throughout the Milky Way galaxy.
A phys.org report
states of the finding,
"...One of the key aspects that
emerged from these observations
is the presence of a
filamentary network
nearly everywhere in our
Galaxy's interstellar medium.
The picture that is emerging
is that these structures
are closely linked to the
formation of stars."
The principal investigator
of the survey stated,
"The greatest surprise was the ubiquity
of filaments in these nearby clouds
and their intimate connection
with star formation."
The picture of proto stars forming due to
gravitational collapse in molecular clouds
is now falsified by
direct observation.
Instead, stars as well as galaxies
form like pearls on a string
which we must find if the
electromagnetic z-pinch effect
is responsible for
star formation.
The tell-tale signature of the electric currents
that confine the star forming filaments
was also detected in the
aforementioned study.
The principal investigator
said of the finding,
"These observations
revealed that filaments,
which may extend to several
light-years in length,
appear to have a universal width of
about one third of a light year.
This suggests that something
fundamental is lurking underneath."
As previously stated, the
universal width of filaments,
which is completely unexpected in
standard reasoning, is not coincidental.
On Earth, constant
width is observed
in the most powerful natural
electrical discharge phenomenon
- lightning -
In fact, for many mysterious
astrophysical phenomena
it is lightning that works as the
most promising natural analog.
We then ask the question:
if Occam's razor were actually
applied in astrophysical circles,
would consensus theory remain
that gravity is the most likely,
that is to say,
simplest explanation
for the undeniable stupendous
electric currents in space?
On our own Earth, the phenomena we
experience in nature and the laboratory
may surely help demystify the ongoing
mysteries in our electric universe.

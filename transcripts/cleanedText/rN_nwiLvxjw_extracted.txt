Some of the largest stars in the Universe are also some
of the strangest. Conventional science would have us
believe that these stars are near the
end of their life. And yet they show some
features that we also find in young stars.
They claim that these stars will expel
vast amounts of material which will
eventually form a planetary nebula.
And now they have discovered a star
which is not only ejecting material in
this manner, but also an expanding ring system
and also ejecting large blobs of plasma.
In the Electric Universe, these stars are
deprived of electrons, which forces the
outer plasma sheath to expand. A 
planetary nebula is not the remnants
of a dying star, but instead are the
structures that the star is connected to,
which are being lit up in glow mode due to a pinching
vent which is taking place around the star itself.
We know that what is termed as a young
star can eject vast amounts of material
from the jets. But this process also
seems to happen with the larger, in
quotes, ‘dying stars’. At the same time,
we also see the formation of a ring system
around new stars, which is often
interpreted as an accretion disk from
which planets may form. The same may also 
appear to happen with these supposed older stars,
but now they call it a dust torus. In 
the Electric Universe, stars undergo a
process whereby they become electrically 
stressed. There is an imbalance between the
incoming charges and those flowing away.
In order to deal with this, some of its
charge material can be ejected. This 
can happen as a CME or in extreme
cases, large planet-sized chunks of plasma can be
ejected. In the most extreme case, the star itself
will split into two equal, and sometimes unequal,
parts. There is much observational evidence to
show that those latter cases occur right
after a sudden flaring or brightening event.
V-Hydrae is what is called a carbon star.
These are luminous red giant stars. These
stars contain atmospheres where
there is more carbon than oxygen.
The two elements combine in the upper
layers of the star, forming carbon monoxide.
This leaves the carbon atoms free to
form other carbon compounds, giving the
star a sooty atmosphere and a strikingly ruby red
appearance. This characteristic is not limited to
massive stars, as dwarf stars are also known to be
carbon stars. When astronomers developed the spectral
classification of carbon stars, they had considerable
difficulty when trying to correlate the spectra to the
stars’ effective temperatures. The trouble was that
the atmospheric carbon was hiding the absorption lines
normally used as temperature indicators for the 
stars. Back in 1981, astronomers detected very
fast outflows from this star. Recently they
have detected not just the jet-like flow,
but that this flow consisted of compact
plasma blobs ejected at high speeds, but
also a slowly expanding set of six rings.
The fact that they observe the star
ejecting huge blobs of plasma on a very regular basis,
is not easily explained in the mainstream model,
and would require a companion star which
passed through the outer envelope of the
star, pulling away material from the star and ejecting
it outwards. The star is around 2,000 light years
away from us. Not only is it a carbon star,
but it is a semi-regular variable star. It pulsates
with a period of 530 days and its brightness
varies by about one to two magnitudes.
On top of this, it also has another
dimming cycle which occurs every
6,160 days and causes its brightness
to drop below magnitude 12.
This periodicity might suggest that there is a cyclic
resonant circuit effect, complete with overtones.
Through visible observations, they were
able to determine that it might have a
companion, but due to the large
separation between the components, the
physical connection of this pair is
still considered provisional, until
sufficient radial velocity and proper motion data
are available. This companion is also not responsible
for the ejection of the plasma blobs. It
is too far away for that to be the case.
Recent data has suggested that the star might
have yet another companion, much closer in.
Direct observational evidence is hard
to come by in these types of stars.
They are large, very luminous stars which
are surrounded by a dusty envelope.
This makes it very difficult to
detect nearby stellar companions.
Some binaries have been inferred
by radial velocity measurements.
This method looks for a wobble in the motion
of stars around a common center of mass.
This causes the star to sometimes move a
little towards us, and sometimes away from us,
thereby altering its radial velocity.
The problem with these larger stars is
that they are believed to have strong variability
intrinsic to their pulsating atmosphere.
Instead, they turn to a technique
called deep ultraviolet observations.
Carbon stars are thought to be cool objects.
The companions are likely a more normal
star and therefore hotter. In their
analysis they determined that V-Hydrae
had the highest far ultraviolet flux.
This they took as evidence of a
companion and they then linked this with
the eruptions they saw to determine it
had a periodicity of eight and a half years.
This is around half of the 6,160 day dimming cycle.
So, more likely the ejection mechanism is
connected to the changes in the current
from the cyclic resonance circuit effect.
What if the UV excess was in fact
evidence of something else going on in the star 
itself? That this process is what is causing the
ejection of material and will eventually lead to
the transformation of the entire surroundings?
In the case of a super red giant, we 
have a star which is electron deficient;
it expands its outer envelope to increase
the surface area for electron capture.
The UV excess we see may be associated
with the fact that the plasma sheath has
expanded far enough, causing an increase in the
electric field and hence giving the electrons a longer
period of acceleration whereby they collide
with other neutral atoms, ionizing them,
creating an avalanche process
through more and more collisions.
These types of stars struggle to 
deal with sudden electrical stressing
and the simplest way for them to 
deal with this is to discharge matter.
Going back to our example of a young
star with its outflows and the ring
system. Rather than considering them as young stars,
maybe a better classification is a star undergoing
extreme electrical stress. The same mechanism is 
what is causing all of these observations of V-Hydrae.
The way these stars manage sudden changes in
electrical input, is to discharge charged matter.
This initially starts in the equatorial
region forming a torus, or series of
rings. As the toroidal magnetization
builds, it may reach a critical point
after which an instability occurs.
This switches its behavior to force it
to start ejecting material out of the polar
regions instead. These are the jets and the ejected
material we see from these types of stars,
and are also the same mechanism that
drives the ejection from active galaxies. If we
examine the rings, you might notice something rather
interesting. The rings are not equally
spaced, but it would appear that the
rings further out, are much further apart than
those close by. If these rings were simply ejected
material from the star, this material should
slow down as it moves away from the star,
and we would expect to see the rings get
closer together as they move further away.
The only reason that they will be
getting further apart, is if they are
being accelerated away from the star.
This would make sense if the star had a
radial electric field, driving away the plasma.
A similar thing is also observed with
the blobs of plasma ejected by the star.
They initially appeared to move at a
steady speed, then suddenly underwent an 
acceleration. This star may well hold the clues to
understanding the process that occurs when a star
undergoes a sudden change in its incoming current,
while at the same time being starved of a ready supply
of electrons. The formation of both rings and jets is
an indication of a star that is undergoing
a significant change to its electrical load.

Info. In previous episodes, we have
introduced the strange and special role
of our planet’s parent star in ancient
world traditions. In global myth, folklore,
religion and rock art, the celestial body
identified as the Sun, bears no resemblance
at all to the Sun as it appears in our
sky today. The recurring anomalous
representations include an orb or star
within a crescent and the many
traditions which depict the Sun as a
spectacular celestial wheel, sometimes
with a warrior hero appearing as the
axle of the wheel with no modern natural
referent. Why do such depictions recur in
ancient tradition, art and storytelling
across the world? For over 40 years
comparative mythologist Ev Cochran,
along with colleague David Talbot, have
exhaustively explored this question.
Through decades of cross-cultural
investigation, they have worked to
reconstruct the historical phenomena
recorded in the ancient record in
prehistory. Today Ev continues in more
detail on the linguistic aspects of his
investigation, beginning with a
provocative suggestion that the ancient
Sun God and Thunder God may be one and
the same celestial entity. That is indeed
our position based upon the collective
findings of day Talbot, Wal Thornhill and
myself. As we have long noted,
prehistoric paintings and petroglyphs
depicting the Sun, bear zero resemblance
to the current solar orb. So-called Sun
petroglyphs commonly depicted for
 8-spoke wheel-like structure. Other images
depict a thunderbolt-like form set upon
the face of the Sun. Properly understood,
the second image is simply a variation
on the first and represents an
evolutionary phase in the history of the
polar configuration, in which the rays of
the primeval Sun become bent
or twisted due to z-pinch forces. The
logical conclusion to be drawn from such
universal imagery is 1) that the
prototypical Sun is not to be confused
 with the present solar orb; 2) the
prototypical Sun was the focus of
intense electrical activity, marked by
the discharge of heaven-spanning
thunderbolts; and 3) the prototypical
Sun had a dynamic history and presented
a wide variety of different forms, all
intimately related to each other.
Consider the image depicted in figure 3:
it depicts a swastika-like form in the
center of the Sun disk. The resemblance
between this form and that depicted in
Figure 2 is evident at once. Is it any
wonder then to find that the ancient
Norse conceptualized Thor's Thunderbolt
as a swastika? Elsewhere however, the
Norse sky watchers represented the god’s
thunderbolt as a fiery wheel. it's
notable that in various ancient
languages terms “the Sun” and “thunderstorm”
are identical and/or cognate in nature.
the Sumerian term “Ud” for example,
 denotes both Sun and Storm. So too the
Semitic term “Umu” denotes Sun as well
as storm. Analogous linguistic structures
are also evident in the Mayan languages of
the new world. Yet, why should this be the
case, given the current order of the
solar system, where the Sun is never the
source of lightning or storms.
Striking contrast the current reality,
ancient reports of the sunrise typically
mention lightning and thunder among the
effects accompanying the appearance of
the Sun.
Consider the following Sumerian hymn: “The
 Lord [the Sun-God Utu] thunders over
 the mountains like a storm.” Equally
important is the fact that ancient words
for solar radiance often mean “lightning”
or “thunderbolt,” much as would be
expected if the energetic discharges of
the prototypical Sun and Thunder God
were one and the same.
The German word “strahlen,” rays or
radiance of the Sun for example, is
elsewhere employed to describe a flash
 and lightning: “blitzstrahl.” The inherent
relation between solar rays and
lightning is shown by the fact that the
cognate term “strala” denotes the
lightning-like arrows shot by the
Slavic Thunder God, Perun. The Latin word
”radius” is also of interest here. In
addition to: ray, beam, sunbeam, radius
also denotes “spoke,” much as we would
expect if the original source of the
reference was a wheel-like Sun whose
radiating sunbeams presented the
appearance of the spoke. Yet the same
word elsewhere appears in words for
lightning, witness the Spanish word “rayo”
which means: ray, beam, Sun beam, but also
thunderbolt. Consider also the Homeric
 word “asterope,” denoting “lightning,” is
reference to a celestial body in as much
 as Greek “aster” denotes “star.” This
etymology alone supports the conclusion
that the Greek concept of lightning was
quite literally a star-based phenomenon.
The archaic phrase preserved in a
 Orphic hymn: “asterobletos keraunon” (star-
flung thunderbolt) points to the same
conclusion, needless to say. In light of
this linguistic evidence, it is relevant
to note the ancient depictions of
the Semitic Thunder God Hadad, depict
 him holding the tri-formed thunderbolt
while a star hovers over his head, as if
to signal that the Thunder God was a
star himself. Note further the
specific structure of the Thunder God’s
weapon forms a close match to the
thunderbolt depicted in Figure 2 above,
where it is set upon the faces of the
Sun. In short, the evidence of prehistoric
rock art, early literary traditions and
early languages, is consistent in
describing an ancient Sun God that was
dramatically different in appearance and
behavior than the present Sun, much as
Dave Talbot and I have been arguing for
40-plus years now.

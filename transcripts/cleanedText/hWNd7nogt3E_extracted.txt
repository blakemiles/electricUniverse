The Electric Universe
-- A Study in Contrasts --
Contrasting viewpoints are the fuel
for progress in all human inquiry
'Vive la différence'
A gravity-driven structure?
Crab Nebula
Or electric discharge?

A contrast can highlight predictive ability
when alternative explanations are at stake.
"When astronomers detected intense
radiation pumping out of the Crab Nebula,
one of the most studied objects in space, at
higher energies than anyone thought possible,
they were nothing
short of stunned."
What difference does it make
whether a planetary nebula
is a cloud of neutral gas or a
cloud of electrically active plasma?
We see the signature of electric currents in the
structure of luminous threads or filaments.
In the vacuum of space, coherent
filaments are not even conceivable
without energetic electrical
and magnetic activity.
A plasma is defined by the presence
of freely moving charged particles.
Electric currents can transport
huge amounts of energy
over virtually unlimited distances,
just as in the power grid,
where the lights of cities are
far away from the power plants.
In space plasma, this energy of electric currents
can suddenly appear as glowing streamers
and even erupt in intense outburst, all
depending on the electrical conditions.
Many filamentary nebulae are remarkably
similar to energies of dense lightning
both in storm clouds and
in volcanic eruptions.
That's not a coincidence.
Filamentation is commonplace in laboratory
experiments with electric discharge.
It's often stated as fact that a
galactic jet is powered by a black hole
but jets from galactic cores
were explained electrically
by the father of plasma science, Nobel
laureate Hannes Alfvén, decades ago.
Does it make a difference whether a black
hole or an electric discharge drives the jet?
Well yes it does, because our entire
understanding of what keeps the universe going
arises from questions such
as this and others posed here.
Each year, scientific
exploration take us deeper
into the electrical nature of
events across the cosmos.

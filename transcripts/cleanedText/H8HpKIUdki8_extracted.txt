A recently released video clip
provides stunning support for the
Electric Universe interpretation of 
one of the most dramatic atmospheric
phenomena on Earth --
above-clouds lightning.
On October 15th, 2019, a pilot
named Chris Holmes was flying
about 35,000 feet above the Gulf of
Mexico when he noticed multiple forms of
powerful electrical
discharge called sprites
and jets erupting
from a thunderhead.
The still image seen here is
a "gigantic jet", a towering form of
electrical discharge reaching all the
way to the ionosphere, which is now known
to sometimes occur above
powerful thunderstorms.
This exceedingly rare video clip
reveals the top of the cloud
from which the jet
emerged, affording a
groundbreaking opportunity for
insights into the phenomenon.
Investigator Oscar van der Velde,
of the Lightning Research
Group, split the video footage into
individual frames and described the
observed sequence for the
website spaceweather.com
He states, "First, relatively cool 
blue filaments spring up. These are
streamers akin to St. Elmo's fire. Next,
after the jet reaches its maximum height,
another feature crawls
more slowly out of the
cloud top -- a white-hot
'lightning leader'."
The Space Weather article notes
why this is a surprise for
conventional meteorology, "For years, some
researchers thought that gigantic jets
could reach such extreme
heights only if their
streamers got a boost from
the lightning leader.
Holmes's video shows just the opposite:
the gigantic jet reaches the ionosphere
before the lightning leader
even leaves the cloud."
Oscar van der Velde concludes on the
images, "This suggests that there
may be a much more powerful electric
configuration inside the thunderstorm
than was previously thought--perhaps
as much as 200 million volts."
To understand the significance of these
insights for the Electric Universe
predictions and interpretations of
extreme above-clouds electrical
discharge, let us first consider a
surprising historical background on the
question of so-called lightning
in Earth's upper atmosphere.
Although numerous eyewitness accounts of
the phenomena including the testimony of
airline pilots trace back many decades,
it was only in the late 1980s that the
first photographic evidence was obtained of
an above-clouds discharge called a sprite.
However, as early as the 1920s, the
Scottish physicist C.T.R. Wilson predicted
the existence of brief flashes of
light above large thunderstorms.
A fundamental question
that must be asked is, do
scientists today really
understand lightning?
As those who follow this series
are aware, what we observe in
nature, as well as
recent scientific
discoveries demonstrate
that the answer is no.
These points are illustrated
when we consider the research into
lightning by Professor Edgar Bering
of the University of Houston.
In 2001, when Bering flew a high-altitude
balloon above a thunderstorm,
he made the unexpected discovery that
when lightning strikes occur both above
and below the clouds, the electrical
charge was already present and did not
take time to build up
between lightning strikes.
This contradicts the standard
notion that lightning is the generator
of the clear air
electric field measured
at about 100 volts per meter between
the Earth and a clear sky.
In standard theory, lightning's
generation of power requires
water droplets to
separate charge in
clouds, a process that
remains mysterious and unverified.
The Electric Universe theory,
however, sees lightning and the
cloud activity as a "load" that is being
driven by electric currents from the Sun.
It is the electrical
circuitry between the
Sun and the Earth that
drives all lightning.
And scientific research provides
support for the role
of the electric Sun-Earth
connection in lightning.
As we reported previously,
in 2014, scientists in the UK
discovered a dramatic increase in
lightning strikes for up to 40 days
after a major
solar storm.
Simply put, the reason the
aforementioned observation of
the gigantic jet is "surprising" is
that the electrical charge that created
the jet was already sitting at the cloud
tops, which is not surprising at all from
the Electric Universe 
perspective.
As physicist Wal Thornhill
has proposed, the
highest clouds
essentially act like one
plate of a capacitor which responds to
the build-up of charge in the ionosphere
above, which is where the above-
clouds lightning terminates.
Thornhill explains, the
gigantic jets and other forms of
above-clouds electrical discharge are
electrical breakdown channels in the
Earth's "leaky 
atmospheric capacitor."
The discharge channel of
Birkeland filaments narrows and forms the
bright jets as it reaches into
the more dense lower atmosphere.
On our planet, we benefit from
having clouds to distribute
lightning more widely
than on other planets.
For instance, Venus does not have water
clouds, yet the early Russian Venera
space probes discovered evidence for
Venusian lightning which is both vastly
more frequent and powerful
than Earthly lightning.
And on the planet Mars, where the
rarefied atmosphere is about 1/2 of
1% as dense as Earth's, the clearest
evidence for powerful lightning-like
discharges is in its towering dust
tornados and global dust storms which
are electrically driven phenomena, and
just as Earthly lightning appears to
increase in direct response to increased
solar activity, we now have evidence that
dramatic dust-raising events on Mars
may be linked to outbursts from the Sun.
For several years, scientists have
puzzled over dramatic dust plumes which
occasionally erupt up to hundreds of
kilometers above the surface of Mars.
As we reported in 2016, investigators
studying data from the Mars Express
spacecraft found that, immediately before
the observation of a dramatic plume, the
planet was hit by a
powerful CME from the Sun.
As one investigator noted, "It's very
surprising that was affecting Mars right
before the plume was
first observed."
So it seems that an understanding of
high-energy electrical discharge
phenomena on planets, including Earth,
will demand a new understanding of the
electrical nature of the
Sun and of all stars.
It was well over a century ago
that physicist Kristian Birkeland
proposed that the earthly Aurorae were
produced by electric currents from the Sun.
Astronomers almost universally
rejected the idea for many decades, until
it was finally
confirmed by discovery.
Likewise, all forms of lightning, as well
as the most powerful gigantic jets in
our upper atmosphere, testify to the
electrical circuitry that connects all
celestial bodies in our solar system and
indeed pervades the entire universe.

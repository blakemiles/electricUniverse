You've just entered the
theater of an alien sky.
If the words and images
seem strange to you,
there's a reason for this.
Our world was once a
vastly different place.
To experience this
won't hurt you
and there is nothing to fear.
Rituals of Remembering
and Forgetting
In these Discourses we
propose that our Earth
was formerly joined in a close
congregation of planets,
unlike anything observed today.
Based on converging
evidence globally,
we can name the gathered bodies and
identify an extraordinary correspondence
between celestial events
as seen from Earth
and a massive outpouring
of myths and symbols,
all inseparably linked to the rapid
rise of the ancient civilizations.
In the final analysis, the only
reason to accept or even to consider
the reconstruction presented
here is predictive ability.
If the claimed events occurred,
would we reasonably expect the
unique narratives and sacred forms
coming down to us as worldwide
or archetypal content.
Our overriding advantage in
this respect is specificity.
It's none of the concrete patterns
revealed to us are predictable
under today's common
assumptions, not a single one.
And yet all are concretely
and specifically predictable
in the light of the reconstructed
polar configuration.
With this episode we will
begin enumerating the polar
configuration's predictive
ability in broader terms
to lay the groundwork for
the episodes to follow.
The history of recorded human thought
began with the myth-making epoch.
Enigmatic symbols and magical
practices told a story of creation,
catastrophe and
regeneration of the world.
Of course the greatest
mystery of all
is the very existence of the mythic
archetypes or common themes.
We can count them
by the hundreds.
Why did every ancient culture
declare that the sky changed
or that towering gods once ruled
the world, then went away?
Such mysteries invariably
direct our attention to deeper
and progressively more
specific questions;
Why did the world's
first astronomers
so consistently name the
great gods as planets?
What was the meaning of the so-called great
conjunction or perfect conjunction of planets,
said to have marked the
beginning of time?
And not only that, the planet
Saturn as a primeval Sun?
How did the planet Venus earn its
worldwide identity as the mother goddess?
Or the planet Mars its global
reputation as a great warrior?
And what was the nature of the
world altering catastrophe,
said to have ended
this celebrated epoch?
Like hundreds of other
mythic archetypes,
such themes never make sense when
referred to our present sky.
Always they speak for things
not seen in our own time.
How did this
disconnection occur?
We can follow the archetypes
across all of human history
as associated art
and mythic imagery,
sacred narratives and
countless magical practices
take us back to a lost
age of gods and wonders.
What was the human experience that
provoked this ground floor human memory?
Reconstructing the ancient experience requires
systematic cross-cultural comparison.
That is how we come to recognize
different myths and symbols
pointing back to the same events, all
occurring in the earliest remembered time.
Within this framework it's only to be
expected that an urgent collective memory
would grow fragmented and
confused across the centuries.
Towering forms in the sky progressively
lost their cosmic dimensions
to become legendary ancestors
of those telling the stories.
Even the most powerful memories
slowly gave way to localization,
every tribal community on earth declaring
its possession of the original story.
In this way each regional culture
could cling to a proclaimed lineage
of divinely ordained kings,
of world-conquering warriors
and radiant mother figures.
Competitive claims of this sort lie at the
heart of all localized mythic rhetoric,
one effect amongst many was the incessant
drive towards regional expansion
through wars of conquest, always the
so-called "holy war" was animated
by a perceived divine mission
descending from the gods themselves.
This universal fact will become a key in
our analysis of the warrior hero theme.
But there's more to
this historic pattern.
All of the broadly
distributed archetypes
bear identifiable relationships
to remembered cosmic events.
To appreciate the
impact on humanity,
the events themselves must be brought
fully into the light of day.
In our own time, historians and
comparative students of religion
can only explain world mythology as a
carnival of pre-scientific ignorance.
The specialists just assume
that they understand
what our early ancestors
did not understand.
But that explanation ignores
hundreds of global patterns
that would not even be possible in the
absence of extraordinary natural events.
The truth is that expertise will lead
nowhere in the absence of understanding.
The great myths arose in an age of
planetary instability and cosmic violence,
including close
approaches of planets
and earth-shaking electrical
exchanges between planets.
The conclusion in these Discourses
is that our world, our sky,
has not always been the stable
referent we experience today.
The events that inspired a transformation
of human consciousness were cosmic.
These events are
not occurring now.
Hence it is futile to look for answers
in the appearance of the sky today.
The present is not
the key to the past.
Allow for another vantage point
and everything will make sense.
But of course, a new vantage point requires
that common assumptions be suspended
to allow the test
of predictability.
Of the hundreds of archetypes
we've previously named,
how many would be expected
under today's assumptions?
Not a single one!
Would you expect the ancient stories of a
former central luminary or primeval sun
different from the body
we call sun today?
Would you expect the preposterous location
of that body at the celestial pole
or expect the ludicrous
identity of that very luminary
with the remote planet Saturn?
Our advantage is that every
tenet in this reconstruction
carries explicit testable and
inescapable implications.
Once named, the
archetypes leap out at us
and as the archetypes are named
so are the implied relationships
to other named archetypes.
This fundamental unity, the ground
floor of the human experience,
is for us the acid test, drawing us into a
critical examination of the causative events
without which no archetypes
could even exist.
The goal is to identify the unified
substructure of human memory.
The process starts by naming
the cross-cultural themes
and allowing the implications
to shine through.
If indeed a common memory lurks
within the historical record,
the historical detective
must first distinguish
between the archetype and
its localized expressions.
Always keep in mind that the
ancient tools of remembering
invariably became agents
of forgetfulness as well.
That's because no local symbol, no
mythic fragment, no magical reenactment,
could even begin to capture the full
integrity of the original experience.
No particular myth could possibly
lead to any reliable conclusions
as to things actually
seen in the sky.
The truth is that
regional storytelling
always fostered more
forgetfulness than remembering.
And yet, through systematic
cross-cultural comparison,
something deeper will reveal
itself, a dependable integrity
hidden in the underlying
points of agreement
for an astonishing archetypal
accord begins to shine through.
In fact, every logical conclusion
to be discussed in these Discourses
will follow simply and directly
from three indisputable facts:
Firstly, no archetype follows logically
from any natural events observed today.
Secondly, all archetypes are
provably connected to each other,
no isolated archetypes exist.
And thirdly, a unified
explanation is available to us
if we allow the archetypes to speak for
natural events not occurring today.
We have named the celestial provocation
as the polar configuration.
By giving attention to the impact of these
gathered planets on human imagination,
all of the recurrent themes become
witnesses to a story told around the world
and that means hundreds of
archetypes hiding in plain sight.
Always look for the
underlying form!

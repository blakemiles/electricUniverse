Welcome to Space News from
the Electric Universe,
brought to you by The
Thunderbolts Projectâ„¢

So, continuing our discussion
on the so-called crisis in
cosmology, let's talk more about
this latest announcement from
the Keck Observatory which
describes the latest verification
of the anomalous accelerating
expansion rate of the universe.
For the first time, scientists
have attempted to estimate
the expansion rate using a new method
involving gravitational lensing.
Now, the concepts behind
the standard ideas about
gravitational lensing is
something that's been discussed
at some of the annual
Thunderbolts conferences.
For example, Dr. Edward
Dowdye is a laser
optics engineer and, in fact, he was a
NASA physicist and he's presented his
case on the importance of plasma in
understanding the phenomena that
scientists attribute to so-called
lensing in space.
So Wal, fundamentally, why don't you
explain the Electric Universe
interpretation of the effects
that astronomers do observe
and which they describe as
"gravitational lensing?"
The concept of gravitational
lensing is faulty at the very
beginning because it assumes that
gravity has an effect on space.
It doesn't; it's an electric force,
it's a dipolar force just like
magnetism, and if that dipole electric
force were able to warp space or, with
the powerful magnets we have
today you should be able to
see distinct lensing effects
using magnets, we don't.
Gravity doesn't affect light directly but it
can, by modifying the density of the ether;
the ether is all-pervasive,
it's the substrate of the universe, it's
the medium through which light travels,
it's the medium through which the
gravitational and magnetic forces
and the electric force travel.
It behaves like any medium in the presence
of the gravitational field because it's a
material medium and has to be
material, of vanishingly small
mass, which indicates there is possibly
neutrinos involved--they will respond to
gravity just like any other material
medium, and in this case like a gas, and
form an atmosphere about a celestial
object, and that atmosphere can refract
light, so that you will get lensing but
it's got nothing to do with gravity per
se, it's the effect of gravity on
the environment of that body.
So yes, you can get gravitational lensing, but
the concept that they're using is invalid.
And principally, because of this idea
that redshift indicates that these
objects that they're seeing near a low
redshifted galaxy, are far away, is incorrect.
All it means is that they're younger than the
object that's in that center of that view.
And what do we find most often 
close to galaxies? Quasars,
redshifted quasars, and they are, in
Halton Arp's research, the offspring of an
active galaxy, galaxies beget baby
galaxies, and they form initially as a
quasar of low mass and high redshift and
low brightness, and their brightness,
their mass and their redshift, all change,
become closer to their parent over time,
and as a result, they become
companion galaxies of various kinds.
So he gives a genealogy,
he shows almost
biological aspect to galactic
formation and so, when
we see these objects in distant, or
so-called lensed objects, what we must be
looking at is an active galaxy surrounded
by some of its redshifted offspring.
Because they're fired off
in episodes, they often
have different, slightly
different, quantized redshifts.
If they've misinterpreted, which they're
being done here by these people, they can
be interpreted in a way which may appear
to give some credence to the distance
scales but the distance scales,
as Halton Arp has shown, are
completely haywire in
modern cosmology, right,
the redshift--distance
relationship is mythical.
Arp wrote on the subject of gravitational
lensing, he said, "...you must
remember that it was invented
for extra galactic objects
because that was the only
escape from observations which
required the physical association
of objects of much different
redshift. The low mass particle
masses..., which I've
talked about,... give rise to a lower
luminosity. That gives a rough, higher
redshift--fainter apparent magnitude
relation for galaxies of different age
at the same distance. And he notes here
also and this is something that I picked up.
"This should also apply to the
supernovae within the galaxies.
Of course, this fainter than expected
supernova discovery gave rise to
the idea that the universe is expanding
more rapidly, it's accelerating!
But that's sheer nonsense,
it means that you don't
understand supernova explosions
either, which is not a surprise
when you think they don't
understand gravity.
Wal, speaking of Halton Arp
and our earlier discussion
about the nature of quasars,
let's talk now about one of
the more remarkable discoveries in the
space sciences in recent months.
In September of this year, in a paper
published in the Astrophysical Journal, a
team of scientists reported their
observation of "six quiet galaxies
shifting into quasars" in a period of
time that is literally thousands of
times more rapid than standard
cosmology can explain.
I'll read to you briefly
from a Science Alert report,
"In a spectacular fashion, six galaxies
have just undergone a huge transformation
in a matter of mere months. They've gone
from relatively peaceful galaxies to
active quasars-the brightest
of all galaxies, blasting
vast amounts of radiation
out into the Universe.
...such changing-look transitions
are usually observed occurring
between different types of
Seyfert galaxies... These Seyfert
transitions were what the
team set out to study."
Now, one of the authors of the study
states, "Instead, we found a whole
new class of active
galactic nucleus capable
of transforming a wimpy
galaxy to a luminous quasar.
Theory suggests that a
quasar should take thousands
of years to turn on, but
these observations suggest
that it could happen very quickly. It
tells us that the theory is all wrong.
We thought that Seyfert
transformation was the major
puzzle. But now we have a
bigger issue to solve..."
And of course, as we reported
previously, this isn't the
first time that scientists have observed
"impossibly rapid changes in quasars."
So Wal, why don't you tell us,
generally speaking, why these kinds of
incredibly rapid cosmic
scale transformations
are actually expected in
the Electric Universe?
I point to the research of
plasma cosmologists, which
shows that the active galactic nucleus
that ejects the quasar, are in fact
plasmoids, the most compact form
of high-energy storage known.
The electrical energy
poured into the plasmoid
from the spiral arms, forms a
tiny doughnut-shaped object.
At some point, the energy
density closest to the axis of the
plasmoid forces the electrons and
protons to collide and form neutrons.
Having no charge allows the
neutrons to escape from
the electromagnetic galactic
nucleus in axial jets.
It seems the neutrons
are nature's Houdini's.
They only exist as a dance
between an electron
and a proton for the short time
required to escape from the
electromagnetic prison of the nucleus of
an atom or the nucleus of the galaxy.
But in doing so, they give birth to either
a new element or a new galaxy, respectively.
Nature never does
things the hard way.
When the neutrons do decay, the freed
electrons are held back by the galactic
magnetic field more strongly than the
heavier protons, which now form a quasar.
I proposed that an initially
positively charged quasar is
therefore followed by a beam
of electrons from its parent
galaxy, which would explain
both the observed quantized
redshifts and the increase
in mass of the quasar,
as a result of increasing
charge polarization
within the matter in the quasar,
as the electrons arrive.
Of course, the bursty
nature of these
outbursts from active galactic nuclei
suggests that the electrons may also
arrive in bursts, just like the ejections
themselves, which would predict and
explain seemingly impossibly
sudden changes in quasars.
Sudden changes on the galactic
scale, and even on the stellar
scale, are expected in the
Electric Universe, simply because
we are dealing with a
coherent, connected, electrical
system operating in real time, in the case
of a galaxy--across the entire galaxy.
And this is because the
electric force is instantaneous
and the release of stored
electrical energy takes place
like a sudden lightning bolt
followed by an exponential
decay, as that energy
dissipates into space.
And this is behind all sorts
of phenomena that are puzzling
researchers at present, where they're
getting gamma-ray bursts and fast radio
bursts and all sorts of things from
seemingly nowhere, and this is another
point that Hannes Alfven made; plasma
currents that are flowing through space
will produce double layers and these
double layers can, if the current density
gets too high, actually shut the current
off, and the result is that the energy is
suddenly concentrated at that point, and
there's a sudden burst like a lightning
bolt and it can happen in apparently
empty space, because these double layers
are often in dark mode
discharge as it's called.
In the case of galaxies,
the plasmoid itself in the
laboratory, it's known that
the plasmoid forms and the
energy that it concentrates,
when it gets to a certain point
at very high density, the electrons
and the protons which are
held in that plasmoid, when they're
traveling down this core of the doughnut,
is where they're closest together, and
that's where the breakdown will first occur.
And that breakdown forms a beam of
neutrons. In the laboratory, plasmoids are
known to be the most copious source of
neutrons when they break down.
So all of this can be
tested in the laboratory,
which is one of the
big advantages of
the Electric Universe cosmology
over Standard cosmology.
Well indeed, and when it comes
to cosmological phenomena, I've always
felt that the most significant type of
discovery is the evidence for physical
connections and interactions of
objects over unfathomable distances.
I've said before that
the model of the Electric
Universe might be: "There
are no islands in space"
and we see this verified
more and more frequently.
A few months ago, we reported
on the discovery of a vast
radio-emitting filament which
is connecting two galaxy
clusters across 10 million
light-years and this seems like
a dramatic confirmation of a prediction
that Anthony Peratt made decades ago,
that cosmic scale currents exist in deep
space connecting these types of objects.
And now, just in the last few weeks, we've
seen the report that distant galaxies,
which are separated by tens of millions
of light years, have been found rotating
in synchronicity with one another; a
Science Alert report on that discovery
states, "The discoveries could force us to
rethink our understanding of the Universe."
An elite author of a paper on
this discovery says, "The observed
coherence must have some relationship
with large-scale structures, because it
is impossible that the
galaxies separated by six mega-
parsecs directly interact
with each other."
But I think what the
scientists should have
said is that the phenomenon
is "impossible"
under the assumption of an inert
and disconnected universe.
So Wal, why don't you shed some
light on why, like countless other
discoveries, this is not impossible, nor
surprising in the Electric Universe?
The Electric Universe has no
problem with the synchronization
of galaxies over colossal
distances simply because
they are all being driven electrically
by the same Birkeland current filaments,
and the spiral galaxies tend to be strung
along them like Catherine wheels on a wire.
Both the rotation and the
form of a spiral galaxy
is explained experimentally and
theoretically by plasma cosmologists, and
the fact that has been discovered
recently, that the rotation of galaxies
seems to be somehow strangely similar, is
all tied up to the fact that they're all
being driven electrically by these
circuits, and it's just like electric
motors in the home, if they're connected
to the same circuit, they will all tend to
be synchronized in some fashion, either
by the number of cycles per second of
the power supply, but in
the case of galaxies, all
this can be tested and
proven in the laboratory.
A critical failure
of modern cosmology
is to assume that gravity is the only
force operating on a cosmic scale.
Plasma cosmologists, for the last 50 years,
have shown that this is incorrect.
Electromagnetic forces dominate
on the cosmic scale.
Supercomputer simulations
have shown that introducing
gravity into their electromagnetic
models has no effect.
This should be no surprise
given that, compared to the
electric force, the force of
gravity is effectively zero.
This should have been obvious
to theorists given that
spiral galaxies rotate like
the solid disk of a Faraday
motor and not a gravitational
system where the outer
satellites rotate more
slowly than the inner.
Once again, our Earth-centric
view has held back science.
Plasma cosmologists showed that spiral
galaxies form like Catherine wheels
along spiraling intergalactic
Birkeland current filaments.
It explains both their axial
alignments and their rotation.
Of course, these recent
discoveries should force a
rethink of the fundamental
understanding of the universe.
It should have done
so, decades ago, but those
doing the research have not been
trained to see the alternatives,
which have been available
since late last century.
Cosmologists are taught
that yes, there is
electricity in space but
it doesn't do anything.
They are also taught a basic form of
plasma physics, which the Nobel
prize-winning plasma cosmologist Hannes
Alfven showed, is invalid in space, and
the tunnel-vision, induced by
their training, prevents modern
cosmologists from attending
plasma cosmology lectures.

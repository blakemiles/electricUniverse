Blinded by the Sun
Good morning, everyone!
The good news this morning
appears to be from ESA that
they have received
data from the lander.
and that they're able to trigger all of
the experiments, as far as I'm aware.
And that they are getting data back or
they expect to get data back from that.
And that's being looked at.
So, hopefully we'll get
some more information
from them in the future to support the
Electric Universe model of comets.
But now I want to
talk about the Sun.
If comets are fundamentally
an electrical phenomenon,
it's telling us something
very important about the Sun.
And it's my contention that most of the
mysteries of astronomy can be solved
by really understanding the Sun.
What we have now is a complicated narrative
constructed over several centuries
that has proven non-predictive
in the space age.
The noted Australian solar
physicist Ron Giovanelli
working at the Mount Stromlo
observatory in the 1940's,
and I should say Mount Stromlo
is about 20 minutes from me.
And we have somebody in the audience
who actually works up there
and so I see him occasionally
at the astrophysics seminars.
Anyway, Mount Stromlo
in the 1940's.
Ron Giovanelli concluded that solar flares
are basically an electromagnetic phenomenon
in which electrons are
accelerated by electric fields
induced by changing
magnetic fields.
Now, this is the problem that astrophysicists
have in separating cause and effect.
In 1984, he published "Secrets of the
Sun" where he writes in the introduction,
"Today there are five basic
problems in solar physics.
The first is the sunspot cycle which
is closely interwoven with the second,
the structure of the
convection zone,
which is supposed to occupy about the outer
200,000 kilometers of the solar radius.
And with the third, the variation of rotation
rate across the surface and with depth.
The final two are the heating
mechanisms in the outer solar layers
and the causes of flares.
There are many other
intriguing problems,
but central to almost all is the
nature of the Sun's magnetic field.
That's the end of the
quote from his work.
In a video prepared
before his death in 1985,
Giovanelli gently upbraids others for drifting
into mathematics and leaving out physics.
He continually reminds how
little we know about the Sun
or, to put it differently,
how much there is to learn.
In the intervening 30 years and
incomparably better data from space,
things have not improved.
They have become worse!
Astronomers remain unaware of
Hannes Alfvén's admonition
to first understand the
electric circuits of the Sun
if you want to understand
its magnetism.
You compare these images of the
Sun which I will just bring up.
Compare these images of the Sun with a comment
by Fred Hoyle in "Frontiers of Astronomy".
That's back in 1955,
where he wrote,
"We should expect, on the basis
of a straightforward calculation,
that the Sun would end itself in
a simple and rather prosaic way.
That with increasing height
above the photosphere,
the density of the solar material
would decrease quite rapidly
until it became pretty well negligible,
only two or three kilometers up.
Instead, the atmosphere is
a huge bloated envelope.
Not only that, the
atmosphere extends well out
through the planetary
system to the heliosphere.
Ralph Juergens, in 1980,
stated the obvious answer
for those not blinded
by their training.
And you see the quote here,
"The modern astrophysical concept that
describes the Sun's energy
to the thermonuclear reactions
deep in the solar interior
is contradicted by nearly every
observable aspect of the Sun."
That was published in 1980.
When I read his paper, it just seemed
so obvious to me that he was correct.
And that was when I began to really try
and understand the Sun for myself.
Ralph Juergens certainly pointed the
way and did a very thorough job.
So, what is a star?
An undergraduate textbook on the
structure and evolution of stars
makes a star seem a
very simple object.
And I quote, "A star can be defined as
a body that satisfies two conditions:
a) it is bound by self gravity
and b) it radiates energy
supplied by an internal source.
Behind this definition are some critical
assumptions that Sir Arthur Eddington
bequeathed to us long before
the Space Age in his 1926 opus
"The Internal Constitution
of the Stars".
But how many students now read Eddington's
original work with a critical eye?
Indeed, how many
read him at all?
Here is Sir Arthur Eddington.
Eddington wrote, "The problem of the source
of a star's energy will be considered;
by a process of exhaustion
we are driven to conclude that the only possible
source of a star's energy is subatomic;
because at this stage
it had been discovered,
nuclear energy had
been discovered.
He said, "...yet it must be
confessed that the hypothesis shows
little disposition to accommodate
itself to the detailed (arguments)
the detailed requirements
(sorry) of observation
and a critic might count up a large
number of fatal objections."
A single fatal objection would
suffice to falsify the hypothesis
but the apparent isolation of
stars in the vacuum of space
encouraged the belief that stars must
consume themselves to fuel their own fires
rather like a campfire in the
sky, only a modern version.
The fatal objections would
be sorted out later.
Two such objections are behind NASA's
plan to launch a mission to the Sun
called "Solar Probe Plus" in 2018, with
first close approach in December 2024.
And I hope I'm about
to report on that.
NASA says the mission’s primary
scientific goal is to understand
how the Sun's corona is heated and
how the solar wind is accelerated.
Solar Probe Plus
will revolutionize
our knowledge of the origin and
evolution of the solar wind.
That's the end of the quote.
That will follow 92 years of denial
that there is a serious problem
with our understanding
of our nearest star.
Neither of these features are predicted
by the standard solar model.
Eddington argued the need for
a central fire as follows,
"No source of energy
is of any avail
unless it liberates energy in
the deep interior of the star.
It is not enough to provide for the
external radiation of the star.
We must provide for the maintenance
of the high internal temperature
without which the
star would collapse."
This is the rationale for having a high
energy, high temperature core in a star.
But this assumes that a star
is basically a ball of hot gas
obeying gravity in the
standard laboratory gas laws.
Edington's logic of exhaustion had
to set aside facts that didn't fit
the only "possible" theory.
Appearances can be deceptive when viewed
through the lens of a single idea.
A kind of tunnel vision develops
that accommodates fatal objections
with the excuse that someday we will find
the answers, just give me more money.
To compensate for the weakness of the
excuse, those who adopt the consensus view
acquire a kind of
evangelical zeal
which you can see anytime you see these
interviews with astrophysicists.
For example, the undergraduate textbook,
referred to in the last slide, opens with,
"The theory of stellar structure and evolution
is elegant and impressively powerful."
Yet we have recently discovered
stars that shouldn't exist.
In one instance, the star is too huge
to be inflated by a central fire.
Tunnel-vision does more than magnify
the elegance of the single idea.
It also excludes consideration
of other ideas.
Alternative ideas are stymied by unquestioning
faith in the "only possible theory".
For this reason,
as history shows,
most fundamental breakthroughs
come from outsiders,
those who sit down before
facts like a child.
Eddington had addressed the
problem of generating electricity
when trying to explain bright lines
in the spectra of some stars.
The difficulty is that the heat of the
star can't supply the energy of the atoms
producing those bright lines.
Something extra
is adding energy.
He came close to the answer
when he wrote, and I quote,
"If there is no other way
out, we may have to suppose
that bright line spectra in the stars
are produced by electric discharges,
similar to those producing bright
line spectra in a vacuum tube."
But he goes on,
"A disturbed cyclonic
state of the atmosphere
might establish local and temporary
electric fields, thunderstorms,
under which the electrons
would acquire high speeds."
Collisions between the high-speed electrons
and atoms in the stellar atmosphere
would give rise to the
bright spectral lines.
However, in a footnote, Eddington revealed the
fundamental limitation of his theory of stars
and I quote again,
"The difficulty is to account for the
escape of positively charged particles.
Unless charges of both
signs are leaving the,
the escape is immediately stopped
by an electrostatic field."
This statement will reverberate down the years
as one of the gravest mistakes in science.
It is an electrostatic model of
an isolated self-contained star.
But stellar magnetism is an
electrodynamic phenomenon
requiring electric currents flowing in
circuits, both within and beyond the star.
Birkeland recognized this,
Alfvén insisted on it.
A noteworthy outsider had already published
an electrical theory of the Sun in 1913
long before Eddington's
work on the subject.
Kristian Birkeland,
on the left,
was a renowned Norwegian scientist
and multiple Nobel Prize nominee,
who set up observatories under great
difficulties in the Arctic Circle
to study the Aurora Borealis.
His fascinating story can be read in Lucy
Jago's biography "The Northern Lights"
and I recommend it.
His theory that the aurora is due to
charged particle beams from the Sun
has only recently been confirmed
as Don Scott pointed out last night.
Birkeland's approach was
largely experimental.
He managed to reproduce sunspot
behavior, see the inset on the left,
in his famous Terella or
little Earth experiment
where he applied external
electric current
in a discharge to a magnetized
globe suspended in a near-vacuum.
Another outsider was Charles Edward
Rhodes Bruce, or C.E.R. Bruce.
He was a fellow of the Royal Astronomical
Society, the Institute of Physics,
the Institution of Electrical Engineers and was
a member of the Electrical Research Association
from 1924 until his
retirement in 1967.
His interest in astronomy and research
on lightning led him to write, in 1968,
"Perhaps in no scientific
discipline, other than cosmology,
have so many theories got by on
so little positive evidence.
Imagination has had free rein, often
at the expense of common sense.
The main observational evidence indicating the
existence of cosmic electrical discharges
is the same as that which would
lead an external observer
to conclude that lightning flashes
occur in our own atmosphere.
Namely, the sudden change
they affect in the spectra
and the spectra of the
Sun, stars and galaxies.
In the Sun’s spectrum, line suddenly appear,
indicating the existence of gas temperatures
of hundreds of thousands or
even millions of degrees.
That's from his work
"Electric Fields in Space"
published in 1968, in
Penguin Science Survey.
Here's Sidney Chapman.
He was one of the establishment,
the British establishment,
Sidney Chapman, fellow of the Royal Society,
studied magnetic storms and aurorae,
developing theories to
explain their relation
to the interaction of the Earth's
magnetic field with the solar wind.
He was recognized as one of the pioneers
of mathematical solar-terrestrial physics.
He continued the tradition of
opposition by British scientists
to Birkeland's work and
Scandinavian science.
He disputed and ridiculed the work of
Kristian Birkeland and Hannes Alfvén
but later adopted Birkeland's
theories as his own.
Near the end of his life he did
acknowledge Charles Bruce in 1964,
in a publication called, a book
actually, called "The Solar Wind".
And I quote,
"It seems appropriate to call attention to the
ideas put forward over many years by Bruce,
concerning the importance of
electrical discharges in the cosmos
and in particular in
the Sun's atmosphere.
Bruce agrees that the Sun offers his
ideas perhaps their greatest challenge
because of the very high electrical conductivity
of the solar material at all levels.
Any electrical discharge in the Sun's
atmosphere demands an exceptionally rapid
and strong means of generating
differences in electric potential."
Here we see a recognized
leader in the field
who at the end allowed that the Sun
itself, as an isolated body in space,
might somehow generate
its own electricity.
But today, scientists don't know how the
earth can generate its own lightning.
That may surprise you but one of the
experts, Dr. Newman or Professor Newman
who's written on this subject,
it's been his subject life-long,
has admitted that we still do not
understand what causes lightning,
what actually causes that
electrical separation sufficient
to initiate a lightning
discharge on the Earth.
Let alone on the Sun.
All we have is a cover story, one
of a large and growing lists.
Of course, you've all heard about the
updrafts of ice particles and so on,
separating electricity.
It doesn't work.
In fact, some years ago
I wrote on my website,
"The balloon goes
up over lightning".
And this was where high-altitude
balloons were flown above thunderstorms.
And the surprise that came from that
was that the electric field already...
The charge is already there, it's
waiting to discharge through the cloud.
It doesn't have to be
generated in the cloud.
So the source of the
lightning is external
and of course, since then
we've seen sprites and elves
and all of the other magical things
that occur above powerful thunderstorms
rising to the ionosphere and from
the ionosphere to the magnetosphere
and from the magnetosphere we already
have these, so called flux ropes,
which are electric
currents to the Sun.
So, our weather is driven
largely electrically
and this is something that climate
scientists know nothing about.
Now, here's the guy who
made the most advance
in the understanding of the
electrical nature of the Sun,
Ralph Juergens.
An important outsider, an engineer and a
pioneer of the electrical model of stars.
He was inspired by Bruce.
And also Birkeland.
But because of the tunnel
vision of the consensus view,
he was forced to publish his ideas in
obscure journals in the early 1970's.
His model is a shining example
of common sense and simplicity
when compared with the infernally complex
and improbable thermonuclear paradigm.
One of the problems of the
thermonuclear paradigm is that
it took a lot of ingenuity to figure out
how you might have a thermonuclear cycle
which would work inside a star.
Even then you required incredible
pressures and temperatures.
But what's more, some of those
reactions, one in particular,
the reaction rate varies as the
temperature to the fifth power.
Well, that is highly unstable.
That's why they make
hydrogen bombs.
It's because it's
highly unstable.
And one of the other reactions
requires quantum tunneling.
So there all sorts of assumptions piled
upon assumptions to actually end up
with that so-called wonderful
thermonuclear model of how a star works.
Juergens' model is simplicity.
Yet Juergens' insight was in
danger of being lost following
following his untimely
death in 1979.
In fact, it was within weeks of
Velikovsky's death, which was ironic.
Ralph wrote, "As I pursued the
phenomenology of electric discharges,
it gradually dawned on
me that structurally,
the atmosphere of the Sun
bears a striking resemblance
to the low-pressure type
of electric discharge
known as the glow discharge..."
And when you look at the Sun in that
way, you can understand how easy it is
to describe what you see on the surface
of the Sun in electrical terms.
The Sun's surface is carpeted
with complex magnetic fields.
Whatever fine structure they
go down to, they can see
more and more levels of structure
in this magnetic carpet.
Now, as all electrical
engineers know,
only electricity or electric currents
can produce magnetic fields.
So, what we're looking at is a
seething storm of electric currents.
So the Sun must be understood
in terms of electric circuits
because (you cannot) all
currents must flow in a circuit.
And the questions then are, where are
these circuits and what creates them?
Well, Hannes Alfvén paved the way
by drawing a circuit for the Sun.
But, he assumed that the Sun was the
driver of that circuit and it was closed.
So you had the current flowing out
along the equatorial plane of the Sun,
the so-called solar wind.
And then somewhere at some distance, he said
it curls back and it comes in at the pole.
So he drew the circuit but he
assumed the Sun was the driver
without explaining precisely
how that might work.
And having established the circuit,
of course, that radiates energy,
electromagnetic
energy and so on.
And the Sun is obviously radiating
energy, so what sustains these currents?
So there's the summary
of just what I've said
and here is the Sun in
that solar circuit.
Remember, I said there's
a current flowing out
here and this is the solar wind
and it comes in at the poles.
This diagram is from Don Scott's
book "The Electric Sky"
and I recommend that book for
anyone who wants to go into
the electrical theory
of how this might work.
The beauty of this
relatively simple diagram
is that it shows how you can
explain the solar cycle.
It's simple, you don't have to rely on
unseen things going on inside the Sun.
All of this is happening at the very
top of the atmosphere of the Sun
which is very highly conductive of
course, and can carry these currents.
So, the greatest puzzle of the Sun, its
magnetic field reversals, is solved.
The Sun is subject to a varying
DC or direct current power input
and so generates alternating
magnetic fields
because the magnetic field always tries
to oppose a change in the current.
It's rather like a power transformer but
one that's operating with a current,
a steady current through it with
a varying input superimposed.
And this makes some kind of sense
because these Birkeland currents,
as Don showed last night,
can have waves passing through
them to cause pinches and so on.
So they're a part of a circuit.
It has a resonance.
So I would suggest the 11 or 22-year
solar cycle, sunspot cycle,
is driven by the resonances
in the Sun's circuit.
Other stars have different
resonances and so their solar,
their stellar cycles
would be different.
So I refer you to
Don Scott's book.
This diagram is on page 112
and explained more fully.
I'll mention again that the polar current
flow shown is referred to by Hannes Alfvén,
but he considered the Sun as a
generator in a closed circuit
and not as a load in
a galactic circuit.
So the principal difference in
the Electric Universe model
is that the circuit extends
beyond the heliosphere,
and this is being confirmed
by surprising discoveries
by the Voyager spacecraft at the boundary of
the Sun's interface with interstellar space,
and the IBEX mission which has picked
up, as Donald explained last night,
the signals we would expect from an enveloping
Birkeland current pinch around the Sun.
As for what creates and sustains the circuits,
I will address that in my presentation
on Electric Universe cosmology
which I think is tomorrow.
Now, you've seen
this picture before.
As we said, this is an archetype
for a stellar circuit where we can
actually see it in glow mode.
This particular object, M2-9,
is 2,100 light-years distant
and as Don said last night,
most stellar circuits operate in a
more diffuse plasma environment,
a lower current density, so
that the circuit does not glow.
But you can imagine, all stars have this
kind of plasma circuit impinging on them.
The conventional caption
for this image says,
"M2-9 represents the spectacular 'last gasp' of
a binary star system at the nebula's center."
They require a binary star system, one star
would rip material off the other (to perform)
to produce that disk
of dust and gas,
that Don explained last night
is necessary in their models,
whether it's a black hole,
a star or whatever.
Such a disc can successfully account for
the jet-exhaust-like appearance of M2-9.
I don't think so.
The last statement
is patently false.
The detailed structure of planetary nebulae
has defied all attempts at explanation
by flinging gas out of a star.
On the contrary, the structure conforms
to the concentric pinched cylinders
of an interstellar
current filament.
More on that in a moment.
Don also showed a stylized
version of this object.
It's called the
Red Square Nebula
and it's a celestial object located in
the area of the sky occupied by star
MWC 922 - in the
constellation Serpens.
And the quote here is from Peter
Tuthill of the University of Sydney.
He was one the people, his team actually
discovered this thing and imaged it.
The thing that really takes your breath
away is the astonishing degree of symmetry
within the intricate
linear form.
A series of rungs and conical
surfaces lie nested,
one within the next, down
to the heart of the system
where the hyperbolic bicone
surfaces are crossed
by a dark lane running
across the principal axis."
This of course is your, and
once again, your dust Lane
which is hiding what's
going on inside.
Then Tuthill makes the connection
and this is important,
"It is fascinating to
take a second look
at one of the most famous astronomical
images of them all: supernova 1987A."
And that was also mentioned last night
by Don and I'll talk more about that.
This particular object,
the Red Square Nebula
is 34 times closer
than supernova 1987A,
so we see fine detail in the inner
structure of the stellar circuit.
Tuthill goes on to say, it's the best
astrophysical laboratory yet discovered
for studying the physics of generating
the mysterious sharp polar ring systems
like that around
supernova 1987A.
And he goes on, "A system as
complex and fascinating as this,
is bound to keep us
guessing for years to come.
How did this beautiful, crisp
structure form? He asks.
This is the
million-dollar question.
Oh, I'd like the million dollars,
thank you, because I explained it.
I explained it in a peer-reviewed
paper to the IEEE.
And it is based, as Don
explained last night,
on Birkeland current filaments
impinging on a star.
What you're seeing there,
these are double
layers seen edge-on.
The Birkeland current filaments.
You can actually see the filaments
themselves in the original image.
They may be a little hard to see here but
you can just see this hairy look here.
And this is the pinch
coming in here.
It's quite a fantastic image and I'm
really pleased that it's been discovered
and is being examined in detail
because this is important.
So, let's move on.
This is the supernova 1987A and the clue
for this came from Tony Peratt's work.
And on the far left there you
see the stellar z-pinch.
And this is one of his
diagrams, a simulation.
And then right at this is,
in the neck of the z-pinch,
this is the detail you see here.
These filaments coming down
here, strike the material
which is in the solar wind if
you like, the stellar wind
which comes out in the
equatorial region and...
Let me see, I'll just catch
up with my notes here...
The bright ring of beads there are due
to the current filaments lighting up
the equatorial stellar wind like a ring
of searchlights through a thin cloud.
One of the interesting things is,
as I mentioned in the article
that I wrote for the IEEE
Plasma Sciences Journal,
that these beads, Tony
said they tend to pair up.
So that over time they coalesce
and they become fewer in number.
But they have certain
classical stabilities
where you get a particular
number of these things.
56 was one of the
the classical ones.
I can't remember, this quite gets to that or
might be 28 where they've tended to pair.
But I suggested that rather than
being a result of an explosion
or light catching up with something that
was left by a prior ejection of material
which is the ad-hoc
astronomical story,
these would remain relatively stationary
because they are actually the pinch itself.
So they're not going
to move very far.
But these filaments that are twisting
around one another, will pair up and so,
and so I would say
they would rotate.
And this is the kind of research
that anyone who's interested
could take up and
publish a paper on.
The more distant coaxial rings.
You'll notice over on the right
here there are more distant ones.
These are just double layers
further along the pinch.
And notice they're symmetric
because the pinch is symmetric.
They, and it's always a sharp boundary
as we saw with that red square.
Those double layers
form a very thin layer
and they, this is why it's so
remarkable for astronomers.
How do you form such
delicate structures
if this is all due to material
blowing out of a star.
OK.
So we come to the Sun's environment
and Don dealt with this
but it's worth
talking about again.
And it was published, this picture
was published in May 10, 2012,
"New IBEX data show heliosphere's long
theorized bow shock does not exist",
was a quote from that article.
I had written on my website in November
13, 2005, almost seven years earlier,
"The solar plasma and that of interstellar
space are two different plasmas,
which must therefore have a double layer
or Langmuir plasma sheath between them.
So to treat the heliospheric boundary simply as
a magnetohydrodynamic shock problem is naive."
The heliosphere is the boundary of
the Sun's electrical influence.
That's where the Sun's
presence in the galaxy
meets the interstellar
regions of the Milky Way.
So the heliosphere is the boundary
of the Sun's Electrical influence.
And Juergens said, "Most of the Sun's driving
voltage appears across this plasma sheath,
simply because of
the graphs here
which show the relationship of a
normal plasma discharge tube,
so this is in the laboratory.
These are the curves you
find in the laboratory.
And if you apply that to
the Sun, here's the Sun,
the positive electrode come
down here, there's the Sun.
As you move out from the
Sun, you'll notice that
there's only a very
shallow voltage change.
And this is important because one of the
arguments against our work has been:
if the Sun is electrical there should
be all these relativistic electrons
and particles streaming
past the Earth.
No, not at all.
The voltage difference
is very slight,
such that it's just enough to cause the
electrons to drift towards the positive anode
and in the opposite direction for
the solar wind to be accelerated
rapidly close to the Sun and then
it just continues accelerating
very slowly out towards
the heliosphere.
Until it hits this bump.
And I predicted before the event
that the solar wind would slow down
more than expected before it got to the
boundary and that was found to be so.
There were articles saying
there was no explanation for why the
solar wind should have suddenly stopped.
Well, that's the answer, it's
an electrical discharge.
So I'll just repeat, if you refer
to Juergens' original work,
you will see that he invokes a very
large voltage driving the Sun.
But he was assuming that all
of the Sun's radiant output
must be accounted for by the
electrical power input.
But we have the evidence for that nuclear
fusion is taking place at the Sun
because we've got
neutrino images now.
I don't know whether you
saw it some months ago.
There was a picture published which showed
this glow, circular glow in the sky.
It was rather pixelated because
it's not very good definition.
And right in the center there was a little
circle and that's where the Sun is.
So the neutrino telescope, if you like
to call it that, is very low definition
so you cannot tell whether the neutrinos
are coming from the core of the Sun
or from the surface of the Sun.
It's unable to distinguish.
So what I'm saying is
that the electrical power
required to catalyze photospheric nuclear
fusion, is yet to be determined.
But the Electric Universe model
says that stars, all stars,
create the heavy elements
in their photospheres.
It's all happening right
in front of our eyes.
You don't have to postulate any crazy
things or crazy conditions inside a star.
It's all happening
right in front of you.
And that makes sense.
I mean, nature always
does things the easy way.
And if that's the easiest
way, and I'm sure it is,
then that's the way we
should be looking at.
OK, I think I've
covered all of that.
Here we come to
the plasma focus.
This is something that
Eric Lerner and his,
is it Lawrenceville Nuclear
Labs or some thing or other.
He's actually producing fusion
or using one of these devices.
The important thing to notice is that
what you have is two coaxial conductors.
And if you think about it,
these stellar circuits
have concentric,
conducting plasma layers.
And when it comes
down to a pinch,
there's the possibility that you'll get
a kind of short-circuit across the,
between those layers.
So, this is important.
It's also important in
the Sun's photosphere.
What happens is that
this little red thing here
represents a capacitor bank
where you store an
enormous amount of energy
which can be released extremely
quickly, in millionths of a second.
You have a special
high-speed switch here.
This yellow part here is your inner metal
electrode ... your inner conductor.
You have insulators then, between
that and the outer conductor.
You close this gap
and, all of a sudden,
there's an electrical discharge between
the inner and the outer pipe, tube.
The discharge
doesn't stay still.
It doesn't e just go
from here to here.
It moves by electromagnetic forces
down the barrel and when it gets here
it balloons out and then folds back
in and forms a tiny little plasmoid.
And you can have the energy of
a whole roomful of capacitors,
which would be an
enormous amount of power,
released into this (woops)
plasmoid, here we go.
This will show you what it does.
We have sound.
"These filaments are little
whirlwinds of plasma.
The sheath of filaments converges
together into a dense pinch or focus,
combining all the
filaments into one.
This filament kinks and twists
itself into a tiny dense ball,
only a few thousandth of an
inch across, called a plasmoid.
Instability in the plasmoid creates
powerful beams in opposite directions.
Positively charged nuclei flow in one
direction and electrons flow in the other."
That's it.
Notice there was
thousands of an inch.
So you've got the energy stored, an enormous
amount of energy in a very tiny volume.
And where do we see that?
We see it in the
centers of galaxies.
We see it in blazars, any of these very highly
concentrated point sources of radiation.
One other aspect of these devices that I
should mention, is that it's not only
X-rays and particles that
come out of the beam.
It's also the most copious source
known in the laboratory of neutrons.
And neutrons are very important when
you want to create the heavy elements.
Because you need to supply of
neutrons to add to the nuclei
which can then beta decay and what not and give
you all the various elements up the table,
of the chemical element table
and the isotopes as well.
And it's significant, of course, that in the
solar spectrum you see the heavy elements,
very highly ionized.
Possibly because they've
only just been created.
Generated I should say,
you can't create matter.
So we go back to our
beautiful M2-9.
I've just put the little plasma focus
down at the bottom here as a reminder.
Here you have your
concentric cylinders.
And if there is a breakdown
between the central column
which, remember, there's a
central column of current.
So if you have a breakdown between the
inner cylinder and the central column,
you will tend to form a
plasma focus effect.
And these FLIERs have
some of that shape.
And see this kind
of curved shape?
And they are a real anomaly.
There's no explanation for them.
So, a distinctive feature of this nebula
are the two bright patches on either side
which are known as FLIERs or Fast
Low Ionization Emission Regions.
They appear to be relatively young
moving outwards at supersonic speeds.
According to Bruce Bellick,
University of Washington,
some of their observed characteristics
suggest that they are like sparks
flung outward from the central star,
late in the very recent past.
That's not very good.
It doesn't explain anything.
Yet, their shape seem to suggest
that they're stationary
and that material ejected from
the star flows past them,
scraping gas on their surfaces.
Well, it has nothing to do
with scraping gases and that.
And this is under electromagnetic
control so it's not a mechanical
blast effect or
anything like that.
In any, in either case,
the formation of FLIERs
cannot be easily explained by any
models of stellar evolution.
(Just see if I've
missed anything.)
Oh yes, an interesting
side issue is that
this might also explain the asynchronous
reversal of the solar magnetic field.
You know, when the Sun's
magnetic field flips
it often does it in one
hemisphere and not the other.
And then later, the second
hemisphere switches.
If the solar cycle is driven
by a regular disturbance
traveling along the
interstellar circuit,
then one of these dense plasma focus
effects will be affected before the other.
But as you can see, the complexity of a star's
circuitry will require a lot more research.
Birkeland wrote with his
unusual prescience in the
"Norwegian Aurora Polaris
Expedition in 1902-03,
"It might be imagined that
the interior of the Sun
form the positive pole for
enormous electric currents.
This was Juergens'
conclusion also.
"This assumption has the advantage of
appearing to give a natural explanation
of the movement of the sunspots
in various latitudes," he wrote,
which he demonstrated with
his Terella experiments.
This guy was a great
experimentalist.
In this case, the origin of the
sunspots must be that the presumptive,
more or less insulating,
photospheric envelope
was sometimes pierced by disruptive
discharges, thus forming great electric arcs.
This is the position of the
Electric Universe model.
Because you've got this
plasma storage ring.
This is SOHO NASA spacecraft
and in ultraviolet light you can see
there's a plasma torus around the Sun.
Now, the energy stored in
there can reach a point
where it discharges to
the surface of the Sun.
And depending upon the voltage
differences, it will shift in latitude.
Those discharges will shift in latitude
which is exactly what sunspots do.
So here's this guy,
back in 1902-1903.
He had it practically
figured out.
Nobody was listening,
especially not Sydney Chapman.
Sunspots. And these
are very interesting.
The sunspot penumbra shows the
detailed structure and behavior
that has nothing to do
with turbulent hot gas.
It has nothing to
do with convection.
And recent discovery by those people
looking at the seismic activity,
or what's going on
underneath the photosphere,
have shown that there is
practically no convection.
So the standard solar model has
already been discredited, again,
by this recent discovery.
The sunspot is dark, showing
the Sun is cooler beneath and
so the bright Sun is a
photospheric effect alone.
One of the things about Birkeland
currents is that it induces rotation
so the problem of why do galaxies
spin, why the stars spin,
why the planets orbit stars
and so on, is easily solved.
It's driven electromagnetically.
Super tornadoes have been
discovered in the chromosphere
between the corona
and the photosphere.
It is estimated there are
more than 10,000s of them,
continuously present
in the quiet Sun.
Surface and coronal
vortices are connected.
Rotation is a natural effect
of Birkeland currents.
So, what I'm suggesting
here is that
the penumbral filaments are
actually electrical tornadoes.
It's like a tornadic
form of lightning.
And a tornado is a slow
discharge, like slow lightning.
So what you're seeing, here on the
Sun, is a form of slow lightning.
The Sun is a ball
of slow lightning.
They have bright
edges, dark cores.
That's because on the right
is a special-effects
thing where you've got a
helicopter blade rotating above
and you put fuel into a fire at the
base and it forms this twisting vortex.
And the center, looking through
it, is darker than the edges.
And this is precisely
what you see on the Sun.
So they are tornadoes.
It's the ideal site for nuclear fusion and
heavy element synthesis by neutron capture.
Because the electromagnetic
forces, pinch forces and so on,
that are active in those stellar
tornadoes, are enormous
and it's a place where the particles
required for nuclear synthesis
nuclei synthesis, are available.
They're not going anywhere soon.
These are actually drawn-out
versions of anode tufts.
Bright plasma "tufts" form as a secondary
plasma in the primary plasma of the discharge.
The number of tufts increases
with increasing current density
and the tufts float above the anode
and are hotter than the anode.
This is why the photosphere is
bright and is darker underneath.
They space themselves apart
evenly over the anode surface
and penumbral filaments have the features
that may be expected of anode tufts
in a gravitationally
stratified atmosphere.
Rather like the Earth.
We get tornadoes.
It gets bigger ones.
The electric photosphere.
This is a diagram that was
based on Juergens' work
and Don Scott noticed that this curve
has the shape of a transistor.
And the beauty of this is that a
small change in voltage here,
because what happens is, the
positive particles in the Sun,
any of them have sufficient
energy and get into here,
are free to move about and any of
them that get over to this side here
will suddenly reach the edge
of this waterfalls effect
and be accelerated
to form the corona.
I have to go through
this fairly quickly.
I'm running out of time.
This is the tuft area.
These are those
electric tornados.
This is where all the nuclear
synthesis is taking place, I think.
Just a small change
in voltage here
raises the barrier for these
particles escaping from the Sun.
So it's a very good
control barrier.
This is why the Sun, its radiant output, remains
steady to within about 0.1 of a percent
while the X-ray output of
the Sun varies markedly.
The Sun is a variable
star in X-rays
and the X-rays are a good
indication of the electrical power
that's being expended
in a small area.
So, the tufted sheath forms a barrier
for protons escaping the Sun
and the spicules, which are these
little jets that occur between them,
provide electrons to
stabilize the sheath.
Just like the porous anodes
used in some arc lamps.
There is no explanation for
spicules in the standard model.
So, summarizing.
Electrical energy arrives at the Sun from
dark mode galactic current filaments.
The electric discharge
intensifies close to the Sun,
causing the thin atmosphere of the corona to
appear to be heated to millions of degrees.
The heavy element body of the Sun is cool
and of unknown structure and composition.
And I will address these questions in a
later talk on Electric Universe cosmology.
So, we cannot understand the countless stars
in the heavens until we understand the Sun.
All bright stars produce heavy
elements in their photospheres.
The incredibly complex, the
evolutionary story of stars
to fit the Hertzsprung-Russell
plot, is invalid.
We do not know the age of the universe
or any celestial object in it.
We have been blinded by the story
of the Sun concocted a century ago
by scientists who had no grasp of the
complexities of plasma behavior.
They were driven by a need to extend
the theoretical lifespan of the Sun
to accommodate the needs of the
geologists lengthening timescales.
So it's understandable that the
discovery of nuclear energy
was embraced at that time as
the only possible answer.
No matter that it was
entirely unpredictive.
Ironically, the astrophysicists
were and still are
unaware that the geologists' Earth
history is a fabrication too.
I will address that story
in my next presentation.
So, in a sense,
Eddington was right.
The Sun is a simple thing.
Far simpler than he imagined.
It is the electric universe
environment that is complex
but that complexity arises from a few simple
concepts and repeated fractal patterns.
Nature is like that.
Meanwhile, for those trying to
produce fusion power "like the Sun",
it's high time to move on and find
out how the Sun really does it.
Nature never does
anything the hard way.
Thank you!

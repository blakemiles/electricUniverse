Solar Gravitation and Solar Plasma
Wave Propagation Interaction
Dr. Ed Dowdye was a popular
speaker at the 2012 EU
and he's back.
An electrical engineer with degrees
in mathematics and physics formerly of NASA,
the originator of the
extinction shift principle,
which challenges the general and
special theories of relativity,
let's welcome Dr. Dowdye to the
stage to challenge us a bit.
The title of this is a continuation
of what I have done before
and this talk, we talked about
Solar Gravitational Gradient
interacts indirectly with
Electromagnetic Waves propagating
in the solar plasma limb.
And when I say the gravitational
gradient, for an example,
we know very well that when you
put up satellites in a deep space
you put atomic clocks
on-board these systems,
in order for the GPS
system to work properly,
then each one of these platforms
that are orbiting about the Earth
has to be timed, a time reference
has to be onboard the system
in order for when you receive
a pulse in your vehicle
when you're moving on the ground or in
the air you know your exact location
because when you receive that
information from the GPS systems
they time-tag it.
And the clock running
onboard the satellite
has to run at the same
rate as that on Earth.
But the problem here is, when
you put these systems in space,
the gravitational gradient
acts on the atomic clock;
and actually the clock on Earth will actually
run at a slower rate than the one in space.
So let's talk about this.
So in the next 19 minutes, I'm just
going to give you a split on this.
So I'm going to go to the next slide
here which is similar to this slide.
My title is actually the Solar Gravitational
Gradient acting on Electromagnetic Waves.
It turns out that the solar
gravitational gradient
interacts directly with
the solar plasma limb,
but the solar plasma limb interacts
directly with the electromagnetic waves
However, the gravitational
gradient, the first one,
interacts indirectly with
the electromagnetic waves.
So, that's the gist of what
I'm talking about here.
And there's enormous
evidence for that
and relativity, the people who support
relativity, are fighting against this.
So let's go on to next one.
Here's a picture of what I
mean in the first two slides.
See, you have the solar
limb of the Sun
and it turns out that the solar limb
of the Sun contains hot plasma gases.
We've been talking about plasma
all day here and partly yesterday.
The plasma is actually
totally ionized,
ionized at the Sun.
The ionized limb of
the Sun is such that
the particles in this limb
ripped off all the electron clouds.
So you have only nuclei,
positive and negative nuclei.
So it's actually a plasma
about 5,000º to 6,000º C.
And it turns out that
that plasma limb
is being acted on by the
gravitational gradient of the Sun.
And it has a
gravitational profile,
and when light propagates
through that or
microwaves, or whatever
wave propagates through it,
you can determine the path of the
waves propagating through that.
And there's a calculation
that allows you to get that.
And what happens, this plasma limb of the Sun
acts directly on the electromagnetic waves
propagating along the
minimum energy path.
It turns out that you
send your students,
you get your students’ assignment in
undergraduate and graduate classes
and you guys you know this, because
I'm preaching to the choir here,
you talk about the minimum
energy path, or the least-time path for waves
propagating in an atmosphere, or some
medium, along a minimum energy path.
And it would be defined by the
gravitational gradient field of the Sun.
And it turns out that the gravitational
gradient field of the Sun
interacts only indirectly with
the electromagnetic waves.
So it's going and we see what
we're talking about here.
Here we find out, if you go above
the Sun or solar limb in space,
going above that solar limb
as long as you're in the limb
there's bending taking
place in the limb.
But above that several of even
a fraction of a solar radius
or many solar radii above it,
it turns out that electromagnetic waves
propagates in the plasma free space,
the space where you have no
plasma at all, there is no bending.
And these light rays are going
along a straight line pair
So the next slide, continuing on,
Showing a picture again you have
the solar limb and it turns out,
you have the Sun, the radius of the Sun
proximately, what is it, 600 or 650,000 km radius.
So actually what happens above
the solar limb and beyond that,
engulfing almost all the
planets orbiting about the Sun,
there is an electron profile
that's known as the solar wind.
I want to talk about
that later on, very briefly,
because we only
have very [little] time here.
So what's happening if you
have a satellite system,
a system moving down,
if I can have a pointer,
and I'll point to you what
is meant. I point here,
going down, let's say you
have a system moving down,
a satellite system moving down,
it could be the Earth or planet
moving from here on down.
What happened, this system
contains antennas on board.
And the antennas are such that
they're spread apart
so you can have a wide beam;
what is called a wide-beam interferometer,
a wide-beam interferometer system.
And this system will detect the rays
of light coming from a distant source
and this distant
source is so far over here
that these rays are almost
parallel to one another.
And what happens when
one of those rays interacts
with the solar plasma of the Sun,
there's bending that takes place.
And in a star, like the Sun, that has one
solar mass and (is) one solar radius,
will bend 1.75 arc seconds.
So that's just bending
down 1.750 arc seconds okay,
and those at the other
side of the Sun would bend up.
So it turns out, that it's bending
such that the Sun acts like a lens.
And it acts pretty much
like a lens here,
if you go far enough away from
that, way out here someplace,
these rays will come together
and come to a focus.
But that's a long distance,
let's talk about that later on.
But what's taking place here, you can
detect the bending: this one would bend up
and this one would bend down, but in
the middle here there is no field.
And so this information is
coming from this distant source.
It could be a radio source,
or some satellite system,
or a distant quasar system that
is emitting actual microwaves,
these rays are noticed to bend.
And the astrophysicists have
measured always this 1.75 arc seconds.
However, there has been no
information up here at all, or down here.
That means the bending always take
place at the plasma limb of the Sun.
That is in itself a direct
violation of General Relativity.
And there's enormous evidence for
that and I'll show you, the evidence
this can take
place after this.
Let's take a look at what we
mean by gravitational gradient.
If you look at the gravitational
gradient of the Earth
in comparison to
that of the Sun.
If you look at the
Sun for an example,
if you are just above
the surface of the Sun,
there is a gravitational potential, a
very strong gravitational potential.
And if you’re over here up above,
you go to 0.38 Astronomical Units (AU)
and 0.72 AU there you have
Mercury and you have Venus,
and at 1.0 AU there's
the planet Earth.
On the Earth's surface it turns out that
the gravitational potential of the Sun
is almost a factor of 14 times greater than that
of the gravitational potential of the Earth.
But that is the gravitational
potential of the Sun;
this yellow line indicates the
gravitational potential of the Sun.
However, that little box where
you have the Earth 1.00 AU
if I blow that box up.
I have the planet Earth here
and you calculate what is known as the
gravitational potential of the Earth.
The green line represents the
gravitational potential of the Earth,
but down below you
have, blown up in this box,
the gravitational potential of the Sun,
indicated by the yellow line down below,
that's 14 times greater
than that of the [Earth].
But it's not the gravitational
potential that we are concerned about;
we are concerned about the gravitational
gradient, not the gravitational potential.
The gravitational
gradient is the key here.
So let's take a look
at this next slide.
If you note the gravitational
potential of the Sun and the Earth
at any given point in space
the Sun always wins over.
But the gravitational potential
gradient, that’s a different story.
But you have the Sun, the
gravitational potential of the Sun,
is equal to approximately
14.14 times that of the
gravitational potential of the Earth.
That's key, keep that in mind.
Next we look at
the gravitational potential gradient.
If you calculate the
gravitational potential gradient,
what you have to do is take
the first derivative of the Sun,
the gravitational potential
of the Sun along its Z axis,
and Z coming from the Sun where you
have the radius of the Sun is 1 AU,
the radius of the orbit
of the Earth is 1 AU,
if you look at that
at the Earth, right?
you'll find that that is much smaller
than the gravitational potential of Earth
along a radial path which
is the radius of the Earth.
So that's significant
because you find that
why is it that atomic
clocks run slower,
when you put the atomic
clock in space, than on Earth.
It turns out the moon has a profound
effect on the Earth's tidal effect.
The tidal effect causes the waters
to stand up on a hill (slope) when
the moon passes
above the Earth.
It is the moon that wins over, when it comes
to gravitational gradient of the moon,
(it) is greater than the
gravitational gradient of the Sun.
However, the gravitational gradient
of the Earth is far more than that.
So, going on to the next slide, I'm going to try
to sum this up in the next ten minutes.
So, making a picture short,
taking the Sun, the gravitational
gradient plasma limb of the Sun,
you'll find that history
for the last 100 years now,
the scientists have been able to
measure light-bending of the stars
in the gravitational
limb of the Sun.
But if relativity were factual,
according to General Relativity,
light-bending should be everywhere
where you have gravitation.
But that is not the case.
The scientists who
support relativity,
this is bad news for them.
They don't want you
to know about this.
So this next slide,
this is the prediction
of General Relativity.
Relativity says there's
bending at the limb of Sun.
At the limb of the Sun you have
1.75 arc seconds bending,
but above that, if you go a radius
or twice the solar radius above that,
the bending should
be one-half of that.
In other words it is one half of 1.75 seconds,
or possibly 0.85 arc seconds.
And above that, 3 solar radii
above that, it's 1/3
and then you get 1/4, 1/5 and so
forth, that's General Relativity.
But what happens here is that
relativity fails this experiment.
So you take the great
General Relativity equation
which is the light
bending or 4GM/Rc²,
that is the bending predicted
by General Relativity,
and in units of a radians.
You can convert that to arc seconds, but
2π radians is 360º and 1º is 3600 arc seconds.
You work out the mathematics: that first
equation will get you 1.755 arc seconds.
But you take the Earth and the Sun, the mass of
the Sun and let that be M,
and no matter what the
potential, what the
density of that mass happens to be,
using Gauss’s law, you should
get exactly the same bending.
So using Gauss’s method, you can find
a lot of objects out in
deep space where relativity has failed.
And going forth, we can use the principle of
reciprocity and the principle of Gauss
showing these two
principles that are in textbooks
all over planet now.
We teach this stuff in
astrophysics and general physics,
undergraduate physics, the
students are learning this stuff;
however they're not tying it down to the
failure of General Relativity. They keep that silent.
So this is our job, to point
this out to these guys.
You point out the
failure of relativity.
So going forth and summarizing
what I just talked about:
you have three different masses,
if these masses
are the same,
they could be more dense,
enclosed within a Gaussian sphere,
they come up with the same light bending and
the optical reciprocity is illustrated here.
So let me move fast, and this summarizes what
I just talked about in the previous slide.
So I’m just going to move forth
if I'd ever summarize this
in the next couple of days if
you want a summary on this.
So let's look at this, summarizing
again the principle of reciprocity
what we just talked about.
If you have bending of a star,
and so you have a star that is a
distance beyond the mass that's
responsible for light bending,
and you observe at the
telescope you should not see,
according to General Relativity, you
will not see a point light source.
In other words, you should
see bending all around.
And this is looking at
it in two dimensions;
looking at in two dimensions you see
the bending for light coming from the star
bending up and then going
down to the telescope.
The light beam could also
go in the other direction
and go down first and then
bend up toward the telescope.
If that happens according to the
prediction of General Relativity,
the observer should
see an Einstein ring.
And the Einstein ring should be visible
in the time you have this picture.
So let's go forth and
take toll of what we have here.
I decided to put in picture an
animation of what actually takes place.
When you have a distant light
source out in deep space,
and that light source could
be a red light source,
and where you have photons of light,
or wave packets coming from light,
(if you don't need the word
’photon’, we can use ‘wave packets’),
or we can use just ‘emissions’ of optical
waves coming from a red light source.
And if in the center between that
light source and our telescope,
there is some object
in the center,
that according to General Relativity
could cause bending of light,
that light should be reflected
or amplified, or actually magnified,
by the massive light
source halfway in between,
and the observers should see
in that case an Einstein ring.
And down below, just below the
observer and his telescope,
this is what the observer
should be seeing in his telescope.
He should see a red
ring around that red X,
instead of seeing a
point light source.
So let me move on and try to
summarize this as we go past.
The main key here is the gravitational light
bending as a function of the impact parameter
in plasma free vacuum space.
This is the main thing we
want to talk about here.
So what I did, we talked about the light
bending as a function of the impact parameter.
The smallest impact parameters you can have
would be the exact radius of the Sun.
So I can go to 2 solar radius,
or I can go to 3 solar radius,
or 4 solar radius,
or 5 solar radius.
If you go on beyond, the light
bending should get less and less.
So let's take a look and
see what we have here.
So you take a look at what the reality
tells us. For the last 100 years of observation,
we have observed virtually no
bending at all of a star light,
beyond the solar limb of the Sun.
So you go back and look
at relativity again,
relativity predicts bending, whether you
are at the solar rim or beyond the solar rim:
However, the
reality tells us this:
the impact parameter, beyond the Sun
there is no bending whatsoever.
Here relativity has a problem.
so looking at this, summarizing
what we are seeing in the picture,
the solar limb of the
Sun causes 1.75 seconds of bending,
while there's no
bending above that.
So if we take a look at the light bending,
as reality tells us, in deep space
modern astronomy shouldn’t
tbe able to explain this at all.
So we have 2R, 3R or 4R, nR,
there should be a bending always,
according to General Relativity.
So, and going back again
what we talked about,
if the Sun bends light rays,
and it has always been the dream of some
astrophysicists to go into deep space
and take a spacecraft and travel
out and find a point in space
where the Sun bends light
rays and they come to a point.
It turns out that you take the 1.75
arcsec and the radius of the Sun
and go out beyond in space, you should
go at least 550 AU
that is 550 times the
orbital radius of Earth.
And that's not likely right now, because
of the space program we have right now.
It's not a silent isn't it maybe
in sometime in the future
I'm not going to be here,
maybe my kids or your kids.
We need some of you guys
younger than I am. You will be here.
So that's not
going to happen right now.
So here is the data.
For the past couple of years
I have managed to publish some papers
in a refereed journal, calculating the impact
parameter at the solar radius.
You calculate a minimum
energy path; you find
then an equation that
will tell you at one solar radius
what the bending would be.
And I come up with the very same
equation as General Relativity,
but it has nothing to do with
General Relativity at all.
So let's go forth  and I might try to summarize
this in the next 5 minutes and I'm done.
There's a principle known
as the Shapiro Delay
and Shapiro was a scientists
who used Mariner satellites
that were put up by the government,
and they used microwave transmission
in communication with
these Mariners satellites.
And we had orbited
around Venus.
There are some orbiting
satellites around Venus
and when I was at NASA
I had a neodymium YAG laser
and one of my
projects got canceled.
These guys took my laser and used
it at the astronomical observatory
to try to hit Venus with that
microwave neodymium YAG laser.
I had this 1,000
milli Joule YAG laser,
and people wouldn't come in my lab
because they were afraid this energy
would burn a hole through.
They used the same laser to cut steel.
So I was working in this lab
and my boss told me if I had an accident that
they just would take the body and do away it.
So this guy didn't
care about me at all.
So I had this laser,
this guy took the laser and tried to
hit Venus with this laser beam, right?
And what happened, you can
always hit these planets
with a microwave beam, right?
It turns out when you go past the Sun and try
to hit a planet out in the solar system,
what happens, they found out that
microwaves will always have a delay.
When you get close to the Sun the delay
would be on the order of a millisecond.
That's a drastic mistake.
What happens, it turns out that this delay
is a function of the microwave frequency
however, for shorter wavelengths
or microwave links at higher
frequencies you get more delay.
So let's go forth and to summarize this picture,
I'm gonna summarize this, and then I will be done.
What happens with the microwave, you'll
get a delay, with the Shapiro effect.
However, microwaves that came in the limb
of the Sun, you'll get light-bending
This is what happens
with microwaves.
The question here is, if Einstein is correct
then, where are the Einstein Rings?
If you have many stars out in
the star-filled skies at night,
you see all these stars right?
And many of those stars are
pretty much like our Sun.
So as we know, all these stars have
a plasma rim associated with it.
And if there is (any) light
bending whatsoever,
we should see Einstein
rings all over the sky.
It's not here, it's not there,
so the question is, where are they.
So reality tells us that light rays
are passing by these stars in deep space
where there's no plasma.
So there's no bending
of the light at all.
So let's go forth  and
I'll just skip this part
about the mathematics and you can
see me, this is on my website,
so you can go to the
mathematics that I calculated
the solar minimum-energy
path and the light bending,
coming up with this equation that general
relativity used. Just a derivation
of the same equation of
relativity, without relativity.
This is bad news
for those guys.
So here's the major event that's going on at the
center of our galaxy known as Sagittarius A
this device, whatever
this thing is,
is estimated at about four million
times the mass of the solar system.
So what happens is, there’s
orbiting stars about this thing,
about 17 some stars orbiting about
this thing all along Kepler paths.
This has been observed for the
last, probably 20 years now.
And this star, S2 is
now on its second orbit,
almost a perfect elliptical
path about this thing,
where the red X is. There’s
this super massive object there
and there's no light bending
in this thing at all.
This is bad news for relativity;
so what (would) happen if relativity were
factual? This is what you should see.
You should see light amplification
or light scattering
somewhere around,
according to the textbooks.
if relativity were actually the case, this
Sagittarius A should look pretty much like that.
You don't see this.
So therefore, where (are) the Einstein
rings and where is the scattering?
You don't see it and this
is what's in the textbook:
a star orbiting about a black hole
should be amplified when it
passes behind the black hole.
You don't see that,
you see it in the textbooks,
but you don't see it in space and
you don't see it in cosmology.
This is what you do see.
This is what you see, here you
see no bending whatsoever.
So, summarizing what I just
talked about all this stuff,
let's this finish up, just skip
over to the summary and conclusion.
And in conclusion you
have the light scattering
and light bending according
to General Relativity
and all these things here.
Let's just summarize
and then I finish. In summary
the gravitational gradient field of the Sun
acts only indirectly on the plasma limb of the Sun,
and there is no bending
whatsoever outside of that.
And you take a look at all electromagnetic
waves propagating (in space) free of plasma,
there’s no bending whatsoever.
Even Einstein
said in his own words,
quoting Einstein, he said
if the velocity of light does depend
on the velocity of the light
source, then all my theories are wrong.
So I'm quoting him right now [reads the German text],
”If the velocity of light is even only a tiny bit dependent on the velocity
of the light source, then my whole theory is wrong”. That’s what he said.
I just use his own words, okay?
And this is Einstein, okay?
This is it.

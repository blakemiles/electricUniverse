Welcome to Space News from
the Electric Universe,

Our planet's atmosphere is home to
extraordinary electrical activity.
It's been known for decades that
electric currents from the Sun
induce our planet's aurorae,
a radical hypothesis originally proposed
over a century ago by Kristian Birkeland,
which ultimately proved correct.
And the profound influence of these electric
currents, called Birkeland currents,
 has become increasingly
undeniable to mainstream science.
However, the Electric Universe has always
proposed that Birkeland currents from the Sun
have a far greater effect
on our planet's atmosphere,
including its jet stream
and wind patterns,
than the scientific mainstream
has ever considered.
As we've noted, retired professor of
electrical engineering Dr. Donald Scott
developed a mathematical model of
the structure of a Birkeland current,
which can be identified visually
as counterrotating cylinders.
We have suggested that the counterrotation
clearly seen at the poles of Jupiter,
Saturn, Neptune,
and in the earthly aurorae
are the consistent indicators of
the Birkeland current's influence.
Today, Dr. Scott invites the
Electric Universe community
to explore the ways one might
actually be able to track
the presence of Birkeland
currents in Earth's atmosphere.
It's been long suggested, as many of the
folks who looked at Space News are aware,
that back in the early part of the
1900’s Kristian Birkeland suggested that
electric current coming from the
Sun down into the poles of the Earth
was the cause of
the Earth's Auroras.
And he got a lot of flak from the
astronomical community for saying that.
But after World War II when we sent
rockets up into the upper atmosphere,
we found that exactly
that was occurring
and so we now know that he was
correct in saying what he said.
Well anyway, in 2015 I presented a,
what I call a Bessel function model
of the form and structure of what those
Birkeland currents might look like.
In other words, were they like a stream of
water from a garden hose or what was it?
Well, actually the structure of the Birkeland
current is quite complicated, quite complex,
but generally, one of the most
obvious properties of it is,
it contains concentric
counter-rotating regions.
And so if you think of a pipe
within a pipe within a pipe
and all these pipes are going in the opposite
direction from the ones just inward or outside them,
you get a general idea and if something
like that, with that property,
hits the atmosphere then generally if it
causes the aurora, which we now know it does,
the aurora should have some sort of
a counterrotating property to it.
Not necessarily visible all the
time, but you should be able to see,
oh look,
there's counterrotation.
That's right, that is the way
that those things are formed.
And of course, there's, we've also
seen supporting evidence for that
by some of the NASA videos of the North
Pole of Saturn, the North Pole of Jupiter,
and there is accumulating evidence
that this is indeed what is happening.
Well, the reason I'm kind of interested
in talking to you this morning
is that there is a website which,
I think, is an excellent website.
If you go on there, you'll see this round
circle, which is of course the Earth.
So if you look down in the lower
left-hand corner of that screen,
you'll see the word Earth.
Just click on that, it'll bring up a menu of
things, the first thing on the top is the Date
and what I've selected is
the wind at 10 hectopascals.
A hectopascal is a
fancy name for millibar,
so 10 millibars is
very, very low pressure.
So if you look down in that menu,
you will see Scale and Source
― sources like US
National Weather Service,
Control, you see, Mode...
Now when it comes to Mode,
make sure you click on Air.
Air should be in a gold color.
You can look at the ocean, you can
look at chemistry, particles in space,
but air is what you
want to look at.
And the Height, next line down.
Way over on the right, you have
the opportunity to click on 10 hPa,
10 millibars, which is way up,
it's around, estimates vary,
but I would say it's somewhere
between 30 and 50 kilometers up,
so it's really really outer
edges of the atmosphere.
And the overlay that you want is Wind
and the projection that you want is O.
If you do that and then you want to get
rid of that menu, you just click on Earth,
on the word Earth again,
and it'll go down.
If you click on the globe, you'll
see, when you push on the globe,
on a point on the globe,
you will see a little green circle
and wherever you click, you can move
that it looks like you move the world up,
you will see that
it rotates the globe
and you can get a look at
the southern hemisphere.
And if you look at that southern hemisphere,
that's my ta-ta come-to-Jesus moment,
that is obviously counterrotation
of those wind flows,
here is a tremendously strong
clockwise circulation of wind
(around the), centered on
the continent of Antarctica.
And then as you go a little bit farther north,
there's another sort of a vacant spot
which is the center of a very tiny,
very weak vestigial counterclockwise flow,
the flow around the
South Pole is clockwise,
we would normally call
that a west to east flow.
And then as you go still farther
north, still south of the equator,
you see a very, very
strong, east to west,
you can see the equator that runs right
through Ecuador and across the Pacific there.
So there is no doubt that in
the upper atmosphere of Earth,
there is counterrotation of the
air in our upper atmosphere.
So anyway, if we go down
deeper into the atmosphere,
all of a sudden the wind
flow becomes distorted
and it's this sort of a
sinusoidal, sinuous kind of a flow.
It's not a circular flow anymore,
you can see that's a chaos;
wind flow is circular,
sinuous, all sorts of stuff.
And you say well, why is that?
Well, I submit that's because the wind
distribution, where the wind flows,
are being disturbed by
all sorts of things,
the farther down you get,
the closer to the surface you get,
the more important land masses and
storms, regions of high and low humidity,
high and low pressure,
all sorts of variants occur
to disrupt that beautiful
circular pattern.
So let's, in effect if you go
all the way down to the surface,
that's SFC, the one just
to the left of a thousand,
and go back and look at the
Earth, you see that this
yeah, that's kind of what it
looks like, there's a storm,
sort of off that peninsula
that sticks out of Antarctica.
It's a very interesting and, I think,
very educational kind of website.
But anyway, back to my main point and that
is looking at the wind at ten millibars,
way, way up there in
the upper atmosphere,
you can then go to the North Pole, whoa!
The North Pole is very different.
You look there and you realize
that there are two circular flows,
one centered pretty much on
the north end of Greenland,
it's not a circular,
it's a more of an elliptic
or hotdog shaped center to
that, that circular pattern.
And then over there centered
right about on the Bering Sea
between the Aleutian Islands and the
Kamchatka peninsula, there's another one
another center, if you will, that's,
that secondary one is weaker,
you can see that the red colors,
the purple, shows the strength of the flow.
There's a, in vector calculus there is
an operator called the curl operator.
If you look at your right
hand and curl your fingers
and then like make-believe
you're picking up a screwdriver
with your fingers curled
around the handle
and your thumb pointed down
the blade of the screwdriver.
If you set your hand on
that North Pole region
with your fingers going in the
direction of the purple flow,
you can see your thumb
is pointing up, outward,
and if that Birkeland
current is doing that,
that says the current there
is flowing out of the Earth,
and then you look at the other one just to
the left, the one that's over the Bering Sea,
you have to push your, put your
thumb in a downward direction
to have your fingers go in
the direction of that flow.
So that says there's a current
going in, a less strong one,
it's a sort of a vestigial current
but it's very strange that there’s two
- well one Birkeland
current that's split,
one going in one direction and
one going in the other direction,
and again if you go back and rotate the
globe and look down at the South Pole,
then there is that major one, not quite
as strong as the one at the North Pole
but the one circulating around
Antarctica in a clockwise direction,
that would say that the
current is going in,
and that little vestigial one, that looks like a
current would be coming out of the globe
because the circulation
is counterclockwise.
I submit that these
patterns are indicative
and I should say, additional
substantially supportive evidence
that my idea of what the Birkeland
current structure looks like,
is indeed happening
here on Earth,
and the last Space News we did was about
this magnetic pole wandering around.
Yes well, these Birkeland currents can
also wander around, I don't mean that
one's going to wander up into the
equatorial regions or anything like that,
but you can see from day to day that the size
of these, the strength of these flows vary
and the location of their centers
of these circular flows vary
and just as an electric arc
would, from a welding machine,
it'll be at least if a welder knows what
he's doing, it'll wander all over the piece.
So I leave you with that thought
and I think, I submit that this
is more additional evidence that the
Electric Universe has opened the door,
I think to finding the answer
to this big question as
how does the Sun affect
weather on the Earth
and the answer is,
via the Birkeland current.

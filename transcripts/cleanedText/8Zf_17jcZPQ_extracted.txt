Earth's Primordial Stellar Host
Dwardu Cardona
escaped the cage of answers
at about the age of 15,
growing up in Malta in a highly
defined Catholic environment,
he wanted more.
And so he entered into
a life of curiosity.
And he came to Canada,
now I got to know as an aside;
What's... How did we start
slipping up in the U.S.?
All these guys are
going to Canada!
What, what, what, it's...
Yeah, I mean I like Canada.
But, come on, really?
Well, he's in Vancouver now, and that's
still pretty close to the U.S. there.
Okay, was a little, we'll grant him that,
in between Alaska
and Washington.
But the former editor of the Journal
Aeon, co-editor of the journal Kronos,
author of many books, four of which are
available here on our, at our bookstore
and they are excellent,
really fascinating.
So this morning Dwardu is going to
pick up where he left off last year.
Welcome Dwardu Cardona!
EARTH'S PRIMORDIAL STELLAR HOST
Thank you!
Actually, I had no idea when I
prepared to talk I am about to give
that my good friend Wallace Thornhill
would be presenting a paper
that touches on exactly the same series
of events that I am about to discuss,
which he did yesterday morning.
That said however,
it does indicate,
actually it stresses
the importance of the
events in question.
As pointed out in the paper I
read at last year's conference,
there are still those on Earth who
are adamant in stating that the Sun
that shone above the heads of their
ancestors was not the present one.
And judging by the way it is described in
mankind's Universal mythohistorical record,
the ancient Sun that shone above
our ancient ancestors' heads
appears to have been much too
close, even if somewhat dim,
and yet exceptionally warm
for it to have been the one that
presently shines above our heads.
What such a Sun best fits is what
is known as a brown dwarf star.
There was a time when brown dwarfs,
who are believed to fail as stars
because their low mass prohibits them from
attaining internal nuclear reactions;
but if astronomical bodies achieved the stellar
qualities to spatial electrical energy,
bodies with lesser mass than normal stars
could still exhibit astral characteristics
even if in a minor way.
As it is, brown dwarf stars have now been
found to be produced in all possible masses
between planets and stars.
By the end of 2004 it could
be additionally reported
that there is no
longer any doubt
that these substellar objects
exist throughout the galaxy
numbering as much as
100 billion members.
In fact, brown dwarf stars
are as common as stars
and not only do brown dwarf stars look
like stars, they behave like stars as well.
On the basis of detections by
the Hubble Space Telescope
the conclusion has now been reached that
brown dwarfs form the same way stars do.
In fact, they are presently
considered to be bonafide stars.
There are various incidentally mythological
expositions from around the world
that proclaim the manner in which God's
creation is said to have unfolded.
In quite a few of these narratives, we
come across an attempted elucidation
of a mysterious substance
that seems to have existed
before whatever God commenced to create
whatever it was said that he created.
In the biblical book of Genesis, this
entity is described as "Tohu wa-bohu",
which is traditionally translated as
"without form and void" or "void and empty"
but which better translates
as "utter chaos".
And it was out of this very chaos
that God is said to have organized
whatever it was that he created.
This belief incidentally is not
unique to the Old Testament.
It was no different among the classical
Greeks as recounted by no other than Hesiod.
The Chinese called
this chaos "Tao,"
describing it as having
not only been chaotic
but also nebulous in its nature
while it constantly revolved.
To the Yuki Amerins it was
an indistinct something
that they likened to fog and/or foam
that will drowned in round continually.
A similar primordial foggy substance
is also mentioned in oceanic mythology
while the Pima compared it
to a fluffy bit of cotton
that drifted to and fro.
Others compared the material to a
stretch of whirling slime or mud,
an eddying of waters, a
whirling ocean in the sky.
One can brush these descriptions aside as
being nothing about the mythological ravings
that would have originated in
early man's ignorance of nature.
And, to be sure, I myself
was somewhat confused
as to what these mythological
reports were alluding to
until I happened to glance at one
of Chesley Bonestell's paintings
illustrating the placental
cloud of matters
surrounding Earth in its
early formative period.
Needless to say, man could not have been
around during that early time on Earth
so he could not have based his
reports on that manifestation.
However, similar so-called
placental clouds
now refer to as circumstellar disks
are also known to girdle stars.
Could ancient man have seen
such a circumstellar disk
whirling around Earth's
previous stellar host?
Do brown dwarfs even
harbor such disks?
In 2001, a team from the Harvard-Smithsonian
Center for Astrophysics
discovered what they
termed "Warm Dusty Disks"
around some of the
free-floating dwarf stars
that were by then being detected
in ever growing numbers.
A year later gas and dust disks
around substellar objects
were being written about
as a matter of fact.
And to be sure, as time went by
more than a hundred brown dwarf stars
were discovered in the Orion Nebula alone,
60% of which turned out to be surrounded
by nebulous clouds of warm dust.
That such disks encircle brown dwarf
stars is now universally accepted.
More than half the brown dwarf stars that
have been discovered display such discs
and the friction may
be as high as 80%.
In fact, brown dwarfs are girdled by
disks just as often as stars are
while their disks have been
calculated to last just as long.
As is usual in such cases,
astronomers were astonished,
not to say perplexed,
that these disks behave so
much like the ones around
much more massive
newly forming stars.
In the meantime, modern mythologist
should not be blamed for being at a loss
in attempting to understand what
our forefathers were alluding to.
Giving the nebulosity
of such a disc,
to say nothing of the difficulty
it must have presented
to being conferred to
terrestrial substances,
the vagueness of its various
descriptions is understandable.
Even so, judging by the overly dusty
and gaseous nature of such disks,
it is hardly surprising
that ancient man
would have described the one seen
around Earth's primordial Sun
as a nebulous substance comparable to
fog, foam, fluff, eddying slime, or mud;
all of which have been added to what was later
simply alluded to as a chaotic substance.
In addition to this circumstellar cloud,
ancient societies also described
what appeared to them as a twirling column
of wind associated with that very cloud.
This can be gleaned all the way from
the beliefs of the Canaanites,
across those of the Egyptians
to Buddhist countries,
the Americas as well
as the South Pacific.
Not only was this wind described
as having been cyclonic in nature
but to have also acted as a
column supporting the sky.
Such for instance was
the Egyptian Shu
as well as the
Mesoamerican Ehecatl.
Since this columnar entity was seen
emanating from Earth's primeval Sun,
it was also thought of as the
celestial gods' single-leg
as in the Hindu case of
the one foot of Brahma
but also Vishnu and the Daramulum
of the Australian aborigines.
To others this appendage was
remembered as god's supporting phallus
that was also surprisingly described as
the downward flow of light from above.
The most descriptive aspect
of this appendage, however,
was as a sky pillar that has gone down
among mythologists as the axis mundi
concerning which entire
books can be written.
Additional to that was the associated
description of the cyclonic wind,
single leg, phallus,
and other items
as having had the appearance
of a whirling ray from above.
What could this brilliant
whirling ray have been?
There has been and continues to be more
than one interpretation of the effulgent,
effulgent ray of light that
ancient man saw stretching between
the primordial Sun above
and the land beneath his feet.
One of these was Ralph Juergens.
Whose theory that the
column like structure
might have been in the nature
of a steady electric discharge.
As time went by, Juergens' concept was
lent validity through the discovery
of so called astral jets of plasma
that are ejected by galaxies
as well as stars, along
the rotational axis.
One can argue that the
colossal size of these jets
would eliminate their
possible occurrence
in association with the much less
massive brown dwarf stars.
But as I reasoned
right from the start,
if these jets can stretch in size
between galactic and stellar magnitudes,
the difference in size
of which is enormous,
what would keep them from
existing in lesser dimensions?
After all, the difference in scale
between brown dwarfs and regular stars
is much less than that
between stars and galaxies.
Or, if brown dwarf stars can be surrounded by a
scaled-down version of a circumstellar disk,
why cannot they emit a scaled-down
version of a stellar jet?
Wallace Thornhill, who was not
adverse to this concept,
indicated that this jet would have
been a sustained plasma discharge
in the form of Birkeland current,
which claim was upheld by the
plasma physicist Anthony Peratt.
The problem with all this stem from the fact
that at the time I came to this conclusion
jetting brown dwarf stars
were still unknown
and yet, when I discussed this problem
with the astrophysicist Doug Lynn,
his verdict was that jets from brown
dwarf stars were not only possible
but very probable.
Lynn's privately tendered personal
opinion was lent probability
less than a year after he had
voiced it, when spectral lines
that are normally
observed in stellar jets
were actually detected
in brown dwarf stars.
As time went by, other than spectral
lines, actual jets and even violent ones
were depicted spouting from
these brown dwarf stars.
As Emma Whelan from the Dublin Institute
for Advanced Studies has stated,
"Jets are confirmed to flow
from a huge range of objects
from the largest galaxies
to tiny brown dwarf stars."
Meanwhile, that brown dwarf stars
can be accompanied by planets
was proven in 2005 when a
planet was actually imaged
in association with
such a brown dwarf star.
Not long after that, more
of the same came to light,
not only that but an
entire planetary system
was eventually detected
forming around a brown dwarf
that is barely larger
than a giant planet.
That is therefore
nothing strange
in Earth having once been the
protege of a brown dwarf star.
As those who are familiar with the
thesis I am here submitting now,
Earth's primordial brown dwarf star
eventually turned into the gaseous planet
we now know as Saturn.
And yes, I do realize that those who are not
familiar with the astronomical evidence
that backs this up will
find it hard to accept.
That Earth had formerly been a
satellite of the Proto-Saturnian body
was first hinted at by
Oskar Reichenbach in 1884
before it was taken up by
Immanuel Velikovsky in 1971.
And that the planetary Saturn
had originally been deified
and adored as mankind supreme
god all over the ancient world,
was magnificently documented by David
Talbott during the same decade.
Indeed, as Talbott stated,
"The consistency with
which early astronomers
identify Saturn as the former
Creator King is extraordinary."
As he reported concerning his research
of Earth's primordial catastrophic history,
"Nothing came as a
greater surprise to me
than the sheer quantity of material bearing
directly on the Saturnian tradition."
And as I myself discovered during my own
investigations of the same traditions,
the Saturnian deity kept showing up in every
mytho-historical avenue that I followed,
despite the fact that I actually tried
very hard to get away from him.
Because of a major event, a turning
point in Earth's cosmic history,
to which I shall
get you in a while,
it was posited by Juergens that Earth and
this primordial Proto-Saturnian stellar host
had been traveling together outside
the demarcation of the solar system
before they were captured
by our present Sun.
And as unusual as that
may sound to some,
stars are known to wander
alone through space
vacating their systems
and/or invading others.
Nor are regular stars
alone in this class
since the conglomeration of these three
wanderers also include brown dwarfs.
Some of these dwarfs are known
to orbit sun-like stars
but most of them are actually
floating freely through space.
And free-floating
sub-brown dwarfs
similar to the one posited
as Earth's primordial Sun,
are more numerous than
their larger siblings.
What, however, was it that made Juergens theorize
that Saturn and Earth had been floating
outside the solar system demarcation
before their capture by our present Sun?
As with various other matters,
this too was based by Juergens
on yet another concept that had
been proposed by Velikovsky.
As Velikovsky had it stated in an
almost offhand manner back in mid 1973,
Saturn had somehow flared
up in nova-like brilliance.
It is unfortunate that Velikovsky
misplaced the event in time,
placing Proto-Saturn's
flare up just ahead
of what has come down
to us as Noah's deluge
when there is much better evidence for
placing it some 5000 years earlier
during that primeval event that lit
up the sky for the very first time
during mankind's
surging on Earth.
In the book of Genesis, this event came
to pass when Elohim gave the order to
"Let there be light."
But let this not be thought of as a
unique biblical event. On the contrary,
this sudden shedding of light
into what had been a somewhat
darkened world is
described in various ways
in the mytho-historical records
of just about all ancient nations,
from Mesopotamia and the
rest of the Near East, India
and the Far East including China
into Egypt down to Africa,
Greece and Rome,
North America and across the stormy
seas to the islands in their midst.
As far as Juergens was concerned, the
sudden flare-up resulted when the Sun
captured the Proto-Saturnian system
including Earth into its electrical domain.
Thus, according to him, Proto-Saturn's discharge
was diverted to the new ruling body
since Proto-Saturn found itself much too
highly charged for its altered environment.
This concept was later taken
up by Wallace Thornhill,
who pointed out that Proto-Saturn's
entry into the solar plasmasphere
would have required rapid adjustment by the
intruder to the new electrical environment
where the Sun was the main
focus of electrical activity.
So likewise, Donald Scott, when he spoke
of bodies like Proto-Saturn and the Sun
possessing different
inherent voltages.
Thus he tells us that when the
plasma spheres of such bodies
come in contact with one another, an electric
current in the form of an arc discharge
will fly between them to the
detriment of the lower voltage body.
In the case in question, the lower
voltage body was Proto-Saturn,
our primordial Sun, flared up in a
brilliant, blinding light that went down
in mytho-history as Day One.
But can brown dwarfs
freely flare?
You bet they can and do.
Very much like bonafide stars, brown
dwarfs also have a tendency to flare up.
The brightness produced
by their X-ray emissions
during these outbursts were originally
considered hard to believe
and said to have
shocked scientists.
Such rays have
even been detected
from what are considered to
be lightweight brown dwarfs,
strong radio waves
spiking at 10,000 times
stronger than what
astronomers thought possible,
indicating flare energies that have actually
been compared to those emitted by the Sun
have also been detected
from these stellar dwarfs.
There is an awful lot of
mytho-historical material
indicating the creative outflow emitted
by the Proto-Saturnian flare up.
As in other matters, toward the
world we come across this outflow
as having actually spiraled
out across the sky.
As in other matters, it is not easy to get
away from what has gone down in mythology
as the spiral of creation.
And here once again we find
that on a much larger scale
eruptive material from supernovae has a
tendency to expel electromagnetic detritus
in vast widening
spiraling streams
as can be seen in the eruptive matter
expelled by the giant red star
known as R Sculptoris.
While it's a sub-brown dwarf,
Proto-Saturn's discharge
would have been nowhere as
close to that of a supernova,
it should be kept in mind that within
the restrictions of certain parameters,
plasmatic occurrences can be scaled up or
down from microcosmic to macrocosmic extents
without losing their
intrinsic behavior.
It, therefore, seemed that what
our ancient forebears described
to have seen spiraling
out across the sky,
was an accurate report of what was
actually transpiring at the time.
That the planet Saturn is the end
result of brown dwarf degeneration,
has more than been
implied by orthodoxy.
As Glenn Schneider opined,
"Given a billion years of
cooling and evolution
and these objects may be
indistinguishable from planets."
Or, as Maria Zapatero
Osório stated,
"With time, brown dwarfs will
look like Jupiter and Saturn."
That's for that billion years
required for such a devolution,
how about that monster of a protostar
in the Sophias constellation
that has been claimed
by astronomers
to be able to develop into a high
mass star in about a mere 10,000 years?
Coincidentally or not, 10,000 years is
precisely the amount of time Sam Flamsteed
claimed it would take a brown dwarf star to
turn into a Jupiter- or Saturn-sized planet.
In fact, let us be quite honest.
As it has been pointed out, the line between
planets and brown dwarfs is rather blurred.
At present, planet Saturn radiates more
heat than it receives from the Sun.
Its total heat emission has
been calculated to be about
two or three times the solar
energy it actually receives
and, as it has been claimed,
an actual internal heat source
is definitely called for.
At present, it is believed that
helium, percolating toward the core,
is responsible for
this excess heat
that has turned Saturn into a world
that is hotter than it should be.
But, in view of what the
ancients had to say,
it is more than probable
that Saturn's excess heat
is a residue from when it radiated
as Earth's primordial Sun.
Besides its excess heat, Saturn
also shines with its own light.
At least to an extent.
As low as its illumination is, its glow, which
has been likened to a Chinese lantern,
is sufficient to back fly
to the planet's clouds.
But let us cut straight
across the lawn.
That the planet Saturn is the relic of what
had previously been a brown dwarf star
is now an accept tenet
of mainstream astronomy,
and there are indications
or is there any evidence
that Earth did not always
belong to the solar system?
As a matter of fact,
NASA's Genesis spacecraft
made a hell of a discovery
when its instruments revealed that
the solar system's inner planets,
including Earth,
do not contain the same ratios of
oxygen and nitrogen as the Sun.
While the interstellar
boundary Explorer
found that the gases contained
within the entire solar system
are different from those
outside its boundaries.
What all this and other evidence
has been interpreted to mean
is that the solar system,
including Earth, came into being
in a different part of the galaxy than
the one in which it('s) presently located.
More importantly however, the Genesis
spacecraft readings imply that Earth
could not have formed out of
the same nebulous material
that is thought to
have created the Sun.
What all this boils
down to is that,
while the Sun seems to have shifted its
location within the Milky Way galaxy,
some of its members including
Earth had to have been captured
into its chaotic
family even later.
As it happens and this
is not at all surprising,
our ancient forefathers have been
telling us that long, long ago
the Sun was young, the
present Sun was young
and no bigger than a star.
They continued to
tell us as time...
they continued to tell of the time
when the Sun was originally very small,
hardly a nail's breadth across,
but as they also said, one day it suddenly
began to grow till it was a span across.
One interesting point about
these reports is that the Sun,
the present Sun,
was not merely remembered as having
been smaller than it is at present
or that it grew in size but
that it was known that
this resulted because it had
actually still been far away.
It, therefore, seemed that
our ancient ancestors
we are not exaggerating in their
descriptions of these primordial events.
So please, let us pay attention
to what they have recorded.
Thank you for listening.

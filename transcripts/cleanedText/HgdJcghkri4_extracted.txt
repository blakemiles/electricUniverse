From Cosmic Currents
to the Electric Sun
No pressure!
What I want to do, and I'd like to thank
Michael Clarage for his introductory talk.
I thought
that was brilliant.
What I wanted to do here is to talk about
the problem of trying to figure out
how we connect an electric
Sun to cosmic currents.
And just to talk initially about
the Electric Universe itself,
I came across this quote from
Science on the 16th of November.
"The most important characteristic
of a paradigm is its fruitfulness."
And I think Michael has pointed out the
fruitfulness of the Electric Universe paradigm.
There's a couple of things I just
like to read from that article,
which I think are
very appropriate.
It says, in the midst of a revolution,
what counts as good evidence
and reason in a discipline, are
themselves open to dispute.
Important terms or concepts
change their meaning
or even cease to be meaningful
in the new paradigm.
Modern science isn't
fruitful, it's dogmatic.
It generates no new insights and
it produces no new outcomes,
no new ways of
generating evidence.
Science in Kuhn's image, must be
productive or its paradigm must change.
And that is the thing that's been driving
me ever since I began this journey.
So the question is what
makes the Sun shine?
And this has been thrown
into sharp relief.
Just recently with this
article published in Science,
I think it was.
And a couple of quotes there:
"Convective velocities",
that is the convection region of the
Sun, just beneath the photosphere,
"are 20 to 100 times weaker than
current theoretical estimates..."
That essentially means that the theory
of how the Sun works is incorrect
because somehow or another, the Sun is
supposed to get the intense radiation
from the center, from the core
out to the surface to give us the
heat and light that we observe.
And what we've found now is that
one of the key links in that
transfer of energy is missing.
Of course, this prompts
the question:
What actually does transport the heat
flux of the solar luminosity outwards?
But a better question is:
"does Sun shine come
from within the Sun?"
And the Electric Universe has said
from the beginning that it doesn't.
And this I think, is some
confirmatory evidence.
If we look at star birth,
as I said yesterday,
star birth is a gravitational
accident in the Big Bang cosmology.
But this is a quote from over
30 years ago, from Hannes Alfvén,
"There is a general belief that stars
are forming by gravitational collapse;
in spite of vigorous efforts
no one has yet found
any observational
indication of confirmation.
Thus the 'generally accepted'
theory of stellar formation
may be one of a hundred
unsupported dogmas
which constitute a large part of
present-day astrophysics."
Now, the reason for
introducing this is that
if we're going to look at how
a star connects to the galaxy,
one of the bits of evidence
we can look at is star birth.
What actually goes on?
And this is what the infrared
telescopes have been telling us
that stars are formed along
cosmic current filaments
Of course, the reports don't talk about electric
current, they just talk about the filaments.
This is a network of 27
star-forming filaments
derived from the
Herschel observatory.
They're numbered there because in the
original report they were very interested
in the fact that the filaments are huge,
stretching for tens of light-years,
and regardless of their length or density,
the filament, the width is always the same.
And what is that
reminiscent of?
A lightning bolt!
The lightning bolt stretches
from the clouds to the ground
and its width remains roughly the
same over that entire distance.
So what we're looking at in effect is
a form of cloud to cloud lightning.
What's more, the stars within
these filaments flicker!
Now, the gravitational model
doesn't allow for that
because for it to flicker requires
material to be added to the star
repeatedly and very quickly.
So astronomers were
surprised to see
the brightness of young objects
varying by more than 20%
over just these few weeks,
since the accretion process
should take years or
even centuries...
But of course, we all know how
electric lights can flicker.
Lightning itself can flicker.
The quote of course is:
"Yet again, Herschel
observations surprise us."
This is a very recent image
which shows a bipolar nebula.
It's described as a newborn
star which is rather odd
because most of the bipolar,
in fact all of the bipolar
nebulae that I've seen so far,
have referred to them as dying
stars ejecting material.
But here we have one that's
supposed to be being born.
So there seems to be
some confusion here.
Also it says there are hundreds of
low-mass brown dwarfs in that cloud
and this provides us
with some ideas about
how stars are born,
where they're born
and also the chances of capture
a brown dwarf by bright stars
which impinges of course
on the Saturn story.
The red dust at the center is thought
to produce the hourglass shape.
This is the mantra that's used
in all of these bipolar nebulas
that it has to have a disk of matter
right at the center of that hourglass
which somehow causes the
material ejected from the star
to take these particular
shapes, the hourglass shape.
This is another visible
stellar circuit.
This of course is supposed
to be a dying star.
It's an hourglass shape and it
has an odd-looking focus there.
It's 8,000 light-years distant.
Remember that example
I gave yesterday
where if the Earth's orbit was two inches
across and the Sun was a speck of dust,
that you could measure the
distances of stars by miles.
So that'll be 8,000 miles
away, there's a speck of dust
which has this particular
interesting shape.
Here it says, the hourglass shape is produced
by the expansion of a fast stellar wind
within a slowly expanding cloud which is
denser near its equator than at its poles.
Now these are all very
special conditions.
How and why are these
conditions established?
There was no real explanation
of these objects.
And the formation of the shape of the
inner "eye" is not yet fully understood.
It's interesting
they call it an eye
because that was a very
powerful reference in mythology
to some of the things that were witnessed
in the electrical events in prehistory.
This is another visible
stellar circuit.
This one is 2,100 miles
away as a speck of dust,
if you would like to
look at it in that way
to give you some perspective.
This particular nebula represents
the spectacular 'last gasp'
of a binary star system
at the nebula center.
You notice they're 'dying stars'.
In the Electric Universe, the age
or the life and death of the star
is not measured at
all in this way.
Astronomers theorize that
the gravity of one star
pulls some of the gas from
the surface of the other
and flings it into a thin, dense
disc extending into space.
This magic that gravity
is asked to perform,
can in no way explain all of the
detailed parts of this nebula.
You'll notice that
it's coaxial too.
There's an outer cone and
then there's an inner one
and then there's these strange
bright objects here, here and here.
None of these are explained
by this particular model.
And yet we have a
quote like this,
"Such a disk and successfully account for
the jet-exhaust-like appearance of M2-9."
I don't think so.
Here's another visible stellar circuit
and this one is really stunning.
In fact, Peter Tuthill from
Sydney University said,
"The thing that really takes your breath
away is the astonishing degree of symmetry
within the intricate
linear form."
Now, I'm not sure whether you can see it all
that well with the light on the screen
but you can see these
descriptions here,
the rungs here, there's rungs
and there's thin filaments
radiating from this central point.
What I've done here is
put my little addition.
I'm calling these Birkeland
current filaments
and I'm calling these rungs here
across those filaments, double layers.
Because double layers are regions in
plasma where particles are accelerated
and you tend to get
a glow as a result.
And you can have
multiple double layers
when the plasma is changing in
density as you move towards the star.
So you see here's one that's
quite bright, that rung there.
"A series of rungs and
conical surfaces lie nested,
one within the next, down
to the heart of the system,
where the hyperbolic bicone
surfaces are crossed
by a dark lane running
across the principal axis."
And of course, this is usually referred
to as your disk of dust and so on,
which produces this shape.
But this is so intricate
and beautiful
that it cannot be formed by an explosion
of gas and dust and that kind of thing.
But, it does have all the characteristics
of an electrical pinch discharge.
"It is fascinating to
take a second look
at one of the most famous astronomical
images of them all: SN1987A."
Now, this particular supernova
is important in my life
because I had a peer-reviewed paper
published on an electrical explanation
of SN1987A in the IEEE
Plasma Sciences journal.
With the help of Tony Peratt
who also had several
other papers published,
including one on the formation
of Martian blueberries and so on
in an electrical discharge
in that same issue.
So for me, that was a milestone.
To get peer-reviewed papers
published on the Electric Universe
is extremely difficult
as you might imagine.
This object is the 'Red
Square' as it's called.
It's 34 times closer than the supernovae
so you can see far more detail.
It was described as "...the best
astrophysical laboratory yet [discovered]
for studying the physics of
generating the mysterious sharp polar-
ring systems like that around SN1987A."
"...a system as complex
and fascinating as this
is bound to keep us guessing
for years to come."
Well as soon as I saw this,
I published my explanation.
And since then I've heard
nothing from the experts
but it's sitting there,
waiting for their discovery.
This is the supernova I referred to and
here I'm only showing the central ring.
The important thing about this diagram
is that it gives you some impression
of the complexity of what goes
on in these plasma discharges.
For instance, this is the neck.
If you consider, right at the very apex of
those hyperbolic curves sits this pinch.
And this is from Tony Peratt,
this particular diagram.
And as it pinches down, it forms
these particle beam columns
right in the center of
this, sort of purplish spot,
there is a central column but then
it's surrounded by a ring of filaments
and they take on
characteristic numbers.
Now around Supernova 1987A,
this is where the actual object,
where the object
was that exploded,
you have this ring
of bright spots.
There are three coaxial
rings. There was one up here
and this is symmetrical, so down here
you've got the same kind of feature,
and there was a third
ring down here.
But they're all coaxial,
which is significant
because it, more or less, says
that this is what was going on.
It was sitting at the centre
of a plasma z-pinch discharge.
I predicted at the time
that these bright spots
would not behave as if there was a
shock-wave racing out from the star.
I also said that they
should appear to rotate
and that they will
flicker in brightness.
So far I haven't seen, I haven't
followed up to check just to see
but all of these predictions are sitting
there, waiting to be confirmed.
What happened next was that
we found around the Sun,
in the Sun's
interstellar interface,
the IBEX mission discovered that there are
energetic neutral atoms, called ENA's,
which were arriving in the Solar System
and they took on this ring shape.
What's more, they
had bright spots,
these yellow and red spots.
So we have around the
Sun, in plasma dark mode,
because they're not
visibly bright,
this same ring and it's also set
perpendicular to the local magnetic field.
So all of these things
fit the electrical model.
But it raises the question then,
how does this connect to the
Sun, how does it power it?
This is what I wrote
back in 2005:
"The solar plasma and that of interstellar
space are two different plasmas
which must therefore have a "double layer"
or Langmuir plasma sheath between them.
So to treat the heliospheric boundary
simply as a magnetohydrodynamic..."
it's a hell of a word
"...shock problem..."
it just means a magnetized fluid,
and like something plowing through water
or an aircraft plowing through the air
"...is naive."
it's not what we will find.
And of course, since that date the
evidence has been piling up in favor
of the fact that it is not
a hydrodynamic shock.
In fact it was said that there
is no shock, just recently.
Also, this is just describing
in terms of my diagram,
that I used back then,
what's going on.
This is the Sun, this is your speck
of dust, around it is the heliosphere
which, remember I said, if the Sun is a
speck of dust this is 20 feet wide.
The solar wind comes out and
it goes, it continues on,
it continues on out to these
Birkeland current filaments.
This is the looking at a
cross-section through that cylinder.
That supernova
cylinder if you like.
So here's one of these particle
beams coming down here.
It meets the solar wind, it neutralizes
some of the ions coming from the Sun
and those that are happened to be
moving in a way towards the heliosphere
will come back in and be
registered by the IBEX mission.
So this is what the IBEX mission
found, is these things here.
And even more recently,
as I said, the Sun's Z-pinch is aligned
with the local galactic magnetic field
which is what the
IBEX mission found.
The ENA's come from solar wind ions
meeting the Z-pinch current cylinder
and then returning back
into the Solar System.
And also up here we have the possibility
of double layers in this central column
and evidence for these particle-
accelerating double layers is arriving.
Remember in the 'Red Square'
image, I showed you those rungs.
It's this kind of thing
that forms the rung.
So that if there are some out here, you
would also see this rung across this pinch.
And just very recently,
December the 4th 2012,
the Voyager 1
crossed a boundary.
Now the expectation was that when
Voyager 1 crossed this boundary,
these magnetic field lines would,
all those particles and so on,
would be blown aside by
this headwind if you like,
and travel around the
heliosphere like that.
Instead of that, what they found
is that the particles suddenly,
they keep going, the magnetic
field keeps going out this way.
Which is what I said on the other
diagram, they continue on.
What's more, the particles
seem to be accelerated here.
There are no slow solar wind
particles beyond this spot
and that is also expected
on that electrical model.
The quote here is of course "...the
new region isn't what we expected,
but we've come to expect the
unexpected from Voyager."
Here is an active
stellar circuit
and Michael Clarage also showed you
this object, this is the Crab Nebula.
This object,
which shows you the complex
activity around this star.
It's supposed to be a neutron star
with a period of 33 milliseconds,
which means it's
spinning extremely fast.
But you'll notice some of the
things that are going on here,
which I'll show you in
more detail in a moment.
These are called wisps
and these are hotspots
and this is the central object.
But this thing here
is of interest.
Because just recently, it's been found
to be the source of intense gamma rays.
They are only discovered
because, by accident,
because they only
occur for a day or so
and you have to be looking at the object
just at the right time to pick it up.
Now before I show you that close up, I'm
going to talk about the plasma focus.
The plasma focus is a
very simple device
but it also is capable of producing the most
concentrated form of electromagnetic energy
and also the most concentrated source
of neutrons and high-energy particles.
In a beam, you'll notice, in a jet!
All you've got is two
different conductors,
an outer electrode,
an inner electrode.
And if you discharge this capacitor
bank which stores electrical energy,
across this switch between
these two electrodes,
what happens is that a discharge
moves down the barrel,
comes out here, balloons
around, comes back in here
and forms a particular
kind of plasma instability
which is called a plasmoid.
And that is the most concentrated
form of electromagnetic energy.
The plasmoid then breaks down and fires
a beam of particles out this way
and back that way.
Then, this direction is not shown because
the plasma gun, this is always closed off.
But in space, you'll get two
jets in different directions.
This one is negatively charged,
this one's positively charged.
So you get this beam of
X-rays and particles.
And of course, if the energy is
sufficient you will get gamma rays.
Now I'll run this
little animation.
So, you'll notice there that one of
the forms of plasma instability
is the corkscrew shape or
a whirlwind or a tornado.
Because we'll come to
that again in a moment.
So we've come back to the
heart of the Crab Nebula.
From this object in
this anvil feature,
powerful gamma rays were coming.
Now this is some distance from
this pulsar, which is here,
but this, in the Electric Universe terms, is part
of the circuit to the star, along this axis.
You'll notice, it has a shape which might
appeal to the plasma mythologists amongst us.
It has kind of upraised arms
and then this strange shape.
Now amongst the petroglyphs
you'll find that;
I'll just get the
rest of this up here...
The shape of the anvil feature is
typical of a plasma instability
or plasma focus effect,
but it can take on shapes
with, like a, duck's head.
Now there are many
petroglyphs around the world,
which have this strange-headed
creature with the arms upraised.
It's a plasma instability!
And the other thing is that that is where
that plasmoid exists, right there.
So the burst of gamma rays is completely
explained in terms of a plasma gun effect
focused on this
half of this pulsar,
(they) want us to call it a pulsar,
it's actually a normal body,
there's no such thing
as a neutron star.
But this circuit is driving
this star to such an extent
that the entire surroundings is lit
up and is in motion, rapid motion.
As I said, it's reminiscent of the
prehistoric petroglyph figures
with a 'duck's head'
atop upraised 'arms'.
Now this is another visible stellar circuit
and you see here the hyperbolic cones.
The star is in here.
And here's its counterpart, the
other half of the bipolar shape.
This one is, if you like, 450
miles away from the Sun,
in terms of that model I
talked about last night.
Now, all of these circuits have to
somehow tie up with the Sun circuit.
And this is the Sun circuit.
This was actually drawn, many
years ago, by Hannes Alfvén.
Only he considered the Sun, at
the center here, as the driver.
We're suggesting that no, the Sun is
actually being driven by this circuit here.
So the puzzle now
is to figure out
what is the connection between
this powerful circuit and the Sun,
which is sitting in this tiny little
heliosphere in the centre of it all.
And we have to couple it to this circuit.
Now, I've taken on this project
in collaboration with Don Scott
who made many...
many of you have probably read
his book The Electric Sky.
Now I think, this is one of
the most interesting and
puzzling things that I've had
to work on for many years
and we hope to be able to
present at the next conference,
our version of what
this circuit looks like.
Because if we can do this, we
can look at the questions of
what causes the solar cycle,
the 11-year solar cycle.
We can look at the possibility
of using radio telescopes
on that, which can
trace these circuits
to deduce and forecast what may
happen over the longer term.
All of these things I
think, would be of benefit
and only available from the
Electric Universe model.
It's interesting. In all
of the work I've done,
one of the most fruitful things to do is to
go back in time and look at the Pioneers.
And also look at the
arguments that went on
when certain things were accepted,
like Einstein's theories.
And if you read the articles
before Einstein was accepted,
there were some brilliant papers
describing the flaws in Einstein's work.
But there comes a point, a
tipping point I suppose,
when Einstein was accepted and
all of these arguments are lost.
Students never see them and I think
this is a great failing of education.
This chap here, amazingly, Sir
William Huggins said in 1885,
"The grandest displays of terrestrial
electrical disturbances must be altogether
insignificant in comparison
with the electrical changes
which must accompany the ceaseless and
fearful activity of the photosphere...
Surely it is not too much to say that
our terrestrial experience of lightning
and of aurorae fails to supply
us with any adequate basis
for a true conception of the electric
force in action on the Sun."
So the idea that the Sun was an electrical
body was a possibility in the 19th century
but we lost it in the
20th, unfortunately.
Recently there was a discovery, a
paper published about tornados
existing in the chromosphere,
between the corona up here,
and the photosphere, down here on the Sun.
Now remember, I talked about
the plasma instability
which creates the corkscrew
motion or the tornadic motion.
This is an example of an electrical
connection between the Sun
at the photosphere,
and the corona.
In other words, this is one
of the circuit elements.
It's estimated, there are more than 10,000 of
them continuously present in the quiet Sun.
Surface and coronal
vortices are connected.
They talk about
coronal vortices here
so I will come on to the
subject of sunspots.
And what of these
granulations on the Sun.
Once again, if we go back in time
and look at Kristian Birkeland
at the turn of the century, of
the end of the 19th century,
he said "...it might be imagined
that the interior of the Sun
formed the positive pole for
enormous electric currents."
This fellow never ceases to
amaze me when I read his works.
"...[this] assumption has the advantages
of appearing to give a natural explanation
for the movement of the
sunspots in various latitudes."
In other words, the
solar sunspot cycle.
"In this case, the origin of the sunspot
must be that the presumptive, more or less
insulating photospheric envelope was
sometimes pierced by disruptive discharges,
thus forming great
electric arcs."
Now it was discovered in the Space Age of
course, that the Sun is surrounded by
a plasma ring, a
plasma doughnut.
That's seen from the
pole looking down on it,
this is looking at
the equatorial region.
So the plasma doughnut is
an energy storage ring
which can, when it becomes
unstable, discharge to the Sun.
And that, I suggest, is
the origin of sunspots.
And this is looking
down into a sunspot.
This is penumbra, this is the
outer region of the sunspot,
look like turbulent
boiling hot jets or hot gas.
And of course, this comes back to that
paper I showed you right at the beginning,
which says, there is no or virtually no
detectable convection occurring on the Sun.
Why is the sunspot dark if
the Sun is hotter beneath?
The simplest answer is that the Sun
is thousands of degrees cooler below!
Penumbral filaments are
glowing plasma tornadoes.
So this is the counterpart of
the tornado in the chronosphere.
This is going deeper
into the Sun.
This is a bit like on Earth where you
see at the top of the diffuse elves,
which can be 80 km or more wide,
then you come down to the jets
and the blue jets and so on and
sprites which are much thinner,
and then you come down to
lightning which is thinner still.
This is the same kind of effect.
They have bright edges, dark
cores and a rotary motion.
Inset there is a fuel fire with a
helicopter engine above to create the vortex
and you can see how it has
bright edges and a dark core.
And up here you can see
these filaments on the Sun,
bright edges and a dark core.
And bright 'lightning' flecks their tightly
packed 'granular' tops and the descending bases.
It's like a descending tornado.
The funnel of a tornado.
In the actual sunspot
itself, in the darkest part,
we see the tops of
even thinner filaments.
And the tops of those are actually
hotter than the surface of the Sun.
This is a diagram, I
won't go into it here.
It can be read both in Don Scott's book
and on my website and his website.
It shows how the Sun regulates the
current flowing through the photosphere
to give us steady
heat and light.
This is one of those amazing things
where nature seems to have worked out
the simple way of doing
things. The same as we have
with transistors to
control electric current.
The spicules, these jets between the granules
on the Sun of course, are unexplained
in the standard model but they're
necessary in the electrical model
to provide the charge carriers for
the double layers (in) above the Sun.
This is the electric Sun. This can be seen
in the online book of the Sun Electric.
And in that model the
Sun has a core here,
a very extensive atmosphere and then
all of the photosphere out here
is like a global lightning storm
or electric tornado storm.
If you like to look it that way.
And the energy flow is inwards
and not outwards.
The corona is a familiar glow discharge
phenomenon recognized by high-voltage engineers.
So, like the lights of a great city at
night, stars are lit at great distances
from where their power
is being generated.
Each star is the focus of an electromagnetic
'pinch' in the galactic current stream.
The details of which
have to be worked out.
And I suggest, the Sun sets
on 20th century science.
The data that's coming back from
all of the marvelous spacecraft
that are focused on the Sun
watching it in stereo,
watching it in all different parts
of the electromagnetic spectrum,
and it's all showing that the Sun is not
understood in terms of the Standard Model.

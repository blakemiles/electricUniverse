Welcome to Space News from the Electric
Universe, brought to you by

In recent days, NASA's New Horizons team
has released what is the best closest up
image to date of the Kuiper Belt object
known as Ultima Thule. This was the
subject of a recent Space News and Wal
kind of introduced some of the
differences between the mainstream
interpretations and predictions for an
object like Ultima Thule versus those of
the Electric Universe. Now in this latest
picture the first thing that stands out
when looking at this picture is the
number of features that look basically
identical to features that we see on a
lot of objects in the inner solar system
such as asteroids and moons. And that is
the number of highly circular craters
and what one might call what appear to
be chains of craters although it's not
entirely evident because portions of the
object are in shadow. And, on the smaller
of the two lobes that compose Ultima
Thule, we see one crater that is
absolutely enormous. Now there's a reason
why the New Horizons team is hesitant to
talk about possible crater chains and an
improbably huge crater on this Kuiper
Belt object. Instead thus far, they are
favoring terms like depressions and
collapse pits and the reason for that is,
you do not expect the kind of high-
velocity explosions that Impact Theory
would probably require to produce these
features. And of course, the explanation
that the New Horizons team has offered
for Ultima Thule's double-lobed form is a
low-speed collision between two objects
in the so-called early solar system
which this traditional story tells us
was four and a half billion years ago. So
I'm now going to bring up Wal Thornhill.
Wal and I have been discussing this new
image over the last couple of days and
so Wal, I think it would be good if we
could lay a little bit of groundwork
just in case there are any newcomers who
have come to this video. Why don't you
begin by explaining what
some of your thoughts were about Ultima
Thule even before the New Horizons
spacecraft arrived at the object and why
don't you share what your initial
thoughts have been as the images of
Ultima Thule have gotten better and
better? Okay, when the New Horizons newest
and best yet view of Ultima Thule
appeared on the web, I was struck by just
how much it looks like comet nuclei in
the inner solar system. Also, it has this
neck joining two objects which is
somewhat different from either of the
adjoining lobes as they call them. It's
brighter and if we remember Comet 67P,
you saw a sand or some kind of material
on that neck region between the two
lobes. And it even had what appeared to
be sand dunes. Well, the connection
between the lobes appears to be
something that happens after the lobes
have generally been formed but during
the same process. Now you know, in an earlier
Space News or 'Seeing Double' it was
called, I pointed out that, in the plasma
cosmology view, stars are formed by
interstellar Birkeland current filaments
inside molecular clouds. In other words,
it's a dusty plasma. And we know from
research that's been done and published
by Don Scott and others, that the dust is
accumulated much more powerfully into
central objects on that filament by
the long-range electromagnetic forces
involved with electric currents in, what
you might call, lightning bolts inside
molecular clouds.
I went further a little later and
pointed out that all solid objects, all
solid bodies are formed in that same
process. There is no need to call upon
gravitational accretion which has never
been shown to work.
One of the big problems is, even if you
have a circulating disk of dust and gas,
you have the problem of getting rid of
the angular momentum of that disk.
There's no reason for the material at
the outer edges to fall in towards the
center once it achieves a certain
velocity of rotation about that center.
So I expected, on the basis of also the
recent history of the solar system, that
the bodies in the outer solar system
would show all of the same features as
those seen in the inner solar system.
Because, to put it simply, the solar
system is a blended family of objects
that have been captured by the Sun after
the formation of the Sun. It had nothing
to do with leftovers from the Sun and
this explains all of the mysteries about
isotopic compositions and the
differences between the planets because
our solar system, if you look at it
dispassionately without the
gravitational theory as a lens, a
distorting lens, it's a fruit salad of
objects. They're all different. They have
different axial tilts and their rotation
rates are hard to explain, the angular
momentum of the whole system is hard to
explain in the gravitational theory and
they exhibit behavior, magnetic fields,
and weather patterns, which are still
unexplained. Given all of these facts, and
when you realize that you're looking
through every space shot that's been
sent up to tell us how the solar system
was formed, is viewed through this
distorting lens of gravitational
accretion. So, Ultima Thule was a big
test really, because I had already
predicted that this would be the case
that objects even in the outer
solar system would tend to be formed in
pairs, sometimes joined during the
process of formation. It's interesting to
look at the language of the reports of
the closest up image yet of this object
because the language has changed. It's an
indication of cognitive dissonance. In
other words, what they're seeing doesn't
match what they expected. When I saw it,
the first thing that
struck me was the circular crater on the
smaller lobe which is facing towards us.
And one of the key aspects of electrical
scarring is circular cratering. With no
debris in the crater, it's looked as
though, it's been
machined and also there is a propensity
for the discharge as it fades to switch
to other high points near the central
crater and of course the nearest high
point on our crater is the rim and
you'll notice there are at least three
that I can see, smaller circular craters
perched on the rim of that larger crater.
Now, I'm calling it a crater but the
language in the report says, 'the large
circular feature about four miles or
seven kilometers across on the smaller
of the two lobes appears to be a deep
depression'. Of course, the reason why they
use the words 'deep depression' is that
for a crater to have occurred it means
that the collision must have been at
high speed and as we've said the whole
idea behind the standard model of trying
to explain this object is low-speed
collisions. You know, five kilometers an
hour or less, the sort of bump in a
parking lot. That just doesn't work with
a crater that size. Right. Four miles
across. 7 kilometers across. That
requires an impact which should have
shattered the object. Because remember,
these are supposed to be ices and dust
that have been accreted from a very
thinly dispersed cloud of dust and gas.
You do not expect an object to form that
is solid enough to receive an impact
like that and survive. And what's more,
at that distance from the Sun the
orbital speed is very low and any other
objects that are following the same
orbit will only have minor differences
in speed and this is why they talk about
a bump in a parking lot. Right. Because
the analogy is fairly accurate based on
the gravitational model. But what we see
has nothing to do with low-speed
collisions.
And what's more, impact craters
themselves are an assumption because in
the gravitational theory the only way to
form craters like that is with impacts.
You're very limited in what you can
actually explain with impacts. No
one has actually observed the
before-and-after of a celestial impact
of sufficient size to create a crater
that size. So this is all mere
speculation or maybe just a story, a
cover story, to hide our fundamental
ignorance. Right. Well, we should mention
that this crater, what we're calling a
crater that we see on the smaller lobe
of Ultima Thule. This is not the first
instance when we've seen an object in
our solar system with a crater that is
so huge that it would have destroyed the
body if it was caused by a kinetic
impact. If you look at some of the moons
of Saturn - Mimas and Tethys are the most
dramatic examples. If you look at the
Martian moon Phobos and Stickney crater,
and if you look at the asteroid Vesta, in
all of these instances you see craters
which astronomers themselves admit
should have shattered the body if they
were caused by mechanical collisions and
high-velocity explosions. That's correct.
The other evidence for electrical scarring
are the small regular circular pits
on the larger lobe. At the top of the
image that I'm looking at that was
published, you can see there are three
small circular pits in a row and in fact
there's a couple of smaller ones heading
up towards the top of the lobe. But then,
in, almost in the shadowed regions at the
top you see another chain of craters.
There's at least four there and they may
actually continue across the shadow to
to meet up with another one on
the far side. Now, crater chains are
electrical formations. There's no other
explanation for them. In the inner solar
system, the story went that
any incoming bolide fractured, more or
less, in space before it hit. Under the
gravitational influence of the body that
it was impacting. And they, sort of,
splattered across the face of that
object, But this is not, that doesn't
explain the circularity, the fact that
one crater doesn't disturb the other. And
there's no fill from one crater that
happened after another. So, the electrical
theory is, I submit, the only theory which
can explain these features. And in fact,
it's one explanation for all of the
observations, not special dispensations
for different bodies simply because they
don't fit the pattern. Right.
All of the strange features
including the craters on the Moon and
the ray-craters and all of that was
explained by Ralph Juergens back in the
1970's in a brilliant series of articles
on the electrical scarring of the Moon
and Mars.
You could then extend his work without
making any other ad-hoc assumptions to
all of the bodies we've seen since then.
Well, I think this actually might be a
good point to just take a moment and
examine some of the recent discoveries
that we've reported here on Space News,
which relate very directly to this
question of our solar system's history
and origins. So obviously, as one expects,
the New Horizons team is holding to this
traditional idea of a solar system that
formed from a gravitationally collapsing
nebular cloud and this happened four and
a half billion years ago. And the only
process they can imagine forming an
object like Ultima Thule is
gravitational accretion. And yet the real
question I have is why any of these
assumptions continue to endure since, as
we have reported, there are more problems
and anomalies for the nebular hypothesis
than there are successes and we report
routinely on discoveries which planetary
scientists admit, it's not us saying this,
it's planetary scientists who say that
these discoveries can't be reconciled
with the solar system's conventional
history and origins. So just very quickly
bear with me,
I'll give just a few examples. Last year
we reported on the discovery of the so
called Hypatia stone which is a
meteorite fragment that was discovered
in a glass field in Libya and which is
composed of this "weird matrix" of
minerals which planetary scientists
admit they can't explain. And the reason
they can't explain it is the meteorite is
supposed to have originated from a
homogeneous primordial dust cloud. And
also late last year, planetary scientists
discovered that there's a group of
asteroids near Neptune which actually
appear to be identical to asteroids that
are close to Jupiter which are so-called
sun-baked asteroids. So here's a quick
excerpt from a Scientific American piece
on that discovery. "...the Neptunian
asteroids are so far from the Sun that
their surfaces should have stayed almost
pristine since birth, scarcely altered by
our nearest star's warming rays... and yet
they appear remarkably similar to a
group of sunbaked asteroids near
Jupiter. These puzzling observations...
Asteroids that look nothing like their
putative parents in the sedate solar
hinterlands but strongly resembled their
supposed relatives that have been toasted by the
Sun... call into question scientists' best
theories for the origin and evolution of
the solar system..." Then, more recently,
you did a brilliant presentation on the
discovery that water in Saturn's rings
and on its moons is apparently identical
to water in Earth's oceans and as you
reported, this was actually a
confirmation of an outrageous prediction
that Velikovsky made which was that
Saturn was the source of our planet's
water. So here's a quote from a Phys.org
report. It says the results "...mean we
need to change models of the formation
of the solar system because the new
results are in conflict with existing
models." And finally, speaking of historic
space missions to supposedly primordial
objects in the solar system, scientists
with the Rosetta mission to 67P, recently
admitted that the comet cannot be
billions of years old. Now in the early
published findings on the mission,
Rosetta scientists proposed
than, like Ultima Thule, the double-lobed
nucleus of 67P was formed by a low-speed
collision of two objects in the early
solar system. But based on the scientists'
numerical calculations, it was determined
that the nucleus would have crumbled or
disintegrated countless eons ago and
therefore it is only millions of years
old
rather than billions. So among the other
problems the comet scientists have faced,
they have to try to explain the
"geological features" we see which
includes complexly layered stratified
rock which is absolutely everywhere on
the comet nucleus. And further, there's
the problem of how do you form a comet
only millions of years ago rather than
billions of years. Well, here's what they
came up with. Two fully formed comet
nuclei in the late solar system
experienced a violent high-velocity
collision and exploded. And then, after
the comets exploded, as you can see in
the computer animation the scientists
created, even though the material would
have been accelerated to tremendous
velocities and in a near zero
gravitational sphere of influence, we are
told that rather than dispersing, a
portion of the destroyed material
recoalesced and kept recoalescing and
kept recoalescing to form 67P as we see
it today. And now I don't think I need to
belabor why this particular conjecture
is, and this is just my opinion, the
closest thing to impossible. But here are
two points to consider. Number one: we see
two very different hypotheses being
offered for the creation of the
respective double-lobed forms of Ultima
Thule and 67P. Even though they both
involve collisions, with Ultima Thule
it's a low-speed collision four and a
half billion years ago and with 67P it's
a violent explosion only millions of
years ago and again the process that is
actually forming the comet is a recoa-
lescing of material that has been
destroyed. But in the case of the Electric
Universe, as Wal has already explained,
we see a consistent coherent explanation
for the "doubling effect at all
scales throughout the entire cosmos." As
you can see on screen, this is quite
evident in the comparison of both 67P
and Ultima Thule to a portion of
hematite that was blasted with an
electric arc. So the question I have to
ask critics of the Electric Universe
theory is, do you care that all of the
discoveries I just described were either
explicitly predicted by the Electric
Universe or are exactly what one does
expect if our solar system experienced
the kind of recent upheaval the electric
universe proposes? So Wal, what are your
thoughts?
Yes, it's system-wide this problem. It's
rather ironic that Velikovsky was more
or less a pilloried for suggesting that
the solar system had changed within the
memory of the earliest human beings. And
now, the favored theory for a lot of
these unexpected discoveries is that the
planets, particularly the gas giants,
must have migrated. In other words, their
orbits have changed but of course it has
to have happened billions of years ago.
And that's one of the aspects that's
never really addressed psychologically
in cosmology, is that the theories appear
to have to make us feel safe. In fact, the
Australian philosopher David Stove
wrote that Newton's theory was
designed to make sure that nothing
untoward happened in the solar system.
This idea of a clockwork solar system
that was wound up four-and-a-half
billion years ago, and has functioned
fairly undisturbed apart from a few
showers of objects that are used to
explain ad-hoc the fact that we
have a moon and there are craters on
objects.
But all of this happened way in the
distant past so we don't have to worry
about that. Right. And of course, this
continues today. So, there is a kind of
almost a religious grip on the
gravitational accretion over huge spans
of time theory. Velikovsky really threw
down a gauntlet which none of them, no
astronomer has been willing to pick up.
And that was of course the origin,
really, of the Electric Universe because
scholars could see that there was a case
to be answered. And some remarkable
people came forward and began picking up
that challenge and piecing it together
and I was very pleased to actually have
joined them a little later in the process,
as it turns out, but nevertheless I think
it's been effective because the
groundwork is very solid. And there's
been no ad-hockery required to explain
all of these weird discoveries in space.
In fact, we've been able to predict a lot
of them.

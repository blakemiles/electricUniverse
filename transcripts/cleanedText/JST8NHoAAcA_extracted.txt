Cosmic Power Lines Part 1
Now the gentlemen that set this
up have done a marvelous job.
I told them they have built us
a 747 here with these screens
and a lot of controls
in front of me.
You should all come up and
look at this before you leave.
And I said I would be happy if I could
get this damn 747 off the runway.
Anyway, thank you very
much and good evening.
It's a pleasure to be
here and thank you for
paying me the honor of wanting
to hear what I have to say.
The topic of course, is
the cosmic power grid
and what it consists of is some
updates about Birkeland currents,
where they go what they do?
Those of you who have been
to this conference before
perhaps heard me speak
on this very topic.
And one of the nice things
about the area that I'm in;
which is this idea of
electricity in the sky
and that sort of, the
electric universe and so on,
okay, thank you;
is that new stuff keeps
coming along all the time.
And I'm very happy.
Between the last workshop that we had
here in this in this hotel I think
and then the previous
conference in Albuquerque,
some very new and I think very,
from our point of view, encouraging
data has come back about this very
topic, the Birkeland current.
What is a Birkeland current
then, who was Birkeland?
Well, let me very
quickly get by that
because I know that some of
you have heard this story,
have been to these conferences perhaps
longer than I've been coming to them,
oh I doubt that but...
beard beard, you know, anyway.
The newcomers might like to know just a
little bit about the background of this so...
For you all folks,
I don't mean that by age, you veteran
attenders take it as a refresher course, ok?
Birkeland current you can think
of as a pipeline in the sky.
It's not an oil pipeline,
it's not a water pipeline,
it's an electrical current pipeline, it
carries charge and carries charged particles
and it can carry them
in both directions
and it consists...
Well, we'll talk a little bit in
detail about what it it consists of
and what its structure is.
And I was very happy to, in the last
April this, couple of months ago,
to get a paper published
about this topic.
And this, I'm saying this not just to
brag about getting the paper published
but to make a comment about the
status of science these days.
You perhaps have heard
us complain and moan,
people like me, others that you
will hear at this conference,
about how difficult it is to get
anything published from here,
from the Electric Universe.
Oh it's those guys, there
are the fringe scientists.
And so if you say anything that
anybody in mainstream science
doesn't completely agree with,
you're out of there, it's
not going to be published.
So I submitted this paper to
a very well-known journal
but, if you want to know
I'll slip it to you later,
but they turned it down!
Cold!
For the wrong reasons.
The guy who did the review,
who sent me the negative review
didn't understand
what I was saying
and he was absolutely wrong!
So I finally found through the good
offices of a couple of friends of mine
this other journal and
they did publish it.
And there is, if you want
to see the article itself,
on the bottom there is,
it's a pretty big long URL
but I think you can get to it just by putting
in your browser - progress in physics
and that'll give you the magazine, the
journal page and look for the April issue
and you can see all the great
gory details in there.
But anyway, well, I'll talk some
more about what that paper says and
what it means as
the talk goes on.
But I always have to, and every time I'd
give a talk here I have to say this
because it stabbed me in the heart so much
that I need to have a catharsis I guess,
at your folks expense.
That is, some things never changed
in this world, it seems like.
The people who talk about
black holes, dark energy,
missing neutrinos, missing
that, neutron stars,
all of which are blatantly impossible,
call us the fringe scientists.
When they don't believe that a fellow
by name James Clark Maxwell ever lived
or that a fellow by the name of
Langmuir ever won the Nobel Prize
or Hannes Alfv√©n who
won the Nobel Prize
and it's his, those people's
principles that we use.
We use all of the
tools in the toolbox,
they ignore the electrical half!
They're fine with thermodynamics
and fluid dynamics
but they don't, they don't
take advantage of what we do.
And so therefore we
can get some answers
and I hope to show you some
of those answers tonight.
But our detractors seem
to keep getting promoted,
I have a sort of a joke here.
I'm not getting through, hello!
Okay, sorry for
the interruption.
The joke on here is that a fellow,
who's a very well-known astronomer;
he is now the head of a very prestigious
astronomical organization in this country
and perhaps in the world;
said this:
"Yes, yes. We know there are electrical
currents in space, but they don't DO ANYTHING."
Well okay, I had his picture and I was
going to put his actual picture on here
but I thought I didn't want to get
sued so I would put that on and said.
Anyway down to business.
The paper that I'm going to
talk to you a little bit about
derives the mathematical equations that
constitute a model of a Birkeland current.
And when I say a model,
that's a meaningful thing.
Engineers like me very often build
models of things, mathematical models,
will come up with an equation
and we try to make those
equations mimic what we see.
I mean, science is really
making observations
and fitting some theory
to those observations
and then later testing those theories
and see if they pass the tests of time
and whatever you want
to do to test them out.
Some people think that
they are not making models
but they are actually discovering the
equations by which the world works.
By which the universe works.
They want to discover the equations
God used when he made thing.
Engineers are less ...
aggressive than that.
We want to just model, we want to
come up with something that works,
kind of like the way
the real thing does
and the closer we can make
it work the happier we are.
So that's what's the difference
between being, I guess, a cosmologist
who wants to know
how does it work
and us who say, we just
want to make a model.
So for example,
the model can be,
this model that I
developed and can be
or, I should say, be very careful
to say that the original model,
the original equations were
discovered back in 1950
but the guy just wrote down a
couple of lines and took off.
He did write, he did show this diagram,
that curlicue diagram on the left
of which, sort of, shows what the
Birkeland current looks like.
It's a curlicue, a helix of current and
magnetic field, parallel if you will.
I know there's some EE's in the audience
and you usually don't think about
currents and magnetic
fields being in parallel,
you usually think of them as being
at right angles to each other.
But if you can get
them to relax,
they will actually line up
and those of you who know what I'm talking
about, the Lorentz forces between them,
their tendency to push each other
back and forth, goes away.
If you can get them to line up
and so there's a thing called a
"Force Free Field Aligned Current.
And that's a picture of it, that barber's
pole there on the left or on the right.
The difference between the two is of
course size, that's all there is.
And so in this model there is a scale factor,
in all models there are scale factors.
If you build a model of a ship or model
of an airplane or think about a map,
a map is a model of reality.
If you draw a topographical
map of a mountain,
that's a model of the mountain, as
you see, the topographical contours.
You can see exactly where the mountain is
higher, steepest, less steep or whatever.
But I think sometimes scientists,
especially cosmologists,
mistake the mountain for the map
with a map for the mountain
and forget about the fact that
they are two different things.
So what we have here is a model of
the way the Birkeland current works.
I contend!
And the scale factor maybe
seems to be, you know,
not important but it is.
For one, it's what got my paper
rejected the first time.
Because you're gonna ...
scale factor.
It's a property of the plasma and
you don't have any idea what it is.
My answer of course is
yes, it's a scale factor
and I, the model builder can
tell you what it's going to be.
You want it to be
seven, make it seven.
And it's not like the
permittivity or permeability,
something that comes to you
through what is nature
but it's just a scale factor so you can make
the size of this thing bigger or smaller.
Anyway there's the journal.
That's the April issue.
And the reason I
show it to you is,
I don't know if you can read the
small writing there at the bottom.
Let me see if I can read it.
It says; "All scientists shall have the right
to present their scientific research results,
in whole or in part, at relevant
scientific conferences,
and to publish the same in
printed scientific journals,
electronic archives,
and any other media."
And this is from the Declaration
of Academic Freedom.
To which, I think, the editor
of this journal actually wrote.
And so, I think that's a step
forward in and of itself
regardless of whether they
publish my paper or not.
That's a breakthrough.
No longer do people like me and people
who are called fringe scientists,
we're going to resent that
totally but of course.
We don't have to be under the heel,
under the boot, the jackboot of,
"do you please the
powers that be or not?"
These, I know for sure that
a couple of my friends, and you
will hear from them later,
or they're in here, Pierre Marie
Robitaille and Stephen Crothers
also have a paper
in that same issue.
And I know for certain that
there is disagreement,
I won't say between
whom and whom,
but as to what they
think is right.
But they got their paper published,
I got my paper published
and the editor honors that there
may be differences of opinion.
But he's still going
to publish it
and I think that's a
real breakthrough.
It may be a subtle thing,
a subtle thing for people to
understand but I think it really is.
Anyway, my contention is that some
scientists refuse to see analogies.
I'm a big analogy, you know
if you know how it works in this
state, in this area, in this milieu,
maybe it works the same way
in this thing over here.
If you know how that...
How that building is constructed
and how it stands against 100 hundred mile
an hour winds maybe you can build your
whatever,
in the same, using the same principles
and have it be stronger too.
To see analogies across fields, I
think is a very important thing.
The analogy that I'm
really talking about
is the, well, that's obviously
the aurora borealis.
The aurora australis
looks the same.
And what you're looking at there is the
business end of a Birkeland current.
And if I can describe it to you
which i think is very apparent,
I think you would say the same thing
if I asked you to describe it to me.
It's a concentric, a collection
of concentric hollow cylinders
that contain filaments
that transport stuff.
In this case the stuff
is electric charge.
It looks as though they possibly might
be some spiraling going on there
and it looks also that the center
of the thing is fairly solid.
... that's the way a
Birkeland current works
and that's the way
the model that I...
Well, I should say finished the derivation
of, predicts that the thing should work.
Well okay, if a long time ago we found
out that this fellow Birkeland,
after whom these
things are named,
was right!
He contended that the energy for, to power
the aurora was coming from outer space.
He said from the Sun.
I would modify that slightly and say,
from the neighborhood of the Sun
and that we receive energy,
electrical energy into our North Pole
and that's how the
auroras are present.
Well we know other planets
have auroras as well.
But you never hear these people,
astrophysicists, saying that,
"Oh yes, we know there are Birkeland currents
going into the North Pole of Saturn."
or into the North Pole of Jupiter
or North Pole of whatever.
We know there are aurorae there but we're
not going to use the word Birkeland.
I don't know why.
I think that's, I don't know...
Maybe it's because they, they're
ashamed of how they treated Birkeland.
They essentially told
him he was a lunatic.
The poor man died in 1917 and it wasn't
until after the end of World War II
when we sent Rockets up into this
area that we found out he was right!
Not just a little bit
right, he was a 100% right!
So Birkeland Currents are named
Birkeland Currents for a good reason.
The topic, I guess,
but the property
that is most important at least for
our purposes here this evening,
is this idea of
counter rotation.
That the Birkeland Current, if
you want to think about it,
is like a bunch of
concentric pipes.
Start off with a rod in the
middle, put a pipe around it
and then put a bigger pipe around that
and then a bigger pipe around that
and keep doing that until
you could run out of pipes.
And the answer is, of course,
until you run out of charge
that wants to be transported
by this mechanism.
And each of those pipes
counter rotates.
You pick out one, the one above it and the one
below it is going in the opposite direction.
That's what I mean
by counter rotation.
That's what the model says!
Now the question is, do Birkeland
currents really work that way?
Well those of you who were here, I
guess at the last one or two meetings,
I forget which one it was,
I showed the picture,
know that that's true, we can we've
seen that in one specific case.
But there is what the
model comes up with.
And it might be.
Let's see if I can make the
747 get off the runway here.
Yes, look at that!
Oh well, like I have a pointer.
Do you can see these dark, the
black lines, the outer one here?
You can see that
the circles there,
the black circles with arrow heads
showing the counter rotation.
Those black circles that
are counter-rotating
are the current and the magnetic
field of the Birkeland current.
The salmon-colored
rings are not really,
they don't really occur in a
Birkeland current in free space
but they do when you jam that Birkeland current
down into the North Pole of the earth,
you've all seen what the magnetosphere
looks like, it's like a funnel.
Because the magnetosphere is
like this big fat doughnut
with the earth in
the middle of it
and the current comes down and as it
comes down closer and closer to Earth
gets squeezed into narrow
or narrower diameters.
The same amount of
current with less area
means the current
density increases.
And so when the current density
increases you get this,
those salmon colored rings are
concentrations of matter.
And matter concentrates into also,
not the same concentric rings
because you can see that salmon coloured
rings are, there are fewer of them,
then there are white more widely
spaced than the black ones
which are, the black ones are the
magnetic field and the current density.
But anyway, that is the main property
that I would like to get across.
This counter rotation of the of the
Birkeland current is very important.
I'd like to change the next
slide but I can't do it.
Very good, okay thank you.
There is a picture, taken by Dr. Tony
Peratt in Los Alamos Nuclear Laboratory,
of one of these Birkeland currents that he
shot into what's called a witness plate
and so you can see exactly
or pretty exactly what
I'm talking about.
There is the slight
spiraling look,
there are certainly that
center is sort of a solid core
and then there are these
rings going outward.
One of the properties of plasma is
that it breaks up into filaments.
And so what we've
got on the outside,
and if I could have my pointer
I would show you what I can't.
See those dots around the outside,
those are filaments of plasma.
And Peratt has drawn a circle
of little dots to delineate
where the, at least the
theoretical filaments should be.
Keep this picture in
the back of your mind
because we're gonna see something
that looks exactly like that.
Okay, next slide please.
That's a picture of
Saturn's North Pole
and it was the famous, not hurricane
but the hexagon is actually there.
And okay, thank
you, all right so.
This is certainly true,
everyone was so surprised
about the hexagon shape,
the question about if these things counter
rotate or not was never really asked.
There's, wow, a
hexagon up there!
Why is there a hexagon?
That was all over the press
for a couple of years.
But of course I'm asking
the question, are
those rings going in the opposite
directions from one to another?
And okay, well let's go,
let's go with this.
This is a NASA video
[Video] Cassini has been in
orbit around Saturn for 9 years
and we've been following this hexagon
which surrounds the North Pole.
It's bigger than two Earths and
it's a wandering jetstream.
But it's been
winter in the north
so we have not been able to see
what's at the center of the hexagon.
But now it's spring!
And what we've found at the center of
the hexagon is a Saturn hurricane.
This is a view from directly over the
North Pole which is made possible ...
[Donald] You see the counterrotation.
Again if I could point,
you can see the whitest
ring from the outside,
you can see those set of elypses, those
are called diocotron instabilities
and they happen in plasma
and in any hydraulic fluids
when their shear.
And so, perfectly in the upper left-hand
corner, you see those curlicue things?
Those are diocotron
instabilities.
And it shows that what's to the inside of
that and and what's to the outside of that
are at least traveling at very different
velocities and probably counter-rotating.
Go ahead, turn up the volume.
I don't know if you can
hear what he said.
He said that the hurricane is
anchored to the North Pole
and it's been there as long as
we've been able to observe it
and he's worried about the fact that a
hurricane is never anchored to anything,
it moves.
And the other thing about a hurricane, on
Earth at least, is it has a warm ocean.
You know, when a hurricane gets
all over land it breaks up
because it loses its heat
energy from the warm water
and all look for any
warm water on Saturn.
So they are very
mystified by this
and I'm not at all
mystified by this.
You folks can see that diagram.
This is from a paper that was
published just earlier this year.
The question was, are there
actually counter rotational winds?
And if you look very carefully, at A is
the North Pole and B is the South Pole
so there's no hexagon
on the South Pole
but there is certainly
on the North Pole.
And the, you can look
at the velocity,
it's way on the left-hand
side, you can see zero
is sort of at the junction between
the blue and the turquoise
and one is positive one ...
is negative.
It means it's going in
opposite directions.
So between blue and
turquoise ther's a shear.
And they quote that this,
in this paper that yes, there is
indeed counter-rotation on Saturn.
How about Jupiter?
Well, from the looks of this it looks as
if there's a hexagon on Jupiter too maybe.
I don't think so.
But I think the guy who drew the
hexagon has a little wishful thinking
but we don't know.
And does Jupter have a
hexagon, I'm not sure, right?
My vote would be no because
from what I'm going to show you
it doesn't look like
there's a hexagon there.
But does it have a counter rotational
kind of a thing happening?
Do these cloud belts counter
rotate as the ones on Saturn do?
Well, nobody knew for years.
And this came out after
my last lecture.
About two days after
I got home, bingo!
This comes out from NASA.
And why so late? Why so late?
You know, anyway.
There's a picture of
Jupiter's North Pole.
And actually, well, I won't
hold you in a suspense.
Do you see any counter rotation?
I sat there for about 20 minutes
and tried to count the rings
and I counted 15 different
counter rotating cylinders.
And the, you can see
going around about
oh, I don't know, maybe, what,
three quarters of the way out
you can see there's a real steady
progression of those little black dots.
I think those are probably
Tony Peratt's filaments,
that he has in those circles that
he drew around his witness plate.
But this is on an endless loop
now, you can sit here and watch it
all night if you want to but...
I just, and again look at, look
on the upper right-hand corner,
right there you see?
Those, all those
diocotron instabilities.
So you can definitely see that
there's a shear going on there.
So is there counter
rotation on Jupiter?
Yeah, you bet there is.
How about Uranus, well,
Uranus is a crazy animal.
You folks probably
know about the Uranus
is actually lying over on its
side, more than 90 degrees over.
So if you point that, to see
going out to the left there,
there's a vector to the Sun.
So when this was drawn, it was
Summer at the north pole of Uranus.
And the spin axis is
pointing downward.
The magnetic field axis,
the axis of its magnetosphere is
59 degrees farther down than that.
This thing is really screwed up.
But the question is,
does it have an aurora?
Yes, yes, it does.
Where is the aurora?
Is it on the geographic
pole, the spin axis?
Does it depend on what parts pointed at the
Sun or does it depend on the magnetic axis?
The magnetic axis.
So the aurora on any planet
is due to the magnetic field,
is due to the Birkeland current coming
in to the magnetosphere of that current,
of that planet.
Some of you've seen
that diagram before,
we're not sure about Mercury
because Mercury doesn't even have,
it's got like a 1% of the
magnetic field of Earth.
And does it have enough
of a magnetic field
to actually cause a Birkeland current
to go down there into the North Pole?
I don't know.
There's some doubt about it.
But boy, it sure looks like there's been
some action at Mercury's North Pole.
And maybe in an earlier geologic
period there was a magnetic field.
Who knows, we don't know now.
There's some new,
new to me at least,
apparently if you look at
the second line there,
these stable auroral red auroras
have been known for about 50 years
but they, there's,
they're will o' the wisp
because they're always, sort of, in
daylight and they're always so far south
that you don't see them very much
and there's city lights down here
and along the northern axis, northern
border of the United States.
But wouldn't it be nice if
what I'm saying is right
and the Birkeland currents are indeed
symmetrically placed concentric hollow cylinders.
Maybe these SAR auroras
are due to the second,
the second column out
there, the second cylinder,
the real Aurora's are
due to the inner one,
up on the North Pole which is
not shown in this diagram.
We're up nearer to the north,
nearer to the North Magnetic Pole.
Don't know. Neptune, some of you
have seen that one already.
There's a hotspot at
Neptune's South Pole.
You think about it,
the South Pole!
South Pole is the hot
spot of the planet?!
Well, there's a possibility that it's getting
a real powerful electric current in there
and that's what's heating up
that particular spot on Neptune
to be the hottest
spot on the planet.
Okay, we're down
to the punchline.
The latest piece of evidence that
I've managed to accumulate is...
Well, I'll show it
to you in a minute.
But let me make a sort of a slight
aside and say a couple of things.
I made an assertion in my paper,
back a couple of months ago,
that the Bessel function model
of a Birkeland current specifies
that these currents
are composed mainly
of hollow, concentric, counter-rotating,
cylindrical, sheets of current.
And I think I've showed that to you.
I hope I have.
I think this is the first time
anyone has made that statement.
But I'm gun-shy because when I did
the, my derivation of this model
I didn't know that Stig
Lundquist had come up
with the form of the
solution about 50 years ago.
Nobody else had talked about it, Tony
Peratt never talked about it in his book.
And so I completely
was blindsided
and I don't want to
be blindsided again.
So if anybody knows of anybody else,
any other investigator other than me
that has said that
Birkeland currents consist
of counter-rotating concentric cylinders of
current density and parallel magnetic fields,
I want to hear about it.
Until that time I claim the...
You know, it's like the
explorer who crawls across
and plants the flag
on the island.
I may be wrong, I may be very
disappointed to find out that
yes yes Rick Dicksmutnitz back
in 1420 came up with this idea.
But I hope, maybe it's my contribution.
I hope it is anyway.
Anyway, what I have
to show you now
is a picture, very mundane
picture taken here on earth
by a spectacularly good
photographer of the Northern Lights
and he did a video of
the aurora borealis
and he did it from a fixed super
high-resolution camera on a fixed tripod
and just let it rip.
And I want to see if you think he
captured any counter-rotation, okay?
This is Caithness on the
northern end of Scotland,
right below Scapa Flow with
the English naval bases.
His name is Maciej Winiarczyk.
See the inner one
moving right to left?
Is there counterrotation,
uh, that's hard to say.
The red is oxygen,
the green is nitrogen.
That's the whole "business
end" of a Birkeland Current.
That's, of course,
the edge of it.
... over on the left
This is sort of a picture of a train
wreck if you start to think about it.
This is the end of the
Birkeland current
... that smashes into,
into the earth.
So yes, there's shattering
and it takes a while for that
form to come back again.
There you can see, I think,
some counter-rotation.
The inner green one is
moving well, who knows.
Some people see these black stripes on a
zebra, other people see white stripes
It looks like MacDuff's Castle.
Yeah, there's a more, I think that
you can see counter-rotation there.
The very last scene I defy anybody
not to see counter-rotation
and I'll tell you when it...
not quite here.
You can see stuff, some stuff
going one way, some another.
This one!
See the one in the,
in the distance,
it seems to me is
going left to right,
the one up on top here, the fuzzy
ones are moving right to left.
Those are just clouds, don't
worry about the clouds.
Did you, did you see the counter rotation?
I don't know,
it's hard to see whether
it's there or not.
It's, how, I've lost my clock, I
don't know what time it is...
How, do we have two
minutes to run that?
Okay, why don't you run that video
one more time and we can see,
sit back, get a glass
of wine and see.
He has released this, by the way, to
the public for educational purposes.
Up on the left,
it's coming at you.
I think that's some obvious
counter-rotation in there, left to right.
Way over on the left not to take
care of those here's the Pleiades
and the constellation of Taurus.
Taurus the Bull, there's
Aldebaran see the ... ?
There's the one that seems to be
in the far distance, it's
moving left to right
and up here near us at the top
it's moving right to left.
I think that's pretty
obvious there.
But that's me. Maybe other people
can say, I don't see that, oh.
I don't know.
Anyway, that's, that is the
latest piece of evidence
and there are all sorts of folks
now taking time-lapse photography
those were, ... time-lapse
to get it to speed up.
There are some videos available that
are just in real time, not time-lapsed
and you can still
see the movement.
And it's, as one and particularly
taken from Yellowknife up in Canada
that I think is almost as
good as this but not quite.
This is the best one
I've been able to find.
Anyway, just one last kind
of piece of evidence,
if you guys heard of the what do they
call it, the Blue Eye of the Desert
and the Richat Structure
It's in the Sahara Desert, it's
about 30 miles in diameter,
the rings are spaced
equidistantly from each other.
That's a Bes... anybody who knows
anything about Bessel functions
realize that the zeroes
are all equally spaced.
And I'll talk more about
that in my next talk but...
Well, how Bessel functions are
important but forget the math.
The surface altitude is
higher toward the center.
And there's what it looks like.
If that doesn't look like
a Birkeland current...
And they're all, it's about
30 miles across there.
Anyway that's, it's
another example so
I'm concluding by saying, I think we've
seen several planets have auroras
that are likely created
by Birkeland currents.
The Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and
possibly Mercury and Neptune, who knows.
(It will) be interesting to see
what they find in Pluto next month.
If they take any
measurements of that at all.
And we now have evidence of
concentric counter rotation
as predicted by the Bessel function that
is the Lundquist model on three of them
that is Saturn,
Jupiter and Earth.
So how about the Sun?
Is there a Birkeland current
coming down into the Sun?
Well, tune in tomorrow,
I'll be back again.

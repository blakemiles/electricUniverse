welcome to the thunderbolts.info podcast
for december 6 2012.
we bring you all the latest news
information and analysis from the
electric universe
shedding new light on the many mysteries
that dark theories have yet to
illuminate
one of the hottest trending news items
in the last week was the anticipated
announcement from nasa of a purported
discovery of historic proportions by the
mars rover curiosity i can tell you in
all honesty that we at the thunderbolts
project were not surprised that this
supposed historic revelation turned out
to be a vast disappointment perhaps for
millions of people around the world
we're now being told that it was all
just a big misunderstanding due to some
miscommunication between curiosity's
chief scientist and a journalist with
npr
but the truth of the matter is that we
have no shortage of incredibly exciting
and thought-provoking mysteries
surrounding mars and the nasa rovers in
fact when we scrutinize each of these
mysteries it becomes readily apparent
that the most exciting discoveries on
mars are not even on the table for
discussion among nasa scientists at
least not in any public statements so
what we're going to be doing over the
next month or so on the thunderbolts
youtube channel is flashing back to the
most fascinating and enduring recent
mysteries surrounding nasa's
investigations into the red planet
now today we're going to be talking
about an ongoing anomaly that truly is
one of the great mysteries in mars
exploration in january of 2004 the mars
rover's spirit and opportunity arrived
on mars about three weeks apart
each of these rovers was given an
anticipated lifespan of 90 days
but for reasons that no one at nasa has
satisfactorily explained
almost nine years later the rover
opportunity is still alive and
transmitting information to scientists
on earth the rover spirit eventually
died around 2010
but only after being ensnared by sandy
soil in a martian crater
how on earth could two rovers that were
given lifespans of 90 days stay alive
for so many years now the scientific
explanation for this ongoing mystery is
at least from our perspective
incontrovertible and it provides
powerful verification of the electrical
martian environment and the environments
of all the planets that reside within
the sun's electrical domain
i'm going to bring david talbot onto the
line now
david is of course the director of the
thunderbolts project he is co-author of
thunderbolts of the gods and the
electric universe and he has handled the
enormous task of organizing the
forthcoming conference the tipping point
from january 3rd to 6th in albuquerque
new mexico and david is going to be with
us for a series of discussions over the
next month devoted to unraveling a
number of the ongoing martian mysteries
that to date nasa scientists have been
unable to resolve
david talbot welcome to the show today
yes greetings michael now david as i
said we're flashing back to january of
2004 and i know that when the rovers
first arrived on mars there wasn't
anything
particularly mysterious about their
missions but then events began to unfold
and nasa scientists really had to
struggle and in fact they still struggle
today to provide any satisfying
explanation why don't you take us back
to the moment
when the mystery began to unfold that
today nasa scientists are still
scratching their heads in truth trying
to figure out
it was in january 2004
that the two rovers dropped onto the
planet mars
and began a project or an exploration of
the surface that was envisioned to last
some three months or 90 days now the
reason for the short lived anticipated
project was
the incredibly dusty atmosphere of mars
this is an interesting mystery in itself
because
the martian atmosphere is
0.008
as dense as the earth's atmosphere so
just the
fact of such a dense presence of dust in
the martian atmosphere is itself a great
uh enigma for planetary scientists
but accumulation of dust on the solar
panels
was envisioned to occur so rapidly that
the solar
panels would basically be deactivated
within a three month or so
period of time now what actually
occurred seemed to clearly verify that
this was going to happen after just a
few months spirit's output dropped to
400 watt hours the opportunity output
dropped to about 500 watt hours due to
dust accumulation affecting the solar
cells so this is what the project was
designed around
but that's when something actually
amazing happened it was something akin
to a car wash as the scientists
themselves put it and nasa scientists
were quite frankly stunned
this this coming back to life that
occurred with these rovers remains a
mystery today
and why did it happen in
spurts during the martian nights power
increased by up to five percent
and it was not long before the power had
peaked at the original 900 watt hours in
other words a full
recovery of both rovers powers so
opportunity and spirit just kept going
and as you said opportunity is still
going today it's nine years after the
landing on mars
so
what
what in the name of heaven happened
nobody could say actually
well it may be that they can't say and
yet they do say they do give their
explanations and as is so often the case
in the science media the guesses they
are offering are actually routinely
reported as fact it's a fact that one of
the rovers had a fortuitous encounter
with a dust devil and the wind from the
dust devil blew off all the dust from
the panels
what was the first guess they offered to
try to explain these miraculous
cleanings
well
the first is wind they just
appeal to the martian wind which would
have the most trivial impact on
accumulated dust and even in a hurricane
you cannot clean a car on earth by wind
so
the fact that that was given as the
first and most plausible
explanation is is very telling this is
all
incredibly ironic because the truth of
the matter is that many technical folks
in and around nasa have worked for years
with electrostatic cleaning
electrostatic cleaning nasa engineers
have attended conferences on
electrostatic cleaning and it's a
process that actually was envisioned for
keeping solar panels clear technologies
to clear the panels electrostatically
electrostatic deposition and
electrostatic cleaning are extremely
prevalent in industry now this was
something
that i pointed out myself way back in
2005 in a picture of the day that it's
just ironic that nasa scientists the
technical folks
have been so aware of electrostatic
cleaning but the people at the top who
are well let's just say they're closer
to science by news release and they you
might say as well that their gatekeepers
who are responsible for
the public image of the sciences and so
on they seem to know nothing about
electrostatic cleaning
so right after all of these years i was
encouraged to see a headline in the mit
technology review uh it was from august
2010 the headline was self-cleaning
solar panels and it specifically
referred to mars
and the mars rovers solar panels and it
specifically referred to electrostatic
cleaning and its intended use on mars
rovers
so that's when this dismain
aspect of the article jumped out at me
the article said this about spirit and
opportunity
the spirit and opportunity mars rovers
lasted longer than expected because
occasional gusts of wind have cleared
off their panels
i'll just add one more point here the
article then quotes a project monitor at
the jet propulsion laboratory quote
we may not be lucky all of the time
well this was part of
an article designed to foster interest
in electrostatic
cleaning and to know that the margin
atmosphere could actually be
accomplishing this electrostatically
would it be helpful to business let's
put it that way right and and let's be
clear about what we're talking about
here
this is not a case of just one or two
happenstance instances
of a miraculous cleaning by
a gust of wind
somehow
clearing the dust from these rovers so
that they can then reboot their power
we're talking about
cleaning after cleaning after cleaning
extending the expected lifespans of
these rovers from 90 days to a period
going on now
nine
years
it's absolutely amazing michael because
the margin atmosphere is
an incredible witness to the behavior
of
electrified wind or electric wind and so
if there's any planet which we should be
closely investigating the potential for
electrostatic cleaning naturally it
would be the planet mars this
electrified atmosphere of mars needs to
be a key part of the
podcast that you're preparing now for
the next few weeks because
mars is giving us all kinds of
indicators of the role of
electricity in the natural environment
of the planet it's one heck of a story
right well there was also the recent
trending news item relating to the
global dust storms on mars and that is
of course from your perspective an
electrical phenomenon
yeah the
the dust devils on mars are so clearly
electrical because you see them actually
gathered in in
bunches
very tightly packed
at the leading edge of storm fronts on
mars this is a great
topic in fact to just emphasize how
we're failing to
to see what is actually occurring on the
planet you can't have dust devils which
is what they're being called you can't
have dust devils in a neutral electrical
environment
gathered close together at all because
they require for their very existence a
broad circle of atmospheric circulation
so these are the kinds of things that i
i think we'll want to look at and it
does add up to one heck of a mystery for
standard science
right well again and in conclusion here
and we're going to be keeping each of
these segments relatively short we're
going to be doing a series as i said on
these ongoing martian mysteries but dave
just to drive the point home again in
conclusion with people
i challenge anyone to point to an
instance when their car
has gotten cleaner on a windy day
that is a very uh good point and i think
the complementary point is that we we
want to
uh
we want to emphasize that there's this
huge divide between working scientists
on the one hand who delivered these
incredible uh technological achievements
a divide between
his army of working scientists
and and the top-down ideological
stagnation that we see
i mean the the latter appears now to
have virtually
destroyed the inspiration in the
sciences because all of the real paths
of discovery have been shut down no
sense of things yet to know no sense of
true mysteries the only mystery that we
find
of late is the mystery was life once
active on a surface it's really a crying
shame but to always remember that the uh
the inspiration and the rapport and the
dedication and the conscientious work
of the scientists who actually got these
these instruments into space and onto
planets this is an incredible and
admirable achievement
so it's it's very important that we keep
perspective on this ideology is only
a damaging science but the dedication of
the working scientists is what
we want to appeal to now
well david this was a lot of fun i'm
glad that we've done this first
installment of a series of videos on
these ongoing martian mysteries you talk
about your hope to resonate with some
appeal to the working scientists and we
see the evidence of this happening now i
know there are a number of highly
accredited scientists who will be in
attendance at the tipping point
conference in albuquerque and i look
forward to these ongoing broadcasts and
ongoing investigations into these really
fascinating martian mysteries we have a
lot more work to do and this is going to
be a lot of fun
very good michael yes
all right thank you very much david

When I concocted this title I kind of realized
that what makes the world go round but what's the
world? What I really meant is the Earth.
And that's something that we don't often
think about, the driving force that makes
the Earth rotate and in fact all of this
came from the book that David
mentioned, The Fourth Phase of Water.
I think some of you have heard the
presentations on the fourth phase of
water. We all know three phases of water,
we know solid, liquid and vapor.
The book presented evidence that
there's actually a fourth phase of water
and there are few properties of that
phase that actually gave rise to what I
want to talk about today. Let me just
begin by mentioning some of those
properties. The first one is that
when water, and you can see the water,
I think there is a, let's see..
So this is water that you see here and
next to the water is some kind of
hydrophilic surface and what we found is
that when water meets the hydrophilic
surface it builds this huge zone, this is
not one or two molecular layers, but up
to millions of molecular layers of water
that actually changes its properties
amazingly. And we call this, because the
properties are so different, we call it
the fourth phase of water. And one of the
features that it has is that it's got
negative charge and the region
beyond that has positive charge.
We call it the fourth phase and
sometimes we call that the exclusion
zone because we found that this zone
excludes practically everything from it,
just like ice. It moves out into the region
of ordinary bulk water. So because this
region is negatively charged and this
region is positively charged you can
actually put on electrode in here
and electrode in here and extract
current from it. So that's one of the
interesting features of this. Another
interesting feature is where the energy
comes from, to build this zone of
water and to separate the charge. It
comes from light. This was rather a
surprise to us but we found that if you
expose the water to light, what happens
is this exclusion zone, EZ, exclusion
zone, fourth phase of water builds and
the charges separate so we found it
really interesting that light, sunlight
for example, is the energy that drives
the buildup of this phase of water.
Now,
when you think about it, this has
led to a lot of thinking about the
consequences of this. And what are the
consequences that I'm going to be
talking about is the rotation of the
earth. I know it's impossible to think of
any linkage between what I showed you a
moment ago and the Earth's rotation but
I bet that a lot of people here don't
really think about what makes the earth
turn. Maybe you do, I'm not sure. Most
of my colleagues don't think about, oh
you know, it just turns it spins, right,
it started spinning from day one and it
just keeps spinning. But when you think about
it, you know, most things that spinned runned
down. There are energy losses and it just
doesn't keep going forever and when we
think of the Eartth, you know, something may
have set it spinning five billion
years ago or something. You can imagine
something spinning for maybe a few times
or a few years or even a few hundred
years but a thousand years, a million
years,
a billion years.. Can it really keep going
on that initial energy? Is inertia
enough to keep it going? So we started
thinking about that, or I started thinking
about that and so where I wanna get to toward
the end of this talk, and I'll give you a
punch line, is that I'm going to suggest
to you that the wind, blowing over the
earth, is actually what's responsible,
at least hypothetically as speculation, for
keeping the earth rotating. In that of
course the question arises, well okay
so I'm suggesting that the wind is
responsible but what gives rise to the
wind? That's another topic that I had
bet not too many people have thought
about and I'm going to be suggesting to
you that the wind actually comes from
charge gradients, lateral gradients of
charge- particularly positive charge in
the atmosphere. So that's where I'm going.
And the way I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna answer a
series of questions and the list is here.
First of all when we think of charges,
charges can exert force, repulsions and
attractions and I think most of us, maybe
with the exception of the people here in
this audience, don't really think of
charges as having really powerful
forces. We think you know, we touch
something, we get a shock and ok but we
don't think of really strong forces so
the first question is well
ok well, how strong are charged forces
if you got a plus and a plus near one
another. Is it weak, is it strong?
Next question. Where on earth do
charges, where on the earth
do charges hang out? OK and I want to talk about
the earth itself and the atmosphere and
the charges that we find there and the
next question which you could have
surmised is, are there really gradients of
charge that we can identify and and then,
can charge gradients really drive the
prevailing winds and if so, can the
prevailing winds spins the earth?
OK so first question, how powerful are
charged forces? Well one of the phenomena that got me started
is something shown by our previous
speaker Don Scott in one of his books
and and that is,
if you put a proton next to an
electron, let's say at a distance d between
them, there are actually 2 forces that you
can think of. The first one is the
obvious one which is the attraction- the
electrostatic force but also, since the
two have mass, there's a gravitational
force and the question is ok, which one
is stronger and by how much. I'm sure
most of you will of course guess that the
electrostatic force is larger than the
gravitational force but by how much?
So that's a question and
the answer turns out to be, ten to
the 38th. It's not trivial it's a huge
amount but I think most of us don't really
understand what ten to the 38 really
means. We can understand 10 times or a
hundred times or a million times but
ten to the 38th.. Ten to the 38th is
something like this schematic shown here.
If you take a proton on the upper left
and consider that diameter of the proton,
okay, and then consider another distance
if you look at, next to the last panel
there, you see the solar system and if
you take the distance from the Sun to
the edge of the solar system,
take the ratio of that distance to the
diameter of a proton, that's only a mere
ten to the nineteenth. We need ten to the
38th!
So you know, we're talking about
the ratio of the size of a proton to the
distance between, between us and some
distant galaxy. That's ten to the 38th.
To give you some idea about how strong
the forces are, the electrostatic forces
compared to gravitational forces. OK
here's another example, you take two
copper balls sitting on top of one
another and you start removing electrons
from each one of them. That of course
leaves the two copper balls positively
charged. And so the question is well,
how many electrons do you need to remove so that
the top 1 levitates? OK and I dunno
maybe you know the answer to that, it turns
out the answer is, one in 10 to the
seventh. In other words only one in ten
million approximately, electrons need to
be removed so that this ball, because of
repulsion, starts levitating. A really
small force. Another example. You take a
light bulb, take one of the old fashioned
hundred twenty watt light bulbs and you
know the current goes through the
filament, right, and if you could suppose
you could capture electrons and capture,
let's say, one seconds worth of electrons
running through that filament. And
suppose you could take that and compress
it into just like a sort of a nucleus of
positive charges, you compress it into a
dot and you put one one of those dots
down at the bottom resting on the ground
and the other one one metre higher. And
so question is, in order to prevent the
levitation to keep it where it is, how
much weight would you have to put on that?
Anybody want to take a guess? Lots. OK, thank you!
The answer is 50,000 fully-loaded
garbage trucks!
I would have shown jumbo jets, 20 actually, there are
5,000 fully loaded seven forty sevens
but my son, the artist, couldn't draw
them. OK and here is finally not to belabor
the point but it's an important point,
consider this. Suppose you, you're lying
down and somebody is lying
suspended let's say 1 meter above you
okay, and you remove one percent of her
electrons, she's got a lot of electrons and
protons, you remove one percent of her
electrons and 1% of the electrons of the
person below, they're one metre apart and
of course both of them become positively
charged so instead of coming together
which they might like they're actually
coming apart and the same question, how
much weight would you need to put on top of
the upper person in order to prevent
the levitation?
A guess, lots! OK how much is lots? Right, the
Earth.
The weight of the Earth. And this is not
my calculation, you'll see it in
Feynman's lectures. He calculated it, I
guess he knows how to calculate. So, in
other words the point of these
somewhat repetitious slides is that charge
forces can be astonishing and if we
don't take into account the force
exerted by those charges we're missing
something
and probably we're missing something
really important. OK so one question is
well okay, so charged forces can be
astonishing but to do that you need to
separate, you need to have separated
charges and the question is, can
substances really bear net charge? OK and
the answer I'm gonna say is yes, although
chemist will generally say that no, they
can't bear net charge because
everything tends toward neutrality but
here's an experiment from last week.
Here's an electrolyzer and some of you
may know this electrolyzer, it
produces so-called health promoting
water. If you drink, it separates the
water into negatively charged and
positively charged, but they don't tell
you it's negatively or positively
charged. It's high pH or low pH and if you
would have drink a low pH water you'd spit
it out because it's awful, kills bacteria.
But if you drink the high pH water, pH
10.5, 11.5, something like that, it tastes
delicious and there is a lot of evidence
that it actually is, is good for your
health. And you find in Japan for example,
this kind of water is,
if you have any kind of
gastrointestinal problem you go into a
clinic and I am told by my colleague in Japan
that first thing they do is they put you
on this alkaline water and the
government pays for it. So it's got
something. Anyway this has nothing to do
with the health benefits of this water
but you can take the water and you can
as you see on the left side, you can fill a
couple of beakers with it and
what we did is, we took a simple
voltmeter and we put one probe in the high
pH and one probe in the low pH
and voila! Half a volt between those
and a half of volt sustained easily
for an hour. That's as far as we we
went. So yes, you can have sustained
charge in vessels of something.
This is water. Here's another example.
This one is kind of cool if you if
you've seen it, this is.. well you start
start with some beaker of water sitting
on the top and so here is the.. so you start
with the water and then what happens is
that the water goes in, divides into two
columns and the water drips into both, it
passes through this ring and it passes
through this ring, by the way this is
called the Kelvin water dropper experiment
done by Lord Kelvin, okay. And the
drips go through these and these collect
in this container and these collect in
this container and what happens is that,
well you know, they they drop into
there and after a while the charge seems
to build up in some way and and then you
get a zap you get a discharge between
those two electrodes. It's audible, you
can see it, it's really astonishing and
if you look, I mean, and even before the
zap, if you stop the flow, these two
containers will sustain charges and one's
got negative and one's got positive and these
charges can be amazing if you look at
the drops falling into the beaker after
a lot of water has got, not enough to
discharge but quite a bit and it looks
like this. So at the bottom is
the cup and you can see these traces,
these traces are actually falling
droplets of water, they should fall into
the cup but the cup has so much charge
and the following droplet is the same
charge that they get repelled, you can
see these traces going upward.
So it means that the charge forces can
easily defy gravity. So we're talking
about really strong forces. Now the point
is, substances can bear charge and
charge forces can be huge. So I've
answered the first question- how powerful
are charged forces and the answer is
much more than most of us think, extreme!
Next question is ok, where on the earth
do charges hang out? And it's known, it's
well known that there is an electric
field. I remember when I was told that
there is, and I come from a different
field I don't know what most of you
people have known since childhood and
a Russian colleague of mine who was
working in my laboratory one day just
happens to ask me if I knew
anything about the earth's electric
field and I said, what are you talking
about, you mean magnetic field? No,
electric field and he said, you don't
know about it? And it was kind of amazing,
he said he grew up in Russia,
of contemporary age and he said, every
middle school student knew about the
electric field of the earth and and and
the negative charge on the face of the
earth and I guess in this country we we
don't learn that or at least these we didn't
learn that. But anyway it's well known, in
the text books, especially the text books
from fifty to hundred years ago, the
electric field is about a hundred volts
pro meter at the surface of the earth
and there must be therefore some
negative charge on the earth and positive
charge somewhere up there. So essentially
the point is that the earth somehow
bears negative charge and again back to
the health issue, some of you may know
that it's now advocated by people in
alternative health or any kind of health
to just walk barefoot on the beach.
If you walk barefoot on the beach you're
basically soaking up the electric charge,
negative electric charge from the earth
and you need that charge, the body needs
negative electric charge to thrive.
That's a different issue, I don't wanna go
into it. So it's called earthing or
grounding,
depending on where you come from and in,
in Japan and some of the other Asian
countries mud baths are pretty common
and mud baths are said to have healing
properties and and I think the the
reason for this has to do with
connecting to the negative earth. OK, so
question is now where does this negative
charge come from? The standard
interpretation, again if you read
Feynman's lectures, volume 2 chapter 9,
lightning. This is commonly thought to
give rise to the negative charge on the
earth. We don't get that much lightning
at least in Seattle, maybe here in
Phoenix there there's more but around
the earth there are
huge numbers of discharges and so it's
possible that the lightning comb strikes
the earth, brings negative charge and the
earth can't rid itself of that negative
charge rapidly enough and therefore it
accumulates a negative, net negative
charge. That's one idea. Another idea is
that it may come from the Earth's water
and this, as you can see, came from the
work that we had done to produce the
book that I mention. If you have EZ
water down, the earth is of course
filled with water and if much of that is
the fourth phase or EZ water, it bears
negative charge, you see. That could be
another source of this negative charge
and interestingly the Sun builds this
EZ and negative charge so, so we have
some sort of relationship with with the
Sun. Essentially
we have the Sun beating on the earth and
we have negative charge that, that builds
and if the Earth is highly conductive, as
many investigators think, then these
charges would be all around and
fill the subsurface of the earth with
net negative charge. So ok, there's the
negative charge and you might say well,
where do the corresponding positive
charges lodge? They're initially together
with water but many of these protons
evaporate into the air, so we have a
negative and the positive. And the
positive ones, along with negatives which
actually form clouds, the positive ones
are rising up into the air and as they
rise up into the air we have a situation
that looks like this. The earth is
negative and then you have positive
charges that begin rising up as you see
here. Close to the earth there's a high
concentration of positive charges
because those charges are attracted to
the negativity of the earth but as you
get higher up, the protons,
or hydroium ions, tend to repel one
another and they rise vertically and
begin to spread out. You have positive
charges in the atmosphere and negative
charges on the Earth. If you think
about that plus and minus, you have situation
like this and you know, basic
electrostatics tells you that the
positive charges are clinging to the
negative charges and so the atmosphere
clings to the Earth and question that
arises well, you know, if the atmosphere
clings to the earth it exerts pressure on
the earth, does this explain atmospheric
pressure? The prevailing pressure
mechanism is fraught with several
paradoxes. You know, we think of pressure
arising from the weight of the air, you
know, so the weight of the air is pressing down
on us and if you are on top of Mount
Everest there's less air and
it's pressing less on you.. But if you think
about that, if you think about, we have a gas
up there and question is, well we
define a gas as, you have molecules and they don't
stick together, they actually bounce
around and hardly interact with one
another and so. If they don't interact
except very rarely then is it, can we easily
imagine how they press on the earth? Or why,
when you are higher up you have less pressure?
It's possible but it, kind of, when you think
about it, those isolated air molecules
not clinging to the earth the way I
suggested to you by just sort of hanging
out there, it leads to the spectacle of
you know, there's a lot of winds up there and why
doesn't the atmosphere just blow away?
Don't know if you ever thought about
that. Okay here's another paradox about
the atmosphere and the way we think
about the atmosphere and we are ignoring
the positive charges that I told you
about. Well you know, the atmosphere is a
mixture of gases, it's not just nitrogen
and oxygen, a whole bunch of other other
gases. So among them argon is about 1
percent, it's actually quite a lot of
argon that we have in the air and co2 of
course causing apparently, maybe if you,
depending on your belief system, a lot of
problems. Now but argon is the densest of all
and so if argon is the densest of all
you think after all these years that you
might have a situation like this. So
you know, if density really matters we're
fraught with a serious problem.
OK, so we got positive charges in the
atmosphere and negative charges on the
earth and so it's possible I think, that
atmospheric pressure may arise from the
positive charges attracting to the
negative earth and pressing down. Quite,
quite simple.
OK, where do these charges hang out in the
earth and in the atmosphere. Next
question, do you, are there are
substantial charge gradients, differences
of charge that we can imagine? And
the answer I suggest you is yes, they're
both vertical gradients and lateral
gradients, the lateral ones being the
ones going to be focused on at the
moment but the first is, you know, I
mentioned to you that the protons
diminish with increasing altitude. That's,
that's shown on the two panels there now,
suppose you put a test charge, the red
one, down near the surface of the earth, a
lot of positive charges there. And you'll
detect the high electric field and if you
put the test charge higher up, there are
fewer positive charges there and the
electric field will diminish. So, the
field strength diminishes with
increasing altitude and that's well known.
Well reported, this is nothing
controversial. The field strength also
increases with sunshine. This is the
interesting part that maybe some people
are unaware but there is enough evidence
for this, so if the positive charges
are caused by evaporation from the
Earth's water then nighttime there's not
much evaporation. The charges should be
fairly low
in altitude and during the daytime
when you have ample sunshine creating
evaporation, those positive charges
should rise way up, right. So there
should be a big difference between
daytime and nighttime and so therefore
the electric field, which depends on all that
charge, should vary with the time of day.
So if you have for example in the middle of
the day you are to see a lot of electric field
when you're measuring up, well up above the earth
and at night time it wanes so it
waxes and wanes. And the evidence for that
is right here. So this is a plot, a
bit complicated but on the apscise you
have time and if you look right in the
middle at twelve o'clock that's noontime
GMT that would be Greenwich ok, in
England, and the electric field that was
measured, up in the air.
Look at the oscilation, so first look at
the middle one, Africa and Europe and you
can see that the peak occurs roughly 2-3
p.m. around around Europe, just when the
Sun is kind of, has been around for a
while high in the sky, maximum
evaporation, all those positive charges
high so you can see that the electric
field there is very high. Now look to the
right and you can see the US- that
occurs six or so hours later during our
afternoon so you can see that during,
it doesn't matter where
you are,
during the nighttime the electric field
is low and during the daytime it's high.
And look at the differences between them,
look at the Americas- the blue one. You can
see that during the daytime the electric
field is ten times, ten times higher than
it is at night, it's a huge difference that,
I think, many people are unaware of.
So there's a great big difference
between day and night and you can see
that there is a gradient, when night
meets day there's a gradient,
and also on the other side, the upper
right of the figure there's another
gradient, there is a morning gradient and
there is an evening gradient. Big, huge
lateral gradient of positive charge. So
do substantial charge gradients exist?
Both vertically and horizontally. OK now,
can those charge gradients drive the
prevailing wind? So think about it.
Seattle, on the left you know, we're
snoozing and snoring and, you know, we
haven't really gotten there yet and New
York is beginning to be bathed in
sunshine and if it's bathed in sunshine
those positive charges are rising up
into the atmosphere. But at night time
there are very few of those, so there's a lateral
gradient, those charges repel one another,
they want to get away from one another,
where do they go? Well they're gonna go
to the left in this and if the
charges are moving, the charges are at
least dragging the air with them
because these charges are either protons
or more likely hydronium ions
and they're either dragging the air or
they may be attached to the air, bound for
example to electronegative oxygens or
nitrogens. So the air is going to move
also and if the air are moves basically we
have wind. So I believe that charge
gradients can create wind, especially the
large gradients with powerful forces
that we're talking about. So there's the morning
boundary and the evening boundary and I
think those give rise to something
interesting and characteristic. Here's the
morning boundary ok again,
New York has received its sunshine and
Seattle, with the space near, is still
dark and we have this charge gradient,
charges in the morning, the charges are
beginning to rise up and there's going
to be a wind that goes across that
gradient toward Seattle. OK now, it's also,
this is also shown on the next slide. Now
sorry, this one's a little complicated
too so let me explain. So, this is
the surface of the earth
spread out so we have night time in the
center and we have morning on the right
side and evening on the left side. Now
start on the right side and morning and
remember that's just what I was talking
about the wind is blowing from the east
toward the west and it's not a strong
wind because the charges on the right
side are just beginning to rise up, there are
not so many and it causes a wind, you might
call it the morning wind and the wind
blows from east to west and that's known
as the trade wind. Trade wind blows
gently that's what got Columbus to the,
to the New World.
Now look at the other side, look at, this
is, the left side is the evening, ok, and
by the evening, mid-afternoon,
late afternoon the charges are way up
high and the gradient is in the opposite
direction,
it blows from late afternoon toward the
evening so it blows from west to east
and anybody who's flown knows that there
is a wind that blows continuously up
high, it's called the jet stream that flows
from west to east and it's pretty strong,
a hundred, 200 miles per hour so if you fly
to New York it's quicker than if you fly
from New York to Seattle or
Los Angeles. So, I think we can understand,
this high wind is going to be stronger,
this high westerly wind is gonna be
stronger than the low easterly wind
because there are many many more charges
by late afternoon, by mid-afternoon to
late afternoon. So I think those two
gradients, from
morning, the morning gradient and the
evening gradient could perhaps
adequately explain why we have trade
winds and jetstream.
Question was, can charge gradients drive
the prevailing wind and I've shown you
some evidence suggesting that maybe that
could be the case. OK now, can the prevailing
wind spin the Earth?
Well if you think about it you really
don't need a whole lot to, you have a
wind that's blowing at 100 or a two hundred
miles an hour, actually you know the
earth is spinning itself right,
it's spinning at, sorry what is it
roughly, I think 1,200 miles miles per
hour compared to the reference frame of
the cosmos and the wind is going, the
jet stream is going a hundred or two
hundred miles per hour faster. So it's
like the jet stream is blowing and it
could be blowing the earth and the earth
can't quite keep up so it's a little bit
slower and that's why we have a
jetstream relative to the earth that's a
hundred or two hundred miles per hour
faster. So I think it's possible that, we
don't need this tall piece, this is
obviously just illustrative but all you
need is a gradience and something rubbing
on the earth or rubbing
on some protrusions. The advantage of this
kind of wind mechanism is that so, the
rotation of the earth now no longer
depends on the inertia. As I said,
maybe you think differently but it's
difficult for me to imagine that
inertia could keep us going
for 5 billion years. It's a, it's a lot of
time. And also the sun's energy is the
ultimate driver because remember, the
sun's energy is what splits the charge
in the water which gives rise to the
positive charge and so it all comes back
to the energy from the Sun and so the
conclusion from this is that the reason
the Sun, the reason the Earth keeps
spinning is, it gets energy from the Sun
to make it spin. It just doesn't do it.
It's known that the rotation speed of
the earth is not constant. It fluctuates
even by the day. If the earth turned by
inertia, there shouldn't be fluctuations.
There are fluctuations and so this can
explain it. So the question is, can the
prevailing winds spin the earth and
I think the answer is possibly, perhaps that
could be. Finally the last few slides as
a sort of extra. So I'm suggesting to you
that there's charge flow around the
earth, right. Charge flow, wind and I want
to touch on magnetic fields because
charge flow, current, magnetic fields,
they're kind of tied together and
with those charges constantly, like jet
stream, constantly flowing around the
Earth, basically, oops sorry, basically we
have a current that's flowing around
the earth. So think of a current now
flowing around the Earth from west to
east and think about what we know from
basic electrostatics and
dynamics- if we have a current flow going
this way we have a magnetic field using
the right hand rule as shown here.
Now think about applying this rule to
the Earth. So, the horizontal arrows- that's
the wind, that's the jet stream that
blows constantly around the earth, it's
a current, the current is flowing
around the earth and if you have a
current flowing that way then those
thicker lines show the magnetic field. So
it's possible that you can actually get
magnetic field occurring just from those
charged gradients creating current that
flows around the earth. So it's possible,
I mean we like to think that the Earth's
magnetic field comes somewhere from the
core of the earth but you know, nobody's
ever been there to make that measurement
and it's kind of odd that, you know,
you got a magnet sitting there but the
angle of the magnet keeps changing, which it
does, sometimes even flips.. That's that's
not, so I mean we're really not sure that
the magnetic field arises from the
core of the earth and I'm suggesting to
you that it's possible that the Earth's
magnetic field arises externally and
not internally. So, I draw some
conclusions and I don't really mean
that they're conclusions, I mean they are
speculations. I've shown you very little
evidence, I have shown you just a few
ideas that have stemmed largely from the
book that I've produced and the ideas
that went into it and a bit of
evidence but mostly just logical
sequences. The first, the first one is not
a, is well known and we all should know
that charges can exert enormous forces.
Sometimes we attribute phenomena to
gravitational forces, for example
settling in a beaker of water with some
particles, we think of gravitation but
that beaker of water contains enormous
numbers of charges. The charge forces
outweigh the gravitational forces
enormously, remember ten to the 38th. The
earth bears negative charge, again,
there's a lot of evidence for that,
evidence starting more than a
hundred years ago and continuing, it's
just that, it's not really well known. The
atmospheric scientists know that the
atmosphere is full of positive charge.
Oddly it doesn't seem to me, I've
never seen anybody make the suggestion
that plus attracts minus, that atmosphere
attracts earth. It seems almost a
no-brainer,
one has to calculate how much force but
seems like a really simple and easy
interpretation of atmospheric pressure
that the atmosphere clings to the earth
because plus and minus attract. It's the sun's
energy that builds that atmospheric
positivity through evaporation. At night
there's not much evaporation, not much
atmospheric positivity and because
of the regions between sunshine and
darkness you have lateral charge
gradients and remember how strong the
force of those charges can be and
so that inevitably drives winds and winds
create friction and the question is
whether that friction is sufficient to
create the earth's, and keep it, spinning
and giving us day and night. And it's
possible that those charges may actually
create the Earth's magnetic field. So I
guess I would like to conclude with the
fact that the universe or at least the Earth
around us is indeed Electric as I know
many of the people here would like to
think and also the point is that, you
know, alternative theories can sometimes
make sense and I, I am with one example
of an alternative theory, this, this is an
alternative theory for global warming
and the rise of the sea
suggesting
alternative mechanism and thank you for
listening!

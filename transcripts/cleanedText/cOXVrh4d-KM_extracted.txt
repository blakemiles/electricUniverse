A new scientific study is again
reshaping planetary scientists' ideas
about the planet Venus.
An enduring mystery is why the
surface of Venus has so few craters
since it's believed that Venus
is billions of years old
and since astronomers believe
that craters formed from random
impacts over eons of time.
For decades, the consensus
belief has been
that the planet must have
been radically "resurfaced"
thus removing all evidence
of the inevitable impacts.
One theory is that the planet's
surface simply sank for some reason
then was replaced by a
surface with no craters.
However, a recent paper published in
the Journal of Geophysical Research
purportedly falsifies
that hypothesis.
A July 30th article on astronomy.com
describes the research as follows,
"Using numerical models to see how material
in the planet's mantle circulates,
the results found that the
planet couldn't have undergone
what is called mobile
lid convection
- a process where the surface
rapidly sinks into the interior
and is replaced by a fresh,
crater-free surface.
The results will help scientists
understand how Venus evolved
and may even help us understand how the
planet's runaway atmosphere came to be."
The major objections
the research raises
include the absence of a significant
offset between the planet's center of mass
and its actual center,
and Venus's exceptionally
weak magnetic field
since the theorists believe
that mobile lid convection
would leave enough heat in the
planet's core to create a dynamo,
the hypothetical source of our
own planet's magnetic field.
The research thus appears to
favor the conventional theory
that massive volcanism must
continually remove Venus's craters.
However, the author
of the paper states,
"While I think my work more or less
disproves the mobile-lid convection,
I don't think that is the same as
proving the volcanic resurfacing event.
There could be some other mechanism,
possibly even as of yet not discovered.
So I want to leave
the door open."
Indeed, since the dawn
of the Space Age
the planet Venus has
been a proving ground
for competing hypotheses
in planetary science.
From the 1950's to 1970's Venus was at the
center of a blazing scientific controversy.
In 1950 in the best-selling
book 'Worlds in Collision'
the scientific heretic Immanuel
Velikovsky proposed that the planet Venus
is a very recent addition
to the inner solar system
and threatened the Earth
as a terrifying comet.
By studying the ancient
accounts of far-flung cultures
Velikovsky constructed a thesis
of celestial catastrophe.
The converging ancient
imagery includes Babylonian,
Aztec, Peruvian and Egyptian
representations of Venus
using the unmistakable language
and symbols for comets.
As we've outlined many times
based on his thesis of Venus's
recent cometary birth
Velikovsky made the
outrageous prediction
that Venus would be found to be
extraordinarily hot and dry.
This was in stark contrast to the
predictions of many noted astronomers
including the originator of the dirty
snowball comet model Fred Whipple
who proposed that Venus would
be covered with oceans.
Of course, Venus was found to be the
hottest planet in the solar system
with an average surface
temperature of 864 ºF
The consensus belief in planetary
science today is that Venus's dense,
mostly carbon dioxide atmosphere,
has caused heating through a
runaway greenhouse effect.
However the fatal objections to this
hypothesis have never been resolved.
As the astronomer
Victor A. Firsoff noted,
"Earth's seas are
not boiling hot,
despite the total greenhouse effect
of water and average sunlight
stronger than at the
ground level of Venus.
Nor is it at all clear how such a
condition could have become established."
Physicist Wal Thornhill addressed the
issue in a 2003 article on his website
holoscience.com
"Venus receives 1.9 times more
solar radiation than Earth
but its clouds reflect
about 80% of that sunlight,
so that Venus actually absorbs less
solar energy than the Earth...
Even with the maximum
greenhouse effect,
the effective surface temperature of Venus
should be low enough to freeze water.
What is being asked of the
'runaway greenhouse effect'
is equivalent to expecting
a well-insulated oven
to reach a temperature
sufficient to melt led
by having only the pilot
light switched on!"
In the electrical hypothesis
Venus's recent electrical birthing
from a gas giant and its recent capture
do explain the stunning absence
of so-called impact craters.
The surface of Venus is covered with
extraordinary networks of filamentary scars.
In Venus's spectacular
near-Earth cometary displays
electrical discharging heated its crust
and produced the filamentary patterns.
As Thornhill notes,
"Lightning occurring in a high-pressure gas
causes this filamentary 'Lichtenberg' pattern.
At low atmospheric pressures, cratering
is more common - as we see on the Moon."
In fact, most of the features that
planetary scientists interpret as
"volcanoes" and ancient lava
flows are electrical scars
which can be uncannily reproduced in
experiments with electrical discharge.
Of course, this can be applied
to so-called volcanic features
throughout the
entire solar system
In our 2017 interview
with Garrett Hill,
he showed the results of applying
electrical discharge to particulate matter.
On your screen the top image is the famous
Martian "shield volcano" Olympus Mons.
The bottom feature was produced
by electrical discharge.
In similar experiments,
we also see stunning formations of
both radial and lateral patterns
which planetary scientists typically attribute
to fluidic processes such as lava flow.
Now consider this
side-by-side comparison
of the electrical discharge features
to the Ovda region on Venus.
Thornhill also proposes that scientists' detection
of sulfur dioxide in Venus's atmosphere
need not necessarily imply
ongoing episodic volcanism.
He writes,
"It is also possible that
another simple nuclear reaction
is taking place at the
surface of Venus,
involving the combination of the two
atoms of oxygen in an oxygen molecule
to form one atom of sulphur.
It is a process occurring today in
plain view on Jupiter's moon, Io.
In any case, volcanoes are an
electric discharge phenomenon
so that the discovery of
active volcanoes on Venus
cannot be used as a distinguishing test for
or against the electrical model of Venus."
Institutional science dismissed
Velikovsky's evidentiary case
because it disobeyed
Newton's law of gravity
which has no means of
restoring order from chaos.
But as Thornhill explains,
science today functions with no physical
explanation for the force of gravity
which Newton himself admitted
and Einstein avoided the problem by
discarding the force without explanation.
So what astronomers have are mere
mathematical descriptions of gravity's effects.
In the Electric Universe
as developed by Thornhill,
the 19th century concept of gravity
as an electrodynamic force
between all subatomic particles
in the universe is reinstated.
This thesis proposes that
order in the solar system
was restored by charge
exchange between planets
aided by slower charge exchange
between a planet and the solar wind
in the form of a
cometary discharge.
There can be no question that
Venus's recent cometary origins
resolve countless enduring
mysteries of the planet
including its orbit
which is the most circular of all
the planets in the solar system,
its odd rotation,
its superhot temperature,
its vast cometary tail,
its electrically agitated
super-heavy atmosphere,
its tremendous networks
of filamentary scars,
and its lack of so-called
impact craters.
The comet Venus, first proposed
nearly 3/4 of a century ago,
is a challenge to the very
foundations of planetary science
and the mythical 4.5 billion year
history of our solar system.
It is past time for scientists
to meet this challenge
and to finally seek new answers which
await in our Electric Universe.

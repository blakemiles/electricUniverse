In Part 1 of his presentation,
Australian archaeologist Peter Jupp
began outlining his case for the sudden
fossilization of organisms on Earth.
As Peter explained, many
examples exist of life forms
that were not fossilized
over geologic ages
but rather through the instantaneous
process of petrification.
But what natural mechanism
could achieve this?
As Peter will explain
in greater detail
at the forthcoming Thunderbolts
Conference in Phoenix Arizona,
the answer lies in decades
of laboratory research
into high energy
plasma discharges.
Peter Jupp: Let's go on now, you've
got a similar case study here
with the Jurassic
coast ammonites.
These marine creatures
of all sizes, you know,
they're up to about ten
foot across, they're huge.
They're meant to be from the Jurassic age
but that's another debate altogether.
Now they were buried instantaneously,
they look up at you along this beach,
and you can see them clearly,
the image will illustrate this.
And when you cut them up and slice them,
you can see the intricate details.
Every little piece of
function across the cut.
They weren't destroyed,
they were something,
if there was molten rock, surely
it would have burned them up.
Is there a possibility that
water actually, they're in,
immersed in the water and some
strange geological happening,
I suspect a plasma discharge, converted
that water to calcium carbonate?
Now that's pure speculation so where
else could we get some evidence
that something like this transmutation
of elements might be occurring?
One of the very interesting possibilities
here is plasmoid research.
Now if your, certain electrodes
are placed in solutions,
and electrodes are damaged, you get
actually transmutation of elements.
Now, there's new
elements created
but the electric current flow also forces
many plasmoids to emerge from the electrodes.
And some, quite curiously, look
like comets, miniature comets,
pouring off it and they're
creating new elements.
Is this a possibility, is this
cold fusion as we call it,
cold plasma fusion, possibly
responsible on a massive scale
and as Wal Thornhill is always quoting,
electrical phenomena are scalable.
If some major plasmoid
occurs, or plasma discharge,
is that possibly responsible for that something
turning water into calcium carbonate?
For instance, large plasmoids
from volcanoes and earthquakes,
both electromagnetic phenomena, but the
plasmoid's ability to create new elements
whilst emitting light is an area of still
pioneering stage of our understanding.
What further sort of
evidence we have?
Well, I talked to professor
Richard Firestone from Berkeley,
he is one of the preeminent
isotope physicists in America,
he runs the Berkeley laboratories there, he
has recently retired from Berkeley actually,
but he studied the Carolina
Bays, for instance.
He was studying the
production of nano-diamonds
that are curiously found in the
Carolina Bays, plus many other elements.
He is not sure what
caused the Carolina Bays
but certainly the number of
elements is just staggering.
They are a marker.
Richard Firestone discovered without fail,
these depressions, the Carolina Bays,
which were mimicked in Alaska and
the Deccan Traps and in Australia,
contain large concentrations of nanodiamonds
and other exclusive chemical signatures,
for instance: iridium, helium 3,
fullerenes, that's buckyballs,
carbon, glass, hollow spherules,
and magnetic particles.
Could an electrical discharge or
an emerging plasmoid instability
possibly create these diamonds?
Perhaps another interesting conclusion
is consideration of related phenomena,
comes from the Calabrian
earthquakes in the 16th century.
The earthquake formed perfectly round
shallow holes just like the Carolina Bays.
Is an electrical
discharge involved?
As Rick Firestone
notes, importantly,
the Carolina Bays accompany and bank
along huge Lichtenberg river systems.
If you've seen the film from space you
can see these Lichtenberg systems
spreading across the land over many miles
and all along them are the Carolina Bays,
these shallow depressions, they're
obviously associated with their formation.
Was this another massive
electrical discharge?
It's a great possibility.
So there's many things to come I'd want
to go into more detail, in the lecture
that I'll be giving later in
this year, in Phoenix Arizona,
but more detail about particulary the
ammonites, which are fascinating,
stir me, certainly about Dr. Larry Agenbroad
at the great site in South Dakota,
the La Brea Tar Pits and perhaps
some of the other ones,
such is the nano-diamond
formation in the Kimberley.
So, I'll look forward to expanding
on some of these details
would give more facts when
we get back together.

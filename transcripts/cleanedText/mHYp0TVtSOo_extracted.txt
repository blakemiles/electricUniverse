You've just entered the
theater of an alien sky.
If the words and images seem strange
to you, there's a reason for this.
Our world was once a
vastly different place.
To experience this won't hurt you
and there is nothing to fear.
The Labyrinth
Dancing ground of the goddess and warrior
In taking up the myths and symbols of
the labyrinth we face a mystery that has
enchanted investigators
for thousands of years.
And yet despite an impressive
library of evidence, even the best
experts struggle to find a plausible
explanation of this mythic archetype.
In these Discourses, we've introduced a
radical perspective on the ancient
cultures and we've offered a
comprehensive interpretation of archaic
myths and symbols based on an unusual
and at times catastrophic solar system history.
Our subject is an ancient
gathering of planets extremely close to
Earth and remembered around the world.
We've proposed that with this referent
in front of us, hundreds of ancient ideas
including all of the mythic archetypes
become predictable in terms that would
not be possible, not even conceivable in
the absence of the natural provocation
we've outlined.
The first mythical character we meet in
investigating the labyrinth is the
legendary warrior and hero Theseus who
earned his reputation by doing what all
of the great mythic heroes did--
vanquishing chaos monsters and unifying
a legendary homeland.
In the case of Theseus, the
story was localized on the
peninsula of Attica said to have been
the site of a vast fortress--
The Labyrinth constructed by the legendary
king Daedalus.
Within the towering walls of the
labyrinth, locked away in its central
precinct, lived a devouring Minotaur, part
man and part bull, usually sewn as a
bull's head on a mostly human body.
From this starting point, we can ask whether a
persuasive explanation of labyrinth
mythology could now be possible.
The answer to that question will require us
to follow several converging threads in
the labyrinth story.
For many years, in our discussion of
Venus mythology, we've emphasized the
planet's centrality and its repeated
connection to intense electric discharge
giving rise to its mythical identity as
the animating female heart of heaven
displaying explosive radiance and
anciently described as the radiant eye
of heaven and the glory of the sky.
In the course of these explorations, we've
also observed that electrical formations
linked to Venus acquired varying numbers
and varying configurations of discharge
streamers, all associated with the axial
center of the sky.
So the first place to look for
clues is the center of the
labyrinth itself from which the
explosive discharge or celestial glory
radiated outward to become the winding
paths of the labyrinth itself.
An overriding archetype to be explored in
connection with the labyrinth is the
prototypical conjunction of the mother
goddess and the ancestral warrior, the
two most dominant archetypal figures
in world mythology.
Most significant was the emergence
of a whirling aspect from the
three-legged Triskelion to the swastika
along with more complex variations of
the symbolic whorl, so it's not
surprising to find these varied forms
repeatedly connected to the central
source of the labyrinth's entwining paths.
From these symbolic connections, we would
naturally look for an explicit
identification of the chaos goddess with
the centerpiece of the labyrinth and
that is precisely what we find in the
example scene here, where the head of the
terrifying Medusa with her snaky locks
is indeed the heart of the labyrinth but
also directly linked to the whirling
triskelion formed from the goddess's
disordered hair, as we should expect.
We can also understand the mythic
interpretation that saw the winding
paths of the labyrinth as a dark cavern
entered by the warrior who then appears
to be trapped within the so called
'intestines' of the labyrinth or otherwise
engulfed by entangling serpents, marking
out the same complex pathways.
A closely related theme involves the intricate
windings of the rope or thread or an
elaborate knot.
In the following analysis, we intend
to show that the mystery of
the labyrinth can be fully explained by
concrete, highly electrified plasma
formations in the ancient sky.
To simplify a complex story, three
well-documented phases of this activity
can be analyzed.
One is radial discharge, the first witness
to the evolving plasma formations.
The events include changes in
both the number and the morphologies of
discharged streamers, which plasma
science explains in a direct
relationship to the energies
driving the activity.
The emerging symbolism of a
four-fold discharge included a diversity
of mythical interpretations as four
etheric spokes of the so-called ‘Sun
wheel,’ four rivers of paradise, four
directional winds and four pillars of the
sky, all discussed at length in my book
'The Saturn Myth.'
With that global language in front
of us, there is no
stretch needed to connect the center of
the labyrinths to the electric discharge
activity that gave rise
to the labyrinth itself.
Second, the whirling aspect first arising
from primeval chaos in the form of a
three-legged triskelion.
The discharge configuration eventually displayed a
more complex whirling form, sometimes
interpreted as a world-threatening
whirlwind or whirlpool.
Its most familiar form was the swastika, anciently
occurring thousands of years before any
of the familiar 20th century adaptations
of the symbol.
Additional, more complex forms can also be named
and the connection of such symbols to the
dynamic center of the labyrinth will be
crucial to our understanding of the
labyrinth's historical origin.
As in virtually all stories of the warrior
hero, there is a chaos monster close by.
The builder of the labyrinth of Knossos,
Daedalus was said to have constructed
the palace-like fortress to imprison
and protect the Minotaur.
The Minotaur was half-man, half-bull and was kept
in the labyrinth by Minos, ruler of Crete.
In mythic terms, the monster can be compared
to the bull of heaven slain by the hero
Perseus, the legendary founder of Mycenae,
or similarly the bull of heaven slain by
the Sumerian warrior hero Gilgamesh.
By placing the emphasis on the celestial
context where they belong, such story
elements become valuable complements to
the Theseus legend.
It was also said that the king's daughter Ariadne fell
passionately in love with the hero,
a theme placing the story squarely within
the archetypal tradition, hero consorting
with the daughter of a famous king.
It was also said that before Theseus
entered the labyrinth
to fight the Minotaur,
Ariadne gave him a ball of thread which
he unwound as he entered the labyrinth
enabling him to find his way back by
following the thread.
This juxtaposition of themes makes it relatively
easy to see the unwinding of a coiled thread in
its proper relationship to the events by
which the labyrinth itself acquired its unique form.
Our explanation begins with
planets close to Earth and aligned in
the ancient polar configuration along a
single axis, when four symmetrical
discharge streamers radiated explosively
from the planet Venus.
In this phase of instability the discharge took on
a whirling appearance, a form that numerous
ancient cultures recorded alternately as
a swastika, then a more elaborate whorl.
Eventually, the displacement of the
aligned planets produced an irregular
more complex streamer pattern
as Venus and Mars visually
danced around the polar
center in unstable motions.
In that dance, the labyrinthine windings of
the discharge streamers acquired the
appearance of a towering Citadel in the
heavens recorded mythically as the labyrinth.
This will explain why the
towering structure was celebrated as the
dancing ground of Theseus and Ariadne,
literary echoes of the prototypical
warrior hero and mother goddess,
Mars and Venus.
In archetypal terms, the labyrinth
signified a fortress which the hero, be it
Gilgamesh, Heracles, or Theseus, was
required to enter to complete a specific
task, test, or labor.
The investigative value of the labyrinth in this Discourse
and in the episode to follow, is that it
offers an uncompromising test of
predictive ability,
while inviting the goddess and the
warrior to open additional doorways to
broader archetypal symbolism
yet to be explored.

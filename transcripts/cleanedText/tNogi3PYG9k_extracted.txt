A new scientific report may provide
stunning support for the role of a form
of electric current called a Birkeland
current on the cosmological scale.
A team of scientists using the ALMA telescope
to study the doughnut-shaped cloud of
gas and dust at the center of the galaxy
NGC 1068 made a shocking discovery -- two
separate disks of gas and dust are
rotating in opposite directions.
Phys.org reports on the team's discovery,
"Unexpectedly, they found two
counter-rotating disks of gas. The inner
disk spans two to four light-years and
follows the rotation of the galaxy,
whereas the outer disk (also known as the
torus) spans 4 to 22 light years
and is rotating the opposite way."
The lead author of a paper on the discovery
states, "We did not expect to see this,
because gas falling into a black hole
would normally spin around it in only
one direction. Something must
have disturbed the flow,
because it is impossible
for a part of the disk
to start rotating
backward all on its own."
Those who have followed this
series might understand
the potential significance
of this discovery.
In 2015, retired
professor of electrical
engineering Dr. Donald Scott published
his mathematical model of the structure
of a Birkeland current, which he
identified visually as counter-rotating
cylinders, and it's being seen at vastly
different scales in the cosmos, from
galaxies to planetary aurorae.
We asked Dr. Scott for his
thoughts  on this latest discovery.
Well, a week or two ago,
National Radio Astronomy Observatory
announced their again of course,
"unexpected discovery" that in another
galaxy, it happens to be M 77, the galactic
disk was experiencing counter-rotation.
While the part of the disk that
is closest to the center of
the galaxy rotates in one direction,
the outer regions of the disk rotate
in the opposite direction, and so
there is counter rotation.
And the only explanation
they could offer was that,
"...counter rotation always results
from the collision or interaction
between two galaxies. What makes this
result remarkable is that we see it on a
much smaller scale, tens of light-years instead
of thousands from the central black hole."
And of course, their amazement
is the result of two different errors
that are actually compounding each other
and making the whole thing worse.
The first is, since they still refuse to
acknowledge the existence of any
electrical effects in the cosmos, the
only tool available to them is the
attractive force of gravity.
So of course, they declare
that any case of counter-
rotation has to be caused by some sort
of collision or near collision or near-
miss or something like that.
And the second error, expressly in this press
release but in other places of course as
well, they repeat the self-contradictory
idea that black holes that suck in
matter due to a singularity -- that's an
infinite concentration of matter which
is impossible -- they also spit out
matter at incredibly high speeds up to
five hundred kilometers per second, which
is more than a million miles an hour.
It's all getting sucked in, how
can it be blasted out again?
But anyway, how can this have
anything at all to do with the
counter rotation in this particular
case is not really discussed.
I feel that their mentioning
of the black hole
that exists there is just a red herring
to distract the reader from asking the
obvious question, how do you explain the
counter rotation in the first place?
And I submit, there is no known scientific
process that naturally produces two
concentric discs that rotate in opposite
directions, other than the natural
counter-rotation that occurs
within a Birkeland current.
It's just that simple.
So very similarly in another case I'm
familiar with, there is a galaxy NGC
4550, and a well-known British
astronomer tried to explain an earlier
case of galactic counter-rotation in
this galaxy by saying that another
galaxy that was spinning in the other
direction must have come close to or
collided with the first galaxy.
And anyway, I discussed this in an
earlier paper that I published.
But the reason the counter-rotation of stars
within a galaxy hasn't been discovered as
often as it might, I suggest, is because
1) the galaxy has to be oriented
in such a way that the red-blue shift that
reveals the counter-rotation can be measured.
It has to be oriented so
that it can be measured.
For example, galaxies that
are face-on to us will
not show spectral evidence of counter-
rotation, because it takes the stars,
the stars that are involved have to
be moving at least partially toward us
and then away from us as they rotate
around the galaxy, and that'll be so
if the galaxy is at an
angle but not face on.
But also, in my estimation, the primary
reason that this hasn't been discovered,
as much as it's seemingly being
discovered now, is that it's easy not to
see something if you don't
really want to see it.
And so we do know of the
existence of several galaxies within
which counter-rotation has been measured,
but in the explanation, none of them have
a satisfactory explanation if electrical
phenomena such as Birkeland current
structure are intentionally
excluded and ignored.
And by the way, if you do a web search, 
anyone who sees this, just go
ahead and do a web search using a search
engine on 'galactic web' and if you do
that well, I just did this morning as a
matter of fact, and I found a Wikipedia
description of the galactic web and it
says the following, "In the standard
model of the evolution of the universe,
galactic filaments form along and follow
web-like structures of dark matter.
It is thought that this dark matter
dictates the structure of the universe
on the grandest of scales. Dark matter
gravitationally attracts normal matter
and it is this normal matter that
astronomers see forming long thin
walls of super-galactic clusters."
Well of course, what they're
missing is that the
strings are made up of plasma and the
formation of filaments is a very normal
thing within a plasma.
That has nothing to do with dark matter
or anything else, any other fairy dust
they conjure up to explain what
they can't normally explain.
It can't be explained without
thinking about electricity up there.
Anyway, they confidently say these
kinds of things about dark matter as if
they actually have seen some and
measured what its properties are.
Maybe they will now say, dark
matter causes things to spin!
They haven't said that one 
before, but that's a possibility.
Anyway, the filaments that make up the galactic
web undoubtedly consist of plasma in the
form of force-free currents.
They carry electric currents to and from the
galaxies that form along them and when
these filaments emit visible light, they're
then properly called Birkeland currents.
And we've talked a lot about
Birkeland currents here on Space News.
We know that the cross sections of those
Birkeland currents have regions of
counter-rotation, it's the only thing in the
universe that naturally does have counter-rotation.
And of course, the galaxies
that form on those filaments
will probably also exhibit that same counter-
rotation because that's how they're formed.
Astronomers ought to know
these things as well but they don't.
They'd rather talk about things smashing
and crashing together and reject the
idea that anything
electrical is happening.
Therefore, the only tool they
have to explain things is the attractive
force of gravity, so the only thing left
for them is to assume collisions or near
collisions are the cause of
just about everything they see.
Their Big Bang story
says that everything blew apart.
OK, if you accept that, fine, but in
addition to blowing apart, then what
causes everything in
the universe to spin?
We don't know, no answer.
Every time we hear about or observe counter-
rotation of disks or cylinders anywhere,
especially at galaxies that have a
common center, think Birkeland currents,
don't think collisions or explosions.
So every time we hear about counter-rotation,
just think about Birkeland currents.
It's the only thing in the universe
that does have counter-rotation.

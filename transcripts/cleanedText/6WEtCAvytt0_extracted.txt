Welcome to the
Electricity of Life,

Beings like ourselves, birthed
in an oxygen-rich atmosphere,
may casually understand the requirements of
life in terms of the creatures we can see.
Air is breathed or extracted
from water in the case of fish,
water is drunk or retained for weeks
and months by hardy life-forms.
The oxygenated environment
around us informs our schemas.
It is wise to remember that life is not
ultimately defined by water and air.
It is defined by the molecular
electronics in an organism's biology.
There are a great many microscopic
life-forms here on Earth
that can or regularly do thrive on
substances that baffle human beliefs.
370 miles off the shore of
Newfoundland - Canada,
the ship wreck of the
Titanic was found.
It lay almost two-and-a-half miles deep or
12,500 feet below the saline waters' weight.
Growing on the hull of this historic vessel
was a fairly historic biological discovery.
Giant mats of microorganisms
were moving along the surface of
the ship reducing it to rust.
Within their protective film,
pulses of electrical communication
allow highly diverse microscopic creatures
to move as a coordinated superorganism.
Among the colony are life forms from all three
domains of currently known organic life
including ancient
archaebacteria.
Using chemical electrical signals
the organisms can communicate
some of their growth needs to each other
in an impressive show of cohabitation.
In our human terms we might say
that some of the tiny life-forms
are not at all eating the metal
but practically breathing it.
This idea owes its strangeness
merely to our familiarity
with the experience of breathing-in air as
a necessity for every moment of our life
and our unfamiliarity with the molecular
electronics that it actually involves.
Our body, during its
generation of vital energy,
uses the oxygen we breathe
as an electron receptor
at the end of a process of splitting
and recombining molecules.
Some microbes use iron or
sulfur for the same purpose.
Here we can see one plugging in to
a microscopic surface of basalt.
In fact, there are actually species which,
in the wild, naturally use uranium.
They are highly resilient at
proofreading and repairing their DNA
from frequent damage
by radiation.
They are an apt reminder of the
diverse electronics life can have
on this planet or others.
And when a large colony of different
microscopic creatures is carrying out
sophisticated alchemy upon one of our
industrial, seemingly impervious objects,
it reminds us of how much
of ecology we do not see.
Diatoms are microscopic
jewels of the sea,
photosynthesizing organisms
which absorb silicon dioxide
and combine it with water molecules
to fashion shells of glass.
There are at least 100,000
different species of diatom,
each one can have
wildly creative shells
grown from combining these
raw molecules of reality
to form designs with intricate
features measured in nanometers.
Imagine we've prepared
a microscope slide
with some pond water with a
few small visible specs.
Looking through the lens,
those specs of matter are revealed to
be tiny islands in their own right
made of rocks and indeterminate plant
pieces, surrounded by unicellular life.
Seeing such tiny specks of familiar
debris at this layer of magnification
gives us a sense of scale and with
that a more accurate understanding
of the sheer amount of life
that is thriving all around us
inhabiting and often interacting
with the matter we see.
In every inch of dirt and every ounce of wild
water there is life in all its chemistry.
Built from and manipulating the
electricity of the physical world.

You've just entered the
theater of an alien sky.
If the words and images seem strange
to you there's a reason for this.
Our world was once a
vastly different place.
To experience this won't hurt you
and there's nothing to fear.
In our previous episode, we observed the
critical role of a great crescent in
the ancient sky. The placement of
this crescent on the sphere of an
enigmatic body called the primeval Sun is one
of the unresolved mysteries of the ancient world.
The first step in a resolution must be
to honor the early historic descriptions
of things not seen in our sky today.
The crescent had nothing to do with our
moon, and the great sphere on which the
crescent appeared certainly was not our Sun.
It was the sphere at the gas giant Saturn,
appearing as a massive body
visually dominating the sky.
Yes, today's Sun was present.
It was the Sun that cast the illuminated
crescent on the towering form of Saturn.
But, why the incessant contradiction
of our familiar sky?
Ancient astronomies place Saturn at
a preposterous location, far from the
orbit that we know today. Saturn occupied the
celestial pole, the axial center of the turning heavens.
This unthinkable idea, when taken
with the seriousness it deserves,
places stringent demands on our reconstruction -
and an inescapable requirement that the
crescent revolve around the polar center
in a cycle of day and night.
Descending to the left at sunset,
below at midnight, rising to the right at sunrise,
and standing inverted above at noon.
Of course, in this description we're
using the modern language of day and night.
But the language is reversed
in more ancient times.
It's well established that the ancient
counting of days was from sunset to sunset.
We explain this language by an
ancient reverence for that moment in the
daily cycle when the planetary
configuration exploded into life
at the beginning of the archaic day.
But there's much more to this story.
The symbolism of the crescent takes on
far-reaching implications with the
emergence of the cosmic pillar, a form
we noted only briefly in the previous segment.
The pillar, linked to the
movement of the planet Mars,
arose with the descent of material
from the red planet toward the Earth,
creating a form universally interpreted,
not just as a pillar,
but as the axial World Mountain, the
cosmic support and resting place
of the creator himself,
the primeval Sun.
A mountain of fire and light,
the mountain of creation, the mountain of assembly,
an axial pillar around which
the heavens visually turned,
all meaningless in the absence of
the original referent in the sky.
A single cosmic column inspired the diverse
images of the crescent at the summit.
Suddenly things were seen imaginatively
that were not imagined previously:
the mythic mountain of the moon;
the outstretched arms or wings
of a divine celestial figure;
shining horns, a horned pillar
called the Bull of Heaven;
a cleft peak, or twin peaks; twin supports of
the sky, as extensions of the central column;
a revolving crescent ship on its mooring post;
and we can add countless ancient
images and pictographs of the daily cycle.
We explain the full range of mythic images
by the placement and movement of the crescent.
Each and every mythic form inspired by
the crescent must have revolved in the sky
- against all seeming logic,
against all familiar human experience.
And not just a revolving crescent form,
but revolution in a precise relationship
to an archaic daily cycle. A
contradiction of anything and
everything that could be
said of a daily cycle today.
Every mythic interpretation of the
crescent thus becomes an acid test.
That means, a test the reconstruction must meet
and alternative explanations could not meet.
A crescent form seen as the
arms of a celestial figure.
Upright and inverted arms in a
predictable relationship
to opposite phases of
growing bright and growing dim.
One phase seen as the twin
or double of the other.
The phase of brilliance, arms upright,
produced the images of life and power,
the phase of dimming, with arms inverted
came to mean negation, or absence of life.
This unique mythic role of a revolving
crescent as outstretched arms in a daily cycle,
can only open our minds to a much
broader range of myths and symbols.
What about the other mythic forms of the crescent,
since they must also have rotated
absurdly around a central star?
We'll show that every predicted correspondence occurs
in explicit detail, the more archaic the tradition,
the more precise the correspondence,
as we would expect,
all with no explanations available under
common suppositions about the ancient sky.

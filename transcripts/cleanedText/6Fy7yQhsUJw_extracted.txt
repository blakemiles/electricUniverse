In the final chapter of the Eye of the Storm
series, I presented Easter eggs, surprise
geologic findings that confirmed a theory,
or presented astonishing new information
about Earth's electric circuitry.
Exploring the Electric Earth is a
perpetual egg hunt, because
every rock confirms that the bunny is real.
Electrical discharges follow patterns
and behaviors that yield definitive
information about cause and effect.
Discharge patterns on the landscape
indelibly record discharge events, like
a holographic data bank. Chapters 8
and 9 of Eye of the Storm discuss
surface conductive discharges across
Earth's surface that form the
Colorado River and its tributaries.
The trace of a surface conductive
discharge is particularly rich in information
because, unlike a lightning bolt that
momentarily sticks on the Earth,
a surface discharge has to crawl across the
surface, meeting significant impedance, seeking
out conductive pathways, expending
vast energies transporting matter, while
explosively faulting and excavating. It takes time,
it's not energy efficient and it leaves its mark.
A stunning display of a particular type
of surface conductive discharge can be
found in the Laramie Mountains in Wyoming.
Embedded in these mountains are gorges
and ridgelines that literally form a
phase diagram of what took place.
It couldn't be more explicit than if God had left
his blueprint on the drafting table for all to see.
This 15-mile cross is from a discharge between
two out-of-phase circuits. First however,
let's consider the geometry of a surface conductive
discharge. Each discharge branches out in fractal
self-similar dendrites, to absorb all the surface
charge on the conductive object it's attached to.
In our case it's the Earth. This is
a diffusion-limited aggregation.
Each filament of a discharge soaks
up charge from a particular domain.
The domain is a region surrounding the
spark, defined by its electromagnetic field,
from which it sucks charge of one polarity and
spits charge of the other polarity in reactive power
surges. It does this because it's not insulated
current, like we use in electrical systems.
Filament domains cover every square
inch of solid land on the planet.
We call them watersheds, because they
serve to collect rain water into river channels.
But that's a consequence, not a cause. The
Earth once crawled with electrical discharges.
This should be self-evident in any
theory of planetary formation.
In consensus theories, planet and comet
collisions would necessitate big sparks. In Electric
Universe theory, sparks are already acknowledged.
Why consensus science doesn't look for
evidence of electrical discharge, is evidence
they don't ask the right questions.
What is interesting, the big Easter egg i'm getting
to, is that domains cross and that filaments
interact. Giant sparks result. The interaction
we'll investigate created a landscape
that can only be explained electrically.
The statistical probability of a
consensus theory doing it, is nigh
impossible. Domains don't usually
cross, because skin effects occur between domains
that keep them segregated, as if by a membrane.
But they can cross and interact,
if domains are out of balance.
An over-voltage in one could make it
aggressive and overcome another.
Depending on phase disparities, this can
be a gentle handholding connection,
or it can be an explosive punch. We'll
look at one of the explosive kinds.
The annotated image shows the area of interest
circled in violet, including the Laramie Mountains
surrounded by green and red circles.
The Laramie is part of the Continental
Divide as it cuts through southeastern
Wyoming. The circles denote the major streams
flowing from the mountains. Green are
streams flowing to the North Platte River
and then to the Missouri and
ultimately the Mississippi valley
and the Gulf of Mexico. Red are streams
that flow to a sink in the basin west of
the mountain range. The sink forms
the Seminoe and Pathfinder Reservoirs,
also circled in red, west of the mountains. And
the North Platte River forms the Glendo Reservoir
on the opposite side, circled in green. The high
basin drains around the mountains in two flows,
shown by yellow connections. The North Platte
runs near Casper, Wyoming, and around the
north of the mountains, and the
Laramie flows from Medicine Bow
to Fort Laramie through a path to the south of
the range. The overall structure is shaped like a
heart, with the mountains filling the upper
half, the basins filling the lower and the
rivers acting as arteries and veins. The
distinctive yellow X in the center of the range
is the X-pattern that was shown earlier and it's
a discharge pattern that occurred when the North
Platte filament of the Mississippi discharge
met a separate domain with a different phase.
What you see is literally a natural phase diagram
that records the phase angles of the discharge.
The discharge took place because
the Missouri circuit was an AC
current that made connection to a ground current
in the basin and sparks shot between the circuits
where the domains came together. The
Laramie Mountains formed as a consequence.
The discharge adopted an X-pattern where it made
connection with the east-west branches vectored
along the electric field denoted by the dotted red
and green lines. The electric field is the dipolar
alignment between the lakes. The lakes, or
the depressions where these lakes are now,
were created in the same discharge
event that met at the crux of the X
and sent reactive discharges rotated
at 90 degrees to the originating spark,
between the circuit domains. The
discharge is much like the resonant
frequency discharges discussed in chapter 8
and 9 of Eye of the Storm which created the
major 180-degree branches of the Colorado River.
The geometry is different, an X instead of a T,
but that is because the X is a resonant
discharge between two existing circuit
domains, whereas the T is a result
of a single circuit bifurcating.
The bifurcating discharge means critical
resistance due to a buildup of stray
capacitance that resonates the circuit,
increasing frequency and therefore
resistance, until the current is stopped,
causing it to explode and reactive
discharges 90 degrees to either side of the original
current. The X is produced by two out of phase
circuit domains coming together.
The Missouri circuit is an alternating
current, whereas the Basin circuit
is a direct current to ground.
The two circuits go in and out of phase
with each other as the AC current
alternates. This makes a connection, then a
discharge. The discharge is totally in reactive
power mode, because the out-of-phase
circuits are 180 degrees out of phase,
and that has the same effect as resonant
discharge, raising resistance to infinity and
forcing the current out sideways at 90 degrees.
The first case is like putting a finger
on the nozzle of a hose and forcing
water to spray out sideways,
90 degrees to the direction of the nozzle.
The second case is like having two hoses
aimed at each other where the streams
impact, flow sprays out sideways. In one,
the water pressure changes
flow direction and makes a T,
and in the other two flows impact and the pressure
changes flow direction to make an X. The reactive
discharge dissolves the voltage differential
between circuits by expending their charge, the
entire accumulated charge in the Missouri circuit
in this case, in an explosive X-shaped spark.
It created what astrophysicists
call magnetic reconnection.
Astrophysicists don't recognize electric circuitry
in space because in dark mode current doesn't
emit radiation they detect,
and since they can't see it, their
reductionist minds can't make
the intuitive leap to circuitry.
But they do detect the magnetic flux that
results. They invented the term magnetic
reconnection in lieu of an explanation,
because they can't fathom the simplicity
of two out-of-phase circuits coming together
to make a spark. Magnetic reconnection.
The moving lines are magnetic field lines, the
things astrophysicists think are reconnecting,
but they are actually the magnetic
field lines generated by current flow,
oriented along the dotted lines. Their
model only recognizes magnetism, so the
dotted lines are just separating the magnetic
fields. The big yellow arrows pointed inwards
and outwards in different quadrants of
the X, are the vectors of electric current,
induced by the changing magnetic field.
In the Laramies, induced electric
currents were expressed in the
atmosphere by plasma winds.
Plasma winds drew to the crux of
the discharge at ground level in
top and bottom quadrants, and blew
outward at high level, like an anvil
cloud in the right and left quadrants.
The winds lifted in a vertical updraft
over the center of the X, but even
more astounding is the effect
that magnetic fields and reactive currents had
in shaping the entire basin and range structure.
The landscape is a 3D photograph of what
happened. To appreciate what took place, the
three-dimensional nature of the circuit
domains needs to be recognized.
Charge diffused across the ground, as well
as through the ground, and into the sky.
Capacitance between the Earth
and sky force mirroring currents
in the atmosphere, stirring a violent storm
system. Think of it as a local squall line of
thunderstorms, raging over the
mountains at the time they were formed,
and while the ground discharge took place.
The central updraft over the X formed a huge
mesocyclone, flanked by smaller
thunderheads to either side.
Most of the energy of the discharge went
straight up into the mesocyclone,
pulsing it with energy. The wind paths to
be described, are ground level winds,
that were shaped by the electromagnetic field at
the planet surface. The combined effect of the
discharge at ground level, its magnetic
field and the resultant plasma winds,
makes an X pattern shown in red. The
magnetic field lines, shown in blue,
are just like they're shown in the
pattern of magnetic reconnection.
The yellow vectors are pointing to the
direction of wind paths at ground level
following this storm system along the magnetic field
lines. The winds in the northeast and southeast
quadrants flow parallel, patterned
around the X. In the northeast,
they cross magnetic field lines perpendicularly,
flowing straight to the crux of the
discharge. The jet stream winds leave
valleys with broad rounded or V-cut bottoms,
carpeted with silt, but no inner gorge. They may
have a superficial meandering stream erosion,
but not a deep-cut, straight inner gorge.
We'll examine more wind-cut valleys
later, but first, let's distinguish
between a wind-cut valley
and a discharge-blasted canyon, like the one that
formed the X. The path of a discharge leaves canyons
rough-cut, with deep inner gorges. This
is the Platte River, or northeastern arm
of the X in the Laramie mountains. The
size of the discharge canyon indicate
arc blasts which expose granite
tetrahedrons. On one side
the tips of the tetrahedrons jut out.
This is the leeward side,
exposed and broken, whereas the other side
shows the flat faces of windward tetrahedrons.
This indicates the mountains were laid down by
a crosswind before the discharge occurred and
blasted this canyon. So the mountains resulted
from an evolving storm system that changed its
winds surely, due to this big spark.
Note on both mountain sides the
cross-hatched patterns of shock diamonds,
in the canyon flanks created by shock waves.
Northeast quadrant wind-cut valleys between
north and east arms of the X discharge.
Note the many transverse striations of cuts and
gorges and how they change orientation between
the arms of the discharge.
Striations come from deposition layers,
shaped by shock waves, transverse to the winds,
and by secondary discharge filaments between
the circuit paths. The winds drew into a central
vortex at the crux of the discharge, drawing dust
into a pile, to form the mountains.
Therefore each quadrant of the discharge
displays shock waves that are oriented
by the wind in that quadrant.
Secondary discharges are from short- circuiting
sparks between current paths, like sparks
between live bare wires that are too close together.
There is one secondary discharge visible
that makes its own X pattern, center
right in the image. This is a mini
discharge between the AC
current in the big X and the static
buildup of charge in the wind-cut
lane due to the plasma jet stream.
It's essentially an AC to DC connection
that makes a perfect 90-degree reaction,
just like the big X. And it's even
oriented in the same orientation,
repeating self-similar forms. In the
next show, we'll conclude with a
look at more wind-cut valleys in the
Laramie mountains of Wyoming,
and how they're shaped
by electromagnetic fields.

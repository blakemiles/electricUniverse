Science news headlines around the world tell
of a baffling mystery on the planet Mars.
In March of 2012,
amateur astronomers spotted enormous
plumes jetting from the Martian surface.
The plumes were more than 250 km high and
several hundreds of kilometers in length.
Similar bright, enormous plumes have
occasionally been spotted on Mars since 1997.
The lead author of a new paper
in the journal Nature states,
"At about 250 km, the division between the
atmosphere and outer space is very thin,
so the reported plumes
are extremely unexpected."
The ad hoc explanations scientists
are grasping for are extremely limited.
One suggestion is that frozen shards
of carbon dioxide or water vapor
somehow form the plumes.
But as noted in a recent
Scientific American article,
their existence would require
the atmosphere to be much colder
than models predict
for that altitude.
Scientists have also suggested that
the plumes may be a kind of Aurora
similar to the Northern
Lights on Earth.
The Nature report states,
"Mars does not have a global magnetic
field, only pockets of magnetization.
The mystery clouds were spotted over one
of these so-called magnetic anomalies,
and auroral lights have been
observed there previously.
However, to explain
the 2012 observations,
an aurora would have had to be 1,000
times brighter than the Northern Lights.
This would require an increased flow
of charged particles from the Sun,
but its activity was not
unusually high during the time."
But there is another possibility that
planetary scientists have yet to consider.
For an important clue,
let us go back to 2001,
when Mars became engulfed in the greatest
global dust storm ever observed on the planet.
The giant Martian dust storms had already
puzzled planetary scientists for decades.
How can an atmosphere less
than 1% as dense as Earth's
remove dust from the soil and accelerate it
into massive clouds circling the planet
up to 40 miles or
more above the surface?
In late June, 2001, the Hubble telescope
revealed the first stirrings of a dust storm.
Within a few weeks, it had
covered the entire planet.
And the storm did not begin
to subside until October.
Scientists were left
to ponder in vain.
How is the dust excavated
from the surface?
What held the dust aloft?
What accelerated the winds and dusts across
the near vacuum of Mars's upper atmosphere
to speeds greater than
250 miles per hour?
Like the baffling Martian plumes,
conventional planetary science offers
no answers that withstand scrutiny.
However, in 2005, The Thunderbolts
Project offered a critical prediction
about dramatic dust
raising events on Mars.
The article 'When Dust
Storms Engulf Mars' states,
"Since Mars has no thunderstorms
to 'charge up its ionosphere,'
it should present a good case
study of the Electric Universe.
The electrical model predicts that the
Martian ionosphere is indeed charged,
and it posits no isolated
dynamo to 'separate charge.'
On Mars, electrical effects will reach
directly from the ionosphere to the surface
without the ameliorating leakage via
storm clouds that we see on Earth.
Unlike radiant
energy from the Sun,
electrical energy can accumulate in the
'planetary capacitor' for some time,
with a potential for planet-altering events
when the atmosphere finally 'breaks down'
and massive discharge
activity is initiated."
The Thunderbolts
Project noted in 2005
that, when the greatest storm on Mars began
in June of 2001, Mars had reached opposition
and was the closest it had been
to Earth in about 12 years.
We then suggest it is not a
coincidence that in March of 2012,
just days before scientists spotted
the enormous baffling Martian plumes,
Mars was again at opposition and was at its
closest proximity to Earth in over two years.
The Martian plumes resembled the fountains
of electrostatically levitated dust
hundreds of kilometers tall, first
observed on the moon in the 1960s.
Indeed, according to
a 2008 NASA report,
Earth's magnetic tail creates a powerful
electric field near the lunar surface
occasionally causing
dust storms on the Moon.
NASA scientist Tim Stubbs states,
"Earth's magnetotail extends well beyond
the orbit of the Moon and, once a month,
the Moon orbits through it.
This can have consequences ranging from lunar
'dust storms' to electrostatic discharges."
We also note that NASA
scientists have acknowledged
the electrified nature of
the giant Martian dust devils.
A NASA news report in
July of 2005 begins,
When humans visit Mars, we'll have to watch
out for towering electrified dust devils.
The article describes a typical dust
devil on Mars as a 'monster column'
towering kilometers high
and hundreds of meters wide,
ten times larger than
any tornado on Earth.
For decades, physicist Wal Thornhill and
others have proposed that dust devils,
tornadoes and water spouts are
all electric discharge phenomena.
We must also note that we cannot
say definitively at this point
that the Martian plumes are
composed of excavated dust.
However, planetary scientists must not
ignore the proven ability of electric fields
to levitate dust in a near vacuum
like the Martian atmosphere.
We cannot emphasize enough that
scientists are just beginning to recognize
the extraordinary electrical
environment of Earth
and of all planets and moons.
In 2012, scientists around
the world were astonished
by the discovery of giant electric
fields in Earth's radiation belts,
some more than 1
million volts strong.
Structures familiar to plasma physicists
called double layers in the outer belts
are said to be powerful enough to accelerate
electrons to near the speed of light.
With each new discovery, planetary
scientists move closer to recognizing
the electrical circuitry between
planets, moons and the Sun.
The electric currents that connect Jupiter
and Saturn to their respective moons
are now acknowledged
by NASA scientists.
It is therefore no coincidence that the so-
called 'volcanic plumes' of the Jovian moon Io,
and the so called 'geysers' of
the Saturnian moon Enceladus,
closely resemble the
baffling Martian plumes.
The Electric Universe does not call for
rewriting the known laws of physics.
Rather, we need only acknowledge the
undeniable significance of electricity
in our lives and
in all of nature.
We again remind scientists
that all matter is electrical,
and it is electrical connectedness
that drives the universe.

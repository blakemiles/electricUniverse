The Pulsating Universe
and Planet Earth
Okay well, hello everybody!
This is a real honor to be
participating in a historic conference.
Let's see.
So, 'The Pulsating Universe
and Planet Earth'.
So, right.
Right here we have the Crab Nebula which sends
out energetic pulses 30 times a second.
So I've chosen that as my iconic
image of the pulsating universe.
And here of course, we
have the Aurora Borealis
which is the electric
current coming into the earth
so that's my symbol of how
planet Earth is affected.
So, there are discharge events occurring
all the time on all kinds of scales,
on a whole range of
scales in the cosmos.
This one is
30 times a second.
Here we have a supernova remnant
so there was a supernova which sent
out a tremendous burst of energy
when it happened.
And here we have even larger
scale, this is a stellar nursery.
So we have a cathode object here which
is being impacted by an incoming current
and every one of those
strands is creating stars
so that's a huge scale
discharge event.
And all of these discharge events
are sending spikes of energy,
spikes of energy down
galactic currents.
Whatever current they're
on, gets a spike of energy
whenever there's
an event like that.
And those energy spikes
reach planet Earth.
Here is an image that,
here's Don Scott's image of the
Birkeland current that powers the Sun
so that current is going to get
its share of energy spikes.
And then those are passed on
to the earth proportionally
so the current coming into
the earth is a spiky current,
it's not a constant current.
It's going to get spikes whenever there's a
discharge event that is connected to our circuit.
And that's going
to cause heating.
So the reason we see
the Aurora Borealis
is because the ionosphere is
being heated to glow mode.
In this particular
report from THEMIS
they call it a hundred thousand
amps circuit coming in.
And I think on an earlier talk it
was an even larger amount of amps.
Doesn't really matter, it's a lot
of amps, that's what we care about.
And it's not just the,
I call this the entire ionosphere. I suppose
I should call it the plasmasphere
but the Van Allen belts,
these radiation belts,
that's because of current
flowing through them.
And that's being heated.
Plus the atmosphere is being heated by
discharge from the ionosphere to the surface.
It's like a 250,000 volt difference
between the ionosphere and the surface.
And these weather events are a
discharge across that potential.
So, the whole Earth system is being heated
by the current that flows through it.
The earth is basically a resistor
for this, for the current,
and resistors heat up
and it's proportional
to the current flow.
So that an energy spike is going
to create a heating spike.
So there's no question that the
earth is heated electrically,
the question is how
significant is that heating.
So to get a handle on whether
that has any significance to it,
let's take a look at
the climate record.
So what we have here is
the last 400,000 years
as recorded in the ice cores
in Antarctica, in Vostok.
I just downloaded this data from
the official website and charted it out.
So what we see is about every
100,000 years there's a major spike
and that's how
ice ages are ended,
and then we see little spikes
about every 10,000 years.
So basically the temperature
record is nothing but spikes.
There's no level periods,
it's all spikes.
And they are, and they occur
on a cyclical pattern.
So let's look at this,
let's talk about climate a little
bit while we have this slide here.
The earth is, 90% of the time,
is in what we call an ice age.
It's unusual to have
an interglacial period
so ice ages are normal.
And when we think about ice ages, we
think about people wearing skins,
hunting mastodons,
woolly mammoths.
Well that's not what
ice ages are like.
Yeah, there are more, a lot of the northern
hemisphere is covered with glaciers
but that doesn't mean
the earth is cold.
I mean, the difference between an ice age
and a non-ice age is only ten degrees.
A place like Phoenix would be much more
livable if it was ten degrees cooler.
And also because all the water
is taken up in the glaciers,
the sea level is about
200 meters lower
which means that what we call the
continental shelf becomes the shoreline.
So in the tropics it's more
livable and there's a lot more land.
So an ice age isn't, it isn't
really that the earth is cold.
It's just colder
but there's nothing to prevent life or
agriculture or civilization or anything else
during what we call an ice age.
So actually, ice ages are normal
and an interglacial
period is a crisis time
because of this huge
energy spike which ends it
and suddenly then all the
glaciers are melting
which means tsunamis
all over the world.
I should see what's next here.
Right, okay.
So now what we're going to do is we're going
to zoom in on the interglacial period.
So we're zooming in on
this little part here
and what do we see, more spikes!
So the heating pattern
of the earth is a fractal,
a spiky fractal pattern.
We're having spikes
at all scales
and that's what
a fractal pattern is.
It's very distinctive,
it's not random.
It's not at all random, it's a very distinctive
non-random pattern of cyclical spikes.
So what we have, we have fractal
energy spikes from the cosmos
and fractal heating spikes
in the temperature record
so basically we have a unique
fingerprint match between
heating caused by discharge
events and the cosmos.
So we have a pattern match
that that doesn't really,
but we don't know
about the magnitude.
I mean, it conceivably could be a
coincidence that the patterns are the same
so what we need is
some direct evidence.
Is there any direct evidence for
an electric effect on climate?
And there is, thanks
to Ben Davidson
because he showed
that solar activity,
variations of solar
activity are correlated,
strongly correlated with
significant climate change.
And variations in solar
activity are of course
due to fluctuations in the Birkeland
current that powers the Sun,
which is proportional to the
current that comes into the earth.
So, my hypothesis then is
that climate variation
is due to fluctuations in the
current flowing into the ionosphere.
Now, I really should say it's a current
flowing into the Earth's system
so it's not just the ionosphere,
it's the whole Earth system.
And I think it's a strong,
I mean, I've given a very
sketchy rendition of this,
but I think it's a
strong hypothesis.
But I think what's even,
so if we, if we have,
if this is what causes
climate variation,
of course, that's interesting
to know how something works
though what's even more interesting is
the implications of the hypothesis.
So here is the first implication
that we have a
seismograph basically,
or a voltage graph of
discharge activity into the past.
So this is a new window
onto the cosmos.
We can learn things from this
that we couldn't learn any other way.
And in particular
let's take a couple,
there we go.
We can, we can look for correlations
between heating spikes in the record
and things we can see, things
that we can see astronomically.
Like the Crab Nebula which was a pulsar,
it also, it's a supernova remnant.
And we know from
records that were kept
that that occurred in 1054 AD.
Well, that exactly matches
one of our spikes.
So what that would indicate is that the
spike of energy that caused the supernova
was the same spike that caused the
the heating spike on the earth.
Do you think what
causes the supernova?
Well, supernova happens when
the double layers break down.
What's going to break
down the double layers
is going to be a surge of
current which overloads them.
It's just like a circuit
breaker or a fuse.
If you put too much current
through it, it goes.
And then here we have
the Vela supernova remnant
which astronomers tell us
happened 12,000 years ago
which is the spike that
ended the last ice age.
So again, of course you might say well
actually, it didn't occur 12,000 years ago.
The light got to us
12,000 years ago.
Well, what that's saying is that the voltage
spike got to us at about light speed
at the same time the light did.
Now, so that was one...
One implication of the hypothesis
is that we have this record
of this window onto the cosmos
basically like a seismograph.
There.
A second implication of the hypothesis is that
discharges seem to be always cyclical.
Now we know with pulsars that
the discharges are cyclical
because it happens fast
enough that we can observe it.
But we would have no
way of guessing that
other that 100,000 year discharges are cyclical
or 1000 year discharges are cyclical.
So we're getting information
about the cosmos
that we really couldn't
get any other way.
I really, by the way, while we're on,
while we, I should've really said this
when this particular
chart was bigger.
This is a good time to talk
about this global warming nonsense.
Notice starting about 1000 BC,
we have a heating spike of about
a degree or degree and a half.
And then we have another
one at Year Zero.
And another one at AD 1000.
So every thousand years...
So, at 0 and at 1000 we got this
one or one and a half degree rise.
Now this particular
chart stops at 1800.
So what would you
expect to have next?
Well, we'd expect a one or one and a half
degree rise peaking in the year 2000
which is exactly what we got.
So yes indeed, there's been two
centuries of global warming
and it's completely natural.
Now the next implication, the
third implication of the hypothesis
is that ice ages are ended by
an electrical energy spikes.
Not a collision with an asteroid,
not orbital variations, not volcanoes,
it's an energy spike.
Now, in the ice age we have
glaciers that are miles high
and they melt in less
than a thousand years.
I mean, this chart is Vostok
and it looks like
that's a steep spike
but actually there's another chart
which I unfortunately didn't include,
and it shows that the
the northern hemisphere
came out of the last ice age much quicker
than the southern hemisphere did.
If you effect, if we stretch out the
graph starting at 50,000, starting back here
and we bring in Greenland,
suddenly this spike that looks so
steep, it becomes a gradual ascent.
And the one in Greenland
is really steep
so like the glaciers melted in
less than a 1000 years.
Now what, how much electrical
energy would it take
to melt the glaciers
in such a short time?
So what we have then is the interglacial
spike is rising in intensity for centuries
and that's what
melts the glaciers.
Well, what would that
mean for the rest of the...
What effect could that have on the rest of
the solar system and the other planets?
That intense amount of energy.
So what we're getting is a constantly
increasing potential in the heliosphere.
So that the potential difference between
the Sun and the heliopause is rising,
that potential difference
is rising for centuries.
So that's going to, what
could that lead to?
Well, the first thing
that's going to happen
is there's going to be extreme
planetary weather events.
Because, I mean, now we have
250,000 volt difference,
and we're now at the
quiescent top of the spike.
But while that spike was rising,
then that potential gradient
between the ionosphere and the
surface is going to be always rising
so you're going to have amazingly
powerful weather events.
Now, we also know from
the electric model
that planetary spacing is
electrically determined
and I mean, just this morning
Wal was telling us that if the,
if you had twice the
voltage gradient,
the planets would
be twice as far.
So we're going to get, planetary
orbits are going to be shifted.
And we're going to have violent
interplanetary discharges.
So what we're going to
have for centuries then is,
oops let's go back,
we're going to have the
Thunderbolts of the Gods
going on for centuries
every 100,000 years.
So, now obviously this is,
this is different than what the Saturn
capture hypothesis says right now
and it would be really good if we could
somehow reconcile the ice core record
with the Saturn
capturing hypothesis.
And conceivably, that
could be done if,
if this huge spike
which ends the ice age,
what if it turns Saturn
temporarily into a brown dwarf?
Say, now of course I'm
totally speculating here,
it's way over my head
on what's possible.
But I can't,
it's not easy to just
dismiss the ice core record
because there are other temperature records
like for instance in the Caribbean
you can look back at temperatures based on
what kind of sea shells were being deposited
and what kind of species could
survive on what temperature
so there are, there are corroborations
for the ice core record.
We can't just totally dismiss it
and we certainly can't dismiss
all the wonderful things
that David and
others have discovered.
So it'd be nice if those two
things could be reconciled.
Anyway, to summarize,
we not only have a
pulsating universe,
we have a rhythmically
pulsating universe
because the spikes are
always occurring in cycles.
So climate is Gaia dancing
to cosmic rhythms.
And the last slide
is if we compare the interglacial
temperature record to a clip of Irish music,
we can see that these discharge
events that caused these spikes,
those are the instruments
of the cosmic orchestra.
So, thank you very much!

Order Out of Chaos
Dwardu Cardona (presented by Wal Thornhill)
I was pleased when Dwardu asked
me to do his presentation
I've done this once before in
London, when he couldn't attend
but I'm pleased because
Dwardu's work I've followed avidly
since the 70's when he published in
Pens√©e and then following that in Kronos
and his work fascinated me
because it was well documented
it was extremely well researched and
it provided me with the raw material
that I needed, the input, the data, I
needed to try and figure out what happened
and then to try and explain
it in terms of Science
and as I found, science need a great
revision to be able to withstand
the input from Dwardu, I mean a sis-
kebab of planets is a hell of a challenge.
So, I'm very pleased to be able to present
his presentation called Order Out of Chaos.
According to various translations of the
Old Testament an entity named Elohim
is said to have been responsible for
the creation of heaven and Earth.
This is not only being one of the most
revered dogmas of the Judeo-Christian faith
it is likewise to be found at the root of
just about all religions, old and new.
it's interesting...
I think this is one of the problems of
compatibility between picture files
because there is or there was last night
when I looked at it on my computer
a picture of Marinus van der Sluijs, he's
down here and we'll be presenting later.
So, anyway, Marinus van der Sluijs
has gone on record in stating that
not all mythology is creation
mythology, which is quite true.
Even so as Fred Bratton
rightly stated,
creation myths are the most
widespread of all myths.
That picture worked.
David Talbott hit the nail right on
the head when he additionally wrote
that a review of the oldest versions
of creation will show that few,
if any mythical themes have
been more misunderstood.
The only thing I will add is
that this does not only apply
to the oldest versions of creation,
but just about to all of then.
One complicated problem that this involves
is that these myths are believed to refer
to the creation of the Earth or
what is even worse, the Universe.
One need not be the proverbial
rocket scientist to realize that man
who was not around when Earth came to
being could not have seen it form.
Let alone the Universe!
Why then, as David
Talbott noted,
did ancient man describe creation as if he
had seen it unfold with his very own eyes?
Most people might find it hard to believe,
but as far as ancient sources are concerned
reports of the creation that unraveled
out of nothing are somewhat rare.
As Stephen Langdon rightly
noted, in Sumerian mythology,
which constitutes the earliest recorded
samples of traditional law at our disposal,
there is no evidence of the considered
theory of the creation of the world.
If by the world is meant
the Earth on which we live.
Similar examples can also be found in
the literature of latest civilizations
from the same general region and additionally
vouched for those who came later.
Thus, sometime in the first century BC
the Sicilian historian, Diodorus Siculus,
could write that the Chaldeans say that
the substance of the world is eternal
and that it neither
had a first beginning
nor that it will at a later
time suffer destruction.
In India, Jain doctrine contains that the
world is uncreated as so is time itself
both of which are without
beginning or an end.
And while there is more than
one version of creation
to be found in the intricate
mythology of Hinduism
few of them actually claimed that the
world had been created out of nothing.
The Roman poet Lucretius was adamant
that even when it comes to divine power
nothing can be created
out of nothing.
What can we, however, say
about more ancient times.
Was primitive man capable of realizing that
the world he lived in had always been there?
Was such a sophisticated concept really
beyond the mentality of ancient man?
We cannot unfortunately
trespass beyond historic times,
but we can extrapolate from the traditional
law of presently existing tribal groups.
And, as it turns out, the concept of a non
beginning was not beyond the comprehension
of some of the world's
primitive cultures.
Thus, all over Polynesia,
Micronesia and Melanesia,
including the Hawaiian
Islands and New Zealand,
the upper or heavenly world and the terrestrial
world are thought to have existed forever.
Creation, according to most
Australian Aborigines,
merely molds or molded
what was already there.
The idea that the land may once not have
existed seems quite simply unimaginable.
One can hardly find a race more
different from the natives
of the Pacific Islands and Australia
than the Eskimos of the Arctic regions.
And yet they too held to similar
beliefs, although there was disagreement
among these Arctic people concerning the
manner in which the world had been formed
a fair portion of these indigenes continue
to believe that it always had been there.
So likewise with the primitive
ancestors of the Tongas in Siberia
who were also of the belief that what is
usually mistranslated as the universe
had always been around.
If such primitive cultures could
grasp the philosophical notion
of there having been no
Genesis to existence
so could our ancient ancestors
come to the realization
prior to the sophisticated civilizations
that rose in the fertile crescent,
the Nile Valley, the islands of Greece
and elsewhere around the world.
Even so, creation was believed, by some,
to have transpired out of nothing
just as in Christianity
it still is.
Most of these beliefs, however, are
based on a series of misinterpretations
one of which concerns the
mistaken belief that Elohim
created whatever he did
create out of nothing
which is neither stated nor
even implied in Genesis.
As it happens, ancient man more than hinted
at a pre-existing, even if chaotic, substance.
Obadi Kim from India
states that this all,
which is often misconstrued to mean the
universe, was indiscriminate chaos.
As it is there maintained, all that
existed then was void and formless.
Void and formless it might have been,
at least in the eyes of ancient man,
but it still existed.
Thus the Laws of Manu rightly inform
us that, despite being without form,
the world or what was later
miss comprehended as the world
was believed to have
already been in place.
Half a world away, the Incan God Veracocha
was burdened with regional variations
of the manner in which he
had said about creation.
And yet in all these variations he
always comes out as a God Creator
who intervened in a world that was already
in existence even if still an organized.
Veracocha's role was to
transform chaos into cosmos,
and since cosmos originally meant
order, harmony or an orderly arrangement
it can be said that creation consisted
in the formation of order out of chaos.
As it has been attested, all of these creations
were mere arrangements of existing matter
rather than creations
out of nothing.
The main pre-existing item from which creation
was said to have unfolded was the May em.
Usually translated as waters
over which the so-called spirit of
Elohim him is said to have
moved prior to creation.
The validity of this inference is evidenced
by the fact that nowhere in Genesis
is Elohim said to have
ever created the May em
nor is this concept to be
found only in Genesis.
The Babylonian version of creation,
known as the Enuma Elish,
is given in a series of
seven cuneiform tablets.
As in Genesis, the waters are given the
honor of having been the primordial element
and also as in Genesis they are proclaimed
to have existed before anything.
In Sumerian mythology, water is not
only said to have preceded creation
it was held to have been
responsible for it.
Thus in a tablet that contains a list of
deities we encounter the goddess whose Nammu
whose name is written with
the ideogram for sea.
And it is this Nammu that is
this sea that was described as
the mother who gave birth
to heaven and Earth.
As elsewhere, the origin of this
primeval sea is not accounted for.
The Egyptian myth of creation also
ascertains that water and chaos
were the pre-existing elements from which
creation was said to have developed.
Let it not be thought that we
are making too much of this
through a survey of myths dealing
with creation from around the world
it is easily recognized that one of
the most noticeable of motives is,
in practically all of them, is the idea that
what is usually misconstrued as the universe
unfolded out of chaos,
from primeval water.
We must, however, travel away from
the preachings of the biblical world
if we wish to illustrate the
universality of this team.
In India we encounter one version
out of many in which Narayana
lifelong ages floating on the
primeval waters we've been discussing
before proceeding to
create what, as usual,
has unfortunately been
misconstrued as the universe.
Later myths ascribed
creation to Brahma,
who is said to have
hatched from a cosmic egg
as it lay floating on the
same primeval waters.
So similarly outside brahmanic India
among the nation's other tribes
we come across the belief that in the
beginning nothing existed, but the waters.
Among the Eskimos of Alaska, or
the Inuit as they are now called,
we also find a creation myth that presupposes
the preexistence of a watery abyss
from which all existence
came into being.
Farther south, but still
in North America,
creation out of water continue to
be told by most Amerindian nations
thus the Hopi have for long insisted
that the creator gathered, something,
from endless space that later
manifested as the waters.
So also was the sea, but one
that floated through space
said to have already been in
existence when the Hearon deity,
known as the spirit of all,
commenced on his creation.
Likewise among the Iroquois
with the same spirit of all
was already in possession of
the gentle swishhing waves
from which to create whatever
needed to be created
but according to the Yuma this is how
it all began, there was only water,
then out of the waters rose a mist but
deep down in the waters lived the creator.
It is the same in Central America where
we come across Nahuatl creation myths
in which the primordial substance
also seems to have been water.
Although the Mayan Popol Vuh describes
creation in a rather convoluted manner
is still describes the original
state of the heavens as a void
with what has been translated as the
tranquil sea already in existence.
Thus the creator was described as having
being in the heart of the still dark sky
and in the heart
of still dark sea
or in the depths of the water
in which he seemed to shimmer.
Following the Mayan, the Azteks
were no different in this respect
according to them the world was a
huge flat space surrounded by the sea
and at a certain point the sea
curved up to become the sky.
The upper air consisted
of sky waters
I could go on and add much more to the
list, but I believe I've made my point.
The question that all this raises is,
why did ancient man resort to the idea
of a world having been created
out of a watery chaos?
Why water, why chaotic water?
And why was it not thought necessary that
this water should also have been created?
In Egypt not only was the creation believed
to have unfolded out of the primeval water
the creator was himself believed
to have risen from the water.
In digging deeper, however, we find out
that as far as the Egyptians were concerned
it was actually the
creator himself
who was the very waters out of reach
creation was said to have unfolded
moreover the rising of the
creator out of these waters
was accompanied by the shading of
light from that very source.
In fact, as with other ancient
civilizations, this form the very
starting point of all conjectures
relating to creation.
This first burst of light is congruent
with the light that was said to be
shed by Elohim in the very
first lines of the book of Genesis.
Throughout the years it remained emphasized
in rabbinic belief that creation
was made possible by the advance of the
primordial light into the darkness of chaos.
In Egypt, the god Osiris was likewise acclaimed
as the sheder of the primordial light
but then a spell from the pyramid
texts towards the same Osiris
as having been synonymous with
the sea and or the ocean.
That this watery chaos or primordial
ocean was celestial in origin
is evidenced by being referred to
as the watery abyss of the sky.
Even the great god Ra or Re was known as
the god of the great celestial waters.
So similarly in Hindu mythology
according to which the god Varuna
is not only said to have appeared
in the seas gathered waters
and have been crowned by Brahma
as the lord of the waters
but to have been
himself the waters.
As to be expected when such
waters are equated with the god
this particular sea or ocean
was located in the sky.
But who or what then
was this creator?
Primitive as they
might have been
and long after the migration from
their original Northern homeland
the Kawesqar Indians of southern Chile
continue to remember the creator
as having being Xolas which
name translates as star
and they were right on the mark.
But let's backtrack a little,
one particular item that has confused
mythologists throughout the years
is the identity of the creator
in most of the ancient world
as the God of the planet Saturn.
Indeed as David Talbot noted, the
consistency with which astronomers identify
Saturn as the former creator
king is extraordinary.
Cutting straight across the lawn I need
to only point out one of the best-known
creators in the Western world the one
referred to in the book of Genesis
as it is their stated, in the beginning
God created the heaven and the Earth
the Hebrew word that has been
translated as God, however, is Elohim
which is the majestic plural of
the Semitic deity know as El.
The Greek transliteration of this name is
Helios the very good that Philo of Byblos
proclaimed to have been the same as Kronos
which was the Greek name for Saturn.
Besides Philo of Byblos other classical sources
as well as inscriptions in Greek and Latin
all establish the identity
of a El as the Greek Kronos.
The same as the
latin Saturnus.
William Albright was therefore right
on track when he identified El
as the Latin Saturnus,
without much ado.
I point next to the Zoroastrian
myth in which Zurvan was said
to have provided or emitted
the original unformed matter.
This ancient deity was
regarded as the first principle
the original seed and the
father of the cosmos
and yet once again as we learn
from various ancient texts
Zurvan was also identified as Kronos
the Greek god and planet Saturn.
In ancient Chinese sources chaos
is equated with the being known as
Huangdi the Yellow
Emperor of dim antiquity.
In different versions of the myth this
yellow Emperor was responsible for
having brought in order to the Elemental
Chaos as the beginning of creation.
Huangdi, however, also originated as a
cognomen of the Saturnian planetary god.
The Huangdi was regarded as the creator,
it's also well known and that is tantamount
to proclaiming that creation was the
work of the Saturnian planetary deity.
By the time of the Greeks and Romans,
to say nothing of those who came later,
the conception was so ingrained
in the minds of scholars
and those of religious disposition that they
could spell it out in no uncertain terms.
Thus, in that mysterious work of this popularly
known as the "Great Magical Papyrus" of Paris
the Greeks actually
addressed Kronos outright
as the founder of the
whole world we live in.
Among the Romans the god Janus was
considered a god of beginnings
and described an essential
role in creation.
This same Janus was also known as the chaos out
of which creation was said to have unfolded
and yet as Alexander Hislop noted Janus
is easily identifiable as Saturn
and so likewise down
into modern times.
Although mainly whole was more
concerned with mystical philosophy
then he was with the verity
of mytho historical content
he was as David Talbott notice
till cognizant of the fact
that the planet Saturn looms as
the elementary power of creation.
Despite all that, the creative was not merely
planetary since the planet in question
had formerly been a brown dwarf
star in close proximity to Earth
before it degenerated into the gaseous
planet we now know as Saturn.
It was in the early 1940's that
Immanuel Velikovsky posited
that the planet Saturn had once
been much larger than at present.
Although he turned to be out to
be an error on many an issue
he was definitely vindicated
on this particular one.
That the planet Saturn is the relic of what
had previously been a brown dwarf star
is now an accepted tenet
of mainstream astronomy.
As Maria Zapatero Osorio reported
at the turn of the present century
in time the evolving brown dwarf stars
will look like Jupiter and Saturn
and as other astronomers found reason to
state at around the same time
sub-brown dwarfs give us a golden opportunity to
see what Jupiter and Saturn were like in the youth.
What the scholarly world also had
to finally admit is that humanity
has known and has kept track of the
planet Saturn since prehistoric times.
As far as we're concerned this would
not have been all that difficult
since our hypothesis demands that
Earth was actually a satellite
of this proto-Saturnian dwarf star
which loomed large in close proximity.
It was in effect Earth's primordial Sun in a
system that had originally been floating
freely outside the demarcation
of the present solar system.
As Vladimir Damgov amongst
others has indicated
brown dwarf generate enough heat to shine,
but only dimly and in infrared light.
They also radiate in the ultraviolet
spectrum that together with the infrared
would have been needed for the
inception and sustenance of life.
Proto-Saturn that were there before have been
hotter than the planet that it is at present
and to be sure it has not yet had enough time
to eliminate all of its primordial heat.
Even after the Cassini spacecraft had
time to study the planet at close quarters
Saturn was still being claimed to be a
world that is hotter than it should be.
Brown dwarf stars have also been discovered
to be surrounded by circumstellar disks
identical to, even if much smaller than,
the ones that are detected around stars.
Judging the water our ancient ancestors
passed on to their descendants
such a circumstellar disk was
remembered as having surrounded
their primordial proto-Saturnian
Sun as a nebulous entity.
Needless to say ancient man had no way of
knowing what this nebulosity really was.
In ancient Hebraic
nomenclature this nebulosity
ended up as the Tohu wa-
bohu of the book of Genesis
which phrases traditionally translated as
without form and void or voidable empty
in relation to whatever it was
Elohim was said to have created.
Tohu wa-bohu, however, can
also mean out of chaos
which conforms with the chaos that
presided as the ruling principle
before creation in various
ancient cosmogonies.
Among the Chinese the same
chaotic or nebulae cloud
said to have revolved without
fail became known as Tao.
In North America the Iuke spoke
of this fog and or foam
that was said to have moved
round and round continually
which fog was also described
by certain tribes in Indonesia
to the Pima it was like a fluffy
bit of cotton in the breeze
to the Phoenicians it was
M√¥t which is normally
translated as mud that
can also connect water
which conforms with the source from which
creation was said to have unfolded.
This revolving chaotic fog or foam
is not a species way in which
our primitive forefathers chose
to describe the indefinable world
that was seen circling
around the nearby Sun.
That under certain conditions
and scintillating eliminations
elimination such a nadie could also
mean visualize the swirling water
a whirling ocean is all
also understandable.
This is brought into prominence by the
Heliopoliten system in ancient Egypt
in which the immense chaos
that existed in the beginning
was believed to have been a celestial ocean
in which the germs of creation lay embedded.
And since creation was vouched to have
sprung out of the celestial sea
it can be stated to be developed out
of proto-Saturnus circumstellar disk
moreover very much like stars
which in fact they truly are
brown dwarf stars are also known
to flare up in an intensity
that to say the least is taken
astrophysicist by surprise.
If we are now to believe
that the mytho-historical record
after having shown dimly
in the sky for untold ages
Earth's primordial proto-Saturnian Sun
also flared up in a blinding light
to their ancient ancestors remembered
as the inception of creation.
This was the Fiat Lux, the let there be
light that is said to be shared by Elohim.
No Earthly description will ever do this
event and all that followed justice.
We who did not see it will never
be able to fully appreciate
the impact it must have had
on the primitive human psyche.
Were something similar to
occur in the present sky,
and granted that we would survive it, we
would now view it with scientific eyes
Our primitive forefathers had no science capable
of explaining that overpowering event.
All they had at their disposal
was fear, reverence and awe.
Following the sheding of
the light it became apparent to our
forefathers the Sun above them
had changed its appearance.
Not only had it suddenly
become much brighter
it also seemed to be slowly
organizing its surroundings.
Due to proto-Saturn's
plasmatic paroxysmal eruption
its circumstellar disk
had compactly shrunk
leaving a wide gap between its
inner edge and its stellar orb.
There will be those who will
hate what all this leads to,
but as Talbott expressed
it when asked what it was
that our ancient forefathers
meant by creation,
he replied that the idea
is remarkably simple.
The creator fashioned a celestial
band or circle around himself
and this band became
his cosmic dwelling.
Basically that's all
there is to it.
Judging by the very words
that our ancestors utilized
that is exactly what they
attempted to describe.
As is widely known, the climactic
entity of Elohim's creation
went down into Western thought
as the garden East of Eden.
In reality, however, the
book of Genesis states that
Elohim planted the garden
eastward in the Eden
and I stress the word
in rather than of.
But even that is
a mistranslation
since the Hebrew word translated as
eastward actually means ancient.
And the phrase in question should be read as
'Elohim planted a garden in ancient Eden'
were 'Eden' translates as
a 'pleasurable place'.
The word translated as 'garden', however,
more correctly means 'an encircled area'.
The word is derived from the Akkadian
'gana' which refers to 'an enclosure'.
The Greek - that is Septuagint - version of the Old
Testament uses the word paradisos for 'garden',
which word is now rendered
into English as 'Paradise'.
This word is derived from a Persian one
that also translates as an enclosed area.
The same concept as aptly
illustrated through persian belief
which dictates that it was
Hima who ruled paradise
and he did so from an area known as a Vara
which he circumscribed with a golden ring.
Although I do not wish to stress it judging
by their resultant illustrations there
even these among modern artists who seem to have
understood this concept quite well.
Such for instance where William
Blake and his description
or depiction of the deity's
creative effort
and Giovanni Di Paolo
in his depiction
of the expulsion of Adam
and Eve from the garden,
both of them envision Elohim's created
effort as a circular enclosure.
Whether this resulted from mankind subdued
nostalgia I will leave others to decide.
I could go on forever and a day on this
particular subject but time does not permit.
Let me however clarify that,
and this is most important,
that following its abrupt
flare-up the proto-Saturnian Saturn
did not take long to develop a set
of radiant plasmatic beams
that continued to mesmerize
mankind to no end.
And although Talbott may have changed
his mind at least to an extent
on what the result amounted to, I present
the manner in which he pictured it
back in 1980 to which I
personally still hold.
It was this entire apparition that actually
went down as the deities ordered arrangement
out of the previous chaotic cloud
that had originally surrounded him.
And Dwardu says thank
you for listening.

During the Middle Ages in Italy, a
popular entertainment was from troops of
traveling actors presenting what they
called commedia dell'arte, the comedy of
the artists. They were satirical sketches
based on broad character types and they
are the predecessors of modern situation
comedies. The heroes of these plays were
the naive good-hearted lovers, the
country bumpkins and the wily street
smart trickster servants. The villains of
these plays were the greedy Venetian
merchants, the bravado-speaking,
Spanish captain, and the bombastic "Il
Dottore". They were all regional
stereotypes and they were making fun of
the Venetian merchants or the Spanish
soldiers or the university professors.
Il Dottore was from Bologna and he
received his doctorate there, which the
university of Bologna, famously
founded in the 11th century,
awarded only doctorates to its
graduates, and in those plays
Il Dottore would sound out long
bombastic gobbledygooky explanations of
minutiae. And it was a grand form of
comedy and again, a predecessor of our
modern American suspicions and
skepticism about intellectuals who have
spent too much time in their
ivory towers and lost touch
with reality. So today we
call such people full of
baloney, and that's where that expression
comes from. And I think what's
a big part, for me, of the excitement of
what we're exploring here with our
review and with the Electric Universe is,
coming out of that realm of baloney, back
down to more grounded natural philosophy
observation-based, experience-based
natural science that has a higher regard
for a little bit more of common sense. So
we've heard about mythology, it seems
absurd. You know, as Dave has suggested, we've
seen the efforts, the Il
Dottores of the modern era, right,
presenting their bombastic
arguments to uphold a theory
that doesn't seem to be tethered to
reality. So, we're going to continue
exploring how we tether some of these
wild ideas to something tangible and
concrete and the best way to get into
that is with the man who has spent his
time in engineering, electrical
engineering, and the study of
astrophysics, so we're going to conclude
tonight with Don Scott, bring him on the
stage. Good evening! As
my wife Annis told you,
I've been coming to these
meetings for many years
now and several years ago, we had at one
of our meetings a professional
astronomer who stood up on his hind legs
and said: yes, yes, yes, we know there's
electricity in the sky but
it doesn't do anything!
Well, I'm here tonight to tell you that
it does and I would like to explain a
few ways that, I think at least, that it
does do stuff, do things that are very
very important and have been
historically important to Earth and to
just about every other object in the
cosmos. So, if we can begin, this was
really the first proof, really,
I hate to use that word
but substantive indication
that electricity does indeed
flow in the sky. Kristian Birkeland was
a Norwegian scientist-explorer.
He went out under the Northern Lights on
the northern slopes of Norway and tried
to take data that would show that his
theory, and his theory was that those
Northern Lights, the Aurora Borealis and
of course the Aurora Australis as well,
are electrical in nature. And he
maintained that there were electrical
currents, the charged particles coming
through the sky and going down into, this
picture shows Earth right there, that's
the little blue dot of Carl Sagan fame.
And you can see there that in the
magnetosphere there are these, what I
call lily-shaped cusps, and Birkeland
claimed that the charges would come
across from the Sun and then pair down
into the two cusps at the two poles.
And well, he was dogged for years by
astronomers who said that was insane. One
of them famously
was asked one time, did Birkeland's ideas
or his theories have any effect on your
work? And Sidney Chapman said no, of
course not. They were all wrong! Well, it
turns out that after we were able to
send rocket probes up into the
ionosphere just after World War II, we
found those currents and they're there.
Nowadays, astronomers will be willing
to call the currents that do come
down into those cusps -- Birkeland currents,
as they should be, and when I
talk about it, I talk about
that as a Birkeland current as
well. They don't like to do
that. They talk about flux ropes
and other sort of airy-fairy
descriptions, they are beginning to try
to not talk about the
word Birkeland. The Birkeland currents, and
you can see there at the bottom of
that lotus funnel, that they are squeezed
together. They do come in sheaths, that is
to say concentric sheaths of current and
current goes both ways on those sheaths.
At the very bottom, of course,
is the Aurora and the
classic astronomy people... I put
the word Birkeland current
on there, but you notice on the diagram
itself, that I got from one of the
astronomy sites, doesn't have the word
Birkeland at all. If you look carefully, it
talks about Peterson currents down there.
Just earlier this year, in 2014, there
was an announcement that galaxies
actually are formed on strings,
delicate strings.
Well, I maintain that those strings are
electrical currents and these electrical
currents have been found by radio
telescopes, I'm consulting my notes, at
326 megahertz between the Coma Cluster
and the Abel 1367 cluster, these long
strings of Birkeland currents do indeed
exist and they have been calculated,
because of the strength of the
surrounding magnetic fields,
that those currents have a magnitude of
somewhere in the order,
get ready for this, of 1019 amperes.
We're talking big currents and they do
indeed exist and they do connect stars
within galaxies and they
do connect galaxies in
intergalactic space. The currents
that we see and can take
pictures of, sometimes
they're quite jagged,
sometimes they're
quite, quite beautiful.
That looks like a ballerina to me but
it's maybe because there've been too many
glasses of wine, I don't know. But other
times they're quite straight, quite
regular. There's an example of a very, I
think, a very regular current. I wouldn't
call it a Birkeland current
because many people
disagree with me, one of my
best friends disagrees with me. I
think that a Birkeland current is
different from a force-free current.
Force-free current in space is a current
that is going along undisturbed, but any
current anywhere will create a magnetic
field. And so, that current in space will
create a magnetic field through
which it itself has to pass.
And if it does that, there's
guaranteed, there's going to be a
force called a Lorentz Force, which
depends on the cross-product
between the current density
and the direction of the
magnetic field. And if there is a force,
it's like you know, kids in a school bus,
you're trying to get them down
to the party or the lake or the
convention or whatever you are taking
them, and they're fighting and boisterous,
and eventually if the bus driver is good
enough, you'll get them to shut up and
sit down in the back and keep quiet.
That's the way I think of one of these
Birkeland currents. A force-
free Birkeland current is one
in which the internal stresses
and strains and forces
and pushes and pulls have been
yielded to. In nature, you know, we
always hear this thing about water flows
downhill, water will seek, things will go
to a lower level if you let them. Well,
that's what's happening, in my opinion, in
these cosmic currents that
are left alone. They reduce
themselves to a force-free
minimum energy, not zero energy,
because obviously there is current in
that, this is far from a force-free
current by the way, because
it's a very powerful Birkeland
current really. But eventually, it
will settle down to that force-free
state. I should say that the force-free
current consists of the current
density and the magnetic field. The
magnetic field and the current are in
the same direction. So, if I speak of the
current, I'm talking about the magnetic
field and vice versa. What's happening
here in that you can see that twisted
helix. There is a magnetic field
component that's axial that goes in the
same direction as the current and one
that wraps around. And after doing some
studying on that, I came up with a model.
Unfortunately, the model that I came up
with and I was very proud of, I just found
out a couple of days ago, was already
derived by another gentleman whose name
was Stig Lundqvist. Stig Lundqvist, I
think, was a friend of Hannes Alfven in
Sweden, and he derived this model for the
force-free current. He called it a
Birkeland current. What you're seeing here,
it's not, it's very complicated looking,
but the red line, the big one, is the
power, the force, the strength of the
magnetic field that is in line with the
direction of the current. The second
curve, and I don't know if you can see it,
it sort of peaks out here. It's
a greenish one. Forget the
third curve, it doesn't mean
anything, but that second
curve is the strength of the wraparound
magnetic field. So, out of all that
complex up-and-down, what do I want you
to remember? What I'd like you to
remember is that where the red curve,
that is the strength of the magnetic
field along in the
direction of the current,
it goes through a zero,
see it right there, if
I can hold my old shaky hand steady,
this is zero there of that
magnetic field in the direction of the
current. At that point, the wraparound
field is at, or pretty close to its
maximum. The first one isn't
quite exactly on, but the
rest of them are. When the red curve goes
through zero, the green curve is at
either a positive or negative maximum. So
what does that mean?
Well, I got a couple of pictures here
that try to show you what it means. The
blue field colors, the field-colored arrows
are the magnetic field as a function of,
if we back off away from from the axis
of the current, so the first
picture there is what the magnetic field
looks like right down on this, on
the axis, right on this. It's almost in
the center of the Birkeland current. It's
straight.
There is no wraparound field. Remember in
that picture, the red thing is way up,
the red curve is way at the top,
but the wraparound field hasn't gotten
started yet. Well, if you pull it back a
little bit away, pull back a little
farther, like to step number two there,
you can see that the
wraparound component has begun
to be seen, the straight
component is getting weaker, and
eventually you get to a point, well,
somewhere between shot three and shot
four, where the only magnetic field
you have is a wraparound. In fact, what
happens and I won't bother with a further
detail of that, well, unless... That's sort
of, I don't know if that gives
you a feeling of the wrapping
that happens. The, as you're
close to the axis, the
magnetic field is in the direction
of the current and then
it begins to twist and it begins
to come back this way and
eventually will go back that way
and in fact it will wrap in all
directions around the current, main
current stream, much like a Roman fasci.
The old Roman fasci, the fascist symbol.
You take a bunch of reeds that are in by
themselves very breakable, very, very
tender, very bendable, and if you push
them all together and then wrap them
with leather in a spiral, and then, when
you get up, wrap them
back the other way in leather and then
wrap them this way in leather and then
wrap them back the other way in leather,
eventually if you do this enough times,
you get something that's as strong as a
steel beam. That, I maintain, it makes
sense to me at least, is one of the
reasons why we do indeed see these
cosmic currents, they're called stellar
jets that are in almost an
absolute straight line and last
collimated, they don't spray
out like a garden hose, but
they last for well, there's the one out
of M86 is five thousand light years long.
And it's just a plain stream of
electrical current in space. So, that is
the picture of, at these very, what
should I say, discrete radii. And those
numbers there are just arbitrary. But it
gives you a feeling for the fact that
the first one out, the one that happens
at 33, the radius of it is 33, is a
clockwise spin. Then you go
out to the next one, it's
counterclockwise. And you go out to the
next one, it's clockwise. Then
counterclockwise, then clockwise. So, that
wrapping, I won't bore you with the
details of it, but it's, what I think, is one
of the most important properties of the
force-free current. There is no, in these
force-free currents, there is no
matter concentration, you don't get what
you see in the Birkeland current there,
those double sheaths as they came down
into the North Pole of the Earth. That
doesn't happen here and even my
critical good friend and I think, we'll
say the same thing, there is no matter
separation, no matter concentration in a
force-free current.
But, what can give you matter
concentration is the so-called famous
magnetic pinch or z-pinch. There is
also a different type of the z-pinches,
a theta-pinch as well. And what happens,
you can see there, the blue is the
go-around type of magnetic
field, the red is supposedly
the current. If the magnetic
field gets stronger,
it's like tightening your belt. It
squeezes. It squeezes it and squeezes
it. And eventually, if it squeezes it so
far, there is liable to be a reaction. And
the, that is a very famous picture, if
you've been here before at all. I'm sure
you've probably seen me or somebody, Wal
or someone put that on there. The
image on the left is a real
astronomical image. It's the
Ant Nebula. It's well known. The
middle one, I think you'll
recognize, is essentially an indication
that what I'm telling you is not
fairytales. That this pinch effect really
does happen and if you, what was
done in the laboratory is to put
a tremendously high current
pulse down through that
conducting aluminum can, and
the current going down made a wraparound
magnetic field which squeezed the can. And
that's exactly, you can do it with a
stream of water from the kitchen faucet
as well. If you pass a current
down through the water, you
can actually squeeze the
stream. Let me tell you what
I see in here and maybe it's like
looking at that and seeing that
ballerina earlier. I hope it isn't, I
think it's real. What I see when I look
at this picture of the ant
nebula is, I see one of these
currents and I see that here
at the upper end of it,
the current, the plasma is not too
visible. It's sort of been getting into
the darkish mode where you don't see
things. And as you should come closer to
the center of it, as you come closer to
the site of the the z-pinch,
the plasma gets brighter
and of course changes
shape. And I think
that that's exactly
what, the mechanism that causes the ant
nebula is the one that crushed the Pepsi
can. So, it's a z-pinch on a cosmic
current that does that. There's another
diagram. It, sort of, shows it. The idea
here is that, if the z-pinch is a
relatively mild pinch, it can produce
those magnetic field lines that actually
hold and give stability to
the current. Stronger z-pinches can
initiate a discharge or a short
circuit. Here's... Sorry, I'm a
professor, I got to put a graph
of something like this on
the board every time I talk.
What this is, is in a plasma.
I'll pick a point. Go to that, I don't
know whether that exit sign is a plasma
or not, but go to the typical, you know,
sign. It says, eat at Joe's, you know, go
into that neon sign, go into the center
of that tube and you're in the middle of
a plasma. At every point in the middle of
a plasma, there are really two important
qualities. One is what's the electric
field there. By that I mean, what is the
force per unit charge. You've got a
positive ion sitting there in the middle
of this thing. What is the force on him?
Is it a strong force, a high E-field,
or is it a low force, a low E-field.
That's .., pick a point, anywhere in
the diagram. At the end of it, like
 the letter “n” there, that says
that the force on it, on a
point in the plasma at that
point is sort of medium. It's
not way up here and it's not
way down there. The other important
quality or quantity associated with
any point in a plasma is the current
density. That says, in your neighborhood
how many amps, how many amperes are going
past you, how many amperes are going through
every square meter, let's say. Every
cross-sectional unit area. If you have a
lot of amperes going through
a plasma, and the plasma is very big, very
wide, then that doesn't mean that
the current density is very high,
because if the cross-sectional area is
big, well, then you can get a lot of
amperes through there without squeezing.
If the cross sectional area of
the current is smaller, then of course
the current density is higher. And so, you
would take that point at the end
and stick it over here, or over here.
And there are really three main modes of
operation of a plasma, (there is going to be an exam
at the end of the week) OK.
The dark mode, you can't see it. The
ionosphere of the Earth is in dark
mode. You know it's there because you can
bounce radio signals off it, but
it's not visible. Except in the aurora,
when it jumps from being in the dark
mode to being in the glow mode and it
glows and you can actually see it. So the
difference between a plasma in the dark
mode and a plasma in the glow
mode is one simply of current
density. So if there's a lot of
amps running through
this thing, and at the bottom of that
funnel you've really compressed
that current cross-section of
that cosmic current, and so the density,
current density goes up. And I maintain
that the center of one of these like the
Ant Nebula have also gone and popped
into the arc mode. And that's that
bright star-like arc, maybe it is a
star, maybe it is the beginning in
the cosmos of a new star. I would like to
say one thing. I don't know if there are any of
SAFIRE people here or whatever, but
I've heard people say, we've looked at
this plasma and we don't see any
arc in there at all. There's
no arc discharges in there. A
lot of people confuse the
word arc. Arc has two meanings.
One is a jagged lightning
bolt, lightning bolt
discharge. It's an arc discharge,
that's true. But not all arcs are
lightning bolts. If you look into the arc
light of a motion picture projector (in a
typical motion picture camera) a motion
picture projector in the theater,
you've got two electrodes that
come together, and an arc is
struck. You pull those electrodes
apart and what you get is not anything
that looks like a lightning bolt, which
it looks like a sheet of flame.
So arc discharges are arc
discharges not because of
their shape, the lightning
bolt shape. They're arc discharges because
of what they emit. And the one big
difference between the
arc discharge and the glow mode
discharge is that the arc discharge, well
you know if you've, anyone has
done any electric arc welding, the
copious amounts of ultraviolet. If you
look at an arc welder, an arc
welder is a perfect example. If you look
at an electric arc welder between
the tool and the workpiece, it’s
not a lightning bolt. It's like a
sheet of flame. The best arc welders look
like gas welders. I mean, they look like
flame. And so, you can't look at a plasma
with the naked eye nor should you,
if you think it's in a glow mode.
Never look at it with your naked
eye, you should use ultraviolet
protection. And if you want
to know if it's a plasma in
ultraviolet, is it in the arc or glow mode,
see if it's putting ultraviolet out.
Anyway, end of that mini lecture. There's
all sorts of things I can tell you about
that diagram. Well, one of the
interesting ones is number four down here,
is there are certain parts of this
diagram that have what's called a
negative slope. These are
positive slopes, they’re rising
with increasing current density.
But right in here is a
negative slope and certainly
in the arc mode, in the
beginning of the arc mode, there's a
negative slope. And that means if you're
a particle in a plasma and you're
sitting up here like right there
over there where that arrow
is, what are you sensing?
What's at your point? The answer
is, it's a reasonably high electric field.
You're pretty high up on
the axis here, but for
the glow mode, you're not in
particularly heavy current density. And
you say to yourself, gee, I don't like to
be pushed around, I don't like to have a
force on me.
Water flows downhill, right. So the
plasma will say, I can reduce the pushing
and pulling that I'm suffering by going
down the chute, down to here. Well,
how do I do that? Well, I move from left
to right and go down, I reduce the
electric field on me and I increase the
current density. Are you going to do that?
How is the plasma
going to reduce its
current density? Excuse me,
increase its current density;
It goes higher, right?
It automatically, I shouldn't say
it takes itself onto its own head
because it doesn't have a head but it
makes filaments. It says, why should I use
my whole area here to go down when
I can clamp down and make a filament
here and a filament here and nothing in
the middle? So, if you see a plasma in a
place like this, you will expect if it's
got a negative slope to it, that it will
form filaments. And so, I submit to you
that the reason that lightning bolts are
jagged, what you call lightning bolts, is
because they form filaments and there's
a natural tendency to filament here.
There's also a natural tendency to filament
here at the breakdown between dark
mode, where you don't see it, and glow
mode. You know what is a perfect example
of that? It's the outer regions of our
Sun's corona. If you ever looked at a
picture of the Sun in a solar
eclipse, you see the corona is very
bright around the Sun.
The farther out you get in the
corona, you see these
striations, these fingers
reach out and that's what's
happening there. So, OK, that's a mini
lecture on plasma. Why did I put you
through that? Well, because I'd like to
talk a little bit about what I think, at
least, happens in one of these pinches. If
you up the current, that's the red arrows,
you will up the B-field going around and
maybe you'll get a pinch. I'm
suggesting as a sort of an ideal
model that instead of crumpling
it up like the Pepsi can
crumpled up, let's say it
just sort of crunches down and what you
get from this point down to this point
is a cone, OK, can you see it getting
smaller? And then beyond the pinch
point out here, you're getting a widening
out cone, OK?
So what's happening as the
charges come in, as this current
comes in here? It may well be in the dark
mode if it's a minimum energy
current, a force-free current,
a field-aligned current, it
may be very quiet, quiescent
and be in dark mode, you might
not see anything. Remember in the Ant
Nebula out at the ends? You don't see
anything. So, it may well be that that's
dark mode plasma and as you get in, what
happens at the beginning of
the cone as the thing narrows
down, as you squeeze that
cross-section, you got the same
amount of current. I mean, you can't have
more current over here than you have
over here. It's in a wire, the
current's the same no matter where
in the wire you measure it. So if you
squeeze the wire down, it's same amount
of current going through the squeeze
point but you have a higher current
density. And on that previous slide
what happens when you increase the
current density you pop the plasma from
dark mode into glow mode and maybe into
arc mode as you get farther and farther
down that cone until finally right in
the middle,
I'm suggesting you get, if the thing
works like a picture I'm going to show
you in a minute, that is the arc, that is
an arc mode discharge. And what
happens is there's an arc mode discharge,
more possibly glow mode discharge
from both sides of this thing, this is
this crimp point. And they look like, I
tried to draw them in here in light blue,
they look like a pair of umbrellas,
umbrella shapes smooshed together. Sort
of like you take two torpedo shapes and
push them together so they smash in each
other's nose. You see,
there's one torpedo that goes around
this way and the other torpedo or
umbrella, more pacifistic than I am,
umbrella shaped thing goes around that
way. And the intersections of the
discharges with the shells of
conductive material are always at
right angles. Electric fields always
impinge on a conductor orthogonally,
straight in. They don't come in this way,
they come in straight down. And so if you
notice I've tried to draw the blue curve
orthogonal to the slope of the cone. You
see that? So what will happen here is
that the discharge, this curved
discharge will move out toward the left.
Why, because between this point and this
point, the voltage is the same as it is
between this point and this point and
therefore the electric field
between here and around this
way is higher, is a stronger
electric field than it would be
if you move the discharge out to,
let's say, around there. The discharge
would still come in perpendicularly to
the surface, OK, and you can say well,
gee, why do you beat your gums about
this, why is this so important?
Well, it's so important because
this is what happens in the z-
pinch. This is the important
mechanism by which we believe,
I believe certainly, that stars are
formed, and it's that crunch in the
middle that... It's not an accretion
disk. That across there, it may be a disc
that surface looks like a
circle, but it isn't an accretion disk.
It's a z-pinch disc and it's, that's
where the compression comes from. So, if
you ask the typical astronomer, you know,
what goes on in one of these pinches.
They know they exist. You will get that
as an answer. Um, I hope you folks
in the back can see it. Do you see the
labels on there? It says black hole,
accretion disk, and magnetic field lines.
There's no such thing as a magnetic
field line just like there's no such
thing as a line of constant altitude in
a topographical map. It's a very
convenient thing and it brings a lot of
information to the people who use it,
very useful, but it's not a real thing.
You shouldn't reify it into meaning
something real and astronomers have done
that with magnetic field lines and when
you, when they talk about reconnection of
these field lines, it's like they really
exist, you would grab this one
over here and stick it over
here and put them together.
There's no such thing. It's like
worrying about whether Pinocchio is
going to have a fight with his brother.
They don't exist.
So anyway, there is a real one. That, I
think, is one of Dave Talbott's favorite
words is archetype and that is my
archetype. That is the archetype z-pinch
and I'll point out some of the things
that are obvious and if you listen to me
carefully, I haven't put
you to sleep yet,
you'll realize what
I'm saying here. Look
down to the way down to the lower left
and way up to the upper right disappears.
That's right, because the plasma there is
in dark mode. But as you approach the
pinch, as you start squeezing down on
this, you pop that plasma, both ends of it
into the glow mode. So the greenish
things here, here, you can see.
You get less of the black
striae through it. The whole plasma goes
into glow mode. Here there's like
partially some of it's in glow and some is
in dark mode. But eventually up in here,
it all becomes glow mode. Also you see
two sheets, there's one sheath here and
an inner sheath. Remember that picture of
the Birkeland current, is one sheath
within another. That's the same thing
that happens here and it happens on both
sides. You can also see, I think, I hope, my
two umbrella-shaped overlapping,
umbrella-shaped what, paraboloids? Call
them torpedoes crashing together,
whatever. The middle business is sort of
interesting too. This through here this
thing, this thing, this thing, and this
thing are called double
layers. Double layers are a
plasma phenomenon that happen
under very heavy current
conditions and in the center, this is
typically of this kind of configuration
the currents are the
heaviest in the center and
then in the outer shells,
they're less and less and less.
So anyway, here's another picture of, this
is, if I had more time I would talk to
you about the making of concentrated
shells of material of what I claim and,
my friend I'm sure will disagree with me,
but what I claim is that if you squeeze
this thing, this force-free, field
aligned current, squeeze it down, what are
you doing to it?
You're increasing the current density.
And if you increase the current density,
it's the same thing really as not
squeezing it but increasing the current.
And if you do that, you can show, by
Lorentz force rules, that matter will be
moved from regions like this into
regions like that. The black arrows
and along the three o'clock
horizontal plane show the directions in
which matter will be moved. This matter
concentration will not occur in a force-
free current. But I suspect and I think it
will in, if you squeeze that force-
free current into a Birkeland current and
we've seen pictures of the Birkeland
current, so we know what they look like,
you saw that picture of that, that last
picture of the object was a
Minkowski 2-9, I think, and that's a
planetary nebula. The Minkowski is
not the Minkowski of Minkowski space,
it's another much younger guy who is an
astronomer. In any event, that's what
you'll get from the typical astronomer,
OK. They refuse, absolutely refuse to
use any electrical kind of voltage,
electric field, current density... Whoo! They
talk about bow shocks, ladder rungs,
wineglass parabolas, hyperbolic arcs. How
the parabolic arc
changes into a hyperbolic arc? I
don't know but I don't
think anybody's measured that closely
but... And close, of course, in the middle of
the whole thing instead of my arc
discharge, they've got a dust disc. They
will not give up the accretion disk as a
figment of their real imaginations. It's
all garbage, none of it exists.
It's all electrical and
what you see back here may
indeed be vortices but they're
not hydrodynamic vortices, they're
electrical vortices. So that's
what you're going to get if you look up
z-pinches from an astronomer. Here is
just, I think one of the best
examples of the fact that
this thing really does work.
Here is a current and it's
suffering obviously multiple z-pinches,
and when they discovered one of these,
one of these objects, there 
were two astronomers. Their
names were Herbig and Haro.
So, they got credit for this and they
called objects and now there's more than
one. Herbig-Haro objects. This is
Herbig-Haro object number 111 and you
can see that there are periodic z-
pinches. Tony Peratt calls that 'the
sausage instability' because they happen
in a periodic way. Any
electrical engineers who have studied
electrical transmission lines, you know
that there's pulses back and forth on
the electrical transmission lines. They
get out of control, you have northeast
blackouts, every once in a
while. There, I submit, is a perfect
example of that. That thing is like a big
transmission line and there are all
sorts of pulses and when the
pulses come up together, that's
where the z-pinch happens and
it happens periodically all
the way down the jet. Here's a
picture of that one and you can
see, it actually moves and those, that set
of pictures was
taken between 1994 and 1998, that's how
much it moved in four years. So when Dave
Talbott first came up with this idea of a
polar configuration, of a bunch of
planets in a line,
astronomers just about broke up laughing.
That was so stupid that they could never
imagine anybody would ever, ever think
about a stable configuration of objects
in a line, like planets on a shish-
kebab, OK. There's the shish-
kebab. It's real and you can
see the one in the front is
sort of getting a little bit
expanded as it goes along but
it does move and there are
many more of these, so this
is a bunch of, essentially,
protostars in a row. All this points out
is that this configuration is indeed
stable and can exist. You don't need to
have stars in circular orbits around the
center star, a sun, whatever, in order to
exist. This is another one and the number
of that is HH34. I guess there's
another one, they go on, there's many,
many, many, many of these, and they all
were looked at various scans set by
astronomers when they were first
discovered. If you go and ask NASA to
describe this HH 111, that's what
you're going to get. That is a NASA
artist's conception of what Herbig
Haro 111, this one right here. They
think this is what this looks like, and
of course it's got the accretion disk
and it's got a dust torus, OK,
nothing electrical.
Anyway, there's, I can go on forever, now
showing you these things that oh, 20
years ago were inconceivable. There are
many of them in space now. There's just
one constellation and that each one of
those is labeled as a Herbig-Haro object.
If you use a big scope on it,
you'll see them, pin balls in a
row. There's the best drawing
that I've come upon that shows
what happens at a z-pinch, at a normal z-
pinch. If I were to draw this, I would
draw this purple line continued down
around the bottom of the blue and back
up there, and that would be one of my
umbrella-shaped surfaces. Do you see what
I'm saying? This purple would come
up over the top and then back down here.
That's what I think happens, that's why
that blue, central, almost spherical
body, how it's formed. It's the overlap
between those arcs, those
discharges (in the Birkeland pinch),
in the Z pinch. This is a picture
sent back well, it's combination, I
kind of cheated. Half of that picture was
sent back by the IBEX mission. The
IBEX mission is the Interstellar
Boundary Explorer and they maintain
pretty much that they have discovered
certainly a spherical thing inside which
our Sun, the little tiny dot in the
middle, is center of, and it is a trail
and they've taken pictures of the trail.
Now, whether they've turned the camera
around and looked for the other tail, which
of course is the one
down here, I don't know.
So this one is, I
cheated a little bit, I
duplicated the upper half of this
picture and turned it upside down and
stuck it on the bottom because that's
what I think happened. And I think, that
will eventually be found, but so far IBEX
has found only the top part. Now, Wal
Thornhill and I are very good buddies
and so I unabashedly stole from him that
picture, which he made up and
you can see, there's some
differences but not a lot. If I
were to draw this over again, I
would make these, this thing come in more
parabolically and out that way and I'd
make this one come up around the top and
come back down
parabolically that way. We don't know
where these areas here are but we
know they exist.
That's what IBEX has found. They found
that there are heavy concentrations out
in the plane of the solar system
where electrons combine here
with solar ions to form, what
is it, excited, wanted to say
right what is it, it's an
excited nuclear atom. Neutral, yeah. I
said that but where the e is what's
bugging me, I think it's excited. Anyway,
that's just like what happens in a
plasma tube. In a plasma discharge,
you've got an anode over here and a
cathode over here and you got ions going
one way and electrons going the other
way. Think about that for a second. You're
an ion, OK, and you're in the
middle of this plasma discharge. Which
way you're going to go? I'm going to head
toward the cathode because that's
negative and you're a positive. You want
to go, negative and positive attract. You
don't want to go to the anode, he's
positive too, that repels you. So you go
screaming down there, you're an ion,
toward the cathode. What happens when you
get to the cathode? There's a sign
that says, no ions beyond this point.
Because ions can't go in wires. Ions live
and die inside the plasma
tube. Electrons go in the
wires, so if you have an
electron that's going down this way,
it'll go into the anode, into the wire
and all the way around through the power
supply to come back out the
cathode again and get into the
plasma tube. But the ion has to
stop and when it stops it recombines
with an electron and becomes
neutral. That's what they found.
A whole bunch of excited neutral
atoms and they bunch up.
And one of the investigators for
the IBEX mission said, it's kind of like
you pour maple syrup on your pancake.
When you do that, it all, sort of, the
maple syrup sort of piles up a little
bit and then eventually oozes down over
the size of the stack. And what we're
seeing in these areas, and of course this
and this are part of a circle. That's
just the thing in cross-section, right. So
what we're seeing here is a
pileup of the maple syrup, but
it works exactly like a plasma
discharge tube. And anyway,
Wal has also included here,
these pictures are the pictures
of the z-pinch and remember,
David talked about the necklace
with the points around here. This is an
example of the filamentation process
going on that the plasma is forming
filaments. Individual filaments, not just
a sheet of plasma. And so, this is what we
think is going on or at least did go
on when the Sun and the solar system, the
original solar system which did not
include Saturn, Earth, Mars, Venus,
it included maybe Uranus and Neptune and
maybe Jupiter but nobody knows really.
But this is what forms a star. This is
the process by which that star can form
and it isn’t going to happen
with accretion discs.
This is what you used to hear from
astronomers. They have since realized
there is no such thing as a bow shock
out there. What we just saw on the
previous slide is pretty much, they don't
admit it's electrical of course, but
they admit the geometry is
pretty much the same. The IBEX
mission discovered, that's the
IBEX ring. That's that ring of
ENAs that are out there, that are piling
up.
It's an excited neutral atom
surrounding the heliosphere, and as
I said, this is very similar to
what you see in a discharge
tube. Exciting, that's moving, hot. Lots of motion
to it. It's been banged around. It's not just
placid. The standard description omits
any discussion of a z-pinch. That's not
far off.
You see what happens, see how
it comes down and what happens in the
middle. They're getting the picture
little by little, but of course it's not
electrical. This suggests that our Sun's
heliosphere may be formed by a similar
z-pinch, that's what I just said, and
there is, I took the liberty to draw in
what I think those parabolic arcs should
be, those two kissing Zeppelins or
intersecting umbrellas... Just think of
scaling this whole thing up. That's maybe
the way our star, our Sun was
made, maybe the way
all suns are made. But could
it be that, if you step it up,
that's also the way those galaxies were
made? And it could well be. I said,
those galaxies were connected by strings,
well...
This is a picture of, you
folks see this, the ghostly
bubbles. The Electric Universe
doesn't use words like
mysterious, dark, ghostly. That's for NASA.
These are the ghostly gamma rays and
they were discovered by the Fermi
gamma ray telescope and they exist there.
I think may be too, I went through that
thing too fast. I'm sort of proud of my
superposition of the ghostly
bubbles on top of that. It makes
sense, it makes a great deal
of sense. Just to finish up,
there's the ghostly gamma rays
on their own. That's an, we can't
see our galaxy obviously, so that's an
artist... You can't get outside of it to
see what it looks like but that's
probably pretty much what it looks like.
Here's another thing that they are good
at. What's the center of the Milky Way.
Again, I'm not asking you guys to really
believe this but I'm suggesting it maybe,
could that be a z-pinch? On the
upper-left, do you see the umbrella shape
going out? I don't see anything on the
lower right but if you listen to NASA or
any of the astronomical organizations,
they will tell you that at the
center of our universe is a black hole.
Well, I'm sorry guys, it does not look
like a black hole to me. Besides, you
can't see black holes, so how do they
know? Anyway, this may be what is at the
center. Is it suggestive of a pinch? I
think it is, but anyway,
it's not a black hole because
you can't see black holes. This
is a picture, I think, Dave
used this as advertisement
for this conference. This
is a real image, taken in the
direction of what we think is the center
of the Milky Way galaxy. And
NASA says that there is
a great deal of evidence
that just to the right of the
the center of this, there's a
supermassive black hole at the galactic
center of the Milky Way, otherwise it
couldn't have formed. You take your
choice, I guess. But anyway, there's more
to come in the next discussion. Thanks a lot!

Welcome to Space News from
the Electric Universe,

It has been one of the greatest
surprises of the Space Age -
powerful magnetic fields
pervade the cosmos.
Mainstream astronomy and astrophysicists do
indeed acknowledge pervasive cosmic magnetism,
but they did not predict it, and the
realization has come begrudgingly.
Some perspective into these ideas can be
gleaned from an early online NASA feature
from the 1990s, which
asked the question,
“Do magnetic fields exist
throughout space?”
It states, “On the
cosmological scale,
there is no data to suggest that
magnetic fields are present.
They certainly are not important
in the dynamics of the universe
for any reasonable range
of field strengths
consistent with present
observational constraints.”
Of course, like countless other
consensus ideas in cosmology,
discovery has shown no regard for
these commonly held beliefs.
The now unavoidable problem of
cosmic magnetism in astronomy
is acknowledged in a 2011 Universe
Today piece, which states:
“The mention of cosmic-scale magnetic
fields is still likely to be met
with an uncomfortable silence
in some astronomical circles
– and after a bit of foot-shuffling
and throat-clearing,
the discussion will be
moved on to safer topics.
But look, they’re out there.
They probably do play a role in galaxy
evolution, if not galaxy formation
– and are certainly a feature of the interstellar
medium and the intergalactic medium.”
The reason magnetic fields
in space are so problematic
for standard, gravity-only
cosmology is self-evident
– possibly apart
from bar magnets,
only electric currents
produce magnetic fields.
And for many decades,
plasma cosmology had proposed that electric
currents over vast cosmic distances
play a significant role in the formation
and evolution of stars and galaxies.
Plasma cosmology predicted that
stars would be found to form
along vast networks
of filaments,
like pearls on a string, an outrageous
prediction that discovery confirmed.
The plasma scientist Dr. Anthony
Perratt of Los Alamos laboratories
demonstrated experimentally
that galactic structures
can evolve under the influence
of electric currents.
Through what is known
as the pinch effect,
parallel currents converge to produce structures
identical in form to spiral galaxies.
And well over a century ago, that Norwegian
experimentalist Kristian Birkeland
predicted that electric currents from the
Sun were the cause of our planet’s auroras,
a claim that astronomers
almost universally rejected
until it was finally
proved in the 1970’s.
In fact, with no official pronouncement,
within some circles in the space sciences,
the recognition and study of electric currents
in space appears to be slowly growing.
Consider the recent article,
published by the American Geophysical
Union’s Earth and Space Science News,
entitled “Electric Currents
in Outer Space Run the Show”,
which is a summary of the new book,
Electric Currents in Geospace and Beyond.
The article states bluntly,
“It is now understood that outer space
is fundamentally electrical in nature,”
a type of statement that critics
of the Electric Universe
have long decried as preposterous
and pseudoscientific.
On the extremely challenging task of
observing and measuring electric currents,
the authors state,
“Since electric currents are comprised
of moving charged particles,
such as ions and electrons, the
most direct way to measure currents
is by probing and counting
the individual particles.
Highly tuned instruments that fly on
board satellites do exactly that.
While particle counting is quite
challenging, as one might expect,
one can also make
use of the fact
that electric currents generate
a magnetic field around them,
which in turn can be measured, more easily,
by instruments, called magnetometers.
From these magnetic
fields one can then infer
using Maxwell’s equations
the underlying currents.”
But the inference of underlying electric currents
as the cause of magnetic fields in space
remains a shockingly rare practice
in the astronomical literature.
Thus, the processes astronomers
and astrophysicists have invented
to try to explain cosmic magnetic fields
have only grown increasingly weird,
encountering greater and greater problems in
the face of ever finer technological data.
Consider the discovery
reported last year
of galactic magnetic fields
with “astonishing order.”
As reported on Phys.org,
“Galactic magnetic fields are formed
through numerous stellar explosions,
the effects of which last for
hundreds of millions of years.
The energy bursts of all supernovas put
together produce a galaxy's magnetic fields.
Due to the fact that stellar
explosions are chaotic processes,
scientists had not expected them
to generate a magnetic field
with an orderly structure
on a large scale.
But this is exactly what they have now
proved to be the case in several galaxies
– even though the orderly structure did
not manifest in every single object.
The underlying mechanisms have
not yet been fully understood.”
However, plasma cosmologists
have hypothesized for decades
that the “underlying mechanism” is
cosmic scale electric currents.
More recently, in 2018, retired
professor Dr. Donald Scott
published his scientific model of
galactic scale Birkeland currents
as the cause of so-called anomalous
stellar rotation profiles in galaxies
— an anomaly that astronomers to this
day believe can only be resolved
by the influence of
invisible dark matter.
However, as seen in this graph, the predicted
stellar velocities based on Dr. Scott’s model
and the actual stellar velocities
measured over nearly a century,
compare remarkably well.
It is then not a
coincidence that galaxies,
like stars, form along vast
networks of filaments,
the form taken by electric
currents flowing through plasma
which connect the bodies
across cosmic distances.
If electromagnetism
rather than gravity
is the organizational force
creating structures in space,
then both the imagined
need for dark matter
and the intractable problem of cosmic
magnetic fields can finally be resolved.
In our own celestial neighborhood,
in the solar system,
space scientists have had the
opportunity to more directly test
 the long-held models of
planetary magnetic fields.
Let us consider NASA’s recent
Juno and Cassini missions
to the gas giant Jupiter
and Saturn, respectively.
In both instances, the scientific
data has shattered the belief
that the source of the gas giants’
respective magnetic fields
is internal dynamos deep
within the planets.
As Juno principal investigator Scott
Bolton stated, of the findings at Jupiter
“I didn’t expect all the
theories to be wrong,
but there’s motion going on in the
planet we did not anticipate.”
In a 2017 report, New Scientist.com
outlined the conundrum as follows:
“Another shock is that
Jupiter’s huge magnetic field
is even stronger and much more
irregular than expected.”
However, rather than questioning
the theoretical foundations
that led to the
predictive failures,
the scientists propose the ad hoc theory
that Jupiter’s hypothetical internal dynamo
must simply be much closer to the
planet’s surface than was believed.
The New Scientist report states:
“The irregularity of the
field so far is a sign
that the dynamo driving it may originate
higher up in Jupiter’s interior,
perhaps from a layer of
metallic hydrogen….”
…“the dynamo driving the field is close
to the surface over the entire planet,
not buried deep within
it like Earth’s core.”
But the most important clue to the actual
source of the planet’s magnetic field
is in the incredible electrical
potentials at Jupiter
that have now been confirmed
by the Juno data.
As described in an Earth and
Space Science news report
on Jupiter’s incredibly
powerful X-ray auroras:
“The data revealed particle signatures
of parallel electrical fields
over the poles of Jupiter that forced
electrons near the poles upward,
away from the planet, while protons and other
ions moved downward into the atmosphere.
This massive electric potential
– upward of a million electron volts –
provides a possible explanation of where
the X-ray auroras get their energy….”
In the Electric Universe, the
assumption that all celestial bodies
must carry no net charge
cannot be correct.
– a fact that scientific
discovery routinely affirms.
Jupiter is an electrically
charged rotating body,
and any such body can produce
its own magnetic field,
with no need for
internal dynamos.
Electric currents flowing from
the Sun impinge on its poles,
modifying its magnetic field,
inducing its stupendous X-ray auroras
and powerfully influencing its
super-fast winds and cyclonic storms.
As we’ve outlined
previously many times,
the aforementioned Dr. Scott recently
published his mathematical modeling
of the structure of a
Birkeland current,
which is identified visually as
counterrotating concentric cylinders.
Critically, this counterrotation
is clearly seen
at the poles of the gas
giants Jupiter and Saturn.
In fact, at Saturn, the crisis
for the standard dynamo model
for the planet’s magnetic
field is even more brazen.
In 2018, Cassini scientists
were astonished to discover
that Saturn’s magnetic field
appears to have virtually no tilt.
The crisis is explained as
follows in a phys.org report:
“It was thought that magnetic
fields around planets can only form
when there is a discernible tilt between
the rotation axis of the planet
 and the magnetic field axis.”
What the investigators actually found is
that the tilt of Saturn’s magnetic field
is “smaller than a
hundredth of a degree.”
As principal investigator Professor
Michele Dougherty lamented,
“…it looks increasingly likely
we will have to rethink the ways
different kinds of planets
can form magnetic fields.
As we’ve also noted
previously, in 2016,
planetary scientists were amazed to discover
that so-called magnetic ropes from the Sun
stretch nearly 900
million miles to Saturn,
and interact with the gas giant in much
the same as they do with the Earth.
We again note the aforementioned material
published by the American Geophysical Union,
which states that
“electric currents generate a
magnetic field around them…
From these magnetic
fields one can then infer
using Maxwell’s equations
the underlying currents.”
Make no mistake,
institutionalized science
does now recognize the
so-called magnetic universe.
If and when space scientists begin
widely inferring the electric currents
that pervasive cosmic
magnetism requires,
it can only be inevitable
they will reach the same conclusion
as the aforementioned authors:
That “outer space is fundamentally
electrical in nature.”

Of all the planets in
the inner solar system
perhaps none have proved more puzzling
to scientists on Earth than Venus.
On close examination we see that almost
nothing about the planet makes sense
from a conventional viewpoint.
From the extraordinary movements
of Venus's atmosphere
at speeds up to 60 times faster
than the planet's rotation
to its extraordinary
super bolts of lightning
vastly more powerful and
prolific than lightning on Earth
to its super hot
temperatures, well over 800º F
hot enough at the planet's
surface to melt lead,
to the mysterious vortices seen
wandering at the planet's poles
to its vast stringy
cometary tail
stretching for millions of miles sometimes
even touching the Earth's orbit.
Countless unresolved mysteries on Venus
demand entirely new theoretical pathways.
A scientific paper published this year in
Nature Astronomy only deepens the mysteries.
A team analyzing data from the
ESA's Venus Express mission
have discovered a mystery in the darkness
of Venus's nightside atmosphere.
Of course, the planet's
forementioned superfast winds
have long been a puzzle
for planetary scientists.
Lead author astrophysicist Javier
Peralta says of the enduring mystery,
"We've spent decades studying
the super-rotating winds
by tracking how the upper
clouds move on Venus's dayside
- these are clearly visible in images
acquired in ultraviolet light.
However, our models of Venus remain
unable to reproduce this super-rotation,
which clearly indicates that we might
be missing some pieces of this puzzle."
Using the visible and infrared
thermal imaging spectrometer
or VIRTIS instrument,
the team gained new insights into what happens
to these winds on the planet's night side
which remains hidden in darkness
for hundreds of days.
They found that Venus's
tremendous baffling winds
are even "more chaotic" on its
night side than on its day side.
They had expected
just the opposite.
As described on Sciencealert.com
"Existing models of the atmosphere
have predicted super-rotation
largely occurred the same way on
both Venus's day and night sides,
but the new infrared perspective
shows the whirling Venusian winds
are actually more irregular and
chaotic when hidden from the Sun."
As seen in this image, the most
puzzling feature to the scientists
is the filamentary patterns
seen in these clouds
which are not seen on
the planet's day side.
The team characterizes the phenomena
as essentially a type of gravity waves
in this case what they refer
to as stationary waves.
One of the researchers states,
"Stationary waves are probably
what we'd call gravity waves
- in other words, rising waves
generated lower in Venus's atmosphere
that appear not to move
with the planet's rotation.
These waves are concentrated over
steep, mountainous areas of Venus;
this suggests that the
planet's topography
is affecting what happens way
up above in the clouds."
However, the scientists are forced to acknowledge
some of the problems with this theory.
As the Sciencealert
article states,
"VIRTIS observed areas in
Venus's southern hemisphere,
which is generally
low in elevation,
but the team says gravity waves still
influence the atmospheric movements
- but strangely enough, there was no
evidence of them in the lower cloud levels,
up to 50 kilometers
above the surface."
Team member Ricardo
Hueso states,
"It's an unexpected
result for sure,
and we'll all need to revisit our models
of Venus to explore its meaning."
From the Electric Universe perspective,
the striking filamentary clouds
are simply due to electric currents
in the Venusian ionosphere.
It has long been known that the solar wind
interacts directly with the ionosphere
and of course filaments
are the forms we see
when electric currents
travel through plasmas.
The concentration of
the filamentary clouds
on high mountain tops is also a
prediction of the electrical
interpretation.
For many years planetary
scientists have sought to explain
the bright mountaintops of Venus
which reflect radar signals.
Some scientists have proposed that the mountains
are covered by a "heavy metal frost".
However, in 2003
physicist Wal Thornhill wrote in an
article on his website Holoscience.com
"A much simpler answer is that
diffuse electric discharge,
known on Earth as
'St. Elmo's fire,'
occurs preferentially at the higher
altitudes of the mountains on Venus.
In that thick atmosphere it forms
a highly conductive dense plasma,
which is a superb reflector
of radar signals."
The difference between the day and
night side phenomena on Venus
may be due to the comet-
like electrical interaction
feeding Birkeland currents into the
planets so-called magnetotail.
Magnetic turbulence
on the night side
can then be the effect
driving the chaotic winds.
In the Electric
Universe view of Venus
it is not a coincidence that Venus today
shows such similarities to a comet.
In fact, following the hypothesis that was
first proposed by Immanuel Velikovsky
in his book 'Worlds in Collision',
it has always been the position of the chief
principals of the Thunderbolts Project
that Venus once appeared in the
earthly sky as a terrifying comet.
Before the earliest space probes
imaged the surface of Venus
a number of scientists,
most notably
Fred Whipple, the originator of
the dirty snowball hypothesis,
had predicted that Venus would
be covered with oceans.
Instead, of course, Venus is
extraordinarily hot and dry
and its surface is blanketed with
networks of filamentary scars
matching the form of so-called Lichtenberg
patterns produced by electrical discharge.
Today Venus has a much more direct electrical
connection to the Sun than the earth
and it is this relationship
that holds the key
to understanding its bizarre
atmospheric and weather phenomena.
As mentioned, the predictions of
the Electric Universe for Venus
are much different than those
of standard planetary science.
In 2005, physicist Wal Thornhill
offered such a radical prediction
in his analysis of the North
Polar vortex on Venus.
Professor Ross Taylor said
of the vortexes discovery,
"...the absence of viable
theories which can be tested,
or in this case any
theory at all,
leaves us uncomfortably in doubt as
to our basic ability to understand
even gross features of planetary
atmospheric circulations."
It was Thornhill's position
that such vortices
would inevitably be found
at both poles of the planet
though only the one at the North
Pole had been observed at the time.
He wrote,
"We should expect to see evidence of the
twisted-pair configuration at the poles of Venus,
if the input current is sufficiently
strong and this model is correct...
The Venusian polar dipole shows the
precise configuration and motion
of Birkeland current pairs in
plasma discharge experiments.
That includes a surrounding
spiral vortex."
In 2006, scientists indeed found a similar
vortex at the South Pole of Venus.
As we see in these images,
it appears stunningly similar
to twin current filaments
studied in laboratories on Earth.
But as Thornhill noted,
"...there was no reason, other
than an appeal to symmetry,
for scientists to expect a similar
vortex at the South Pole of Venus."
Thornhill explained that the
mysterious polar vortices
and Venus's super-fast winds
share the same source,
incoming electrical
currents from the Sun.
He wrote,
"Venus Express science team
members say they want to know
how these vortices remain stable
and where they get their energy.
This goes to the heart of what drives the
super-rotating upper atmosphere of Venus...
Venus, as shown by its
cometary plasmasphere,
is still discharging strongly
to the solar plasma.
The enhanced infrared emissions
seen from the polar dipole
is due to the dissipation of electrical
energy in the upper atmosphere of Venus.
The polar dipole has a
variable rotation rate
and it varies the position of its axis of
rotation with respect to that of the planet.
It was observed to move 500 km from
the Venusian pole in less than a day
and return just as quickly.
The variable nature of the electrical
input to Venus via the Sun
and the snaking about of the Birkeland currents
explained both these characteristics."
However, in 2005 Thornhill offered
a similar outrageous prediction
on the planet Saturn, that science
discovery also confirmed.
In his analysis of the warm polar vortex
discovered at Saturn's South Pole
Thornhill wrote,
"The Electric Universe also
predicts, experimentum crucis,
that both poles should be hot,
not one hot and the other cold."
In 2008, the Cassini spacecraft
confirmed the astonishing prediction,
astonishing because the
freezing cold North Pole
had been deprived of sunlight
for more than 12 years.
The author of a paper
on the discovery stated,
"We didn't expect it to have
a hot spot at the north."
Electric currents
from an electric Sun
connect it to planets and (are) driving
atmospheric and weather phenomena.
How many enduring mysteries
will be resolved
when planetary scientists finally recognize
these simple and logical concepts?

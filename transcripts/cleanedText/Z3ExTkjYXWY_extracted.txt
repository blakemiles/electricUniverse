In 1993 Egan Bach wrote a treatise
on the ejection of strange
donut-shaped fireballs from volcanoes.
Historically they're known as gorgons,
but science was unable to explain their curious
formation. As he delved deeper into their unique
structure and properties, it 
became apparent their behavior
mimicked most of the sightings of UFO’s.
Sixty years ago, Winston Harper Bostick
found that an amorphous mass
of high velocity plasma,
has a natural ability to convert a
large proportion of its kinetic energy
into magnetic energy contained in an
organized toroidal structure. He termed
this structure a “plasmoid.” It
has become apparent that these
curious volcanic doughnut ejection
structures are electromagnetic plasmoids.
Bach's book examines in minute detail their bizarre
behavior. Going back to 1956, a milestone in plasma
physics was reached, when Bostick reported
experimental results which showed that plasma,
when created and accelerated to high velocities
by a batten type pulse source, is shaped
by its own magnetic field into 
a compact toroidal structure.
Terming this structure a plasmoid,
Bostick was careful to distinguish his
own definition of a plasmoid as a generic
term for all plasma magnetic entities.
Highly structured, from its 
definition as an amorphous blob,
he subsequently clarified his definition
as a self-generating shaped body,
and a force-free, minimum free energy
structure, taking the form of a plasma vortex.
According to Bostick, “A rather surprising result
occurs when the source is placed in a vacuum
in an externally applied DC magnetic field
and fired across the field.” The plasma
apparently has no difficulty in crossing
the magnetic field, “...it forms an
ever-elongating hollow cylinder as it proceeds
across the magnetic field... Subsequent
investigations were to prove that
the plasma crosses the magnetic field
in a train of paired oppositely
rotating diamagnetic vortices.”
Kubes et al. recently demonstrated
a similar conversion effect
in a laboratory Z-pinch. The points of
maximum pinch serve to accelerate
plasma actually away from the zone of
maximum compression. The high-velocity
plasma then forms ”...toroidal,
helical and plasmoidal structures
within the dense plasma column
in the lower pressure regions
along the axis.” A Z-pinch is apparently
an efficient way of generating the
initial high velocities, which result in
the formation of self-contained plasmoids
by the mechanism which Bostick identified.
The volcanic plasmoidal ejection occurs
at a specific point in any new eruption,
with the plasmoid size varying vastly.
Is this the classic dark-glow-arc stages
of excitation of plasma, signaling the
timing of ejection? For instance, reports 
mentioned some only 20 centimeters diameter,
while others cite these plasmoids
at over 100 meters long.
The plasmoid color also varies greatly,
with witnesses up to 100 kilometers from
the volcano, such as mount Redoubt 
in Alaska, noting dramatic color shifts.
From brilliant, whitish violet, to bluish,
greenish, gold, orange, and finally to red
and infrared. They fly at a rapid speed,
reportedly at above the speed of a jet plane. But
they seem also to descend and
rise, often in formation or swarms,
and can fly thousands of kilometers from their
origin. They can both attract and repel each
other. So how do these plasmoids
UFO’s manifest at eruption time?
The following is quoted on the Redoubt
eruption in Alaska on February the 15th, 1990
by captain Richard Swain some 35
kilometers away. “The top of Redoubt lit
up with an incredibly bright flash. The Cook
Inlet and the mountains behind it lit up in
daytime brightness. A fireball 
grew above Redoubt with
huge tongue-like projections -
quite unlike the concentric fireball
of nuclear explosions. Right on the heel of that
fireball an innumerable multitude of fireballs
began to jet in all directions.
They streaked really fast in the two
opposite directions of Homer and 
Anchorage. Their speed was
such that the eyes had a hard time following
the flight. They appeared like tracer bullets,
not perfectly round as they disappeared along
the inlet, at perhaps three times the speed of a
jet plane. Those balls went
on for about eight minutes,
at first many hundreds, then becoming
smaller and fewer as time progressed. At the
beginning they were huge and
many, but after about ten minutes
an abundance of common lightning strikes
began in the eruption cloud.” Important in
the Swain video is Bach's comment.
”The sequence shows two huge discs
hovering close to the horizon. They gradually
divide into four and then eight and finally
sixteen discs, all in intimate linkage!
These objects seem all aglow from the
inside. They clearly fly northeast
along the magnetic meridian
and back to the volcano.” But by what
mechanism are these plasmoid UFO’s created?
If we look at the volcano from an
Electric Universe interpretation,
this may help. The massive 
production of molten magma,
steam, and possibly transmutation of elements,
and formation of new compounds, suggests
the possibility that we're dealing
with a high-energy Z-pinch situation.
Now a pinch is the compression
of an electrically conducting
filament by magnetic forces. The conductor
 is usually a plasma, but could also be a solid,
or liquid metal. Pinches were the first type
of device used for experiments in controlled
nuclear fusion power. This pinch effect
is the self-constriction of a cylinder
of an electrically conducting plasma.
When an electric current is passed
through a plasma, a magnetic field
is set up that tends to force
the current-carrying particles together.
This force can compress the plasma so
that it is heated, as well as confined.
But such a self-pinched plasma cylinder is
unstable and will quickly develop kinks
or break up into a series of lumps,
resembling a string of sausages, or in 
this case plasmoids, ready for ejection
from a volcano or earthquake.
Ejected plasmoids often form
cylinders which shear apart, like stacks 
of coins into flat ellipsoids. By what
criteria are we convinced that most UFO sightings
are in fact these very plasmoids? Well, firstly they
seem to possess an intelligence, and they 
being heavier than air, they rise and fall
to the ground as though being flown.
They seem to fly in the direction of
either of the magnetic poles. They can readily
change shape, and pulse and blink with rhythms
shorter than one second, with light often
several colors. This is a ubiquitous
property of these plasmoids and
this observation is often recorded
during UFO sightings. Similarly, the 
plasma property of developing colored
portholes in their equatorial plane,
is classic flying saucer mythology.
The normal plasmoid body is a sphere, which 
often bulges into an ellipsoid with a short or long
rotation axis, reflected as a saucer
or cigar. They draw closer via
an electromagnetic, but actual visible chain 
link. These bodies often develop a mist
which is drawn out during flight to a tail.
Here the visual relationship between comets
and images of Matsumoto's mini-plasmoids
emitted out of electrodes, but also
showing a cometary tail and jets, is interesting.
This seems to link the concept of
scalability of electromagnetic characteristics.
Widespread witnesses from over the globe
relate how volcanic plasmoids often
then detonate after producing this tail.
These plasmoid UFO’s are
attracted to the Sun, but also
other heat sources, such as reported at
power stations and jetliner exhausts.
Plasmoids for instance have arrived at different
times to heated ducts at power stations.
This would explain reports
of pilots being tracked
by a UFO. Bach interpreted much
of the behavior of these UFO’s
before the advent of the
Electric Universe hypothesis
and before the deeper
understanding of plasma physics
from researchers such as Anthony Peratt.
To me this sharpened knowledge of plasma behavior
seems to crystallize much of the behaviors
of these plasmoid UFO’s. Regardless
Bach's work clearly shows how these entities
mimic the reported behavior of our classic UFO's.
Whilst the Electric Universe
enlightenment explains
much of their seemingly intelligent, yet erratic
behavior,  NASA has been slow to embrace plasma
physics and its paramount status in the universe.
It seems that they tend to explain UFO’s
as extraterrestrial, when a simpler explanation
exists. Nevertheless, strong evidence suggests
that most UFO sightings
can be clearly explained as
errant plasmoids, or gorgons 
as the ancients named them.
Will NASA actually provide
evidence that contradicts Bach?

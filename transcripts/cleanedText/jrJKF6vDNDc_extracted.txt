New reports in popular science media highlight
some of the theoretical limitations
in planetary science
and geology today,
limitations which have resulted
in countless mysteries
related to the planets,
moons and comets.
The reports in question
propose that volcanism
on various bodies
throughout the solar system
is more pervasive than scientists
have ever previously believed.
Even supposedly
occurring on comets.
On March 6, 2017 Astronomy.com
published the article,
"Planetary scientists are turning
up volcanoes everywhere they look."
The report focuses heavily on a theoretical
phenomenon called cryovolcanism,
or ice volcanoes.
On planet Earth scientists theorize
that the shifting of tectonic plates
is a cause in both earthquakes
and volcanic eruptions.
But on several other worlds which are
not thought to have plate tectonics,
planetary scientists believe they
observe another type of volcanism
called cryovolcanism.
A cryo volcano or ice volcano is hypothesized
to result when gravitational forces
produce tidal heating and other effects in
an icy body, producing volcanic eruptions.
For decades planetary scientists
have believed that tidal heating
is the cause of the most dramatic
volcanism in our entire solar system,
on the Jovian moon, Io.
The Astronomy.com article outlines
the hypothesis as follows:
"Io and other Galilean satellites
(such as Europa and Ganymede)
are in synchronous
rotation around Jupiter.
Io then becomes caught up in a
tug-of-war between Jupiter's gravity
and the gravity of these
other satellites...
This in turn leads to the bulging
of Io’s crust up and down
and the resulting friction produces a large
amount of heat and a molten interior.
When the pressure builds, it occasionally
erupts melted rock and plumes of gas.
However, as previously reported on this
series, observations in recent years
have effectively falsified the tidal heating
model for Io’s so called volcanoes.
In 2013 a geological survey found that
the surprising locations of the plumes
“...can't be reconciled with any existing
solid body tidal heating model.”
But the problems for the
volcano hypothesis on Io
began almost immediately
after their discovery.
In fact, in 1979, it was the
world-renowned astrophysicist Thomas Gold
who first proposed that Io’s
so-called volcanic plumes
were in fact high-energy
electrical discharges.
Nine years later plasma scientists Anthony
Peratt of Los Alamos Laboratories
and co-author Alex Dessler also proposed
an electrical mechanism for the “plumes”
If the plumes are in fact
electrical discharges,
this would account for numerous
anomalies with the standard hypothesis,
including their
filamentary structure,
a completely anomalous feature
for any volcanic plume;
as well as their surprising
movements across the surface of Io.
But perhaps most significantly,
the electrical interpretation
explains the electrical currents
that have been found connecting the
Jovian atmosphere and its icy moons.
Planetary scientists insists that the
source of the electrical currents
is charged particles
from volcanic eruptions.
But this hypothesis was complicated
when scientists also found
the auroral footprints of the
moons Europa and Ganymede.
A research team wrote
of this discovery
“Europa is not thought to be volcanic, so
what could produce the electrical current
that zips along and eventually gives
rise to Europa’s auroral footprint?”
Similar problems also face planetary
scientists who seek to explain
the high velocity features seen jetting
from the Saturnian moon Enceladus.
More than a decade ago the discovery
of the enormous jets and plumes
at Saturn's south pole astonished scientists
working on NASA's Cassini mission.
Scientists had expected the
moon to be geologically dead
and the last place they expected such
activity would be the moon’s south pole,
as reported by
Space.com at the time.
"The finding flipped everything scientists
knew about Enceladus on its head,
because what should have been a dead
moon appeared to be geologically active
and while it's supposed to be the moon’s
coldest region, turned out to be its warmest.
A co-investigator of the Cassini
mission said of the discovery,
“This is as astonishing as
if we'd flown past Earth
and found that Antarctica was
warmer than the Sahara.”
The tiny moon is a mere 504
kilometers in diameter
and the icy plumes were seen to
reach up to 480 kilometers high.
Investigators settled on the notion that
liquid water must be present under the surface
like a Yellowstone geyser in order
for it to erupt in high speed jets.
A NASA news release stated,
“The rare occurrence of liquid
water so near the surface
raises many (new) questions
about this mysterious moon.”
But the immediate assumption of liquid
water near the surface only showed
that the surprising discovery caused no
reassessment of a theoretical framework.
Scientists settled on the
notion that Saturn must be
”gravitationally
leading Enceladus”,
producing so-called cryo volcanoes at the
moon's south pole through friction heating.
In 2015 planetary scientists
made the surprising discovery
that particles in the Enceladus
plumes are electrically charged.
A lead investigator studying data from the Cassini
plasma spectrometer said of the discovery,
“What are particularly fascinating are
the bursts of dust that CAPS detects
when Cassini passes through the
individual jets in the plume.
Each jet is split according
to charge though.
Negative grains are on one side,
and positive ones on the other.”
As in the Jovian system we see an electrical
connection between Saturn and Enceladus.
The comparability of the gas giants’
respective environments is summarized
by Thunderbolts Picture of the Day managing
editor Steven Smith in his article:
”Enceladus Is Plugged in,”
“It is easiest to get an idea of
what is happening on Enceladus
by comparing it to another moon in the
solar system: Jupiter's moon Io....
Io acts like an electrical generator as it
travels through Jupiter's plasmasphere,
inducing over 400,000 volts across its
diameter at more than three million amperes.”
"That tremendous current flows
along its magnetic field
into the electric
environment in Jupiter.
The same kind of electromagnetic activity
connects Enceladus with Saturn's poles..."
In the Electric Universe
interpretation,
neither the one-way electrical
transaction scientists propose,
nor the assumed charge neutrality of
Jupiter, Saturn and their respective moons,
can be valid.
The electrical discharge activity
that scientists misinterpret
as cryovolcanism on
Io and Enceladus
may be comparable to the filamentary jets of
comets, which are also electrical in nature.
Ironically, in the March
2017 Astronomy.com report
“Are there volcanoes
on comets?”,
the article suggests that so-called
volcanic activity has occurred on
Comet 29P Schwassmann-Wachmann in its
orbit between Saturn and Jupiter.
It states,
“The strange activity may be due to the
comet’s unusually long day/night cycle.
Unlike most comets, which
rotate on hourly scales,
29P rotates only about
once every 60 Earth-days.
During the comet’s long night, material
may pool in chambers beneath the surface.
When the comet rotates into its long day,
the gas expands, flexing the surface.
High pressures can help the gas
break through the surface,
exploding outward in a
volcano-like event.
Instead of hot magma, frozen
gas streams from the comet.”
However, neither the imagined subsurface
cometary ice, nor the theoretical nozzles
from which comet jets supposedly
emanate, have ever been found.
The 2012 paper, “Cometary jet collimation
without physical confinement”
published in the American Geophysical Union
acknowledged the dilemma as follows,
“Contemporary models postulate
that these jets collimate
when the expanding gases and dust pass
through a physical aperture or nozzle.
However, recent high-resolution
spacecraft observations
failed to detect such
apertures on comet surfaces.
Furthermore, these models do
not explain why cometary jets
appear to be directed normal to the
local gravitational potential,
and/or to originate on
the faces of scarps.”
In fact electrical discharges producing
comet jets on the faces of scarps
is a prediction of the
Electric Comet theory
which states that electrical activity will
always center on the sharp points of a body
which act as kinds
of lightning rods.
Yet today consensus
scientific theory remains
that comets are slowly sublimating
ice balls that produce outbursts
or sometimes disintegrate due to
increasingly strange processes.
In the Electric Universe
theory, a comet's activity
is a result of its experiencing voltage
spikes in its changing plasma environment.
One of the most promising, yet still
overlooked pathways of discovery
is the growing evidence for a link between
cometary outbursts and dramatic solar activity.
At the 2016 Thunderbolts Project
conference, “Elegant Simplicity”
Russian scientist Dr. Subhon
Ibadov presented the talk,
“Nature of electric comets, electric
discharge mechanism of comet outbursts
and thunderbolts lightning in comet
nuclei due to solar flares.”
On the planet Mars recent
discoveries may provide a clue
to the electrical phenomena that planetary
scientists sometimes interpret as volcanism.
In 2012 amateur astronomers spotted enormous
plumes jetting from the Martian surface.
The plumes were more
than 250 kilometers high
and several hundreds of
kilometers in length.
Similar bright enormous plumes have
occasionally been spotted on Mars since 1997,
leaving astronomers
completely baffled.
However, in 2016 scientists reported
that a dramatic appearance of the plumes
occurred immediately after Mars was
hit by a coronal mass ejection.
In standard reasoning there is no reason
why charged particles from the Sun
would produce such a
dramatic dust raising event.
As one scientist stated,
“It's very surprising that was affecting Mars
right before the plume was first observed.”
A New Scientists report on
the discovery acknowledged
the unavoidability of an
electrical interpretation.
It stated,
“One possibility is that plasma could
be interacting with ice grains or dust
lower down in the atmosphere and
electrically charging them,
boosting them higher, but it's not
clear how the effect would be big.”
It's surely no coincidence that Martian plumes
appears strikingly similar in structure
to the plumes on the
moons Io and Enceladus.
Perhaps the single greatest
obstacle in the space sciences
is the ongoing assumption of charge
neutrality for celestial objects.
On our own Earth, scientists are still
making extraordinary discoveries,
completely unexpected
in standard theory,
confirming our planet's dynamic
electrical environment.
This includes the recent discovery of “supersonic
plasma” jets high up in our atmosphere
that could push temperatures up
to almost 10,000 degrees Celsius.
A Phys.org report
on the finding,
which will be the topic of a forthcoming
Space News episode, states,
“The theory that there are huge electric
currents, powered by solar wind
and guided through the ionosphere
by Earth's magnetic field,
was postulated more than a century ago by
Norwegian scientist Kristian Birkeland.
While much is known about
these current systems,
recent observations by
(the ESA’s Swarm mission)
have revealed that they are associated
with large electrical fields.”
If our own Earth so presents such
mysteries for institutional science,
what further surprises might
distant world still hold?
Moreover, how many ongoing mysteries will
finally be resolved when space scientists
abandon the notion of an electrically
sterile and disconnected universe?

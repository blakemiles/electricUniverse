Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought

A new scientific report provides
stunning confirmation of a foundational
prediction of the Electric Universe
hypothesis. For many years, one of the
great mysteries in planetary science
has been the heating in the upper
atmospheres of gas giant planets. The
apparent anomaly cannot be explained due
to simple solar heating, given the
planet's tremendous distance from the
Sun. Today, a team of scientists who have
studied data from NASA's Cassini mission
say they have an answer. The team
composed the most comprehensive mapping
to date of both temperature and density
in the upper atmosphere of the gas giant
Saturn. Based on their analysis, they've
concluded that rather than solar heating,
the tell-tale clue to the anomalous
temperatures is Saturn's aurorae, which are
induced by electric currents. A phys.org
report summarizes the findings as
follows. “The upper layers in the
atmospheres of gas giants Saturn, Jupiter
Uranus and Neptune, are hot,
just like Earth's. But unlike Earth, the
Sun is too far from these outer planets
to account for the high temperatures.
Their heat source has been one of the
great mysteries of planetary science.”
The report then explains the scientists’
explanation. “Electric currents, triggered
by interactions between solar winds and
charged particles from Saturn's moons,
spark the auroras and heat the upper
atmosphere.” While this analysis may be a
step in the right direction for
planetary scientists, it is also another
instance when the theoretical
predictions of the Electric Universe
have been far ahead of the curve over
institutionalized science. On the
question of atmospheric and temperature
anomalies at Saturn, in 2005 Thunderbolts
chief science adviser, physicist Wal
Thornhill offered a prediction that
could only seem preposterous
from conventional reasoning.
On his website, Thornhill analyzed the
mysterious hot spot in the vortex at
Saturn’s South Pole. The hot spot
puzzled planetary scientists because, as
described by the Keck Observatory “...both
the distinct boundary of a warm polar
vortex some 30 degrees latitude from the
southern pole and a very hot ‘tip’ right
at the pole, were completely unexpected.”
Thornhill wrote of this feature “It's
compactness is due to the
electromagnetic pinch effect where it
enters Saturn's atmosphere.” He then
stated “The Electric Universe also
predicts, experimentum crucis, that both
poles should be hot, not one hot and the
other cold.” In 2008, the Cassini
spacecraft confirmed the astonishing
prediction. Astonishing, because the
freezing cold North Pole had been
deprived of sunlight for more than 12
years. Thornhill explained, “The polar
hotspot and long-lived hexagonal feature
result from a continuous electric
current flowing from the Sun into the
pole of Saturn.” in stark contrast to the
conventional view of the Sun as an
isolated body, powered by internal
thermonuclear reactions, the Electric
Universe proposes that the Sun is
primarily an electrical phenomenon
at the focus of a galactic “glow
discharge”. In this view, electric currents
flowing from the Sun to planets has
implications for many atmospheric
phenomena, including the tremendous winds,
as well as X-ray and temperature
anomalies of gas giant planets, and also
jet streams and weather patterns on
Earth. While scientists today
increasingly recognize the role of
electric currents in planetary science,
they still view the electric currents as
byproducts of localized phenomena in
closed systems. And yet, one of the
clearest evidences of external electric
currents driving extreme atmospheric
phenomena, can be found with the
aforementioned hexagon which was
discovered at Saturn's North Pole in the
1980s. For a number of years, planetary
scientists have favored the explanation
that fluid experiments resolve the
hexagonal feature. However, as we reported
in 2018, recent observations
have pointed definitively
away from the fluid dynamics explanation.
Using images obtained by NASA's Cassini
spacecraft a team of scientists observed
an unexpected towering vortex, far above
the famous hexagon. A Science Alert
report on the observation states, “There's
something strange over
Saturn's North Pole.
A tremendous structure towering high
above the clouds indicates that the
planet’s peculiar hexagonal formation is
much, much bigger than was initially
apparent.” One of the investigators said
of the discovery, “As the polar vortex
became more and more visible, we noticed
it had hexagonal edges, and realized that
we were seeing the pre-existing hexagon
at much higher altitudes than previously
thought.” The problematic nature of this
discovery is noted in the Science Alert
article which states, “...since wind
conditions change dramatically with
altitude, the fact that the hexagon shape
persists so much higher than the cloud
tops, is a baffling conundrum.” In other
words, the persistence of the hexagonal
feature hundreds of kilometers above
the clouds, is the clearest possible
indication it is being driven by energy
from above and cannot be explained by
simple fluid dynamics. The Electric
Universe explanation, as noted earlier by
Thornhill, points to decades of
experimental research by plasma
scientists which reveals the importance
of hexagons seen throughout nature.
Consider the side-by-side images on your
screen. On the left are vortices of an
electron beam, etched onto a carbon
witness plate. On the right are vortices
of an electron beam, photographed on a
fluorescent screen. The hexagonal form
is a distinct feature of a
well-documented plasma phenomenon called
the “diocotron instability.” And the
phenomenon observed in the laboratory, is
remarkably scalable. As explained by Dr.
Anthony Peratt in Physics of the Plasma
Universe, “The vortices of the diocotron
instability are found to occur over 12
orders of magnitude in beam current.
This mechanism was first introduced to
explain auroral curtains by Hannes
Alfvén.” As we've also discussed ad
nauseam on this series,
another signature of the external Birkeland
currents that drive atmospheric
phenomena is the counter-rotation seen
at the poles of Saturn, Jupiter, Neptune,
and in the auroral displays on our own
planet. it was in 2015 that Dr. Donald
Scott published his mathematical
modeling of the structure of a Birkeland
current which is identified visually as
counter-rotating cylindrical shells
Again, today more than ever,
mainstream science is exploring the
critical role of electric currents in
atmospheric science. Consider the recent
article published by the American
Geophysical Union's Earth and Space
Science News entitled “Electric Currents
in Outer Space Run the Show” which is a
summary of the 2018 book: Electric
Currents in Geospace and Beyond.
The article bluntly states “It is now
understood that outer space is
fundamentally electrical in nature.”
However, while the aforementioned
book does explore in detail the role of
electric currents on and near the Earth,
it does not take the theoretical leap
proposed by the Electric Universe, which
is that the Sun is itself an electrical
phenomenon with a direct electromagnetic
connection to the earth. And yet, with
each passing year, new discoveries render
smaller and smaller the theoretical leap
required by mainstream science to reach
this conclusion. Electric currents,
driving atmospheric phenomena, is just
one of countless telltale signs that
we live in an Electric Universe. [Music]

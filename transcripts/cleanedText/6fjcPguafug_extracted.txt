Welcome to Space News from
the Electric Universe,

In part 1 of this presentation, physicist
Wal Thornhill began his analysis
of one of the most significant space
discoveries in recent memory.
The history and origins of the gas giant
Saturn, and indeed the entire solar system,
including our own planet is
not what we've been told.
Planetary scientists recently
made the astonishing discovery
that water in Saturn's satellites and rings
is remarkably similar to water on Earth.
As Thornhill explained,
this discovery was explicitly predicted
nearly 3/4 of a century ago,
by the scientific heretic Dr.
Immanuel Velikovsky.
It was Velikovsky's claim that,
only a few thousand years ago,
a period of chaos reigned
in the solar system.
One of the planets closely
associated with Earth was Saturn
and watery filaments rained on our planet
following Saturn's violent flare up.
Decades later, based on the respective
research of Dave Talbott and Dwardu Cardona,
Thornhill developed
his own model
of a primordially close relationship
between Earth and Saturn
which was the source of all
the water in our oceans
while leaving remnants
in its rings.
Today, Thornhill continues
his presentation
shifting his focus to his own successful
predictions for the Saturnian system,
including the
mysterious moon Titan.
Before I tell the epic
story, a warning!
Our education systems train students
to memorize a litany of facts
which produces
global groupthink.
Students are not given the time or encouragement
to critically examine the history of ideas.
A leading researcher in to the learning
functions of the divided brain,
Dr. Iain McGilchrist, has shown such
blinkered left hemisphere training
renders students functionally blind to
alternative ways of looking at a problem.
The left hemisphere simply blocks out
everything that doesn't fit with its take.
It doesn't see it,
actually, at all.
Societies with their narrow specialized
training may look at but cannot see
what to a non-expert
may seem obvious.
They will be the last to see a
paradigm shift in the making.
This is particularly evident for
electrical phenomena in space.
Even the Nobel Prize winning founder
of the idea of an Electric Universe,
Hannes Alfven, was ignored when he
warned in his 1970 acceptance speech
of an inevitable crisis in astrophysics if
electric circuits in space are not recognized.
Houston, we still have that
problem after almost 50 years.
I have lived since a teenager with
uncertainty about accepted truths
and learned to have the
courage to challenge them.
The result is not chaos but a synthesis of
ideas that explains the old ideas better
and finds new ways of incorporating
what seems a chaos of anomalies
and the best test is that of
classical physics, simplification.
The resulting paradigm shift is
not a threat but an invitation
to the greatest adventure
we may ever know;
to begin to understand our real place
in the universe for the first time.
In our Electric Universe, stars and
planets are formed at the same time
inside molecular clouds along a
snaking cosmic lightning bolt.
Gravity plays no
role in the process.
Since cosmic lightning takes the form
of a twisted pair of current filaments,
it is found that most stars
are in pairs or multiples.
Planets will tend
to do the same:
Like the snaking filaments
in a novelty plasma ball,
the star-forming
filament moves on
leaving a string of massive
objects behind to gravitationally
form the weird and theoretically
challenging zoo of exoplanetary systems
recently discovered.
Some gas giant planets are subsequently
formed in close orbits about a star
that has ejected charged matter
to achieve stability with a
changed electrical environment.
The ejection flares may account for
the flickering of newborn stars
which can't be explained by
gravitational accretion.
This explains the unexpected hot
Jupiters seen in large numbers
closely orbiting other stars.
The most numerous stars in
the galaxy, brown dwarfs,
which would appear reddish if they
could be seen with the naked eye,
are generally classed
as failed stars
yet they have the baffling ability
to produce massive stellar flares.
This is simply explained because red stars
don't have the ability of main-sequence
bright stars to control their
current by a transistor-like action
in their photospheric plasma.
A brown dwarf can only respond by
discharging matter electrically.
The capture process
of a brown dwarf star
involves flaring and ejection
of charged matter by that body,
in order to achieve a new electrical
equilibrium in its adopted family.
That acounts for the large
number of close orbiting moons
of our captured gas
giants in remote orbits.
With this in mind, I want to take
you back to just before the famous
Cassini-Huygens space probe was to
arrive at Saturn on July the 1st, 2004.
In news reports, Saturn was dubbed
'the original Lord of the Rings'.
There is a profound truth behind
such a glib turn of phrase
but it wasn't until the advent of the
telescope, that Christian Huygens in 1656
was able to suggest
that Saturn had a ring.
So how do we explain the Saturnian ring
symbolism that pervades our cultures?
The halo of the saints,
the royal crown
and the ring given in marriage
are Saturnian symbols
as are the circled
or celtic cross,
the Egyptian ansate
cross or ankh,
the eye of Ra and the
astronomically baffling
star inside the crescent.
The star at the top of the large Christmas
tree is pure Saturnian imagery.
It is truly amazing that we are still
haunted by prehistoric archetypes.
It helps us to understand the
extraordinary archetypal attraction
of Tolkien's fantasy
of Lord of the Rings.
He was well versed in mythology.
The following description of events
is based on the surprisingly detailed
and truly remarkable scholarship
of Talbott and Cardona
which required explanations with the
physics of an Eectric Universe.
Let's call our primordial
star Proto Saturn.
It was an independent brown dwarf
with its own entourage of satellites
including the Earth,
Mars and Titan.
Proto Saturn's dim reddish light was due
to a glowing red anode plasma sheath,
much larger than the Sun,
enclosing Proto Saturn and its inner
satellites in a radiant cell.
The term 'dwarf star'
is purely theoretical
since they are difficult
to see and measure.
In fact, NASA reported
a brown dwarf
which was radiating as if it had
twice the expected surface area.
The environment inside
the radiant red shell
is most hospitable for life
on any enclosed satellites
because there are no seasons and water is
conspicuous in the spectra of such stars.
Water misted down on this planet continually
and red light is ideal for photosynthesis
which explains the
abundance of ferns
and other vegetation globally
in the Carboniferous era.
But there is a catch.
Brown dwarf stars
are known to flare,
sometimes to the extent, as
one astronomer commented,
that any satellites would
suffer a very bad day.
Such flaring by Proto Saturn
accounts for the geological strata
and the fossil record of a number
of global mass extinctions
and instant burial of dismembered
plant and animal remains.
As we approached the
Sun from deep space,
our plasma sheath flickered
like a faulty electric light
when the two stellar plasma sheaths
or magnetospheres began to clash.
Proto Saturn's galactic electrical
power was usurped by the Sun
and its appearance
changed dramatically.
Before dimming forever,
the dwarf star proto Saturn would
have flared brilliantly like a comet,
ejecting charged matter to
relieve the electrical stresses
caused by the sudden
change in environment.
Even now the former star
has not completely cooled.
Saturn still radiates more than twice
the heat it receives from the Sun.
And we have a simple explanation
for the origin of Saturn's
mysteriously short-lived
water-ice rings.
As the Proto Saturnian system approached
the Sun in the outer solar system,
our minor star's gravitational
sphere of influence steadily shrank
and its outer satellites were
progressively stripped away.
This, and the earlier capture
of the other gas giants
provides the source of 'Trans-Neptunian
Objects' as they're known,
including Pluto with its unexpected geology
and atmosphere and its peculiar moons.
There is a simple physical characteristic that
links a captured star with its offspring.
It is the axial tilts.
Like our close-orbiting Moon,
satellites tend to orbit their primary with
the same face always turned toward it.
If they orbit in the
equatorial plane,
their spin axis will be aligned
with that of the primary.
As gyroscopes, the satellites
will retain the same tilt
even if jolted from their orbit
although the process may induce
a wobble of the spin axis.
It is therefore
highly significant
that the two key planets identified
in the ancient Pantheons,
Saturn and Mars, have axial tilts
closely similar to that of the Earth.
The tilt of Saturn, at 27 degrees to the
ecliptic plane, is itself an enigma
unless it formed
independently from the Sun.
Venus was described as a
spectacular discharging body
in the ancient
congregation of planets.
It can be explained if Venus was ejected
in the flare-up of Proto Saturn
and the in-fall of the stream of ejected
matter from swiftly rotating Proto Saturn
gave Venus a slow
retrograde spin.
The magnitude of the axial tilt of Venus
to the ecliptic is much less than Saturn's
which suggests that Venus was
ejected from a low latitude.
This accounts for the hellish
temperature and new surface of Venus
having been recently spat from the
mantle of a brown dwarf star,
its filamentary equatorial scars caused
by spectacular radial discharging
and its thick atmosphere
inherited from the brown dwarf
and subsequently modified by
interplanetary and cometary discharges.
Venus still has a cometary magnetotail
stretching to the Earth's orbit
and its mountaintops glow
with plasma discharges
which return Magellan's radar
signals as unexplained shininess.
Magellan's radar also showed Venus
has a surprisingly young surface
that gave rise to ad-hoc
theories of resurfacing events.
They're unnecessary.
Venus is a baby.
Since my predictions
were written in 2004,
the electro gravity model
has been further developed
and it explains
electro-gravitational capture
and the rounding of cometary
orbits by electrical discharge.
It explains the huge capture
cross-section of stars
and why the observed phenomenal
discharging of cometary Venus
caused it to finally have the most
circular orbit of any planet.
The Electric Universe conceptual model can
claim a number of successful predictions.
Significantly, it was the only model to predict
the surface features of smog-shrouded Titan
before the Huygens probe
revealed them in detail.
Titan, which is 50%
larger than our Moon,
is an enigma for astronomers
having a global orange haze that has
prevented us from seeing surface features.
It has a massive atmosphere,
mainly of nitrogen,
with the pressure at the surface like
that at the bottom of the swimming pool.
The atmosphere also contains methane and
at least nine other organic molecules.
The methane is being continually
destroyed by solar radiation
which raises a further problem
about its source of resupply
if the moon is 4.6
billion years old.
This has led to widespread speculations
of Titan possibly being covered by
an approximately one kilometer
deep ocean of liquid ethane.
However, radar infrared and
radio observations of Titan
have not found signs of
a hydrocarbon ocean.
In fact, one radar return was of a type that
we would expect to get back from Venus.
But Titan is not 4.6 billion years old and the
Earth did not form where we find it today.
Instead, Saturn's largest moon
Titan is a child of Saturn
and a sibling of
Venus, Earth and Mars.
I wrote just before Cassini
arrived at Saturn,
"...we should be alert to similarities
between Titan and Venus."
On November 29, 2006, the
Dallas Morning News reported,
when the 3 billion-dollar Cassini spacecraft
sailed past Titan three weeks ago,
it was supposed to clear up many of the
mysteries about Saturn's largest moon.
Instead, it has left
scientists more befuddled.
The new Cassini images do not support
previous theories about Saturn's moon.
In New Scientist of
November 6, 2004,
'Titan images add two moon's
mystery' Steven Battersby reported,
"The world got its first peek at the
surface of Saturn's moon Titan last week.
The images were taken as NASA's Cassini-Huygens
spacecraft swept past the moon...
The images show a landscape that
is clearly still being shaped.
Although Titan must have suffered
numerous meteor impacts in the past,
its surface today is
largely crater-free.
Somehow these scars must have
been eroded or filled in.
"We are seeing a place that is alive,
geologically speaking," says Charles Elachi,
head of the team running
Cassini's radar instrument.
I commented at the time, that is
precisely what was said about Venus
when the Magellan orbiter
revealed that planet's surface.
It is only supposition that Titan's
surface is still being shaped.
It's based on the belief that Titan must have
suffered numerous meteor impacts in the past
and therefore something must have occurred
from within the moon to fill the craters.
However, like Venus, there may have
been no impact craters to fill.
For that matter, no one has witnessed
a large crater-forming meteor impact.
The report continued,
"Suggestions of an active, dynamic surface
on Titan are beginning to emerge.
Not a single crater has
been identified yet,
which means the surface
must be young and active...
One large circular feature,
suspected of being a crater
until closer examination
showed it to be flat,
closely resembles the
pancake domes seen on Venus
that are produced by magma
welling up to produce a bubble
that then slumps down to
a nearly flat profile...
Other features resemble the lobes
of some surface lava flows...
We don't understand
what we're looking at.
Titan is going to be
a real challenge."
My comment was,
the surprise about the lack of craters and
Titan's apparent active dynamic surface
mirrors the comments made about Venus
when radar images were first returned.
The large flat circular feature on Titan does
resemble the pancake dome seen on Venus.
However, these domes were not
formed by volcanic action.
It would require an unacceptably
large number of coincidences
to produce such circularity
in just one of these domes.
The surface must be absolutely horizontal
and the flow from the central vent
must be perfectly even in
all horizontal directions.
But there are many
domes on Venus.
In the Electric Universe model, the
domes are more simply explained
as the raised blisters,
sometimes caused by lightning.
Small-scale circular-raised
blisters have been found
following a negative cloud-to-ground lightning
strike to a lightning conductor cap.
They're called fulgamites.
A test of this hypothesis would be to determine
if the surface around these domes is sunken.
Fulgamites show this
characteristic burrough pit effect
where the material has been drawn inwards
and upwards by the intense discharge
to form the raised blister.
It is not something to be expected
from a volcanic upwelling.
Inexplicably in terms of the volcanic
model where two domes overlap,
the relief of the underlying dome
doesn't disturb the overriding dome.
This, and the chain formation seen above is
typical of electrical scarring in general
where one crater is often
centered on the rim of another,
with little disturbance
of the existing crater.
With fulgamites, one mound
often occurs on top of another
as a result of multiple strokes
within the lightning flash.
So it seems that the images of Titan's
surface returned by Cassini so far,
are predictable
based on forensic evidence that we should be
alert to similarities between Titan and Venus.
This brings us to the other major
puzzle about Titan, its atmosphere.
Titan's atmosphere is
believed by many scientists
to be similar to Earth's early
atmosphere billions of years ago.
Toby Owens, principal scientist at
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory said,
"What we've got is a very primitive atmosphere
that has been preserved for 4.6 billion years.
Titan gives us the chance
for cosmic time travel...
going back to the very earliest days of
Earth when it had a similar atmosphere."
From New Scientist, November 6,
"Titan appears to have lost much
of its original atmosphere.
The moon has an unusually high
abundance of nitrogen-15,
compared with the lighter
isotope nitrogen-14.
That could be explained if most of the
atmosphere had evaporated into space,
a process in which the nitrogen-14 would
have escaped more easily than nitrogen-15."
What could cause such
a loss is unknown,
but it would mean that Titan once had an
atmosphere 40 times as thick as Earth's
- making it a dwarf
version of a gas planet.
This bizarre world may be far more
complex than we have begun to imagine."
Says Larry Soderblom of the US
Geological Survey in Flagstaff, Arizona.
My comment was, Titan's
atmosphere is primitive
but not in the sense that it
remains 4.6 billion years old.
Instead, there has not been time for
young Titan to lose much atmosphere.
If Titan, like Venus, is a
young recently-ejected body,
it may still be cooling
from its natal heat
and, like Venus, it has
a super-rotating wind.
The striking disparities
in nitrogen isotopes
is telling us something about the way
planetary atmospheres are formed
rather than how they evolved.
There are several processes during
birth in an electrical discharge
that will have significant effects on planetary
atmospheres, including that of Titan.
The primary effect comes from the
source and depth of the ejection
from the flaring parent
dwarf star or gas giant.
The chemical elements in the
discharge are then sorted
according to their critical
ionization velocity.
Also, isotopes will tend to separate in the
magnetic field of the plasma discharge.
Lastly, the plasma gun effect,
seen now ejecting material from Io's
so-called volcanoes into space,
is known in the laboratory to be
a copious source of neutrons.
The neutrons may be captured to form
heavy isotopes and radioactive elements.
The variable combination
of all these effects
suggests that it would be unlikely for
any two bodies in the same family
to have identical
initial atmospheres.
Subsequent electrical interactions
between planets and moons
would also serve to transfer
surface materials and atmospheres,
transmute elements and further
complicate the picture.
That fits generally with the irregular
elemental and isotopic signatures
found in the atmospheres
of our planetary system.
For example, nitrogen in lunar soils is 10
times more abundant than one may expect
from the concentrations
of solar wind rare gases.
There are some other mechanisms
that could also contribute
to the lack of nitrogen-14
in Titan's atmosphere.
For example, nitrogen-14 can capture
an electron to become carbon-14.
Carbon-14 decays by very weak
beta decay back to nitrogen-14
with a half-life of
approximately 5730 years.
If the age of Titan's
atmosphere can be measured
in tens or hundreds of thousands
of years instead of billions,
then a significant amount of nitrogen-14
may still be locked up as carbon-14,
contributing perhaps to the hydrocarbons
in Titan's atmosphere and on its surface.
To suggest Titan once had an atmosphere
40 times as thick as Earth's
making it a dwarf version
of a gas planet,
only complicates the plainly impossible Standard
Model of formation of the solar system.
Why don't other large moons in the outer solar
system have substantial residual atmospheres?
It seems far more plausible
to suggest that Titan
is a much newer moon than
Jupiter's Ganymede or Callisto.
Titan simply hasn't had time
to lose its heavy atmosphere,
just as Saturn hasn't had time to lose
its rings following its last discharge.
In this picture, "we now have the key to
understanding what shapes Titan's landscape",
said Dr. Martin Tomasko, principal investigator
for the Descent Imager-Spectral Radiometer,
adding,
"Geological evidence for precipitation, erosion,
mechanical abrasion and other fluvial activity
says that the physical
processes shaping Titan
are much the same as
those shaping Earth.
These comments demonstrate the problem of
interpretation when the model is geocentric.
Methane is a non-polar molecule
which doesn't form clouds and rain
like electrically polarized
water molecules do.
So, precipitation erosion and other
fluvial activity will not occur
much the same as
those shaping Earth.
Finally, returning to Venus,
why is its atmosphere so different
to the other planets and Titan?
The atmosphere of Venus is mostly
carbon dioxide, 96.5% by volume.
Most of the remaining
3.5% is nitrogen.
This inhospitable mix is accompanied
by clouds of sulfuric acid.
I explained in my 2004 article,
Venus probably began with an atmosphere
more like Titan's and the Earth's
where nitrogen dominates
and with more water.
On the Venusian surface, nitrogen
molecules require very little energy
to transmute to carbon
monoxide molecules
by a catalytic surface nuclear reaction
in the presence of red-hot iron.
The brilliant French
chemist Louis Kervran
when investigating carbon
monoxide poisoning of welders,
discovered this
surprising transmutation.
The carbon monoxide then reacts
at the hot surface of Venus
with water vapor to form
carbon dioxide and hydrogen
in a well known
industrial process.
The hydrogen produced
escapes from Venus.
This process explains the puzzling
discovery made by Venus Landers
that the water vapor concentration diminished
as they approached the Venusian surface.
But decisively, it explains the
heavy carbon dioxide atmosphere
and little remaining
nitrogen on Venus.
It also explains the
steady stream of hydrogen
escaping from the top of
Venus's atmosphere at present,
and the phenomenally high proportion,
120 times that on Earth,
of heavy hydrogen or deuterium
left behind in its atmosphere.
What I've attempted to show here is a
coherent story using forensic evidence
stretching back into prehistory
of celestial events involving planets and
their electrical thunderbolt interactions.
A new picture of the universe results
from paying heed to Alfven's warning
to introduce electric universe
science into cosmology.
This is a fundamental shift from
the ad hoc theoretical approach
which has no theory explaining the force
of gravity and so, unsurprisingly,
no success trying to introduce
order into a chaos of anomalies.
It has no chance of ever discovering
that we are children of the planet
and former brown
dwarf star, Saturn.
This is an invitation to
the greatest adventure,
to begin to understand our real history and
place in the universe for the first time.
And that must bring about a
much needed cultural change
that may dwarf the
scientific revolution.
That change is essential
if we are to have a future
because the post-traumatic
stress disorder we've inherited
threatens our very
existence on this planet.
It manifests as a desire not
to know the shocking truth
because it exposes our
existential fears.
As Roger Wescott
overtly expressed it,
"Man is a wounded animal. His
survival is astonishing.
But his inability to heal
his wounds is tragic.
It is tragic because,
as Velikovsky argued,
being descendants of the survivors of
great paroxysms of nature of the past,
we are possessed by the urge
inherited through racial memory
to repeat the violent
performance.
And it was his greatest fear
that we now had the destructive
capability to produce our own doomsday.
Along with that genius Carl Jung, he warned
that mankind is its own worst enemy.
So the cultural change offered
by Electric Universe cosmology
is essential for our survival.
By offering a real understanding
of the universe and our history,
it offers hope and inspiration
where presently there is none.
There is far more to life in the electric
universe than is dreamt of presently.
We are all intimately connected
with each other and the Earth.
Enjoy the Saturnian festival
of lights and the New Year.

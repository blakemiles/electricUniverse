A new scientific study could radically
change our view of the Sun.
It seems that the Sun is
not behaving as it should.
Scientists have recently
created what they call
an MRI of the Sun's
interior plasma motions.
For decades, solar physicists have
believed that at the Sun's core
is a superheated
thermonuclear reaction.
This theory requires a massive
transport of thermal energy
to the Sun's surface
through convection.
But the results of this study indicate
a virtual absence of convection,
just 1% of what a thermonuclear
core would require.
How does this affect our
understanding of the Sun?
The thermonuclear model requires
several things to be going on
which don't appear to
be going on. One is,
there's supposed to be a
radiative zone inside the Sun
and then above that,
a convective zone.
And, of course, the radiative
zone is purely speculative.
It's only required by the model,
there's no evidence for it.
And the convective zone
is also speculative,
based on the granulation seen
on the surface of the Sun
that was interpreted as being
the tops of convection cells.
But the fact that they've discovered
very little convection, means that
both the theory of
the granulation,
the theory of the generation
of magnetic field
and the theory of transfer of
energy from the center of the Sun,
all of these are in peril.
And I would say that
what we are seeing
is the demise of the
standard model of the Sun.
The absence of the
expected convection
is just the latest in a long string
of surprises for solar physicists.
There are many anomalies, in fact, the
very magnetic fields above the Sun
and the very hot corona,
none of these have been
properly explained.
There've been a lot of arm waving
about energy as somehow transferred
from inside the Sun to the outside
without afecting the photosphere.
Because this is what's required, but this
is a really weird kind of model.
We've got 16 million degrees
on one side of the photosphere
and tens of millions of
degrees up in the corona
and sitting in the middle is the
5,000 to 6,000 degree photosphere.
And it's required very, or sort
of, extreme speculation as to
how you would ever get that
energy out of the Sun?
And there's been no
satisfactory answer.
Thornhill points to a
different model of the Sun
which relies on the
principles of plasma physics.
Well, the Electric Sun is, energy
received from outside the Sun
in the form of an electric current
lighting up the ionosphere of a body
which is no different to many of the
other bodies in the Solar System,
only it might be much larger.
And so, we're looking at the top of
the, very top of the atmosphere
like the ionosphere of a body
like, say Jupiter or Saturn.
Because of the electrical energy
coming in, it's lighting up
like any of the new gas discharge
electric lights that you see
in car HitLights and so on.
So that's what we're looking
at, it's just an electric light.
I think the theorists have to
begin to look at plasma physics,
real plasma physics,
the physics of electrical
discharges in low pressure gases
and forget about thermonuclear
models at this stage
but concentrate on plasma
discharge phenomena.

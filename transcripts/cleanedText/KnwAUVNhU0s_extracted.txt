Weather and EZ Water ― An
Intimate Role of Separated Charge
So I am going to
talk about water but
I'm going to talk about
water in a special context
and that is in the context of something
that's really important around here
and really important where I
come from and that is weather.
And so, I want to talk
about water and weather
and I hope to demonstrate to you that
something is really important about weather
that we haven't realized before
and that is electrical charge
which fits nicely into the
theme of this conference.
And, I guess, a shorter title would be,
should I bring an umbrella to work?
Okay, so let me start
with a few questions.
So, here's a question.
Sometimes above the water
you see a single cloud.
But that's weird because you know, the
water is evaporating from everywhere
so how come only one cloud
when the vapor rises all over?
Is there some attraction
of moisture that comes
and pulls the moisture into
this cloud or something else?
How do we understand this?
How come there's not one broad
cloud that exists over the water?
Another one.
Maybe you haven't
thought about this
but what keeps the cloud afloat?
Cloud consists of
water, water is heavy,
cloud like this consists of, I
could give you in kilograms,
the weight and such but
it's convenient to talk about the
weight in terms of elephants.
So, this is the equivalent of
perhaps a thousand or so elephants.
And how come the elephants
don't fall on your head?
Maybe it's a question that you haven't
thought about but some people have.
And then, you know, in
Seattle where I live,
we get a lot of rain and
we see dark clouds.
Sometimes they release the rain
and other times they don't.
And so, what gives, how
come, what makes it rain
and why sometimes
does it not rain?
So we're talking about water
and water is something
about which we know so.
So I want to start from a few principles
that have been developed over the past years
and then go on from there to
talk about how these principles
can be applied to get a better
understanding of weather.
And it starts with this book
that Don Scott mentioned
and we uncovered a different phase of
water beyond solid, liquid and vapor.
And it's the basis, it comes from
a lot of experiments that we did
and I think rather
straightforward interpretations.
And I just want to give you a summary without
presenting the evidence for what we found.
So, we found that
if there's water
and the water sits next to a hydrophilic
material in particular not hydrophobic
but hydrophilic, water-loving,
what happens is that the water transitions
into a completely different structure.
A layered structure, honeycomb kind
of structure that builds in layers
from here one after another
and just keeps going on
and in fact typically we find up
to millions of molecular layers
that undergo these
transformations.
We call them EZ or
Exclusion Zone of water
because we find experimentally
that as these grow
they push out all
particles and solutes
so it's rather pure substance that
we get here that's solute free.
And the structure looks
something like this.
It's a hexagonal or
honeycomb kind of structure
consisting of course
of oxygen and hydrogen
and unlike the structure of
liquid water which sits out here.
And it turns out it's
not H₂O anymore.
It's actually H₃O₂ - if you count the
oxygens and hydrogens in the unit cell.
This is what you get
and it's not surprising because
experimentally we found that this region
has a net negative charge and
this is negatively charged.
To be neutral, it would have to be H₄0₂
that is double H₂O that's neutral.
It's negatively charged.
If you wanted this to be neutral, you'd
have to put one more proton in here
to make it H₄0₂.
So, negatively charged and
the positive charges,
complementary positive
charges lie here in water
and the reason is that,
in order to build these
what happens is the water molecule is
breaking into its component parts into OH-
which sits here and lines up to give
you this structure and H+ protons.
So this is negative
and this is positive
and what that does is to
form a kind of battery.
This is the hydrophilic
surface, this is the water
and this negatively charged, EZ, or we call
it 'fourth phase of water' is sitting here
and the complementary
protons are sitting here.
It's got potential energy
just like a battery
and in fact the energy to charge this
comes from light, we found that.
So, question is, how does this
potential energy play into weather?
Everybody's interested in the weather,
nobody really understands it.
And I think the answer
is - profoundly.
And I want to present to you some,
well rather than really evidence,
some of this is evidence and
some of it is conjecture
to give you perhaps some idea that
differs from the conventional idea of
what is responsible for weather.
It's not with the watercycle and
many of you have seen this before.
Here's the atmosphere and the
clouds and we have precipitation
which could be water or
it could be ice and snow
and the groundwater flows down
into the oceans and it evaporates
and the evaporated water
condenses and so on.
And so, some of the water that exists,
could be millions of years old.
Same molecules that get
recycled over and over.
And so, we deal with ice and
snow, we deal with snow-melt,
evaporation, condensation
and then precipitation.
And that's what I
want to talk about
and I'd like to present you and argue
that these are qualitatively different
from what you think you have,
what you might have learned.
So, we're going to talk about
this water cycle and weather
and I want to talk first about water and
ice which you saw on the upper left.
Then evaporation, condensation,
precipitation and then wind,
something that many of us never really
think about but it's certainly around.
And, weather exotica.
I'm not sure how much I'll
get through but let's see.
So, we start with water and ice.
So you know about ice, you just basically
take water and freeze it and you get ice.
But it's not quite
so clear as that.
It turns out that this fourth
phase that I mentioned to you
is a necessary condition
for the freezing of water.
So we all think that when you freeze
water you go from water to ice
but what we found and is described in the
book and I'll show you a few slides,
is that water doesn't really
transition directly to ice.
It transitions to EZ whose structure
is not so different from ice.
It's not ice but not so
different and then to ice.
And if you melt the ice, you go
from ice to EZ and then to water.
So, the process of
freezing differs.
And the way it works is something like
this, you start with the EZ structure,
remember there are the these hexagonal
sheets that pile on one another,
and you may not
have noticed it but
each sheet is slightly displaced
from the sheet behind it.
It's displaced in such a way
that the negative oxygen here
lines up with the
positive hydrogen here
and so these are
electrostatically attracted.
The same here, so it's a stable
structure, it sticks together.
And what we found is that the
ice forms as this EZ structure.
Remember, you start, you go from
water to EZ and then to ice.
What happens is that you add protons,
and I'll explain how in a moment,
and these protons,
positively charged,
insinuate themselves between
the two negative oxygens here
and then there's a
shift of planes
so that the planes are no longer
displaced from one another
but they're actually in register and
that's when the planes come apart
so that the ice is less
dense and the ice floats.
And, you know, we're
happy that ice floats
because if it didn't float,
if the ice were more dense
and the ice began from the
bottom and worked its way up
then you'd have a real problem because
creatures like this could be,
maybe in cold climes, could be
basically pushed out of the water
and would obviously perish.
So, we're lucky that the structure of ice
is less dense than the structure of water.
So, let me show
you the evidence.
Is it really necessary, is the EZ
really necessary for ice formation?
So, here's a simple experiment.
What we do is, we take
a droplet of water
and we put it next to a
hydrophilic material.
This is one that
we commonly use.
It's called Nafion.
And so, what we find is
that next to the Nafion
we have EZ water that forms and
beneath this we have a cooling plate
so basically this water is being
cooled and eventually it turns to ice.
But I want to demonstrate
to you that it's the EZ
where the ice formation
is initiated.
And that's shown here.
And so, we're depicting this
particular region over time
and so here's a water drop and here's
the piece of Nafion and remember the EZ
is sitting right here and
you see this bright spot.
This bright spot shows the initial
location of ice formation
and later as ice formation occurs
of course it moves into the water
but it moves and penetrates down where
the EZ is and you can see later
it basically follows the EZ.
So, the EZ is basically the
first place to freeze.
The freeze initiates in the
EZ and that's the main point.
And the way we think it does, and
I'll show you evidence in a moment,
is that you have the EZ here and
remember negatively charged here
and the protons here and
gradually as the EZ builds up,
more negative charge, you get
more positive charge here.
And when the positive
charge gets dense enough,
what happens is it
moves into the lattice
all the way to the most negative
part and it forms here.
And remember, EZ plus
protons gives you ice
and so we have the ice that forms
right here and the process continues
and gradually you get a whole bunch
of ice starting with the EZ.
Now to show you that this really happens,
we have a setup that looks like this.
So, here's a chamber.
This is a thermoelectric cooler so this
water then gets progressively cooler
and we find that the cooler it
gets the bigger the EZ gets
and beyond that we just have water
and we put pH sensitive dye.
These are the dyes, you know, that
change color just like litmus paper.
Acid is one color, base is another color and
here's what happens when freeze occurs.
So here's the cooling
plate, right.
Here's this cooling plate.
Here's the ice and here's the water
that has yet to convert to ice.
So, the green color
is actually neutral
and here in the ice the
red color is very low pH.
It means it's full of protons.
So it shows that indeed, as the ice forms,
a lot of protons enter into that region.
So, ice formation
involves protons.
It's EZ, negatively charged,
plus protons, give you ice.
So we understand now that what happens is,
you reduce the temperature, you get EZ,
EZ builds up and all the protons that
are sitting here rush into the EZ
whose structure is a little bit different
from ice and that converts to ice.
So, what happens
when the ice melts?
Well, you might expect the
opposite or the reverse process.
So, the ice turns into EZ which
then turns into - water.
So do we really see EZ
water when this melts?
We did the experiment, put ice into
a cuvette and allowed it to melt.
And put the cuvette
into a spectrometer
which can measure the absorption
of light at different wavelengths.
And so we asked the question, does
melting produce EZ water and protons?
So, this is the absorption spectra of just
melted ice, just melted water samples.
And there are four
different panels
and the only difference between them
is we used a different kind of water
so this is de-ionized water,
we use that to make the ice.
Boiled de-ionized water,
de-gassed de-ionized water.
It doesn't really matter what
kind of water you put in there,
when you melt the ice you get
a similar spectral pattern.
In all cases, there's a big
absorption peak at 270 nanometers
and we know from our
previous experience that
the 270 nanometer absorption
is the signature of EZ water.
It's the defining feature.
That water absorbs light in the UV region
at 270 nanometers, ordinary water doesn't.
So, we can conclude that as you
take the ice and you melt the ice,
the melted ice is EZ water.
So, the melting is ice
to EZ and then finally,
after some time, the EZ
converts to ordinary water.
So, what about snow?
Um well, it's pretty
and I think all of you know that
snow has hexagonal crystals
and it's always been a kind of mystery
as to why they should be hexagonal.
But remember, the EZ is hexagonal
and if snow grows from
hexagonal kind of ordered water it makes
total sense that the snowflake would
But remember, the EZ is hexagonal
and if snow grows from
hexagonal kind of ordered water it makes
total sense that the snowflake would
actually be EZ, some
construct of EZ water.
And the fact that EZ
water is negative
means every snowflake
should have negative charge
and these snowflakes should stay apart
from one another which basically they do,
built from hexagonal EZ.
So, we dealt with ice and snow
and the fourth phase of water
and I presented to you some features
that are perhaps a lot different
from what the conventional view
is of freezing and melting.
And now I would like
to show you a video
and this video is something that
is on the Discovery Channel
and it was based on my book
'The Fourth Phase Of Water'
and we made it, you might say, to Hollywood
and I want to show you a five minute clip.
The movie is called
'The Fourth Phase'.
It's done by a famous
snowboarder Travis Rice.
From when I was a kid I've
always been intrigued with water
and how we interact with it.
Since then, traveling the world of snowboarding,
the concept for this trip evolved
to follow the hydrological
cycle around the North Pacific
really attempting to immerse oneself in the
elements and see how this whole thing works.
It's been incredible.
As children, we're all
motivated to find the truth.
A child looks around and is
learning truths all the time.
We have this natural
tendency to explore.
I'm Gerald Pollack
and I'm a professor of bioengineering at
the University of Washington in Seattle.
It can be really challenging to
keep an open mind in these days.
Scientists have become more hesitant
to challenge perceived truth.
"How are you doing?
So, it's working?"
There are some books
that suggest that
essentially we've kind of reached
the limit of what there is to know.
I'm shocked by this
this perception.
There are many aspects of
water that we see every day
and we don't really
understand them.
These are questions
that need answers.
We all learned that
water has three phases;
solid state,
liquid state
and also vapor state.
However, you can't explain all the known
properties of water with 3 phases alone.
You need a fourth phase.
What's the fourth phase?
With an energetic input, water
molecules undergo massive change.
They become ordered,
they acquire charge.
All of this energy to create
that order comes from light.
We began with experiments
to try to learn more.
We noticed something that
seemed almost magical.
Every one of the tests
that we did showed that
this water was different
from ordinary water.
The individual molecules were actually
linked together to form a hexagon,
and then many hexagons.
We can understand why
snowflakes are hexagonal.
They actually form from the
fourth phase of water.
After some time there seemed to be
enough evidence to indicate that
this was a distinctly
different phase of water.
You might ask, what
implications it has for us?
We're approximately
two-thirds water.
Most of the water inside of our cells,
they're filled with fourth-phase water.
This could be central to all of what
goes on in the biology of the cell.
This is going to lead the way to a better
understanding of how cells function.
I think part of the beauty
of the fourth phase,
especially as it relates,
I guess, to this film,
is the concept that not everything
is as it appears to be.
Leaving some space
and open-mindedness
for allowance of a shift in perspective
on how you view the world is
one of the most important
things in my life.
Being a scientist is
a search for truth.
We somehow need to change
the system so that
we're looking for ideas whose outcome has
the capacity to really shake the earth
and yield breakthroughs
if not revolutions.
You need to dig deeper and deeper
in order to find the truth.
Thank you.
This was cool and I'm really shocked
that these guys actually survive
what they, what they
do in the backcountry.
OK, so I talked about water and ice
and I've tried to demonstrate that
the formation of ice and the melting of
ice is different from what we think.
And I want to talk about evaporation
and the message is the same,
it's not what we think.
So, what do you think
about evaporation?
You probably think that you've
got a glass of water, you know,
and it's evaporating one
molecule at a time.
A molecule gets a kick of energy,
of kinetic energy, and it comes up
at least that's what I learned.
And the reality is
a lot different.
So, let me start with this.
This is taken at Starbucks
and, you know, Seattle, Starbucks was born
in Seattle so we drink a lot of coffee.
And if you have a dark background you
notice this is a hot latte, I think,
and taken by my son.
You notice something interesting,
you can see the vapor.
Now, if you can see the
vapor, what does that mean?
Well, you can see the vapor because
the light is being scattered
and you don't see a hell of a lot
unless the scattering entity
is at least on the order of
the wavelength of light.
Wavelength of light
is half a micrometer.
Well, it turns out that these are little tiny
droplets in here that are tens of microns.
Now, even one micrometer
little droplet contains,
you know, how many
water molecules?
You can do the arithmetic, it's something
like a billion, on that order.
So, there's something wrong with,
appears to be wrong with the idea
that the evaporative
entity is one molecule,
unless they come together above here and
we know they don't because we've checked
that where we've checked these
when water is evaporating
and we can check right just above
the surface as this is emerging,
it's no different from
what you see here.
So, that idea seems to be
incompatible with basic physics.
Well, another interesting feature
is that it's not continuous.
Look, it seems to be discrete.
Now that's a surprise
because most of us,
we presume that the evaporative process is
a continuous one, not only is it discrete
but also it appears to come
from one region of the water
not necessarily from the
entire surface simultaneously.
Well, I have a lot of undergraduate
students working in the lab
and many of them don't do
what I tell them to do.
They have minds of their
own and there was one guy,
a Chinese student, we have
a lot of them in Seattle,
and he was curious and so he
took a laser beam and he,
what he did is to condense
the beam into a plane
and he wanted to get a cross-section
of how one of these would look like.
So, what do you think
they look like?
You might think,
cross-section might,
would look like kind of cotton
or something like that,
but doesn't.
It looks like this.
These are four different
experiments and you can see,
looking at let's say this one, that
the bright area is scattering light.
It means that's
where the water is.
In between that, the dark
area is doing nothing.
So it seems to be
essentially empty.
And I got to tell you that
when I saw this for the first
time I almost fell out of my seat
because I couldn't believe that the evaporative
entity had structure, just like this.
It seemed inconceivable but, you know,
after enough repeats of the experiment
it was pretty clear
that this was correct.
So the first thing...
Well, sorry it wasn't
the first thing
but we thought this is not
created from nothing.
This kind of
pretzel-like structure.
There must be something
in the water
that may be giving rise to this
kind of pretzel-like structure.
So, we raised the question, is there a
corresponding structure in the water itself?
I'm not sure if you can see it
but I can see it on my screen.
If you look into the warm
water that you see here,
and this picture was
taken by my son,
he was the artist of my book and I was
really pleasantly surprised to see this.
This one was at home, I think,
not in Starbucks but...
I can see it here,
I hope you can.
There's a mosaic structure.
If you can't see it then
take a look at this one.
This is an experiment
you could do yourself.
So, this is a pan of warm water and
it's illuminated not from above
but at a glancing
angle from the side.
You might call that
dark field illumination
and you can see the same sort of
structure, low angle illumination.
And so, it looks like the
warm water that's evaporating
does contain some kind of structure
as the previous slide showed as well.
And we can also see it by
using an infrared camera
to look down at the warm water and
you can see same sort of structures.
There's no doubt that
the structure is there.
Well the usual interpretation
when you use an infrared camera
is that this region looks
warmer than this region.
In fact, conveniently they
actually provide a scale for you
so you can correlate the darkness
with the equivalent temperature
but it's not necessary that
that's the only explanation.
Another possible explanation is that these lines
actually denote the presence of EZ water.
Now why do I think so?
Well it's because of older
experiments that we did.
Here's a piece of
Nafion next to water
and remember an EZ forms
next to the water.
And so the infrared camera is picking
up the amount of infrared energy
that's being radiated from that.
The EZ is dark.
That means it doesn't
radiate a whole lot
and the water beyond the EZ radiates, as you
can see it's brighter, it radiates much more.
So dark here, the EZ is dark and if we
go back to the infrared image of this
you have to ask the question,
is it possible that the dark region
here is actually EZ material?
And we think it is because we've looked at
the origin of these structures that form.
And you can see little dots
here just as they form.
And these dots, we don't know whether
they're little droplets or little bubbles
but essentially it doesn't matter for us
because what we found in our experiments
is that if you have a droplet,
this is the structure.
If you have a bubble,
this is a structure.
And in both cases these are
lined by layers of EZ material,
just like onion skin and that's what
holds it together for both of these.
But inside you have a lot of protons and
the protons are repelling each other,
they're pushing out against the skin and
that's what keeps it into a sphere.
The difference is that in this case
it's liquid, in this case it's a vapor.
So we've learned in our experiments
about these water droplets
and since we don't really know if they are
droplets or bubbles, we call them vesicles.
And we do know that the vesicle
structure looks like this
and we do know that as they form
before they enclose themselves,
these positive charges tend to
repel each other, they leak out.
And so, the amount of
negative charge here
is always more than the
amount of positive charge.
So, these little vesicles, whether they're
bubbles or droplets, have net negative charge.
That's important.
So, if you think about the possible
explanation for these dark lines,
remember I suggested, maybe
they contain EZ material.
Well, a possible way that
they can contain EZ material
is shown here that you have a lot of
these vesicles that are stuck together
and so, for example,
this entire cluster here
would represent what we see here consisting
of a whole bunch of these stuck together.
How are they stuck together?
Well, we presume that they're
actually glued by protons
and so these are negatively charged
and this is negatively charged.
If you have protons between them, the protons
will act as glue holding them together.
Now this is not a
wild speculation.
It actually comes from
Feynman, many years ago,
who talked about negative, like
charges that come together
and he called it
like-likes-like.
Well, these negative
charges like each other
so they come together and he said
the reason they come together
doesn't violate any basic
principles of physics.
It's because opposite
charges gather in between
and so you might have positive charge
which pulls this one and pulls this one.
He said like-likes-like because
of an intermediate of unlikes.
And I think that's what happens
and that's how you can imagine
that these are actually glued
together, negative charge here
negative charge here, protons
in-between holding it all together.
There are many examples of this.
I don't have time to present it.
So, this is what, this is an oblique view
that shows the same mosaic structure on top;
but what this slide shows is that
it's not just a surface layer,
it actually extends downward.
You can see the dark lines
coming and extending downward
and what that means is that these
mosaic cells are actually mosaic tubes,
they extend down into the water.
And so, when we talk about evaporation we
have a situation that looks like this.
This is a kind of conclusion slide that we
have these basically tubes that run down.
They're not just on the surface.
They run into the water and
when sufficient charge gathers,
they actually rise up like this
and then they become vapor.
And if you were to take a cross-section of
this, it might look something like this.
So, basically the vapor patterns that
you see, especially in cross-section,
come from liquid patterns
that are down here.
They simply rise up to give you this incredibly
beautifully shaped vapor that we see.
And you get clusters so you get one
of these groups of tubes that rise,
so this will be the first
one then the next one
and the next one and they're
actually discrete events.
But by the time you get up here, the
droplets that make up these clusters
eventually dissipate because you
don't see any vapor up here.
So they're basically
dissipated into the air.
And so, when you think
about humid air,
you can think about these
negatively charged little droplets
surrounded by positive charges which
are known to occupy the atmosphere.
However, if there's enough positive
charge to glue these together
and form clouds like this.
In the atmosphere, the humidity disappears
and it becomes clear instead of humid
and then you can see a
difference in your environment.
So, if you have humid air,
you can imagine looking through this humid air
to some building that sits at some distance.
And the building is not clear, it's
fuzzy and the reason it's fuzzy
is that the light that gets scattered from
the building before it gets to your eye,
it's scattered by numerous of these
rather large little droplets
that sit in the air as humidity.
On the other hand,
if the air is clear,
if these little droplets have
actually condensed into clouds,
then you can see these
buildings much more clearly.
So, those of you who live on the East Coast,
you know, Washington DC in summertime,
buildings look like this but in the
wintertime they may look like this.
OK, so that's evaporation and the
mechanism I've presented evidence to you
that the mechanism is grossly
different from what we think.
OK, now what about condensation?
So, you've got these droplets in the
air, how do they condense into clouds?
Why do we get a cloud
to begin with?
So, what we have in the atmosphere among
other things are two principal constituents.
One is these water vesicles
that have a net negative charge
and we have positive
charges known,
the atmosphere is known among atmospheric
scientists to be net positive charge
and somehow the positive charges are
linked, nobody knows exactly how,
to molecules in the air.
So, we have negative charge
and we have positive charge
and so we come back to the Feynman
like-likes-like mechanism,
we have these vesicles of water
that are suspended in the air
and we have positive charge.
If you add these together in the
right quantity, you get a cloud
because the positive charge brings these
negatively charged vesicles together.
So, a cloud may look
something like this.
Principally these negatively-charged
vesicles and with enough positive charge
these charges, these vesicles
are actually linked together
and they form these clusters
that we call clouds.
So question arises, what keeps
clouds suspended in the sky?
And I don't know, a lot of people have
never thought about this question.
Remember it's water, the
water is pretty heavy.
Well we know that
clouds have charge.
This is one example, probably not unknown
to the Electric Universe people.
We also know that the earth
has an electric field.
I mean, beyond the
magnetic field.
And the electric field runs perpendicular
to the surface of the earth
and it exists because there are positive
charges up here in the ionosphere and beneath
and because the earth has
a net negative charge.
By the way, the net negative
charge may come from the EZ water
that fills the surface of
the earth and all greenery.
So, this is the electric field
at the surface of the earth.
It is roughly a hundred
volts per meter
which means that my nose is 200
volts relative to my toes.
OK, good to remember.
You know, it's easy.
OK, so we have, what
about floating clouds.
So, the earth is negative
and the cloud is negative
and so doesn't take a rocket
scientist to figure out that
there's a repulsive
force between them.
But your reaction might
be or may might not be,
is that repulsive force really strong
enough to keep the clouds suspended
simply by repulsion?
I want to give you two
examples that demonstrate it.
The first is this.
You take an old-fashioned
120-watt bulb
and, you know, current is flowing
through the tungsten filament.
And suppose you could collect one second
worth of charge flowing through it,
just one second.
And suppose, thought experiment,
you could compress that to a point
and you put that point down
here of negative charge
and you do the same thing up here
and they're separated by one meter.
So, the question I ask you is, you know
that these are going to repel each other.
This one can't go down
but this one can go up.
So, question is, how much
weight do you need to put
on this one in order to
prevent it from going up, OK?
So, I've asked this question.
I got all kinds of answers from
a gram to a ton or whatever
and the right answer is about
50,000 garbage trucks.
Now, knowing that there are Boeing engineers
here, the original thought was actually,
it's something like
5,000 Boeing 747s.
But my son, the artist, couldn't
draw a Boeing 747 stacked up
so we wind up with garbage trucks and
this is roughly the amount of weight.
And even... So it, we're
talking a huge force.
Now, another example is this.
So, you have a couple and the guy is lying
here and the woman is suspended somehow.
It doesn't really matter
how she's suspended,
you might think of a net or
something that's keeping her away.
Of course, they would like to join
each other but she's suspended here.
And suppose, this comes also
from Feynman by the way,
from his lectures except
he has them vertical.
I mean, standing instead
of in this position.
But suppose you're able to remove
1% of the electrons from this guy
and 1% of the electrons from this woman
so she's positive, he's positive.
They repel each other.
He can't go down
but she can go up.
He doesn't want her to go up,
he'd rather have her go...
Well, so, so a question is,
how much weight would you have to put on her
back in order to prevent her from rising up?
Anybody have a guess?
How many garbage trucks.
OK, so actually the number of garbage
trucks is so large, the correct answer,
remember according to Feynman
is the weight of the earth.
It's astonishing.
So, main point.
The force that is generated
by charges is much larger
even than people in the Electric Universe
are, most of you are, I think, thinking.
Huge forces.
And so we come back to what
keeps the clouds suspended?
And I think what keeps them
suspended is the fact that
the clouds have a net negative charge and
the earth has a net negative charge.
So one suggestion is a repulsive
force between these and these.
That's why the clouds
are sitting up there.
And if the cloud has more negative
charge then it's going to be higher
and if it has less negative charge
then it's going to be lower.
It's a simple paradigm
and that explains what atmospheric scientists
have a really hard time explaining
and that is clouds
in different layers.
So, simple explanation is that this cloud
has a lot of negative charge so it's high.
And this one has a moderate amount and
this one has low negative charge.
And so that's how
they're suspended.
Side issue is this,
think about it.
The earth is negative, the
atmosphere is positive.
We all know that positive attracts
negative and so you'd expect that
simply by virtue of the fact that this
is positive and this is negative,
they're going to stick together.
Now imagine if they
didn't stick together.
Just think about the
scenario for a moment.
The earth is spinning, right, and
typical velocity on the surface is,
we're talking about something like
two times the speed of a jet plane.
So, it means if you went outside and the
atmosphere was not stuck to the earth,
there'd be a hurricane outside
every time you walked out.
So, I mean the atmosphere must
somehow stick to the earth
and this is perhaps a
simple explanation that
plus and minus cling and so the
atmospheric clings to the earth.
And in fact, if you think about it,
a question that might be raised is,
does clinging force explain what
we know as atmospheric pressure?
We think of the pressure arising from
molecules pressing on each other
but, you know, the atmosphere
is not a pile of bricks.
The molecules are a gas which means
they hardly touch each other
and you can go through various
arguments to come up with an idea
of how the atmosphere could
actually press on the earth
but a simple argument
might be that
the pressure comes from the
plus sticking to the minus.
And that prevents the
blow-away scenario because
there are big winds up here and if
you just have stray molecules around
and the wind comes, you might expect that
we'd have no oxygen left to breathe.
OK, so I talked about
the condensation.
Now what about precipitation?
It does rain, although not
too often around here.
So, what causes the rain?
Well, if you listen to
the weather people,
they'll talk about pressure and
they'll talk about temperature
and I don't know about you but
I've never been able to understand
how this combination of temperature
and pressure could yield rain.
So of course, another question that
people here are likely to raise is,
what about charge?
There's somehow charge involved
in weather and bringing rain.
We know that there's
charge there
and I'd like to bring up the
principle of induction.
This is Faraday induction which I
think is known to many of you.
So if you have a positive
charge sitting up here,
if it's really far away doesn't do
a whole lot but if it's closer,
it'll begin to induce opposite charge
down here and the closer it is,
the larger the opposite
charge that’s generated.
It doesn't matter whether this
charge is positive or negative.
Basically the same thing occurs and this
force is always attractive, that is,
if you have the negative here you'll always have
positive here and they attract one another.
And I think this principle, this simple principle
that we all know about is really critical.
An example of it is here.
You take a balloon and you
rub it on your shirt.
And notice same shirt as in the
movie, it's the only shirt I own.
Embarrassing moment.
And you put it next to the faucet and
the faucet bends quite appreciably.
It's a fun thing to
demonstrate for kids.
And what's going on?
Well, the balloon is charged
by the triboelectric effect,
rubbing on your
shirt or your hair,
induces opposite charge and the two are
attracted and so the stream bends this way.
So, we have the same
principle going.
We go back to the cloud
and in the cloud,
we have the negatively charged vesicles containing
the water and we have positive charges.
They come together to form a
negatively charged cloud.
And when positive charge, more
positive charge lowers the cloud,
right, it comes closer to here, there's an
inductive force, positive here negative here.
And this pulls the
water from the cloud.
It's a simple pulling
force that can do that.
So, I think a possibility is that
precipitation occurs inductively.
I'll go back to
that in a moment.
And what about wind?
So, we know the wind occurs and
we sometimes think that it's a fire
of the Dragon that creates the wind,
but, what creates the wind?
We, you know, we don't know.
Is it pressure gradients, which I think
is what you'll read in the textbook.
But it's kind of difficult to
understand how you get a wind gust?
Gust is pretty local and of course the
gust can be powerful as you see here.
And I think it's possible that charge
gradients are responsible for wind.
And why do I think so?
So, here's diagram
that you've seen.
Here's the earth and here's the
positive charge in the atmosphere
and it's known from measurements that
protons diminish with increasing altitude.
So here you have the
highest electric field,
and it diminishes with
increasing altitude.
At night, It's very small, possibly
because there's not much evaporation
and the positive charges don't
get into the atmosphere.
During the daytime, it gets much
higher and this is well known.
This is not conjecture.
So here is low electric field
and here's high electric field.
Now this is taken from
a published paper
and what we're seeing here is the electric field
up high in different places on the earth.
So, forget this one
for the moment.
That's integrated
over all of them.
Let's look at Africa and Europe
and this is GMT so we see that the peak
electric field in Africa and Europe
occurs at 14.00 roughly GMT.
So, this is in Africa and
Europe roughly early afternoon.
It's when the sun
is the brightest.
Sun is really shining and you see
it's much bigger than in the evening.
Look at the Americas.
The peak occurs at about 21.00.
It occurs later than here.
Again, it corresponds to when the
sun is really up high in the sky.
And the difference between nighttime and
daytime is huge, it is a factor of 10.
There's a big difference
between the two.
So, think about it.
The electric field is high
here and it's low here.
So, that means you've got a gradient:
high electric field, low electric field.
So, in this case you've got a lot of positive
charges here and very few positive charges.
Positive charges
repel each other.
They want to escape.
Where are they going to go?
Well, they're going to go this
way and that gives you wind.
And I think, with this,
I don't have time,
I think this can explain both the trade
winds that blow from east to west
and the prevailing westerlies or jet
stream that flows from west to east.
They occur, originate at the two
different light / dark boundaries.
That gives you wind.
So, what about a gust of wind?
Well, I think a gust of wind could
occur with a local charge gradient
depending on the plants and the
structures that exist there.
I think they, it's possible
that the origin of wind
comes from atmospheric
charge gradients.
Now what about exotic weather?
Seattle is not like Phoenix.
This is what it looks like
in typical winter time
and we get a fair amount of rain
and people get caught downtown,
you know, without their umbrellas
and they rush to their cars.
So, what's going on?
Why, the question is, why in Seattle
do we get a lot of rain in the winter
whereas the summertime it's a bit like
Phoenix although a little bit cooler.
And remember, this is the mechanism
that we've deduced for clouds.
You need the humidity
with negative charge
and you need positive charge
to bring these together.
And of course you need enough
positive charge to bring it together
because if you have a trivial
amount, it won't happen.
So, think about the
winter in Seattle, OK.
Now, when it's
winter in Seattle,
in the summer the earth is tilted in such
a way that in the southern hemisphere
you got a lot of sunshine
occuring, right?
And this lot of sunshine builds positive
charge way up into the atmosphere.
We don't get it here
but we get it here.
Now, where does this
charge want to go?
Well, the charge wants
to escape from here,
the high atmospheric charge,
so it goes this way.
Meanwhile, you have the prevailing
westerlies going this way
and the two are combined to bring
moisture into Seattle in the wintertime.
And so, you're getting a lot of charge
coming and the situation is like this.
You have a cloud, charge comes, right,
and the addition of more positive charge
reduces the negativity
so the cloud gets lower.
And of course, sorry,
a lot of these vesicles begin to be
attracted to these positive charges.
So the cloud begins to, the cloud, because
of the positive charge begins to lower
and because of additional positive charges these
clouds can actually merge with one another
so not only do they get lower but they
get larger and this keeps happening.
Gets lower and it reaches the point
where you have an inductive force,
the negative charge induces positive
charge and that brings the rain.
If it's low enough and it
induces enough positive charge,
the positive pulls the negatively
charged vesicles and we get rain.
The rain is actually
pulled toward the earth.
So, rain or no rain it's, I think,
the cloud must lower sufficiently
past the critical point of inductive
inevitability, then it rains.
It's sort of like an orgasm, you know,
you're almost there and then you're there,
if you will.
Interesting scientific fact.
Some guys, not this
one, this one.
Some guys used high-speed
video to record rainfall
and we all know, if you have
a droplet that's falling,
based on its size, and physical
properties, you can compute the velocity.
Well they measured the velocity and they
found that it was up to ten times higher
than you could imagine due to to
the fall and so they concluded,
this is published in Nature,
they concluded that
there's a pulling force that
brings it to the earth.
I need about three minutes, OK.
Now, exotic weather.
For the Australians who are here, I
think, this comes from Australia.
We have these thunderheads which
can yield intense rainfalls
and notice the
curvature around here.
If you think about the earth
that's rotating, you know.
If you're standing on the equator,
it's rotating really fast.
If you're standing up here,
the speed is pretty slow.
And so, there's a gradient
along here which means,
because this is always faster than
this clouds will always rotate
in the counterclockwise in the
northern hemisphere we see here.
So, if you think
about a hurricane,
so here's a cloud that
has negative charge.
It's moving in this direction
at least initially
because the trade winds
push in this direction.
But think about the atmosphere, the
positively charged atmosphere.
So, this cloud is moving in this direction,
compressing all of these positive charges
whereas behind it, it's already passed
through, there's not much positivity left.
It's left a swath where there
shouldn't be positive charge.
So, this negative charge is attracted
to a lot of positive charges.
The two will tend to combine and
when they combine, what happens is,
remember you get more positive
charge with the negative,
this part of the cloud descends.
It releases its rain
and it becomes clear.
And this will be the
eye of the hurricane.
Meanwhile, the cloud is
rotating in this direction
for the reason I showed
you in the last slide
so you come to here and again the
same thing happens with this region
and so the eye becomes larger.
And it starts curling around until you
reach the state where a negative charge,
right, induces positive charge
and the ice sticks to this.
And it keeps going and
building like that
and eventually you get a structure
that looks something like this.
This is a typical hurricane.
And sometimes, you know, you
can get one of these typhoon,
not typhoons, but tornadoes
and think about it.
Again, we have the
rotation occurring here
and what keeps it all
together is the first point
and most of these particles
here are negatively charged.
So, you've got positive charge
that keeps it all together
by the like-likes-like
mechanism.
And by the way, you often see
lightning discharges in these.
So, it's kept together and because it's kept
together this entire thing is rotating.
You get fierce winds out here
and because of the charges,
the induction force pulls
up refrigerators from here.
So we get some idea of what is
responsible for the tornado.
So, I've gone quickly
through the entire cycle.
Evaporation, condensation,
precipitation, ice and snow, and so on.
And I'm suggesting to you that
not only are the mechanisms
different from what
we've all learned
but that central feature
for all of this is charge.
Negative charge and
positive charge.
So, I would leave you with,
charge is absolutely critical
and there's not a single weather
forecast that I've ever seen
that says hey, the charge in the
atmosphere is such and such
and because of the charge we may
expect this kind of weather.
So, I think one day if the atmospheric
people begin to take into account
that the universe is
really electrical,
we'll know whether to bring
an umbrella to work.
And before I end, I have to talk one slide
about the Institute for Venture Science,
because well, for a number
of reasons including,
the next speaker is
deeply involved in it
and Dave Talbott was also involved in getting
this and Susan, getting this started
and the Institute funds promising ideas
that challenge conventional thinking.
And we received more
than 200 pre-proposals.
They've all been reviewed and out of
those 200 we picked a dozen or so
that are extremely promising.
And the people, those people are
now drafting full proposals
which we expect to receive in about, well,
two weeks and this is a going concern.
Of course, we're looking for donors
and anybody who knows people of means
who have done well and would
like to give back to society,
I think this is a really wonderful
way of returning to society
in a way that is meaningful.
So, I end with the book.
The book has become popular
and a lot of the ideas and issues
that led to the speculations,
which is really what they
are, that I presented to you,
come from this book, where
you'll find the evidence.
Thank you very much!

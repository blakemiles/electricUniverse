Welcome to Space News from
the Electric Universe,

In part 1 of this presentation,
physicist Wal Thornhill began his
analysis of the recent remarkable update
by the team behind the groundbreaking
scientific experiment,
the SAFIRE project.
For the first time, an
independent experiment has been
conducted to audit the Electric Sun
model, first proposed by the engineer
Ralph Juergens in the 1970s.
At the recent University of
Bath Electric Universe
conference in the UK, SAFIRE's principal
scientist and chief engineer Montgomery
Childs said of SAFIRE's results; in all
our experiments and discoveries, we have
found no disparities with
the Electric Sun model.
We believe the SAFIRE experiment validates
and supports the Electric Sun model.
Childs is president and founder
of the engineering firm Aurtas
International Incorporated, which was
contacted by the International Science
Foundation to experimentally
test the Electric Sun.
As noted previously, Aurtas
International Inc. is an independent body
which has no affiliation with the Electric
Universe or The Thunderbolts Project.
In this episode, Thornhill
continues with his thoughts on
some of the most stunning
SAFIRE results to date.
This famous photo of settled
science will be recognized in
future as the moment we stopped
doing physics in the 20th century.
Quantum theory discarded
the physics principle
of cause followed by effect.
Einstein didn't like it but he
had already done the fatal damage.
He isolated his arbitrary inertial
observers from the rest of the
universe, discarded the absolute
standards of length and time, invented an
imaginary proper clock, which doesn't
exist, removed the ether, and the effect
of gravity became an illusion,
all unforgiveable nonsense to the
great physicists of the past.
We were propelled
back almost 2,000 years to
the Greek Ptolemaic era, when geometric
symmetry and mathematical beauty
dictated that endless ad-hoc epicycles
be added to perfect circular planetary
orbits in order to match appearances.
That dogma lasted for over 1500 years.
How long will we allow relativity
dogma and its taboos to persist?
It should be no surprise
that since that conference,
science has failed to produce
fundamental breakthroughs, anything like
the 19th century, when some of the finest
experimental physicists: Weber, Ampere,
Gauss, Faraday, were discovering the
secrets of electricity and magnetism.
For example, Wilhelm Weber produced an
electrodynamic orbital model of the atom
in the 1870s, 40 years before it was
experimentally discovered by Ernest Rutherford.
Weber's electrodynamic law will
form the foundation of future physics.
The Electric Universe follows the lead
of those experimenting electrical pioneers.
The SAFIRE project shows our
century-old understanding of
stars, and therefore the universe,
is fundamentally wrong.
There is no mention of electricity in space
in any textbook on astronomy or cosmology.
The Electric Sun model accepts and
extends electrical Plasma Cosmology,
the only experimentally tested and
predictive cosmology today.
The Nobel-Prize-winning
plasma physicist Hannes
Alfven developed it based on a universal
network of Birkeland current filaments
connecting and driving the rotation of
galaxies, which matches modern observations.
50 years ago, he predicted a crisis
in astrophysics because theorists
chose to misunderstand his
pioneering research in Plasma Physics.
The SAFIRE project
proves he was right.
Galaxies are an electrically powered phenomenon,
and electric stars light their spiral circuits.
It shows we have wasted
more than 60 years trying to produce
energy "like the Sun," based on the
unshakable belief that stars are
isolated thermonuclear-
powered campfires in the sky.
The SAFIRE project exposes the
complicated untestable life-and-death
story of thermonuclear
stars as fictional.
Plasma Cosmology has a long history
of peer-reviewed literature in
the nuclear and plasma sciences society
of the Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers, the IEEE.
The dysfunction of modern
institutionalized science is epitomized
by the absence of astronomers
at the IEEE conferences.
In my experience, there was
one notable exception, the
radio astronomer Gerrit Verschuur who used
his expertise to map local interstellar
Birkeland currents.
He wrote, "The role of large-scale
currents may be far more important in
defining interstellar structure than has
generally been recognized within the
astronomical community."
Plasma Cosmology supports the Electric
Sun model in another crucial aspect.
It successfully predicted
that stars are formed by
powerful electromagnetic pinches strung
along Birkeland current filaments
inside molecular clouds.
The electrical formation
easily accounts for the
observed but unexplained flickering of
newborn stars, and witnessed in SAFIRE.
The electromagnetic accretion process
is called Marklund convection, which
deposits heavy elements at the cool
center of the star, and hydrogen and
helium in the outermost atmosphere.
There is no thermonuclear core in a star.
Of course, the evidence has always been
plain to see in the fact that sunspots
are dark and cool compared to the
surrounding bright photosphere.
Astrophysics and particle physics are
the two pillars of cosmology.
The SAFIRE project knocks
down both pillars.
The two disciplines have fed off
each other's misinformation for decades
giving birth to futile and hugely
expensive projects; fusion power unlike
the Sun, the Large Hadron Collider in a
futile attempt to explain mass
independent of the matter exhibiting
mass, and the baseless quest for
imaginary dark matter
and dark energy.
As one theoretical physicist admitted, we
gratuitously blow the public's mind with
our crazy ideas.
As for the Big Bang, it
is plainly unscientific.
There is no idea how matter
is constructed, let alone
created, which defies
a principle of physics.
And thanks to Einstein, mass and
energy are physically undefinable, and we
have no physical idea how gravity works.
Einstein's universal speed limit of
light is applied to the electric force
and gravity, despite the inverse square
law applying to them, both being
independent of time.
Introducing a speed of light
delay renders orbital systems
like those in the atom and the solar
system incoherent and unstable.
This also reveals that
gravitational wave detectors
are not detecting gravity signals
because their coincident detection
assumes gravity operates
at the speed of light.
As for super-collapsed
gravitational objects like black holes
and neutron stars, Plasma Cosmology
explains in detail the phenomena
associated with them, both by theory and
experiment, and has no need of them.
The SAFIRE project exposes the misbegotten
taboo by fusion researchers against low
energy transmutation
and energy production.
That has held up progress in
nuclear power for more than 60 years.
In 1979, Juergens asked, "Could it be that
the search for thermonuclear energy is a
false trail that has been followed all
these years with no real hope of success?
If the Sun and the stars indeed succeed
in fusing lighter elements to form
heavier ones, are the relevant activities
carried out more or less in plain sight --
in their atmospheres?"
Supporting evidence has since
been found of an anti-
correlation between sunspot number, a
photospheric effect, and neutrino
count from the Sun.
In about the same year, 1979,
I read the work of a noted
French scientist, professor
C. Louis Kervran,
who in the 1960s published important
research demonstrating low-energy
biological transmutations of the
chemical elements which, surprise,
surprise, "...falls outside mainstream
physics and is not part of the
scientific discourse..."
according to Wikipedia.
However, the SAFIRE project is now verifying
low-energy nuclear transmutations.
In 1981, I read a small pamphlet
titled 'Electron Structure' by
Ralph Sansbury, an independent
researcher from New York.
He proposed an orbital model
of the electron which, when
applied to nucleons, provides a simple
alternative model of nuclear reactions
involving resonant catalytic
nuclear chemistry at low energies.
It provided a real physical basis
for understanding quantum mechanics.
It shows, the picture of fusion
requiring high-energy particle
collisions to overcome a high nuclear
Coulomb barrier is too restrictive.
Weber's electrodynamics shows a
short-range resonant attraction between
two like-charged particles,
such as two atomic nuclei.
With this in mind, I spoke
to Monty regularly in the design stage
about the requirements for the
experimental star and the detection of
elemental transmutation.
My friend and Thunderbolts
colleague, professor Donald
Scott also extended Juergens' Electric Sun
model by recognizing the PNP transistor
action of the anode tufts or photospheric
granulations, which was successfully
produced in phase one of
SAFIRE's proof of concept.
This mechanism was important
in the model to steady the radiant output
of the Sun, while in X-rays
the Sun is a variable star.
The steadiness of starshine
from billions of stars is one of
the disparities of the
standard thermonuclear model.
Don also provided electrical engineering
advice in the construction phase.
Don's most recent contribution
to understanding the
electromagnetic structure of Birkeland
current filaments, promises a deeper
understanding of the connection
between an electric star
and its interstellar circuit, as well as
many mysterious phenomena in deep space
and within the solar system.
The Thunderbolts team are grateful to Monty
and a remarkable dedicated team who
successfully designed and built the
historic experiment, then devised and
performed the SAFIRE experiments
employing the latest Design Of
Experiments methodology to independently
test the Electric Sun model.
Their professional investigation and results
change everything we thought we knew
about our place in the universe.
That, I hopefully predict, will have
a beneficial effect on all of us.
It is a far more inclusive, coherent and
hopeful, big picture than we have ever had.
Best of all, responses show, it
inspires people and just makes sense.

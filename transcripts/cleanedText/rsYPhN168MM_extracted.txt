You've just entered the
theater of an alien sky.
If the words and images seem strange
to you, there's a reason for this.
Our world was once a
vastly different place.
To experience this won't hurt you
and there is nothing to fear.
The Great Comet Venus
The planet Venus.
A closest planetary neighbor and
the brightest star in the sky.
Poets the world over have
long considered Venus
as a celestial symbol of
charm and enchantment.
The morning star transitioning to
evening star, then back to morningstar.
But more ancient traditions
about the planet
run much deeper with
enigmas at every turn.
Tales of wonder and
terror attached to Venus
seem entirely out of place
in our tranquil heavens.
Within the common theoretical
frameworks today, there's just no room
for the extraordinary sky-altering
events once remembered around the world.
That today's quiet planet could have
formally appeared as a great monster,
a serpent or dragon attacking the Earth,
may indeed seem too much to believe.
And yet anomalies
abound at every turn,
inexplicably Venus is the
only planet revered globally
as a celestial symbol of the mother
goddess, both the love goddess,
a goddess of unrivaled
radiance and an angry goddess
linked to earth-shaking and
even world-ending catastrophe.
This global contradiction
must have an explanation
even if that explanation has been
entirely missed in contemporary studies.
Today Venus moves on an orbit
67 million miles from the Sun,
compared to Earth's distance from
the Sun, of 96 million miles.
But many clues suggest a historic
connection of Venus to the Earth
and these clues include the
geometries of their motions today,
both the rotation of Venus and
its revolution around the Sun
exhibit a synchronous
connection to Earth's motions.
5 Venus' years equal
8 Earth years.
While the usual planetary rotation is from
west to east, Venus rotates in reverse,
though remarkably slowly in
contrast to the solar system norm.
A Venus day of full rotation
is longer than its year,
the time it takes to complete
a revolution around the Sun.
But a Venus' year almost exactly matches the
timing of its closest approach to the Earth
and at its closest approach Venus always shows
virtually the same hemisphere to Earth.
Synchronous or locked-in
relationships of this sort,
when they occur elsewhere
in the solar system,
are seen as evidence of a dynamic connection,
either currently or in the past.
Of course, astronomers have long
believed that Venus evolved peacefully
within its own enclave in the solar
system, for countless millions of years.
Given its proximity to
Earth, astronomers assumed
the planet to be rather
similar to our own,
calling it Earth's sister planet
and speculating freely on the
possibilities of life on Venus.
But such speculations
ended in the 1960s
when probes of the planet
stunned astronomers.
The first continuous close-up look at Venus'
surface came with the Magellan probe.
But Magellan moved into orbit around
the planet on August tenth, 1990.
Its radar images revealed features
as small as 100 meters across.
Almost nothing in the
earlier picture of Venus
could withstand the impact of
the discoveries that followed.
The surface of Venus has been radically
and catastrophically transformed
by events yet to
be comprehended.
The probes revealed the
superheated cauldron
with surface temperatures averaging
more than 460ºC or 900ºF.
And describing a new
profile of Venus,
astronomers summoned images
of a doomsday world.
Massive clouds of sulfuric acid and
carbon dioxide 20,000 meters high,
create an atmospheric pressure at the
surface some 90 times that of the Earth.
What has occurred in the
evolutionary history of Venus
to create a world never imagined
prior to the Space Age?
In this Discourse and others to follow
we'll explore the astonishing accord
between space-age surprises and the
ancient descriptions of Venus.
The greatest surprise for science
will lie in the global evidence
that Venus formerly roamed
the sky as a comet.
In the language of ancient myths and
symbols, the mother of all comets.
And this is where we find one
of the greatest challenges
to today's theoretical assumptions
about planetary history.
Though Immanuel Velikovsky
was not the first to notice
the cometary images
attached to Venus,
it was his book "Worlds in
Collision" published in 1950,
that brought the issue to public
attention with much greater force
than any evidential fragments that
preceded his best-selling book.
Velikovsky noted many tales
of disaster and upheaval
in which the agent of destruction not
only possessed comet-like attributes
but was named as
the planet Venus.
And so the anomalous comet-like
features of Venus in world mythology
became key pieces of a
historical argument.
He noted for example, that in Mexican
records Venus was the smoking star,
the very phrase natives
employed for a comet.
He found in both the Americas and the
Near East a recurring association
of Venus with celestial hair
and with a celestial beard.
Two of the most common hieroglyphs
for the comet in the ancient world.
Another popular glyph for the
comet was the serpent or dragon.
A form taken by the planet
Venus in virtually every land.
And the same planet among the Egyptians,
the Babylonians and other races
was called the Flame
or Torch of heaven,
a widespread symbol of a comet
amongst ancient peoples.
According to Velikovsky, the
history of the comet Venus
inspired one of the most powerful
themes of ancient myth and ritual,
a collective memory of catastrophe, global
upheaval, earth-shaking battles in the sky,
decimation of nations on earth,
an extended period of darkness
and the end of one world age
and the birth of another.
Having devoted decades to
following the global evidence,
I can confirm beyond
any reasonable doubt
that chroniclers the world over did
indeed describe Venus as a comet.
Not the planet that we observe
on a predictable path today.
From Egypt and Mesopotamia to
northern Europe and Africa,
from the Mediterranean to the South
Pacific, from China to the Americas,
the sky worshippers remembered the
comet Venus with awe and terror.
For those who've been following these
Discourses we'll connect the global story
of the comet Venus to our reconstruction
of the polar configuration.
The universal fears of comets trace
to the symbolic mother of all comets
without which the global accord could
never have arisen in the first place.
Why did the appearance of a comet
signify the death of a great king?
Why, more specifically, was it claimed to be
the soul of a deceased King rising in the sky?
Our goal will be to show that
the myth of the Great Comet
is the story of the radiant star that
animated the polar configuration.
As the central eye, heart and
soul of the primeval Sun.
The subsequent fate of that star is
indeed the story of the Great Comet.
Always look for the
underlying form!

Where did asteroids come from?
For decades, in the standard
story of our solar system,
we have been told that asteroids,
as well as comets and meteoroids,
are the so-called leftovers
of the early solar system.
In this view, comets and even
asteroids have been proposed
as a possible source
of our planet's oceans.
Of course, when spacecraft
have visited comets
they've not found anything like the
dirty snowballs of conventional theory.
In this conclusion to his
three-part presentation,
physicist Eugene Bagashov explores
the latest scientific papers
into the evidence for the water of the
asteroids Bennu and Ryugu, respectively,
and what it means for an understanding of
the solar system's history and origins.
Spectral data from both Ryugu
and Bennu seems pretty similar.
One of the prominent features of spectra
of these bodies is the high absorption
at the infrared wavelength
of about 2.7 microns,
and the researchers acknowledge that it
must be associated with the OH- groups
in the minerals on the surface.
However, their idea of how it
got there is pretty peculiar.
They think that it's the remnants of
the water that formed in the inner belt
together with the parent
asteroids of Bennu and Ryugu
and later was evaporated when they
migrated into the inner solar system.
Now of course, we are well
aware of another process
which is considered to be fundamental
for the electric comet hypothesis,
the idea that hydroxyl groups
and water itself might be formed
due to the electrochemical interaction
between the protons from the solar wind
and oxygen in the minerals on
the surface of an airless body,
such as a comet or an asteroid.
A few years ago, this process has been
confirmed in the laboratory experiments
that were simulating the interaction
of the solar wind with silicates.
For more details, I'd recommend watching
Thunderbolts Project documentary
The Electric Comet
and brilliant Franklin Anariba's talks available
at the Thunderbolts Project YouTube channel.
So in principle, the detection of OH
signal should be considered trivial
and not really indicative of
anything in the EU perspective.
These bodies might have
been formed anywhere,
including the inner
solar system itself,
and still demonstrate the
same spectral absorption line.
Nevertheless, with regards to
that, even in research papers
the scientists from both teams
keep repeating the mantra
that it was the asteroids and comets
that brought water to the Earth
whereas it is already known that there
is at least as much water in the mantle
as on the surface of our planet.
How would Ryugu and Bennu keep any
significant amount of water ice anyway
if the temperatures on their surface are
higher than the sublimation limit for water?
It's probably important
to emphasize here
that what Hayabusa2 and
Osiris-Rex are observing
is only structural OH-
groups, not the water itself.
Even more so, they have
to go quite a long way
to somehow get rid of the
water in their scenario.
In particular, Hayabusa2 scientists have to
imply a significant radioactive heating
of the parent body of Ryugu asteroid
in order to heat it up enough
to produce the water-poor minerals
that are observed on its surface.
And on top of that, they have
to imply impact scenario
as they note that in order to produce
the observed spectrum of Ryugu,
a short-term catastrophic
heating is also needed.
But at the same time, they note that impacts
would heat only a part of the surface,
so they need a lot of them.
So maybe in this case a single short-term
electrical heating would be more appropriate.
Otherwise, the spectra
of both Bennu and Ryugu
are more or less consistent with the
high abundance of phyllosilicates,
that is essentially
sedimentary rock.
Now, how would sedimentary
rock end up on a tiny asteroid
otherwise than as a result of its
ejection from a much larger planet,
is a good question that we should
address to the Astrophysical community.
Moreover, the present data from Osiris-Rex
shows that the specific spectral feature
of magnesium-rich Phyllosilicates
at 16 micrometers is not observed,
from which the researchers conclude that
the minerals should be iron-rich instead
and that's not all there is.
"... spectra of Bennu also exhibit
two features at 555 and 340 cm^(-1)
that are probably attributable,
at least in part, to magnetite."
In my opinion, this is
a potential indication
that this asteroid was once part
of a larger planet such as Mars,
although I wouldn't discount Venus
and Earth or Moon and Mercury, too.
In previous decades, there has been some
debate regarding possible formation
of nano crystals of magnetite
in Martian meteorites
due to the influence of
hypothetical bacterial life,
though the shapes of crystals don't seem to
match the ones produced by bacteria on Earth.
I think it would be very funny if the
samples collected at Ryugu and Bennu
would show these biogenic
crystals of magnetite instead,
proving that these rocks
originate from Earth.
But that is only one of
many possibilities, of course.
Most likely the minerals
would be transformed too much
during their excavation
process anyway.
Last thing I wish to mention with
regards to the spectrum of these objects
is that it demonstrates
reddening at large phase angles,
that is when the detector is
placed far away from the line
connecting the Sun
and the asteroid.
At the moment, scientists cannot
explain this peculiar property,
but perhaps it is caused by a much higher degree
of ordering of the material on the surface,
which would be consistent with
the scenario of their excavation
under the influence of
extremely strong electric fields
but probably pretty hard to explain
from a rubble pile standpoint.
Speaking of the electric comet ideas,
a recent press release by NASA
states that some unexpected dust particles
were observed near the asteroid Bennu.
Now, I would envision
two scenarios here.
First of all, those might be some
sort of electrostatic dust fountains
that are produced due to the potential
difference across the surface of the asteroid.
It is well known and acknowledged
that the dayside of such objects
should be charged positively
with respect to the nightside.
There are two primary
causes of that effect.
Firstly, the photo ionization of the surface on
the dayside makes it more positively charged
and secondly, the solar wind is
blocked by the asteroid itself,
so that it's night side is experiencing
a plasma shadowing, so to speak,
and the solar wind protons cannot expand into
this shadowed region as quickly as electrons,
so together this might cause potential
differences of the order of a few hundred volts
between the day side
and the night side.
But of course, so more localized potential
differences on the surface are also possible
due to some topographic features, different elemental
composition and albedo across the surface,
its potential local
magnetization, and so on.
It's interesting that the
researchers themselves
note some peculiar reflectance differences
across the surface of both asteroids
and they also note that it might be produced
through some process of dust transfer,
the nature of which
"remains unclear".
However, to be completely fair, the
gravity on these asteroids it's so weak
that according to the
researchers, at least on Bennu,
"...material can achieve orbit
through downslope migration."
So dust particles might just be
rolling downhill and end up in space.
That is if we assume that no other
forces are acting upon this dust,
which is obviously not the case.
But anyway, the second
scenario I would envision
is, that these are not dust
particles in the first place.
Unfortunately I don't know all
the details of this detection,
as the only information we have on it is
basically one paragraph from NASA press release.
So perhaps the option I'd like
to propose might be ruled out,
but from the publicly available data
it still seems to be a viable option.
So I'd propose that these bright dots
that we see on the NavCam images
might actually be just charged particles
emanating from the vicinity of Bennu,
and picked up by the camera.
What exactly these
particles are,
ions or electrons, or maybe
even photons, is not clear yet
but any of these, as far as I understand,
could trigger the camera matrix pixels.
And it is clear, I think, that in
this case, whatever they are,
their production should be caused
by some electromagnetic interaction
of the solar wind plasma, or maybe
the cosmic rays with the asteroid.
Continuing this topic, it's quite a
shame that both Hayabusa2 and Osiris-Rex
are very poorly equipped to study the really
important properties of Ryugu and Bennu,
that is their interaction
with space plasma.
It might sound ridiculous, but none of
these spacecraft have Langmuir probes,
plasma wave suits of instruments, or any
detectors of charged particles whatsoever.
The only thing we have in this department,
is the magnetometer on Mascot lander
that spent some 17 hours on
Ryugu in early October of 2018
and then died when
its batteries ran out.
Well, hopefully we'll see some data from
it eventually, as so far I've seen none.
I suspect that the instrument might show
some remnant magnetization of Ryugu,
as if it represents a
piece of planetary crust
it should bear some imprint
of its magnetic field.
But also, if it was excavated electrically,
the currents running through and around it
would also generate some fields that
might be retained in the asteroidal rock.
Perhaps this magnetometer might
register some other interesting effects,
for example the changing magnetic fields
during the progression of day and night cycle,
as the surface of the asteroid charges
and recharges positively and negatively,
or the variation of
the magnetic field
due to the interaction of the
asteroid with the solar wind plasma.
There is a slight hope that Rex's X-ray
spectrometer on board of Osiris-Rex
at some point might detect soft X-rays resulting
from Bennu's interaction with the solar wind.
The hope is only slight, because the
lowest value of energy it might detect
is 700 electron volts which
might be a bit too high,
as for example Rosetta
mission has shown
that the negative electric
potential of Comet 67P nucleus
with respect to the ambient solar
wind is only about 200 to 400 volts,
and only about 200 volts of
potential difference were detected
by Cassini spacecraft at
the Saturnian moon Hyperion,
and Pluto emits X-rays charge
exchange with the solar wind
at only 300 to 600 volts
of potential difference.
Summing it all up, I would say that
the data that has been released so far
does not contradict the scenario under
which the asteroids Bennu and Ryugu
represent a
relatively homogeneous,
internally strong but highly porous rocks
that have been electrically excavated
from the surface of one of the
bodies in the inner solar system
during a relatively recent
planetary catastrophe.
Their complex surfaces indicate
that most likely this material
does not originate
from the asteroid belt.
However, as I've noted
in the very beginning,
the so-called
rubble pile scenario
also does not directly contradict
the Electric Universe paradigm.
But, my personal opinion
is that these bodies
are most likely internally
homogeneous and strong.
As the instrumentation onboard of both
Hayabusa2 and Osiris-Rex spacecraft
is very limited in terms of studying the
plasma environments of Ryugu and Bennu,
we're left with only observations of secondary
evidence for their electrical activity,
like these dust particles
or whatever they are,
that were spotted in
the vicinity of Bennu.
But hopefully, we'll be able to draw at
least some conclusions from these missions.
It would be especially interesting
to see the results of the analysis
of collected samples when
they would return to Earth,
but that is still
quite a long time away.

It's one of the great enduring
mysteries of solar physics --
why is the Sun's lower corona hundreds
of times hotter than the Sun's photosphere?
For many decades, scientists on Earth
have sought an answer to the puzzle,
doing so exclusively within the confines
of the standard model of the Sun.
Recently, a team of scientists reported
observational evidence that the mysterious
rise in temperature could be driven
by so-called “magnetic plasma pulses."
As reported by Phys.org,
an international team of
scientists, led by the
University of Sheffield,
have discovered previously
undetected observational evidence of
frequent energetic wave
pulses the size of the UK,
transporting energy from the solar
surface to the higher solar atmosphere.
Of course, like all scientific
data, both what the scientists
are looking for and how they
interpret what they see,
is governed by their
theoretical premises.
In this episode, we asked Dr. Donald
Scott for a comprehensive overview
of the Electric Sun model’s explanation
for the mystery of coronal heating.
For many years, the
mainstream astrophysical
community has been seeking an
explanation for the tremendously
hot temperatures of
the Sun's lower corona.
It's a classic problem,
they've been doing it for
decades, they've been
worried about it for decades,
but that Sun's lower
corona is more than 300
times hotter than the
6,000 Kelvin photosphere,
which is below it, if you can imagine
300 x 6,000, it's in the millions of Kelvin.
And so, it's outrageous that the Sun's
outer layer should be hotter than its inner
layer, close to where they
presume the source of the heat is.
This search has been punctuated by a 
series of press releases, especially in Phys.org
which is the source of all these
press releases, NASA press releases
and stories about
these sorts of things.
So for example, I'll just go 
through a bunch of them.
In December 2007, one of these things
came out and said what they included
in their words were, "Powerful magnetic
Alfvén waves in the electrically charged gas
near the Sun have always been a leading
candidate for why this happens.
Alfvén waves are created by
convective motions, get this,
when convective motions and sound
waves push magnetic fields around."
I didn't know you could move
magnetic fields by playing rock music
and push them around.
But that's the kind of level of under-
standing or misunderstanding that these
things are full of, they
always refer to magnetic
reconnection which
Hannes Alfvén essentially
demolished as a non-process, but they
always prefer the magnetic reconnection.
Also, like in June 2012, there
was an article 'Space tornadoes
power the atmosphere of the Sun',
where they make a
great emphasis on
"Applied mathematicians
from the University of
Sheffield...say that the
solar tornadoes carry
the energy from below the Sun's
surface up to the lower corona” and
they are of course in the
form of magnetic waves.
These are applied
mathematicians who never got
close to an observatory,
but they're explaining
how all of this stuff
works, supposedly.
In July of 2018, there was 
one press release that I
will spend some time talking
about, if you don't mind.
The story is this, it says,
"...coronal heating problem begins
with a green spectral line observed
during an 1869 total eclipse.
Because different elements emit light
at characteristic wavelengths, scientists
can use spectrometers to
analyze light from the Sun
and identify its composition,"
that's quite right.
"But the green line observed
in 1869 didn't correspond
to any known elements on Earth.
So scientists thought perhaps
they'd discovered a new element
that didn't exist on Earth
and they called it coronium."
Because it was observed in the corona.
Anyway, that was one of 
the first fictions that these
people have invented
along with black holes and
neutron stars and...
Anyway, "Not until 70 years
later, a Swedish physicist
discovered that the element
responsible for the emission is
of all things, iron,
superheated to the point that it's
ionized 13 times, that is to say it is
so hot that it has released
13 of its outer electrons,
leaving it with just about half the
electrons of a normal atom of iron.
And therein lies the problem:
Scientists have calculated that
such high levels of ionization would
require coronal temperatures of
around 2 million Kelvin, actually.
So anyway, that's where the
whole problem was discovered.
But, these press releases continue,
year after year, and they talk about
heating of different elements 
that are heated at different rates,
they're right at the doorstep,
it seems to me, of when
they start talking about
ionization, of recognizing
what the source of the whole
phenomenon is, that it is electrical.
Those ions are ripped out
of there by electric fields.
But anyway, those ions that
do escape the Sun, are those
ions form what's called the solar wind.
All of these press releases in my mind
tend to use what I
call ‘purple prose.’
A perfect example of this is on August
2018, it says, "For the first time, a
NASA spacecraft will swoop
in and touch the Sun."
’Purple prose’ is text that's so
extravagant or ornate, or flowery
as to break the flow
of a person's text
and draw excessive attention
to itself; I am reading
from the dictionary, that's what
purple prose is defined as being.
Well if that isn't the
purple prose, "It's going to
swoop in and touch 
the surface of the Sun."
The Sun doesn't have any
surface, first part, but
anyway, that's the level,
I'm trying to get across
to you, that of the PR, of 
purpleness of the prose,
based on a really fundamental
misunderstanding of what is actually
going on up there.
The last press release: so let me 
talk a little bit about my reaction to it.
It does mention the four
suites of scientific
instruments that are on
the Parker Solar Probe.
First of all, that Parker Solar Probe is an
absolutely astounding marvel of engineering.
To get that probe as close
to the Sun as they’re
going to get it (and it has
actually made one close
approach already),
is just marvelous.
And the instrumentation that's on board
is apparently exactly what they need.
Here are some important numbers
that I get from that release, in fact, they
emphasize that. The Parker Solar Probe's
closest approach to the Sun is going
to be around 4 million miles, that's
six million four hundred
thousand kilometers.
Now, the Sun's radius is about
695,000 kilometers and therefore
the Parker Solar Probe's closest
approach to the Sun is going
to be 9.25 solar radii.
That's the closest that the
probe is going to get to.
In 2016, I gave a talk, at the EU Conference,
that extends the Juergens model
and I mean the motive for
talking to you this morning
is that I'd like people to be
familiar with what Juergens,
and to what extent I've been
able to extend his model,
explain the very things that 
these folks are looking for, except
I submit, we've got the real reason
that these phenomena occur,
and it isn't going to be
discovered or harvested by fancy
mathematical analysis or computer
simulations, especially when you don't
understand at the beginning, what is going on.
So anyway, in that talk,
if you take a look at
slide five just for example,
shows the three major layers
of the Sun's outer edge, the Sun
is positively charged and
it's full of positive ions that are
ready to escape, and the photosphere,
that you see here, consists of
charges, clumped into anode tufts.
These serve as 
a barrier to other
positive charges within the Sun. It's
like a dam at the end of a reservoir.
That's really the Juergens
model of the Sun.
And this is really the basis for everything
that the Electric Universe thinks about the Sun.
Anyway, slide twelve shows the 3 plots
there, which I've shown many times.
The top curve is a plot of the
voltage, with points on the line.
It starts at the surface of the
Sun on the left, and goes out
through the top of one of those
tufts, those photospheric tufts,
out toward the corona.
It's like the cross section
of a dam, at the end of
the reservoir, we'll come
back to that in a minute.
The middle plot is a plot of the
electric field, and the electric field
is simply a force, a force
directed toward the right on any
positive ion in that area and while the
chromosphere, that is from points B to D, while
in there, the flow is laminar.
That is to say that's a ski-jump
that goes down there and any flow,
whether it's electrons, or
protons, in an electric field,
that laminar flow is a 
dethermalized flow.
Laminar flow is the opposite 
of turbulent, it's slick.
Turbulence is measured, at least 
in a plasma, by its temperature,
so when you say a plasma is
hot, it means the elements in
that plasma are really in
random, violent random motion.
But anyway, the bottom plot there,
it shows that the ions are moving,
it's just a plot
of the velocity.
They're moving very fast after
point D and they become
turbulent, and so that red
region at the bottom there
shows high temperature.
This is the reason for the Sun's hot chromosphere;
those ions are coming out of there and colliding in the
lower corona with other neutral
atoms and other ions that
are there to start with and
they go out toward the
right hand side and after they get
past that area, there are no collisions.
So anyway, slide 16, to jump ahead.
These are the properties
of the fast solar wind.
Essentially, what is a fancy
name for the flow of those ions
that we’ve just seen coming over the
tops of those tufts in the photosphere.
Then it emanates from regions of the Sun's
surface where there are no sunspots.
A sunspot is a place where there are no
photospheric tufts and that's why it looks
black and when you look at the regular
surface of the Sun through a telescope,
hopefully it's a solar telescope
for otherwise you'll go blind
instantly, but you can
see these photospheric
tufts, so they move around
and they disappear.
That solar wind approaches 
800 km/s, at approximately
9 solar radii away from
the Sun, remember that.
The Parker Probe is going to go in 
there, get in there, to about 9 solar radii.
So at that point, this fast solar
wind is going about 800 km/s.
So, they should be able to measure
 a very intense solar wind flow of
ions, at that closest approach.
Go to slide 17 and you'll
see that only a few ions are
energetic enough to get
over the top of the dam.
You can see in purple there, they 
constitute a, this is important,
they constitute a low
density -- high velocity flow.
That is to say, they're falling from
a great height, a great voltage,
which is the same thing, and therefore
they get very, very fast at the bottom.
But not too many of them make it 
over the top of the dam, so it's a low
density, it's not very much water
in that flow, not very many ions.
Slide 18 shows a hydraulic analogy of the
fast solar wind and it shows what that water
would look like when 
coming over that sluice gate.
Slide 19 talks about
the slow solar wind.
Now, that's a different animal.
The slow solar wind emanates from
the equatorial region of the Sun,
mainly from sunspots, and its maximum
velocity is only about half the fast
solar wind velocity, but
its ion density is more
than 3 times denser than
the fast solar wind.
But it's much slower
than the fast solar wind.
Now why, what happens?
Well, in a sunspot, there
are no photospheric
tufts, the dam has been
broken or removed and so
it's the, water it’s just,
or in this case the ions, they're
just free to flow outward.
And slide 24 shows a low
velocity -- high density flow.
The difference between the two water
levels in that picture is not very much.
The river is only a few
feet higher than the level
of the land onto which
the water is flowing.
But, it's a lot of water, therefore
it's a high density flow.
The next slide, slide 25, just shows
the bottom of a sluice and
both the fast and the slow solar
winds; where the fast wind comes out
of the tops of the tufts, and the slow
solar wind comes out of a sunspot.
Both of them can create very
strong turbulence when they collide
with ions farther out, at the bottom of
the corona, just like the water here at the
bottom of the sluice gate.
It is just colliding with the
motionless water and perhaps
some rocks at the bottom
on this slide and it becomes
quite turbulent, and as I
said before, temperature is a
measure of this turbulence.
So that's the explanation for this hot, solar
temperature at the bottom of the corona.
The next slide, slide 27
is a statement made by
a well-known helio-
astronomer, Dr. Grail.
He said, "Our results indicate that the
acceleration of the solar wind is almost
complete by 10 Solar Radii, much closer
to the Sun than had been expected.
This is about where the
Parker Probe is going to get to
and the acceleration is almost
complete at that point.
He said, this is important,
"this suggests that the acceleration
of the solar wind and
the heating of the solar
corona occur in essentially
the same region,
and thus that the underlying
mechanisms may be strongly linked.
And I remember to this day,
when I presented that I said,
strongly linked, you got to be kidding,
they're the same mechanism!
They are the electric mechanism
described by Juergens' model
and it's obvious what's
going on if you just
realize what the cause is,
it's really pretty simple.
And anyway, therefore,
given the fact that the
Parker Probe isn't going to
approach the Sun closely
enough to even get into the corona,
even the outer edges of the corona,
they only extend out about four,
or maybe at most five solar radii.
Now, the corona itself exists
way out but it becomes
dark mode plasma,
you can't see it.
I think what does happen
is that the corona
forms in its outer regions these,
what are called coronal caps.
And those coronal
caps are the basis for
Birkeland currents that
go out farther, but
it's a filamentary kind
of a flow out farther.
We'll see, perhaps they can measure, if
they're out that far, how these Birkeland
currents do flow farther
than coronal caps, we'll see.
Anyway, slide 31 just lays it out, it says that
Juergens' model explains why the plasma
corona exists in the first place and it
explains the inverted temperature profile
and it explains how the strong electric
field above the photospheric tufts
accelarates the ions
of the fast solar wind.
Slide 32 is my
contribution to this.
I submit that that
extension of Juergens'
work, explains that the solar photospheric
tufts are variable electrical
barriers for the positive ions
attempting to escape from the Sun.
They're also traps for
incoming electrons, we
haven't mentioned that this
morning, but they are.
Why there are two very different
solar winds, one fast, one slow?
Because they come from two
different places and are formed by
two different electrical, I emphasize
that, electrical mechanisms.
Why the fast wind is faster than the
slow wind, why it has a lower density?
That's because of where it comes from.
Why the electron temperature is the
same in both winds -- that's simply
because the electrons don't go through
the same mix master that the ions do.
Why do the tufts go away and collapse
in a short time -- yeah because
those photospheric tufts fill up
with electrons and they neutralize
and they disappear,
relegated out of existence
by recombination between
electrons and ions.
And last but not least, why
is the fast solar wind
why does it come out of the coronal
holes? Well, a coronal hole is simply
a place where there are
no sunspots, so they
come out of the typical
photospheric tufts.
Here's the important point -- none
of these mechanisms occur at
locations accessible
to the Parker Probe.
None of them.
All of these mechanisms occur
way down at the base of the
corona in or just above the
photosphere and the chromosphere,
and so the Parker Probe
hasn't got a ghost of a
chance of getting into where
these mechanisms occur.
And it will be impossible for
the probe to prove anything
about magnetic Alfvén waves,
I'm sure that they're dying to do that,
but it will be impossible, because the
probe can't possibly get in close enough,
that is to say below the corona and
observe what's really happening.
No matter how complicated
the mathematical analysis or
advanced computer 
simulations are, it's not
going to be of any help
if you don't understand
the electrical nature of what's
going on in the first place.
Stay tuned for Don Scott's
and Wal Thornhill's
analysis of SAFIRE
Project's latest update.

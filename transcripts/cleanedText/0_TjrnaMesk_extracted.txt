Welcome to the

Here is some footage
of a tadpole embryo
from Tufts University's Levin
Lab for regenerative medicine.
Electrical gradients
have been made visible
and we can see that they
precede the development
features of the
tadpole's face and body.
The relevance of electric frontiers
in biology is no small matter.
Planaria regenerate their
tail end into a second head.
Tadpole is bioelectrically modified to
grow additional eyes, genetically altered,
so that a particular
frequency of blue light
would stimulate ion regulators
in their cell walls.
This allowed electric gradients in
their body to be precisely changed
to match the electrical
characteristics
that cue the body to grow all
the tissues required for an eye.
This is the leading edge of knowledge in
the science of how life forms on Earth.
Use electricity to shape or
instruct the tissues of their body.
The significance of these
bioelectric principles
can be understood from fellow scientists
who have been amazed by their implications.
Some animals are known for the
regeneration of whole appendages.
The scientists who come to take part
in explorations at the Levin Lab,
use experiments and
computer modeling
to learn what conditions are
needed for natural regeneration.
Their experiments touch on several
paths for future medicine
all informed by how a body's infrastructure
of bioelectricity makes executive decisions.
Change the voltage exerted
upon cell membranes
and you can modify genetic
expression in the cell
so that a group of cells carry out
a very different plan of growth.
Electrical managing forces inform cell
development and response to injury
as a holistic system of
physiological decision-making
integrated with the body's
biochemical and genetic instructions.
A couple of years ago the Levin Lab
showed the tumor type abnormal growth,
administered to
developing tadpoles,
could be remissed with
a 30% success rate
by way of changing cellular
electrical behavior.
Back then, this was once again entailed
by genetically altering the organisms
to have light-controllable
cell membrane potential.
In the beginning of their
abstract they noted,
"It has long been known that the
resting potential of tumor cells
is depolarized relative to
their normal counterparts."
Later on, the authors put forth
that this bioelectric signature
could be used to
locate tumorous cells
and it appears to be functionally
required for tumors to form,
according to these experiments.
This year, dr. Michael
Levin and his colleagues
have discovered a practical new means
of readjusting electric gradients
that might soon become medicine.
Prozac, which is a selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitor or SSRI,
was recently used to reform the electrical
behavior of laboratory cancer cells
specifically administered
to change voltage gradients.
The authors declared this work
a successful proof-of-concept.
They said that existing and novel
drugs could be used as an alternative
to highly toxic chemotherapy.
The authors of this
study redefined cancer
as a network disorder affecting the
ability of cells to properly interact
with a morphodynamic field
of instructive signals
that keeps proliferation
and migration orchestrated
towards the anatomical
needs of the host organism.
In other words, a failure
to communicate or regulate.

In episode 2 of this presentation,
Dr. Michael Clarage continues
his discussion of the Earth's
electrical environment
and his ongoing role as a
scientist on the SAFIRE Project.
In episode one Dr. Clarage offered his
thoughts on a recent space.com report
on mysteries fluctuations of
electrons in Earth's atmosphere.
We ask Dr. Clarage to further explain his
thoughts on the best experimental approach
to investigating electrical phenomena
associated with planets and stars.
As the primary astrophysicist
on the SAFIRE Project
it's my job to design
the experiments
that will best allow us to explore
electrical aspects of planets and stars.
What might the electrical potential
between a star and a planet look like.
Here's one model that I am working on, the
Earth is on the left the Sun on the right,
that squiggle blue line represents the
rough structure of electrical potential
at any point between
a planet and a star.
Drawing is quite representational, just trying
to sketch out the general shape of things.
This model is based partly on
experimental data from SAFIRE
partly on known geophysical data
and partly on NASA satellite
data of the Sun and solar wind.
On the left, the potential rises
quickly to about 300,000 volts
as you move away
from the planet.
This is that 'fair weather'
potential I mentioned.
The sawtooth squiggles as
you move up are those bands
of increasing and decreasing electron
density mentioned in the space.com article.
Then continuing to move away from the
Earth we reach the Van Allen belts.
The inner Van Allen belt, dominated by positive
charges, is the high point of the curve,
then a potential drop as you move
out into the outer Van Allen belt,
dominated by negative charges,
then we have a long slow rise in the
potential as we move towards the Sun.
There is data to support a
600 volts rise in potential
from the Van Allen
belts to the Sun.
I've spoken about that at several conferences
and I'll give you the references below.
Putting everything together on to one graph
like this is really breaking new ground.
Astrophysicists are not talking about
things this way, not yet at least.
This is understandable, every scientist has
enough difficulty keeping up with data
in their own sub-specialty.
It is difficult to be combining measurements
from the atmosphere, the ionosphere,
Van Allen belts, interplanetary space,
solar atmosphere and photosphere.
And like I said, none of us on the SAFIRE
team are pushing any particular model
the real shape of that curve
between a planet and a star
might look very different
from what I've drawn here.
This still needs much
more exploration
and continued work matching
SAFIRE data to NASA data,
and further reinterpretation of the
NASA data in an electrical context.
Pictures such as these, of the
overall electrical potential layers,
are not yet seen in books because most
astronomers have continued to assume
that charge separations are not
maintainable at cosmological distances.
Is almost an irony to it, because my little
drawing is actually the much simpler
first-order effect
natural in plasmas.
It should have been the
first thing people look for,
but since planetary charge separations
were not considered possible
investigations were forced to
look at the much more complicated
second-order effects of complex magnetic
fields and induced local currents.
With the SAFIRE chamber, we are in a
unique position to run experiments
exploring the possible overall
electrical nature of stars and planets.
Coming back to the space.com article,
I would propose that the phrase
'The case of the missing electrons'
is somewhat of a misnomer.
Calling them missing, implies there
is something wrong about it,
like an awkward glitch in what should be
nature's otherwise tidy charge neutrality.
I have become convinced that the
whole mantra of charge neutrality
is preventing us
from seeing reality.
Nature is almost never
charge neutral,
and by that I mean, if you look at
anything interesting in nature,
like a cell, or an organelle in a
cell, or a tree, or a thunderstorm,
or the Northern Lights, nature
is always separating charges.
Inside our cells all the workings of
life are powered by charge separations
across chloroplasts and
mitochondria membranes.
Bees always have a greater
electrical potential than flowers
so there are always electrical
fields connecting bees and flowers.
And when a bee pollinates a flower
there is a quite measurable
and very exciting exchange of
electric charge between the two.
The more we look at what nature is
actually doing, the more we see that
charge neutrality seldom exists
in any dynamic environment.
Coming back to the
ionosphere, I would say that
the shells of free electrons are not
missing from regions of the ionosphere.
I would propose that the
electrons in the ionosphere
are simply arranging
themselves as needed.
Now, as needed for what?
That's a really good question.
There was another recent article, a review
article that make similar mistakes,
I would say, in describing
large-scale electrical phenomena.
This was the press release describing
an unexpected Star Trek shield
protecting the Earth
from 'killer electrons'.
Again there's an undertone
like something is wrong,
like the Earth should not have
high energy electrons around it.
Or if it does, then that
somehow a scary thing.
Think an analogy might help here,
by way of analogy you could say
that the stomach protects
the rest of the body
from the dangerous
enzymes and acids in it.
You could certainly say that,
but you need to acknowledge that
it's all part of a larger structure.
The enzymes are needed inside the
stomach for specific reasons.
The high potency acids are supposed to be
there, for the stomach to do its function.
When it comes to studying
planetary and stellar structures,
it would be better if we all
would broaden our thinking.
We would learn much more
if we came to expect
that cosmological structures are
performing useful functions also.
For reasons that we
do not yet understand
the Earth is supposed to have
high energy electrons around it.
That is a required part
of a larger structure.
Just because we do not understand, does
not mean it's a dangerous accident.
Electrical plasmas naturally form
barriers, membranes if you will,
these plasma barriers, or membranes, let
through some particles, but not others.
We have a lot to
learn about that,
our theoretical understanding of
all this is still very primitive,
but such plasma membranes have been
known about for about a hundred years.
The SAFIRE team is trying
to take us a step back
and explore experimentally
some of the basic assumptions
about the electrical nature
of the solar system.

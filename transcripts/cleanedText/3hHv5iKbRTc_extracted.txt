Welcome to Space News from the Electric
Universe, brought to you by

It is a fact known to any high school
student, electric currents produce
magnetic fields.
Incredibly, this law of physics is
virtually nowhere evident in the
so-called Standard Model of the universe.
It is therefore no surprise that many
so-called baffling discoveries in the
space sciences have involved the
detection of magnetic fields at
virtually all scales throughout the
universe. A Universetoday article from
2011 describes the conundrum for
astronomers. It states, "The mention of
cosmic-scale magnetic fields is still
likely to be met with an uncomfortable
silence in some astronomical circles -- and
after a bit of foot-shuffling and throat-
clearing, the discussion will be moved on
to safer topics. But look, they're out
there.
They probably do play a role in galaxy
evolution, if not galaxy formation, and
are certainly a feature of the
interstellar medium and the
intergalactic medium." In recent years
one of the great mysteries in
astrophysics was the detection of
astonishingly powerful magnetic fields
in so-called young galaxies. A 2008
report on such a discovery reads,
"Astronomers have made the first direct
measurement of the magnetic field in a
young, distant galaxy, and the result is
a big surprise.
Looking at a faraway protogalaxy seen
as it was 6.5 billion years ago, the
scientists measured a magnetic field at
least 10 times stronger than that of our
own Milky Way.
They had expected just the opposite."
But what is the cause of these magnetic
fields?
The answer to this question, which we
revealed in the opening statement of
this report, remains elusive for
astrophysicists. Today, increasingly fine
data across the entire electromagnetic
spectrum only deepens the astronomical
mysteries. Recently, scientists in
Germany, using the Hubble Space Telescope,
have detected extremely strong magnetic
fields in the quasar which is believed
to be about 4 billion light-years from
Earth. The magnetic fields were measured
at 200 million Gauss. In comparison, the
strength of the magnetic field at
Earth's surface is only about one Gauss.
The scientists state that the magnetic
fields are very close to the quasar's
theoretical central black hole and they
suggest that the magnetic fields play a
role in expelling matter from the black
hole's accretion disk.
However, how confident should
astrophysicists be in their ideas about
magnetic fields in space or their
belief in the existence of black holes.
Scientists from the university of
GÃ¶ttingen in Germany have detected, for
the first time, the existence of very
strong magnetic field of 200 million
Gauss immediately next to a supermassive
black hole in a quasar four billion
light-years distant. As a comparison, the
magnetic fields on Earth are measured in
the range of one Gauss.
The report states that, "The existence of
such magnetic fields could explain why
so much of the matter, which happens it
to enter into the surroundings field of a
Black Hole, still manages to escape." Now
years ago I was at a meeting of
professionals
where leading astrophysicists admitted,
"When we don't understand something we
blame it on magnetism!"
But what that leading astrophysicists
didn't say is that astrophysicists don't
understand how the magnetic fields are
generated!
If you have a look at Scholarpedia on the
web and it says and I quote, "The origin of
the first magnetic fields in the
universe is still a mystery"
and it goes on, "It calls for a mechanism
to sustain and organize the magnetic
field." Of course mysterious dynamos are
called upon to provide these magnetic
fields.
You'll notice in astrophysics that these
dynamos are in fact inside the Earth,
inside the Sun and now inside galaxies
but no one knows how they work,
they've never been shown theoretically
to work so they remain mysterious.
Meanwhile, plasma cosmologists have shown
both theoretically and experimentally that
the magnetic fields in galaxies are due
to electric currents flowing into the
centers along the spiral arms of the
galaxy.
Now when the current reaches the center
of the galaxy
it is twisted into a plasmoid where all
of the electromagnetic energy is stored
until that plasmoid becomes
unstable and ejects matter in jets along
the galaxy axis, as observed. And all of
this was published and is easy to read
in Eric Lerner's book, The Big Bang Never
Happened. In plasma physics the plasmoid
is the most concentrated form of
electromagnetic energy known.
You can store the energy of a room full
of capacitors in something a few
millimeters across, the tiny donut-shaped
plasmoid. That plasmoid of course, to
contain that energy, has an intense
magnetic field itself generated just by
the electric currents and the way they
twist themselves together.
So this discovery confirms the plasma
cosmology model.
This means of course that black holes
are mathematical fiction.
Now at our Electric Universe conferences
in the past year or two,
Steve Crothers has shown that the
mathematics of black holes is nonsense;
that the most significant argument
against them is that the mathematics
invoke a universe where there is no
other matter,
it exists on its own, they can be no
other matter in its universe.
If you want to have a simple explanation
you could look at his paper called, Black
Holes, Unicorns, and All That Jazz. At the
heart of all of this is the problem that
physicists themselves don't understand
magnetism, gravity or mass
so this talk about what's going on in the
centers of galaxies is complete nonsense.
I'll be talking about all of these
subjects and particularly "The Long Road
to Understanding Gravity" at my
presentation at the Electric Universe
conference this year in Phoenix, in June.
There's a great deal of evidence against
Black Holes from other observations that
have been made in recent years,
one is the idea that these massive
gravitational concentrations called
Black Holes will cause gravitational
lensing.
Now, the stars orbiting the so-called
supermassive black hole at the center of
the Milky Way have been observed over a
number of years and they orbit this
so-called Black Hole at high speeds and
their orbits have been tracked but in
no case has there been any evidence of
gravitational lensing of those stars.
Another thing that was observed recently
and was tracked was a cloud of gas and
dust which was approaching the center of
the Milky Way, the so-called black hole,
and it was expected to be gobbled up by
the black hole but that didn't happen
and that was a surprise.
The point is, it's not a black hole and
therefore the forces in action there are
not purely gravitational as this
research has just shown.
Like the theoretical wormhole celebrated
in the recent blockbuster film
"Interstellar", black holes are a beloved
staple of science fiction and popular
science media routinely present the
theoretical Black Hole as a science fact.
How might the general public form
independent opinions on such a complex
and arcane subject?
The public is at a disadvantage with
science reporting these days because
it's done by press release and the
original papers which present the data
are usually interpreted in such a way as
to make these assertions and assumptions
real objects. We have artists' impressions
of black holes, we have artists'
impressions of all kinds of things in
space --
none of which are images of something
that has been actually observed. As
Einstein once said but didn't actually
follow; the ideas of the most important
thing, not the mathematics, and yet the
ideas are often not well organized logically
or well expressed so that the public can
be misled. But not only the public, the
scientists themselves mislead themselves.
The Electric Universe, on the other hand,
follows the tradition of classical
physics where there is a freewheeling
exchange of ideas and those ideas are
organized into a coherent big picture,
something which makes sense of a widely
disparate set of information from
different disciplines. The Electric
Universe has not been surprised by any
of these surprises for astronomers and
astrophysicists simply because it starts
from a much bigger picture,
it accepts empirical evidence from
plasma cosmologists, which astronomers
unfortunately ignore, and the result is
that we have been able to predict things
in advance and to accommodate new
information and actually find
confirmation in new information week by
week, as it comes in.

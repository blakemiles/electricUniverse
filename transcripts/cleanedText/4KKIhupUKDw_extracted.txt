Future Science
Future Science
Of course, I can't
foretell the future
but what I can do is
provide some ideas
which may form the revolutions in technology
and so on that we may expect in future.
First I've got to set
a bit of context,
we need a bit of perspective.
Science today and this...
just a moment, see if I
can pick up at the top,
it's okay...
this is a doctored picture from the 'March
for Science' which you'll all remember,
occurred a few months ago
where all of the scientists came out
and marched on the political capitals.
I doctored this si.. this sign.
The problem really here is,
what were they marching for?
You know the march for science
boiled down to the concern
that future funding of science
projects will be cut or redirected.
I don't think there's any clear
idea of what science really is,
we seem to have lost that.
The point is that science
is never "settled".
And yet we hear an awful
lot about settled science.
Science being settled
suggests it's going nowhere.
Of course, the placard there says
that we want a theory of everything
and of course we want it now.
The other aspect of that is that
that so-called theory of everything can be
focused right down and put on a t-shirt.
Now, that's the exact opposite
of everything in my opinion
because the Electric Universe is about
an expansive picture of everything
which you cannot
fit on a t-shirt.
Just a few little problems
that science faces.
We don't understand
why matter has mass.
and yet we have built an umpteen-
billion-dollar Large Hadron Collider
to try and find out.
The very question
hardly makes sense
because if the electrons and the
protons that make up matter
have no mass, they
can have no energy,
they can have no structure
and we know that's not true.
Energy is undefined.
Einstein took care of that
because he gave us
nothing to measure it by.
Gravity isn't understood.
Now I am going into that again
because I've settled off already.
But of course, when I say
gravity is not understood,
that's the basis of
modern cosmology.
So modern cosmology is not worth
the paper it's not written on.
Time is not understood.
I mean, Einstein thought
a clock was time
and Steve Crothers pointed
out the stupidity of that.
And the result is of course that the
language of science has become meaningless.
Those people who can stomach watching
science programs on television...
I've attempted occasionally but after
having sat through a few minutes of
being able to pick holes in almost
every sentence that's uttered,
I give up!
Yet we have the hubris to think we are
prepared for this theory of everything.
Here's settled science, they
look pretty settled.
This is the math magicians'
conference in Brussels October 1927.
A very famous picture,
it's full of famous men.
Right there, center
front row is Einstein.
Now, he stopped us
from doing physics
because he removed the
standards of length and time.
They became malleable,
they become rubbery.
In fact, Salvador Dali admitted that
he was inspired by Einstein's work
to paint his melting clocks
and his weird landscapes.
And on, in the second row on the
right hand side is Niels Bohr
and he introduced quantum theory
which divorced
cause and effect.
So he crippled that
aspect of science as well.
So we stopped doing
science about this time.
Science, so science has been
"settled" for almost a century.
It's technology that has made our
existence starkly different.
You know, the past was a different country,
they did things differently there.
Today, the difference is
all due to technology.
But technology advances
without the science.
It bootstraps itself.
The better instrumentation you
build, the better rockets you build,
using as a basis
the old technology
but doing it better, has got
us to where we are now.
So most of the science
required for modern technology
was invented before this
photograph was taken.
Think about that.
Now Faraday's work, Ampère, the people
who worked on electromagnetism, Maxwell,
all of these people more or less produced
the requirements for modern technology.
But of course, scientists have to
show something for their existence.
So they claim the credit for
advances in technology
which is generally tinkering with things in
the laboratory, finding something that works
and then building better
mousetraps and selling them
as a new product.
We are being treated like
lab rats as a result.
And you can see
this in every field;
in medicine, in food production,
in pharmaceuticals, in radio smog...
I remember attending an IEEE
meeting in Canberra some years ago,
and the concern with mobile
phones then was that
is the radiation from the phone
sufficient to heat the cells,
just heat by the way,
so that it could cause damage to
the biological molecules in a cell?
There's no thought that there is something
more going on in a cell than just chemistry.
Of course, we're suffering the
cost and the consequences
both in our health and the
impact on the environment that we're having.
So the things we
must first learn,
this is a picture
from the new movie
that was shown on the National
Geographic Channel on Einstein.
That's Geoffrey Rush, an
Australian actor playing Einstein.
Now, Geoffrey Rush is very good
at getting into the character
so he read everything
he could about the man
and he described Einstein
as the 'glorious daydreamer.'
Well...
Einstein, the 'glorious daydreamer,'
wasn't so glorious at physics or math
as Steve Crothers
has pointed out.
He disconnected mathematical physics
from real standards of measurement.
Mass, energy and time are undefined in terms
of matter in motion relative to a standard.
This is why the, I insist
on defining these terms.
The energy is matter in motion
with respect to the fixed stars.
In other words, to the
rest of the universe.
Also, light is a wave in a medium.
Then unfortunately, the ether got
lost sometime around about here.
It is not a massless
particle, it is not a photon.
Multiplying zero by infinity to
give you a number is idiotic.
The universal gravitational
constant, so-called,
and 'c' the speed of light,
are not universal constants,
'c' is not a speed limit for
the transfer of information.
In fact, when you talk
about the speed of light
you must have a standard
to measure it by
but Einstein removed
that standard.
There's a consequence, now they define the
meter in terms of the wavelength of light
which is in other words,
requires you know the speed of light.
So it's a circular argument.
They've made sure that
'c' remains constant
simply by defining the
standard of length.
This is pretty tricky.
Also as I said, quantum mechanics
must have cause and effect
and particle physics must apply
these lessons and start over again
almost from scratch.
Here's the real genius of the
20th century in my opinion,
the psychoanalyst and
polymath Immanuel Velikovsky.
I took this photo on the
date shown in Princeton.
He recognized a, what he
called a, "desire not to know"
about chaos in the
celestial order.
It may explain the
delusional belief in order
and control of nature
through mathematics
and of course we heard the
story about Harlow Shapley
and how he wanted perfect
order in the solar system
and of course was one of those most
hostile to Velikovsky's attack.
It may also explain the
religious conviction of science
and the academic book burning of Velikovsky's
best-selling Worlds in Collision in 1950.
In other words, in my opinion, to have a
future requires a real human cosmology.
We have to be included.
It's not good talking about black
holes and dark matter and dark energy
and all of that nonsense.
We have to be central
to the cosmology,
otherwise it has
no meaning for us.
And that involves us really
understanding our past.
And it was Velikovsky who provided the
forensic keys to future cosmology,
to the Thunderbolts of the Gods
and to the Electric Universe.
So some Electric Universe rules;
It goes back to classical science
before Einstein and Bohr destroyed it,
its principles and simplification that
guides the Electric Universe model.
It's a strange thing that the more I
understand about the history of science
the more I understand that there's
practically no (idea,} new idea under the Sun
if you look hard enough.
And I think those other
scholars in the audience
and Electric Universe
aficionados know that.
When you do take the trouble
to go back in history
you find people who have had
those ideas in the past.
So the Electric Universe is a synthesis
of those ideas ― and that is new.
Modern science tends to have no interest
in anything beyond a few years old
because that's all been
done, that's settled.
I should say that this big picture
here is done in the form of a puzzle
simply because this is
how I've approached it
looking for the bits and
pieces to put together.
But the Electric Universe
therefore by doing this
is a bigger picture than any
before and fewer missing pieces.
Of course, this is all my doing,
this is what I took on many years ago
having been inspired by Velikovsky
and this is why I
encourage others,
many of them have
been up here speaking,
to propose new pieces or
point out misplaced ones.
So technology rules, okay?
Technological advances are often
claimed to be scientific advances.
This forward button tends to
be rather hard to get on with.
The technology bootstraps itself
building ever better mousetraps.
If only the science was
advanced as the technology
because the basic science behind the
engineering of the Large Hadron Collider
is about 100 years old or more.
It relies on electromagnetic
theory and so on
which has been known for
that length of time.
And as I said, the notion that mass is
caused by a "cosmic treacle" particle
(of Higgs pink pigs) is cranky.
It is cranky, it fulfills the
definition of cranky science.
So is the gravitational
wave detector
which was pulled apart by
Steve Crothers the other day
and fusion energy "like the Sun."
As the SAFIRE project,
I hope, is about to say.
That's better.
I showed this slide, I
think it was last year,
the simplicity,
Elegant Simplicity of the Electric
Universe was the title of my presentation.
But this particular slide shows you
just how cranky particle physics is
because this is an explanation
of what a proton is
according to an expert,
Professor Matthew Strassler.
He says, 'imagine
all of the quarks
because protons are supposed to be
made like J.J. Thomson's plum pudding model,
out of these weird pieces, quarks.
Up, down and strange
denoted by u, d and s;
anti quarks up down... u, d and s
with a bar on the top; and gluons (g)
zipping around near
the speed of light
and banging into each other and
appearing and disappearing.
And of course the notes go on to
say that the gluons themselves
also contribute to the
mass of the proton
and these particles wink
in and out of existence
which of course defies one of
the principles of physics.
So this is,
and the, of course you've got
the ultimate let-out here
because quarks are
unobservable in principle.
So this is just a story.
And here's the fellow who looked at
the sociology of this behavior
and said there is no obligation on
anyone to take any notice of any of it.
So I choose to do that.
Now Edwin Kaal told me about what
he was working on a year or so ago
and I encouraged it because this is an extra
simplification over the model of an atom.
And that is to have no
neutrons in the nucleus
and that makes an
awful lot of sense
because how do you hold a whole lot of
positively charged particles together
if all you do is stuff a few
neutral particles between them?
That is not going to work.
But if you put an electron
between two protons,
on average the force between the
protons and that central electron
is four times stronger than the
repulsive force between the two protons
because of the
distances between them.
This can be a stable arrangement
which is the basis, I think, of
Edwin Kaal's attempted model
to reproduce the
the periodic table.
I think it's excellent
and I think it shows
great promise
and I feel it's on the
right track, intuitively.
...I've just said that
and that...
This results in a resonant
geometric structure.
There is no need for
an extra strong force.
This is, a very bad habit that physics has
introduced in the last hundred years,
is more forces and more particles in the
hope of getting a Nobel Prize, I expect.
So only two particles are needed
to build all of the elements.
I like that.
What about the neutrons?
We know they exist but we only
know they exist outside the nucleus
as a short-lived dance between
a proton and an electron
in the kind of a relationship
they have inside the nucleus.
And that makes sense.
And the fact that a neutrino is involved
in the final breakdown of the neutron
tends to suggest that it's a neutrino that
may be responsible for radioactive decay.
The present radioactive decay
is a statistical thing.
In other words, the cause
and effect are disconnected.
So I think the neutrino
is involved in this.
Light is simply an electrical wave
in a polarizable medium ― the ether.
No imaginary photon is involved.
Get rid of it.
You can't have a wave or a particle
just depending on your whim.
And the receiving atom is one that
happens to be tuned to the sending atom
through the instantaneous
electrical resonance
between their constituent
subatomic particles.
That's the same thing as saying
you have quantum entanglement between
the sending and the receiving particle.
So when the energy wave
arrives at the speed of light,
you happen to have an atom that is
perfectly set to receive that energy
and once it's done so, because all matter
in the universe is connected instantly,
no other particle can take it
because this one's accepted it.
That's a simple way of
looking at it anyway.
This so-called 'quantum entanglement'
currently has no explanation, of course.
Gravity, and this is from the BBC
General Certificate of Secondary
Education, GCSE, website for schools
and this is what they
say about gravity,
'It pulls objects on Earth towards
the center of the planet.
It holds the Earth's
atmosphere in place.
It holds all the components of the
solar system in orbit around the Sun
and holds all the components
of the galaxy together.'
Well, this is not a good
start for students.
The Large Hadron Collider can't tell us why
inertial mass is equal to the gravitational mass
because particle
physics is a mess.
It simply assumed that
Newton's law of gravity
applies all the way to
the center of the earth.
I remember over the decades
after I left University
there were several occasions when
anomalous readings down deep mine shafts
resulted in the suggestion that there's
a fifth force or a sixth force
to explain these anomalies
instead of thinking,
hang on a minute,
maybe we don't
understand gravity.
The balanced dipole model of gravity
has the field reversing at depth.
And also cosmologically.
And I've talked about this so I'm not
going to go into any detail here.
The repulsive aspect of gravity dominates
and provides a balanced universe
which is what Halton
Arp's research demands.
So there is no Big Bang and
collisions tend to be avoided.
The electrical nature of gravity
provides a feedback mechanism
essential for forming and stabilizing
orbital planetary systems.
Because it's a bit [inaudible]
...that didn't sound good...
The electrical nature of gravity
provides a feedback mechanism
essential for forming and stabilizing
orbital planetary systems.
Because one of the big issues with Velikovsky's
recent history of the solar system
is that you had a chaotic
system, say 12,000 years ago,
or in his case he was talking about
you know only 3000 - 4000 years ago
and here we have this
clockwork system.
How the heck do you do
that? Gravity can't do it
at least through the
conventional view.
The electrical exchange of charge
between the Sun and the planets
and their cometary tails which tend to
stretch from one planet to the next
gives you a means of adjusting
their masses electrically
that is their gravitational fields
and I've been through this before
but it shows that the inner
planet, when they pass,
if the sun's here and one planet's
here and the other one's out here
when this comes around here and the
tail of this planet reaches this one,
if they're close a lot
of charge is transferred
and the two planets move apart.
And they keep doing that until they
hardly affect each other at all.
And if one tends to
diverge from its orbit,
the other one will tend
to shift it back again.
So there is this feedback mechanism which
is essential for a clockwork mechanism.
Plasma cosmology is a central
part of the Electric Universe
and Hannes Alfvén said, There's
one great branch of physics
which up to now has told us
little or nothing about astronomy.
That branch is electricity.
You won't find any reference to
electricity in the back of a textbook
on astrophysics or astronomy.
He says, it's rather astonishing
that this phenomenon
which has been so exhaustively
studied on the earth,
(principally by him)
has been of so little help
in the celestial sphere.
Electricity has illuminated our cities
but shed no light on stellar phenomena.
It has linked the earth with the
dense net of communications
but has given no information
about the universe around us.
Nobody paid any attention.
Astronomers don't
attend the lectures
or the presentations or the symposia
of the electrical engineers
who are now carrying the
torch for plasma cosmology.
The Sun
Our understanding relies
on century-old assumptions
which don't predict any of
the features of the Sun
and that was one of the
things that caught my eye
when I read Ralph Juergens' article about
the Sun for the very first time.
Because a moment's thought
I said, yes he's right!
There are huge problems with
the thermonuclear model.
They're glossed over.
'The corona is like a flame
coming out of an ice cube,
it doesn't make any sense,'
one scientist said.
Iron increases in the corona with
increasing solar magnetic activity.
Why is that so?
What is the Sun doing?
We know there are nuclear reactions
coming, occurring at the Sun.
I'm not saying in the Sun.
Because of the neutrino telescopes
that have been able to see
the haze of neutrinos
in its vicinity.
And iron is one
of those elements
which would suggest that the iron is
being formed right in front of our eyes.
And of course, we've seen
the presentation on SAFIRE
and that gives you an idea why we're so
interested in those heavier elements
appearing in the spectrum of some
of the material on the anode,
our electric Sun.
And if we're right, this could,
this will revolutionize our understanding
of nuclear physics and energy production.
Space Science
The New Horizons mission to
Pluto was a technological marvel
that finally completed the imaging of
significant bodies in the solar system.
Pluto was the very last.
Of course, it's no longer a planet
so I had to say significant bodies.
It took 4 years to launch and a team
of only 50 people were involved,
that's pretty incredible.
It's the fastest spacecraft ever
launched on an Atlas V rocket,
it took one and a half seconds
to clear the 300-foot tower,
15 seconds to punch through
the 10,000 foot clouds.
The second stage reignited
over the Middle East
and the craft could have
reached the Moon in 9 hours.
Apollo astronauts took 3 days,
gives you some impression.
Alan Stern, I attended a meeting
about three weeks ago
at the National University where he
and another, one of the team members,
presented their
findings on Pluto.
It was a good meeting
and he said "Everywhere we
turn are new mysteries."
There are low energy X-rays
from Pluto that are unexplained.
And the moon Charon has been active and
there are mountains in the Kuiper Belt.
"This system is
amazing", said Alan.
Now these are supposed to be
equivalent to large cometary snowballs.
We weren't expecting rocks and
all of these kinds of features.
Pluto is 70% rock instead of ices
with mountains up to 11,000 feet
with no tidal heating
to power tectonics.
Pluto has clouds and
is losing atmosphere
at tons per second
which questions all this business
about how old these things are.
And also, the moon Charon which you
can see there to the right of Pluto,
these are natural colors too,
is so unlike Pluto
that they are puzzled
because these objects,
all of them out there,
should be roughly equivalent
in their composition.
So Charon and Pluto
are "too different".
What's more, those smaller satellites
Nix and Hydra are too bright
because cosmic rays are supposed to affect
the surface and darken it over time
but these things are shining
like they're covered with snow.
The small moons are
"too reflective."
So I'm more or less showing you
where we're up to now.
Biological Science
Biologists don't have the physics
to understand embryogenesis,
the mind and mind-body
connection,
extrasensory perception
or homeopathy.
All of these, most of these
things are "impossible"
and you're not even allowed to investigate
them because the subjects are "taboo."
Rupert Sheldrake has done some
very good work on embryogenesis
and shown that there is something
going on beyond the body
involved in it
but of course such
a thing is taboo.
I get the science
journals delivered
and I'm rather dismayed and
I got fed up with Nature
because it was almost cover
to cover biochemical models
incredibly complex and of no help in
trying to understand what life is.
I mean, it's all very
interesting, the chemistry,
but the actual relevance to a living
system seems to be lost in the detail.
So we're treated more or less as
chemically driven machines.
We have become "lab rats" for
the pharmaceutical industry
and the medical and
food technologists.
Far worse ― publicly funded research
has been corrupted by industry,
influencing government and regulators to shut
down research into alternative modalities
on the basis that
"They're impossible".
Never listen to an expert when
they say something is impossible
because they are last to know when
a paradigm shift is about to come.
One I took out of a magazine.
Talk about misleading... see a
difference, GMO corn and non-GMO corn?
Neither can science.
Well that says a lot about
the blindness of science.
It's certainly not an argument for GMO
corn given our limited understanding
of living systems and the
interconnectedness of everything.
Genetic engineering is an experiment
with unknown consequences
since it relies on a flawed
understanding of genetics.
They're only beginning to
get involved in epigenetics
that is the changing of the genetic
information in a living creature
during their lifetime.
We have great hulking
molecules of DNA
with an unknown number of genes
that interact with one another
in unknown ways under
circumstances we don't know!
That's terrific!
It really gives you
confidence, doesn't it?
I should point out too
that we have less genes than a
nematode and less than a grape.
This gives you an idea that the
morphogenesis of an embryo
has more to do with
signals from outside
and that the DNA is more or less a
factory floor acting under instruction.
So all you need in the DNA is the
instructions on how to make things,
in other words the coding
for the proteins and so on.
But what switches
them on and off
is something that really
needs to be investigated.
I'll talk more about that later.
It assumes a closed
system and as I said
yet epigenetics shows the gene expression
is somehow tuned to environmental signals.
Science hasn't figured out yet what
all of those junk sequences do.
When they say junk, it just
means they don't understand.
Once again, we're treated as lab
rats to "whatever sells" culture
with no thought of the consequences
in such an unfathomed eco system.
Here we go, "To know the
future don't ask an expert"
and this is Richard Feynman.
"Learn from science that
you must doubt the experts.
As a matter of fact, I can also
define science another way:
Science is the belief in
the ignorance of experts."
I mean, when you look at
the history it's dreadful.
Ignaz Semmelweis could offer no acceptable
scientific explanation for his findings
and some doctors were offended at the
suggestion that they should wash their hands
between the autopsy room
and the delivery room.
I mean, you think about it now,
it just seems incredible.
I would also say that the words
debunk and labeling dissidents denier
shows the agenda
to be unscientific.
Debunking is a case of selecting
the evidence to suit your argument
and ignoring the evidence
that doesn't fit.
It's the sort of thing
that skeptics do.
Yeah, it's impossible that washing
hands between the autopsy room
and the childbirth ward will prevent
deaths from puerperal fever.
Heavier-than-air flying
machines are impossible.
Cold fusion is impossible and
I saw a show of hands
on a television,
interview with the experts,
and there was one guy who was obviously
the alpha male, the dominant one
and he put his hand up and
he looked along like this
waiting for the others to put their
hands up and the other, sort of,
you know, finally
put their hands up.
So this is how you do science.
It's a media show.
Of course, homeopathy
is impossible
but if you don't understand structured
water and Jerry Pollack's work,
of course it's impossible.
And also the transfer of information
faster-than-light is impossible.
Isn't it?
And yet the earth manages to
maintain its orbit around the sun
by knowing where the
sun is at this instant,
not eight minutes ago.
Future Science
Sir Fred Hoyle
The future is a
different universe,
they do things electrically
there in the Electric Universe.
No, he didn't say that.
What he did say is,
it's a strange thought but
I believe a correct one
that twenty or thirty pages
of ideas and information
would be capable of turning the
present-day world upside down
or even destroying it.
I have often tried to conceive of
what those pages might contain
but of course I am a prisoner
of the present day world
just as all of you are.
Well not us.
We cannot think outside the particular
patterns that our brains are conditioned to
or to be more accurate,
we can only think a
very little way outside
and then only if we
are very original.
That was in his book
'Of Men and Galaxies.'
So, the Electric Universe
is the path less traveled
and it is a game changer.
The Earth's real past and the post traumatic
stress disorder that humanity seems to suffer.
Quantum matter interactions --
the ether, time, mass, energy, light,
all of these crucial basic things
need to be understood.
Cosmic matter interactions ―
electromagnetism, plasma behavior, gravity
and understand stars.
And also in, when it comes down to
the orderliness of the universe,
the orderliness of
the solar system
and the amazing ability
of living systems
to control trillions of reactions
in the body every second
requires that real-time
connectedness
and it's also associated, I
believe, with consciousness.
So In Future
The future started yesterday
and we're already late.
Right
In future, we may understand
quantum mechanics as resonances
between matter connected instantaneously
by the direct electric force.
In future, we may understand
light as the energy in a
light wave traveling
through the ether
arriving at an atom
that is tuned by the
direct electric force
to receive that energy.
In future, we may understand the real
electrical structure of atomic nuclei
and catalytic, that is
resonant, nuclear chemistry,
or "warm fusion"
energy of stars etc.
In future, we may understand gravity as a
near-instantaneous dipolar electric force
that can be attractive
or repulsive
like magnetism.
In future, understanding
electrogravity
may allow us to begin to understand the
real interiors of stars and planets
and ways to harness the
gravitational force for propulsion.
In future, understanding the instant
signaling between resonant systems
may allow biology to advance
beyond biochemistry
into the realms of morphogenesis
and consciousness,
the basis of life.
In future there is
no time travel.
I'm sorry.
But galactic communication
at the speed of thought?
Who knows?
In future, a new science
must be causally complete
that is every effect has a cause.
It must be coherent.
There can't be any exceptions. It's
got to fit in with everything.
And also, it has to be coherent in the
sense that the whole thing is stable
and it must be consistent.
The rules and so on that
apply are consistent.
In future, the language of science
must be accessible to all.
This is why, whenever I present,
I try to use just plain language,
something that's accessible to all.
In future, the real mysteries of
our existence will become clearer.
Right now, the mysteries that you find
published in New Scientist and other places,
I remember getting a copy with
10 of the big mysteries
and all of them were artifacts of having
the science wrong in the first place.
In future, we may understand
our connectedness
and the insane divisions
caused by our false beliefs.
Carl Jung said the conflict
between science and religion
is a consequence of the immature state
of both of these domains of thinking.
In future, we may appreciate
that we are earthlings
with an intimate connection and
responsibility to this pale blue dot.
I thought that picture was
rather evocative and I,
when it was first
published I thought,
surely people can get a better
perspective on our situation on Earth
instead of battling amongst ourselves for,
you know, a few square inches of land.
It just seems so insane.
In future, these
changes are essential
if we are to have a sustainable
future on this planet.
Because, for those who saw
that program last night
by the mythographer David
Evans, Dr. David Evans,
he himself made to stress this
that we are currently living
with a Bronze Age mythology,
with all of its gods and
heroes and wars and so on
and this is the basis
of our present culture.
He says we need a new cosmology and
he found us, the Electric Universe
and said this is the
only one that fits.
It doesn't, it discards
the old cosmology
because you can understand it
and once you understand it, it
no longer has a grip on you.
The Electric Universe provides a
cosmology which is about connectedness,
our understanding of our real place
in the universe for the first time
and of our real history
and that of the earth.
Once you understand those things, science
fiction stories pale into insignificance.
Future Science
There is nothing more important for
the human race than to know its past,
to be able to face it.
This was a quote from
Immanuel Velikovsky
in a documentary made
by the BBC in 1972.
And as Eric Unzicker who is a great
critic of the Large Hadron Collider says,
"With each paradigm shift there
should be a simplification."
Well, the Electric Universe
has got that in spades.
And as Dr. Iain McGilchrist says,
"Meaning comes from understanding
the whole, the big picture."
And I think that's been my obsession
most of, almost all of my life,
is trying to see
that big picture,
seeing the whole.
Connectedness, which gives us the ability
to see our place in the world more clearly,
is also the key to happiness.
I believe that's true too.
I've never seen such a bunch of happy
people as I do at these conferences.
And science and technology may
flourish with more wisdom and mastery.
Future Science
is about us
not about things.
Thank you.

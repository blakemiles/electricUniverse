My first foray into comparative
mythology was the book Martian
Metamorphoses, a compendium of traditions about
the Red Planet from antiquity until modern times.
There I documented that Mars was
conceptualized as the archetypal warrior
hero, and as a central player in the
catastrophic natural events attending
creation and the ordering of the cosmos.
My basic strategy was to investigate the
earliest literary and astronomical texts, mentioning
Mars, to see if recurring patterns could be found.
In time I succeeded in identifying well
over 200 motifs associated with the red
planet, including dragon slayer, eclipse agent and
fire god. Many of these motifs are shared by Mars
gods around the globe: compelling
evidence that they trace to the witness
behavior of the planet Mars in
relatively recent prehistoric times.
The picture that emerged from my
research, is that Mars represented an
awe-inspiring celestial form, one 
prone to drastic distortions in its
relative size and luminosity, to say
nothing of its propensity for hurling
great thunderbolts and generating world- engulfing
storms. All of these ideas are difficult to
reconcile with Mars’ present benign
appearance, needless to say.
In ancient Mesopotamia, the homeland 
of the first scientific astronomy,
Mars was identified with the god Nergal,
the latter described as a raging warrior
whose incendiary behavior threatened the 
world. Numerous hymns attest to Nergal's
prowess as an invincible warrior. Quote,
”Warrior! Raging storm-tide, who flattens
the lands in upheaval, Warrior!”
Nergal's belligerent nature knew no
bounds. According to one hymn, the god's wrath
threatened the domain of the gods as well.
Quote “O warrior... Perfect one without
rival among all the gods, who grasps the
pitiless deluge-weapon, who massacres 
the enemy, Lion clad in splendor, at the
flaring-up of whose (fierce) brilliance, the gods
of the inhabited world took to secret places...”
Babylonian astronomical texts, interestingly,
warned that if a person is born during
the appearance of Mars, he will be quick
to anger. While such traditions can only
appear bizarre and incongruous by
reference to the Red Planet's innocuous
behavior in today's skies, the fact remains that
analogous reports should be found around the globe.
Far removed from ancient Mesopotamia 
the Skidi Pawnee of the North American
plains are known to have had an
astronomically-based religion.
Indeed, it has been said that they were
obsessed with the planets and had a
sky-oriented theology, perhaps 
without parallel in human history.
For the Skidi sky watchers, Mars was
described as an irascible warrior, whose
interactions with Venus at the
time of Beginning sparked creation.
During a ritual in which human
sacrifices were offered to the Red
Planet, the celebrants sought to channel
Mars's anger. Quote, “I become ferocious: I
became like him.” End of quote. In another
ritual, the Mars impersonator chanted the
following refrain when pretending to
conquer Venus. Quote, “I become myself when
I become angry.” End of quote. Yet 
another hymn quotes the god himself
”This is the way I did when I became angry.”
Analogous traditions will be found in
Egypt where early astronomical texts
identified Mars with the god Horus. In
literary texts dating to the third millennium
BCE, Horus described as raging against the
gods, thereby reminding us of the
Akkadian traditions attached to Nergal.
So too, in the pyramid text Horus is
described as the “Lord of Wrath,” whose
seething fury shakes the very
foundations of Heaven. Quote, “Unis will
come with the face of the great god,
Horus, who is lord of wrath...; he will
strike Shu's arms from under the sky.” End of 
quote. The Latin god Mars, whose name was
assigned to the Red Planet during Hellenistic
times, was remembered as a warrior whose
terrible fury knew no bounds.
Although the vast majority of Roman
mythology has been lost, a few 
vestigial remnants can still be found.
The Carmen Arvale, the oldest bit of Latin
text from antiquity, invokes ‘fere Mars.
Literally, “the fierce or furious Mars.”
In his classic, Archaic Roman Religion,
George Dumezil offered the following
portrait of the Roman War God. Quote, “The
ambiguous character of Mars, when 
he breaks loose on the field of battle,
accounts for the epithet “caecus,”
 or blind, given him by the poets.
At a certain stage of furor, he abandons himself
to his nature, destroying friend as well as foe.”
Why, it must be asked, would a distant
diminutive planet, moving on a supposedly
eternally stable orbit about the Sun,
be described as angry or furious or as
raging against the Gods? A major 
portion of Martian metamorphoses
was devoted to investigating the
mythological traditions associated with
the great heroes identified with the
planet Mars. Figures such as the Greek
Hercules for example, to see 
if there was any discernible
overlap with the aforementioned Mars gods.
As I documented, the overlap is at once
substantial and archaic in nature,
tracing to the earliest literary
traditions in the third millennium BCE,
while it would be impossible to do
justice to this vast wealth of material
in a 10-minute video, it might prove
instructive to examine a few traditional
tales recounting the Warrior Hero's
terrible anger. The Greek Heracles, expressly 
identified as the planet Mars during the
Hellenistic period, was renowned for his fiery
anger and deemed to be a major threat to the gods.
The poet Virgil describes
Heracles as follows in the Aeneid.
Quote, “Suddenly Hercules ignited in rage. Here the
word ‘rage’ is ‘ira’, literally ’anger’ or ‘rage’."
Seneca wrote an entire play on the subject:
Hercules Furens. Ovid in turn speaks of the fire
generated by Heracles’ seething wrath.
The Celtic hero ‘Cu Chulainn’
offers a striking parallel to Hercules.
In traditional accounts of the great
hero's fury, it is reported that he radiated
intense heat, became crimson all over
and assumed a gigantic form.
The epithet ‘the distorted one’,
commemorates the radical distortion of
features that distinguished the Celtic
hero during his battle frenzy.
Indeed, The Tain describes the hero's
furor as follows. Quote, “It was then that,
as before, Cu Chulain’s distortion came on,
and he was filled with swelling and
great fullness, like breath in a bladder,
until he became a terrible, fearful, many-
colored, wonderful giant.” End of quote.
The swelling of the warrior hero,
while in the midst of his furor, is a
universally occurring motif, as I have 
documented. Ovid in his description of Heracles’
Apotheosis on Mount Olympus, notes that the
hero suddenly took on a gargantuan appearance.
So too, Beowulf was said to swell with anger
as he prepares to meet the dragon Grendel.
Marie Sjoestedt, summarizing the Celtic
traditions, was among the few scholars to
call attention to this motif. Quote, 
“We see that all the words for ‘hero’
express the notions of fury, ardor, tumescence,
speed. The hero is the furious one, possessed of
his own tumultuous energy.” End of quote.
That the hero's sudden swelling traces
to a witnessed planetary event, is
strongly suggested by the fact that
ancient astronomers called attention
to Mars’ propensity for swelling.
Thus it is that Polynesian sky watchers knew
Mars as Horo-Pukupuku, ’Quick-swelling.’
So too Babylonian scribes describe Nergal as
pes-gal, literally the “furious” or impetuous god.
Yet the word ‘pes’ also denotes, to ‘swell’ or to
‘expand’. A classic example of the warrior heroes
offered by the ascetic Batraz, renowned 
for his terrible furor and erratic behavior.
In a popular tale recounting the hero's
birth, Batraz is said to burst forth from
a giant's abscess on high, whereupon 
he fell headlong towards Earth.
Quote, “When he came down from heaven
to earth he was burning.” End of quote.
The igneous nature of the infant hero
who fell from heaven like a thunderbolt,
or meteor, is a decided point of emphasis.
In a number of tales the townsfolk are
said to have gone to great lengths to cool
him down through one means or another.
In one account, the newly delivered
infant plummets down from heaven and is
forthwith dunked into a tub of water in
an effort to quench his warrior ardor.
Quote, “Batraz ...grew so furious
that his steely body became red hot.
He peered around, then leaped down from
the heavenly heights, straight onto the
roof of the seven tower... He burned his way through
ceilings, one after another with his red-hot body.
In the lowest story of the tower, there
stood a huge water tub, and into that
fell the glowing-hot Batraz. Having
cooled off in the water, he climbed out
of the tub.” End of quote. In a 
variant account of his birth, Batraz
is thrown into the sea to cool him off,
at which point he assumes a gigantic
form. Quote, “When the little boy came out
of the abscess at the time of this birth
they carried him to the sea and threw 
him in. All at once he became as big as a
mountain.” End of quote. Such 
traditions have nothing to do with
human biology, needless to say. Rather
these vignettes encode extraordinary i.e.
cataclysmic natural events. The
 curious report that Batraz became as
big as a mountain upon descending from
heaven, represents an invaluable clue.
As we have documented elsewhere, when the
planet Mars descended towards Earth as a
meteor-like bolide along the axial
column uniting the various planets, it
assumed a colossal form. Like 
countless other warrior heroes,
Batraz is a notorious shape-shifter.
Especially relevant here are the
traditions that describe the hero
as taking the form of lightning.
Quote, “After a turbulent and marvelous
childhood, somewhat reminiscent of that
of Heracles, he went to heaven, where 
he lived from that time on, never leaving
except to fall (literally) onto the earth,
in the manner of lightning, sometimes to
save his fellow Narts when they were in
danger, but sometimes to decimate them
cruelly and blindly without any clear motive.
Each of these ‘descents’ is described in
terms and images that express his
lightning nature.” End of quote.
On those occasions when Batraz descended
from heaven, it is reported that he was
wont to assume a brilliant red form and become
furious. The red color assigned to the descending
bolide, together with the hero's
identification with Aries, is tantamount
to the DNA left at the scene of a crime
and allows us to positively identify
Batraz as the planet Mars.
Here it is significant to find that
Mesopotamian sky watchers expressly
compared the Red Planet to a meteor, or
fire falling from heaven. Thus it 
is that the star god Nergal was
given the epithet miqit isatu,
denoting ”the fall of fire” from heaven.
Equally telling is the fact the same
phrase was employed to describe
”lightning” or “meteor”. Far 
from being confined to ancient
mythological traditions, the warrior
hero's capacity for destructive feats of
furor left an indelible mark on
countless ancient rituals and customs,
not to mention warriors’ initiation
rights around the globe. If Skidi
warriors used to prepare for battle
by emulating Mars's fiery anger, the
Spartans and Batavian berserkers of old
Europe whipped themselves into a frenzy by
singing of the deeds of Heracles
in the hopes that they too,
might be possessed by his spirit 
and prove equally formidable and
invulnerable to fire or pain. Quote, 
“Archaic warriors everywhere
re-enacted in masked dances the deeds 
of the gods and ancestors. They did so to
gain the divine ecstasy of ‘the beginning
of time’...In battle when it mattered most
to live in mythical time, warriors bodied forth
gods and ancestors fighting in their style.
Batavi going to battle sang of ‘Hercules,’ their
ancestral, club-wielding hero.” To summarize,
traditional tales attached to the
warrior hero describe him as red-hot in
nature, swelling in anger, possessed by
seething wrath, and radiating intense heat or
lightning-like flashes. Such 
attributes point unequivocally to
the Martian origins of the
warrior hero archetype.
Is it any wonder then that indigenous
warriors around the globe formerly
smeared their bodies with red ochre in
order to embody and advertise their
furor?

Welcome to Space News from

42 years ago, on separate dates more
than two weeks apart, two spacecraft were
launched at Cape Canaveral, Florida with
the potential to rewrite our
understanding of the solar system
and the interstellar environment.
In the 1970s, the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2
spacecraft were designed with the
intention of studying the
environments of Jupiter and
Saturn, as well as the gas
giants' respective moons.
In 2012, scientists announced
that Voyager 1 had
apparently become the first man-made
object ever to reach interstellar space.
But what the spacecraft told us, about
the behaviors of the solar wind and the
conditions at the
interstellar boundary, did not
match space scientists'
theoretical predictions.
In 2013, the lead author of
a paper in the journal Science
told wired.com of the Voyager 1 data, "The
models that have been thought to predict
what should happen are all
incorrect....We essentially have
absolutely no reliable roadmap of
what to expect at this point."
And today, scientists have reported that
Voyager 2 has now also recently crossed
the boundary into interstellar space and
again, the theoretical predictions based
on standard solar physics
do not match discovery.
Don Gurnett, the corresponding
author of a study
published in the journal Nature
Astronomy, said to phys.org, "In a
historical sense, the old idea that the
solar wind will just be gradually
whittled away as you go further into
interstellar space is simply not true. We
show with Voyager 2--and previously with
Voyager 1--that there's a distinct
boundary out there. It's
just astonishing how
fluids, including plasmas,
form boundaries."
Of course, the predictions of the
Electric Universe theory about the
interstellar environment
and behavior of the
solar wind, differ
dramatically from convention.
The Electric Universe has always
proposed that a vast Birkeland
current enters our solar system
and, in fact, powers the Sun.
We asked retired professor
of electrical engineering, Dr.
Donald Scott to offer his overview
of the Voyager 2 findings to date.
Well, a few days ago, researchers at the
University of Iowa announced that space
probe Voyager 2 left the Sun's
heliosphere in late 2018 and entered
what they think is the
interstellar medium.
Its sister probe, Voyager 1 did
that earlier, that was back in 2012,
and they announced that this latest
transition was signaled definitely by a,
and they emphasized, the strong increase in
the plasma density measured by the probe.
In other words, that probe
essentially went through
what they refer to as "a
wall", a boundary there
between the heliosphere and
the interstellar medium.
Well, these guys, astrophysics
in general is still in the
mindset of fluid dynamics and gravity
only, so continuously hear words like
winds and shocks and bow
waves and in fact, one
typical astronomer commented
on this latest release.
He said, "In a historic
sense, the old idea that the
solar wind will just be gradually
whittled away as you go further into the
interstellar space is simply not true.
No kidding. We show with Voyager 2--and
previously with Voyager 1--that there is
a distinct boundary out there. It's
just astonishing how fluids,
including plasmas, form boundaries."
Well yes, in a sense, plasmas are
fluid but fluids are not plasmas, so...
And do they form boundaries,
yes, you betcha.
Again, they seem to be surprised
when they shouldn't be surprised.
We, in the Electric Universe,
realize that the
discovery of an increase in the plasma
density is completely consistent with
the electric Bessel function
model of a Birkeland current.
So we're not surprised at all,
the Electric Universe model of 
star formation, that is how the Sun
formed, is that it results from a z-pinch
in a Birkeland current filament inside
our galaxy, and in our model, in the EU
model, matter: that's to
say ions, electrons, neutral
atoms, molecules, etc, form
in concentric cylinders.
So it's quite probable that
the outer cylindrical layer of the
Birkeland current is a region of
increased density and so, that's what the
EU would have expected in that, we don't
look at it as a surprise or a
discovery and it would be something
we would be looking for.
It's also true in the
classical plasma lab experiment;
Alfven did them, Langmuir did them; there
is often a double layer of charge just
outside the cathode,
just above the cathode.
It's called a cathode drop
and in the case of the
heliosphere, the heliosphere
in the Electric Universe
model is the outer layer of the
heliopause, serves as a virtual cathode.
And so, thinking of it that way,
we would expect to see an increased
density of matter just at the cathode,
and, in our model, the heliopause is the
cathode, so that again is
what we would expect to see.
Z-pinches have been long observed
in plasma labs throughout the
world, and there's nothing exciting to us
about them, but it's very nice to see our
ideas born true and see that,
that's what they're seeing.
At the risk of boring people,
I think, I'll point out yet
again that when both mechanical and
fluid processes occur in a region where
there's also electrical forces involved,
those electrical forces are 10 to the
36th power times stronger than anything
gravity by itself can produce, so
electricity is very important and
these folks have got to learn that.
There's a slide there that says The Sun's
Environment, and on the left of the image
there is a sketch showing how the
twisting current density and magnetic
field tend to flatten out into
a disc, as you get closer
and closer to the actual
location of the z-pinch.
We're looking sideways at what the Electric
Universe thinks is the Birkeland current
that serves the Sun, and that
oval there in the middle
is the, what we would say
would be the heliosphere.
There in the center of that
diagram, you see sort of an X-Ray
photograph of that
Birkeland current and
the heliosphere,
the outer edges,
is defined by the words
edge of the z-pinch,
a filament cylinder on both sides there,
and so that's, that sort of yellow
cloudiness is those increased ions and
electrons and that sort of thing
that demark the extent of
the Birkeland current, and in
the center is the heliosphere, the Sun, a
very tiny dot right in the middle of that.
That is a reasonable, sort of a
schematic of what the Electric Universe
thinks is the heliosphere and the way
the Sun is situated.
But actually a better image, the
hourglass shaped nebula M-29 and it's, I
think it's perhaps the canonical
example of a cosmic z-pinch.
You can see many of the aspects
of what I just said in that
image, and you can see there's at
least two visible layers outward along
the Birkeland current,
and the locations of two
possible double layers
easily seen there...
The M-29 is a visible plasma entity
and such it has to be, of course,
in plasma that's in arc mode or at least
glow mode, in order for us to see it.
If you look at the top of that image and the
very bottom, you can see that the plasma
is beginning to disappear, it's beginning
to turn into dark mode, because the
electrical current density
is lower, the farther
you get away
from the z-pinch.
Clearly, our Birkeland current is in dark
mode, because otherwise you would see it.
Well, if you take a closer look,
again a schematic of, looks
like there's some black lines that show
the shape of the Birkeland current on
either side of the z-pinch,
you notice that where those lines form
together, that I'm suggesting that it
looks as though the heliosphere itself
is more of a sort of a, I hate to use the
word flying saucer, but that's what it
looks like, it's like, it's a sort of a
squished sphere and point a is inside of it,
and if those two probes followed the
path a to b or a to c, they would have
left the heliosphere but, however,
not left the Birkeland current.
Had the Voyagers gone from a to d, that is
straight out, they would have left both
the heliosphere and the Birkeland current
and gone out into the truly interstellar space.
And you notice on there, there's a
notation about the electrons combined
here with solar ions to form ENAs.
The IBEX mission and the satellite on
which the mission depended was a product
of the Lockheed Martin corporation, and
the division of that Lockheed Martin was
headed up by the late Dr. Jim Ryder.
He's a valued Electric
Universe scientist engineer,
and I will say, a good
friend to many of us.
We miss him.
A report of the mission's
initial results by the
mainstream said, "...the interstellar
environment has far more influence on
structuring the heliosphere than anyone
previously believed... No one knows what is
creating the ENA (the energetic
neutral atoms) ribbon..."
Now, this is what IBEX
discovered, that there were these
energetic and neutral
atoms that they hadn't
expected to find, just
outside the heliosphere.
Well, see a picture there of
what a classic plasma experiment would
look like in the laboratory, with the anode
on the left and the cathode on the right,
and of course you put a
higher voltage on the
anode and ground the
cathode and what happens?
Well, if you do it right, in the
middle of the tube there are, round
somewhere where it says positive column,
neutral atoms are ionized by like
electrons coming from the
cathode and so you get an ion.
Ions are produced in there,
and the positive ion, that is to
say, what's left of the atom minus the
electron that's popped off of it, it
starts to move toward the right, where
it'll be attracted, its positive charge
attracted by the cathode
and repulsed by the anode.
So eventually we get the stream
of positive ions heading toward
the right, heading toward the
cathode and flooding out from
the cathode are a stream of
electrons and what happens?
Well, they recombine, there's no such
thing as a positive ion traveling in the
wire that goes out of the
cathode, you can't do that.
So, where the positive
ions end up are being neutralized by
those electrons coming out of the
cathode and what's the result?
An electrically neutral atom, again, and so
that's, there's nothing magic about these
electrically neutral atoms, these ENAs
are formed simply by recombination, and I
interject my friends, it's an electrical
process of the recombination of the
negatively charged electron with
positively charged ion and that's how
you get the electrically neutral
atom out there at point d.
One of the most, I think, most
interesting things to come
out of this experience is that on
October 29th, in 2015, the NASA, the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory issued another
press release and they said, Voyager 1
has now helped to solve
the interstellar medium mystery.
I'm not sure what they
were referring to by the interstellar
medium mystery but anyway, the quote from
the release that I find extremely
interesting is, "Now researchers have
found that the direction of the magnetic
field has been slowly
turning ever since the
spacecraft crossed into
interstellar space."
OK, let's say that again, they have
discovered that the direction of the
magnetic field, that the spacecraft
observes, has been slowly turning,
rotating ever since the spacecraft
crossed into interstellar space.
They should have said it is ever since the
spacecraft left the heliosphere but
because, as we saw in that previous
diagram with the three way pass; a to b,
a to c, and a to d, they
left the heliosphere
but stayed inside the
Birkeland current.
That's exactly what they would
have observed because, as you
travel through a Birkeland current, the
magnetic field slowly rotates and slowly
changes its direction as you
proceed farther and farther
away from the central
axis of the current.
One of the most important
properties of the Bessel function model
of the Birkeland current is that
inside the current structure,
the direction of the magnetic
field continually increases.
Therefore, this announcement is a
supremely importantly in agreement with
this inherent property of the EU, and my
conclusion is that the two spacecraft, or
at least any one that measures
that continually rotating
magnetic field, followed a
path like a to b and a to c.
That means they have not really entered
the interstellar space, they're still
inside the Birkeland current, they've left
the heliosphere, that's true, but until
that magnetic field stops
rotating the farther out
they get, they're still
inside the Birkeland current.
There's several different points of
confirmation of our model and not theirs.
These astrophysicists
have got to stop talking
about fluid flows,
shocks, and bow waves,
and they have to learn that real
entities such as Birkeland currents and
double layers are important, and until
they do, their research will stagnate,
just as their fruitless
search for dark matter has.
These people have to begin to learn
about electricity in the cosmos.

Welcome to Space News from

On this series, we are
presenting what we consider
the ten most compelling
and clear-cut reasons
why electromagnetism is the
force that rules the cosmos.
This exercise provides an
invaluable opportunity
to juxtapose the theoretical
predictions and explanations
of standard cosmology versus
those of the Electric Universe.
In our first two episodes,
we explored the significance of
pervasive, vast cosmic magnetic fields
and filamentary cosmic
structures respectively,
neither of which are predicted or
explained by gravity-centric cosmology
but they are expected features
of an electric universe.
In fact, at all scales
throughout the cosmos,
both the structures and energies
of the most stupendous phenomena
reveal an underlying cause that
continues to elude space scientists.
Today we explore why spectacular emissions
across unimaginable cosmic distances
are the third of ten reasons
why the universe is electric.
Cosmic Jets
It is a mystery that space
science must openly confront,
what force is capable of producing high
energy jets spanning not millions of miles
but many light-years
across the cosmos.
What confines the jets to narrow
streams across cosmic distances
and what prevents the, so called, streams of
gas from dispersing in the "vacuum of space"?
These questions are posed by the discovery
of Herbig-Haro objects, or jetted stars,
which have sometimes been
characterized as "cosmic tornadoes".
The image on your screen appeared as the
Astronomy Picture of the Day in 2006.
The stellar jet of
Herbig-Haro 49/50
was detected at the incredible
velocity of 100 km/s.
The caption of the APOD, entitled
Cosmic Tornado, reads as follows,
"Though such energetic outflows are well known to be
associated with the formation of young stars,
the exact cause of the spiraling structures
apparent in this case is still mysterious."
Of course, terms like
tornado and outflow
are derived from the familiar behaviors
of wind and water on our own rocky planet.
But how could such terminology be applicable
to the behaviors of "gases in a vacuum"?
The inappropriateness of the analogy
is highlighted in the scientific paper,
The Formation of Stars and
Solar Systems. It states,
"Stellar jets are analogous
to giant lawn sprinklers.
Whether a sprinkler whirls,
pulses or oscillates,
it offers insights into how
its tiny mechanism works.
Likewise stellar jets, billions or
trillions of miles long, offer some clues
as to what's happening close into the
star at scales of only millions of miles.
Material either at or near the star
is heated and blasted into space,
where it travels for billions of miles
before colliding with interstellar material.
This explanation raises more
than one fatal objection.
It begs the question,
if one were to turn on a
"lawn sprinkler in space"
what would happen to
the stream of water?
The aforementioned paper acknowledges the
problem by asking the following question,
"Why are jets so narrow?
The Hubble pictures increase the mystery as
to how jets are confined into a thin beam."
Of course, heat alone does not explain the
ejection and confinement of the jetted material.
Discussing the jet of
Herbig Haro 1/11,
the aforementioned paper admits
that a disc around the star,
which is supposed to provide the "nozzle" from
which the theoretical lawn sprinkler emanates,
is not evident in this image.
The authors then entertain a rarely
considered possibility; they state,
"One theoretical possibility is
that magnetic fields in the disk
might focus the gas
into narrow beams,
but there is as yet no direct observational
evidence that magnetic fields are important."
We note that this statement was
published more than a decade ago
and, as we outlined in the
first episode of this series,
even in the last 10 years space
scientists have had no choice
but to much more freely acknowledge the
pervasive vast cosmic magnetic fields.
A dramatic recent example of
this is the magnetic field
scientists have detected associated
with the Magellanic bridge,
a thread-like filament stretching
an astounding 75,000 light-years
and connecting the small and
large Magellanic Clouds.
One of the researchers
said of the finding,
"Not only are entire
galaxies magnetic,
but the faint delicate threads
joining galaxies are magnetic, too.
Everywhere we look in the
sky, we find magnetism."
Jane Kaczmarek of the University
of Sydney said of the finding,
"In general, we don't know how such
vast magnetic fields are generated,
nor how these large-scale magnetic fields
affect galaxy formation and evolution."
Just as electric currents sustain
and confine the vast filament
connecting the small and
large Magellanic Clouds,
it is electric currents
flowing through plasma
that produce the extraordinary structure
and energies of the Herbig-Haro jets.
An ongoing astronomical mystery is both the
beaded structure and "kinkiness" of stellar jets.
Of course, as plasma physicists will
attest, beading and kink instabilities
are two of the most easily recognized
features of electrical discharges in plasma.
In fact, as we turn our attention
to an even greater scale,
to the spectacular cosmic jets
seen emanating from galaxies,
we see the perhaps inevitable confirmation
of the jet's electrical nature.
In 2011, a team of scientists including
radio astronomer Philipp Kronberg,
measured the electrical current in the
jet shooting from the galaxy 3C303.
The New Scientist headline "Universe's
highest electric current found"
states of the finding,
"A COSMIC jet 2 billion light-years away is
carrying the highest electric current ever seen:
10 to the 18th power amps, equivalent
to a trillion bolts of lightning.
Philipp Kronberg of the University of
Toronto in Canada and colleagues
measured the alignment of radio waves
around a galaxy called 3C303,
which has a giant jet of
matter shooting from its core.
They saw a sudden change in the waves'
alignment coinciding with the jet.
'This is an unambiguous signature
of a current,' says Kronberg."
 
 
Unfortunately, the team of scientists
can only conclude that a black hole
produces magnetic fields which
then generate the current.
But more recently, the study of
cosmic jets at the vastest scale
has provided findings that can only
be described as fatal for this theory.
In 2016, astronomers
reported a finding
that will never be reconciled with
conventional black hole theory.
A Royal Astronomical Society press
release states of the finding,
"...supermassive black holes in a
region of the distant universe
are all spinning out radio
jets in the same direction.."
A lead investigator, professor
Romeel Dave writes,
"This is not obviously expected based on
our current understanding of cosmology.
It's a bizarre finding."
As noted by Professor
Andrew Russ Taylor,
"These black holes don't know about each other,
or have any way of exchanging information
or influencing each other directly
over such vast scales..."
In the Electric Universe it is not
black holes at the centers of galaxies
which are responsible for the
observed energies and mass.
Rather, the plasma discharge
phenomenon, called a z-pinch,
creates plasmoids at
the cores of galaxies.
As the plasmoid's charge
density increases,
it creates the well-known plasma
feature called a double layer
which can explode or release energy in the form
of cosmic jets and other spectacular emissions.
As we explained in
the previous episode,
plasma scientists have provided
persuasive experimental proof
for the dominant role of electromagnetism in
influencing the structure and rotation of galaxies.
In the Electric Universe, space
across the vastest cosmic distances
has a substructure of electrical potential,
typically extremely subtle at any point
but sufficient to affect
cosmic directionality.
Both stars and galaxies occur
like pearls on a string
revealing a filamentery or even cellular
structure to the universe at unfathomable scales.
Plasma physicists have
demonstrated experimentally
that plasma discharges can be
scaled up to 14 orders of magnitude.
In fact, the Nobel prize-winner, the
father of plasma cosmology Hannes Alfven
proposed that plasma phenomena could be scaled
up to an incredible 28 orders of magnitude.
As we will continue to demonstrate
in our following episode,
standard astrophysics will
never successfully explain
the most stupendous electromagnetic
events in the cosmos
through theoretical models in which
electricity doesn't cause anything.
The breathtaking form and
energies of cosmic jets
are yet another of countless reminders
that we live in an electric universe.

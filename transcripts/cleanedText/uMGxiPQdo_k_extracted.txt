The planet Mars -- our planetary
neighbor and a source of enormous
mystery for space
science and academia.
In our previous episode, our guest Ev
Cochrane summarized some of the
incredible identities given Mars in ancient
myth, astronomical traditions, and religion.
For reasons that defy explanation
based on Mars's appearance
and behavior in our sky today,
Mars was globally recognized as a
masculine warrior hero, the
God of War, a Dragonslayer.
Cochrane also described the
equally inexplicable, in modern
astronomical terms, relationship
between the "masculine" Mars and the
feminine Venus in
ancient storytelling.
For decades, Cochrane and his colleagues
including David Talbott and the late
Dwardu Cardona have worked to
reconstruct the catastrophic celestial
events that inspired countless global
recurring patterns in myth and religion.
As Cochrane explains in this conclusion,
the reconstruction of these events has
involved not merely a cross-cultural
investigation of myth, but also sheds
remarkable new light on the
origins of words and language.
I've now had 40 years of
experience reconnecting these myths
and is becoming more and more apparent
that not only are the myths all around
the world, but comparative mythology
works hand in hand with comparative
linguistics or language.
And so, take whatever language
you want, it doesn't
make any difference because languages
will always include archaic vestiges of
these catastrophic events, and so words
will mean things that have no reference
whatsoever in the current natural
world or the current sky.
When you find that confirmed
on virtually every continent,
you get a level of
confidence that suggests that
we're on the right
track, that's for sure.
To take a classic example, we
mentioned eclipses earlier, so
the universal myth of the
eclipse is that a sun-like
object is swallowed by
a great dragon, right?
Of course, as you said, there
are no such things as dragons.
So what does that mean?
And you will find that cultures
all around the world will
always say, that was a time of tremendous
terror, disaster and that indigenous
cultures all around, they always made a
tremendous noise like banging on drums
or clashing shields together or shouting
and screaming at the time of an eclipse.
Their goal was, according to
them, to scare away the dragon.
None of that makes sense
by current standards.
I mean, we just had a full eclipse of the
Sun here in the last year or so, which
was a spectacular event, but number one --
there was no disaster, there was no loud
clanging of sounds, the end
of the world did not happen.
And so, as you start to piece
these things together, you realize
that these traditions surrounding
eclipses have nothing to do with the
current eclipse whatsoever, they had to
do with a prototypical celestial
disaster that was interpreted as a sun-like
object being swallowed by a giant dragon.
To give you another example,
I think that uses a little bit of
language, that will make my point.
The Sumerian word, again, Sumerian is
theoretically the oldest language on the
planet, you know, started writing about
3000 BC, and in the Sumerian language the
word for Sun is Ud, but the Sumerian
word for storm is also Ud.
Now, how is that to be explained?
Why would a culture use the same
word to describe a Sun as
they used to describe a storm?
Well, if you pull up the earliest artworks
in ancient Mesopotamia, you will
see this picture of the Sun will have a giant
Thunderbolt or lightning bolt right in its center.
So, slowly but surely, you start
to deduce that the former Sun
was electrical in nature and the
former Sun God was the Thunder God.
So turn to Greece or take any culture, doesn't
make any difference; the same bizarre
association of Sun and storm will show
up in other cultures as well and also in
other languages, so it's not just a wild
guess about comparative mythology.
This is comparative linguistics and so, that
is a powerful argument that some
historical event caused these bizarre
associations in these various languages.
The earliest pictures of the Sun show a giant
lightning bolt set right in the center of it.
Dave and I had reconstructed
that the center was where
Mars was at, and so you get this image
that Mars was at the center of an
intense lightning storm, and so it was
constantly being subjected to these
unbelievably powerful exchanges of lightning,
plasma, whatever you want to call it.
Unbelievable torsion of its
geological structure.
Again, the language also is
going to describe that, so when
you talk about early words for lightning bolt or
thunderbolt, they will have the word star in there.
So like you will have, a word
for thunderbolt is "astropeleki"
for example, and there's dozens of
words that I can cite just like that,
but it clearly means star-something,
in that case star-axe.
The original thunderbolt was a
celestial, star-caused event.
That has never been discerned
before, or properly recognized
as being at the heart of so much of
comparative mythology, but it clearly
testifies to the solar system having a radically
different appearance in former times.
In 1971, when the Mariner 9
spacecraft returned the closest images
of the Martian surface to that time,
planetary scientists were astonished to
observe the stupendous feature of Valles
Marineris, an enormous canyon system
which is four thousand kilometres long
and reaches depths of up to seven kilometers.
If Mars was indeed drastically
closer to Planet Earth only
several thousands of years ago in
prehistory, then, as Ev explains, perhaps
it's not a coincidence that a figure in myth
and storytelling is the scar-faced warrior.
I don't think there's
any doubt about it.
The particular myth that Dave has cited
very early on, I'll just read it to you, it's
describing this character named Scarface
in North American myth and it goes
like this, "He was so poor he had no
clothes, not even moccasins to wear.
He did not play with other children,
because they made fun of him ... He had a
ridge-scar on his face, and
they called him Scarface."
So, as I mentioned earlier,
when Mars was close to Venus a long
ways from Earth, it appeared small, like an
infant at Venus' breast, but when it
moved on its orbit towards the Earth, it
grew giant in size, and so you get the
impression that you could see a lot of
the surface fixtures on Mars, kind of
like we can see the structures on Moon
right now when we've got a full
Moon, you know, you'll see certain
sections of a crater on the Moon or whatever.
But there's no doubt that Mars
was much bigger than the Moon and when
it got close to the Earth, if the scar
was there, Valles Marineris, yes, I think
that's a very strong possibility.
One of the great surprises in planetary
science has been the discovery of Martian
meteorites on planet Earth.
While many mainstream astronomers
initially challenged the
validity of the discovery, Ev explains
why Martian meteorites on our planet are
both explicable and necessary
in the catastrophists' hypothesis.
When we first started discussing this subject
in the mid-90s, Dave and I were on the internet
trying to get some feedback from the
scientists, we had a bunch of JPL
scientists on there, the world's famous
figures, each and every one of them
denied that meteorites could get off the
planet Mars, they could not, they had no
way that they could figure
out how these giant
rocks could get ejected
off the planet Mars.
But we had statements from
ancient Sumerian texts and
stuff saying meteorites come
from the planet Mars, so
we were pretty confident that not only
did meteorites from Mars make it to
Earth but they make it to
Earth in tremendous numbers.
That just based upon our reading of
myth and so, within about five
years, very quickly, the scientists came
up with this ejection hypothesis where
they have some massive celestial objects
smash into Mars and ejecting these meteorites.
And of course, they place it
many many millions of years ago and
these, we're supposed to imagine that
these rocks have traveled around solar
system for countless millions of years and then
they just happen to make their way to Earth.
Our theory, of course, argues
that because of these tremendous
exchanges of thunderbolts, the lightning,
plasma, and the torsion going on between Mars
moving close orbit to Earth, that it
just naturally follows that gargantuan
amounts of Mars rocks were launched into
the atmosphere and because of the close
proximity to the planet Earth,
it follows that they fell in great
numbers on the planet Earth, much higher
numbers than would ever be expected from
the mainstream theory, and at the same
time now, you have a perfectly natural
explanation for why Mars lost its
water, why it lost its atmosphere.
I mean, mainstream astronomers have no
envision for why Mars looks like it had
tremendous oceans and flowing water and
yet there's no possibility of having
water today because it's out in the
middle of nowhere, it's frozen solid.
But given our theory, where Mars was right
next to the Earth, it stands to reason
that just like the Earth, it probably had
water at some point in time and it
certainly had an atmosphere at some
point in time, and according to our
theory of course, it's lost both here in
the last five to ten thousand years as a
result of these stupendous catastrophes.

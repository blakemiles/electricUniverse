What powers the Sun?
The answer seems obvious.
It must be nuclear energy to allow the
Sun to shine for billions of years.
But that assumes, as Sir Arthur Eddington
did in the early 20th century, that stars
are isolated objects in space, and
because it had been found that the
fusion of two hydrogen nuclei produced
the most energy and hydrogen dominates
the sun's outer atmosphere,
Eddington assumed that stars are a
gravitating ball of hydrogen gas.
The astronomer George Gamow wrote of
Eddington, "he was able to find out
everything about the interior of the Sun
and other stars without leaving his
comfortable study at Cambridge
University.
Eddington famously used to say, "It should
not be too difficult to understand such
a simple thing as a star."
The misguided certainty of mathematical theorists
becomes conspicuous as Gamow continues,
"...astronomers can tell the temperature of
the central regions of the Sun and of
the many stars within a few percentage
points and be quite sure about the
figures they quote."
So scientists have labored ever
since, using Eddington's
simplistic model, in an attempt to
produce nuclear energy "like the
Sun" although the model doesn't predict
any of the complex features
seen on or above the Sun.
The certainty attached to
mathematical models is entirely
misplaced if the physical model is
incorrect.
Unbeknownst to the general public and to
many scientists, an alternative electric
Sun model was proposed
in 1979 by an engineer.
It has the critical longevity
of all electric lights, it is plugged
into a Galactic circuit and galactic
circuits are the basis of plasma
cosmology which is ignored by
astrophysicists but was developed by
experimental scientists and engineers in
the 20th century
and it has proven to be predictive, quite
unlike mathematical Big Bang cosmology.
Only in the last few years have the
circumstances arisen to enable the
Electric Sun model to be tested.
Called the SAFIRE project, the cutting-edge
engineering firm Aurtas international
incorporated was contacted by the
International Science Foundation to
experimentally test the Electric Sun model.
Aurtas International Incorporated
is an independent body which has no
affiliation with the Electric Universe
or The Thunderbolts Project.
Recently, the SAFIRE team shared an
extraordinary update on their results to date.
Today, in part 1 of this two-part presentation,
physicist Wal Thornhill discusses the
SAFIRE experiment, its results and its
promise for the future.
History was made on July 7th
at the University of Bath
Electric Universe Conference in the UK,
when the 2019 SAFIRE project update
announced the success of the SAFIRE
experiment at the end of phase 2.
On September 2nd, it was shared publicly on
The Thunderbolts website.
SAFIRE, S A F I R E, the
cryptic acronym means stellar
atmospheric function in
regulation experiment.
In plain language, it is the
Electric Sun experiment which aimed to
reproduce in a lab on earth the plasma
features of the Sun,
from the photosphere outward into
space, to do so reproducibly
and to show that it was self-regulating.
The aim was to let nature show us, if the
model was correct,
how and why stars like the 
Sun shine so steadily.
It followed the example of an
early pioneer of the Electric Universe,
the Norwegian scientist Kristian
Birkeland with his terella,
or little Earth experiment which he
performed at the end of the 19th century.
Birkeland demonstrated Auroras using an
electric discharge to a magnetized
sphere enclosed in a vacuum chamber.
Amongst other things,
he predicted an electrical connection
between the Earth 
and the Sun, composed of
electrons and flying ions of all kinds.
In modern terms, he had
predicted the solar wind.
The concept of electricity in space was
clearly not taboo in the 19th century.
Montgomery Childs who is
president and founder of Aurtas
international and manager of the
SAFIRE project, together with the
physicist Dr. Michael Clarage, provided
the experiment update.
Monty summed up with these words,
"In all our experiments
and discoveries we have found no
disparities with the Electric Sun model.
We believe the SAFIRE experiment validates
and supports the Electric Sun model."
The mind-blowing consequences of these
words may not be immediately apparent.
The SAFIRE experiment was an
independent audit of the Electric Sun
model by a Canadian engineering company Aurtas
international with an interest in solar energy.
The project was funded by
the International Science Foundation, ISF,
whose mission states that it, "was
established to support promising new
research in the sciences, placing a
spotlight on innovative ideas that have
met initial scientific tests but lacked
recognition or funding. The ISF places
its highest value on prospects for
far-reaching discovery."
These goals are sadly lacking
in mainstream science
where experts are far too quick to
defend the status quo and declare
unfamiliar proposals impossible.
At risk was the life's work of a number of
scholars who are responsible for the
Electric Sun model.
Such risk-taking is not something
seen in today's inventive
science, where model failures are
everyday occurrences but rarely
seriously acted upon.
Generally, they are
dismissed by qualifiers such as "the
phenomenon is not fully understood" which
are weasel words for "send more funding
to continue searching for imaginary
particles and forces we may invent so as
to save appearances and per chance to score
a Nobel Prize."
This shows that extraordinary disproof is
required for modern institutionalized science.
The SAFIRE results now proves,
cosmologists and particle physicists
don't understand stars!
Eddington's complicated untestable
century-old model is wrong, we don't
understand the universe at any level
from the subatomic to the Galactic and
everything in between.
Some background to the electric
model is necessary here.
Aurtas international had developed a new
solar panel microfilament technology and
was investigating new energy systems.
Monty first called me in Australia, in
2011, to find out if I could help him
with his research, since he had looked at
the Electric Sun model and for the first
time in his extensive engineering
experience he could, in his
words, find no disparities.
That is, no inconsistencies when he
compared it to the standard solar model.
So I introduced Monty to my
Thunderbolts partner in the US, David
Talbott who persuaded him to write a
paper addressing his stated concern that,
if after 14 years of our Electric
Universe collaboration we don't test the
Electric Sun model, we may find ourselves
in the same place in another 14 years.
So in January 7th, 2012, Monty presented
an experimental test of the Electric Sun
at the annual Electric Universe
conference in Las Vegas.
An engineer from Flagstaff,
Arizona, Ralph Juergens had
his well-researched Electric Sun model
published in 1979 under the headline:
Stellar Thermonuclear Energy, a False
Trail? Shortly after his untimely death
his friend and colleague Dr. Earl Milton,
associate professor of physics at the
University of Lethbridge in Canada,
edited Juergens' unpublished material.
Both Ralph and Earl, like many others, had
been inspired by Immanuel Velikovsky's 1950
challenge to astronomers in his
best-selling book "Worlds in Collision".
It demanded critical attention to dramatic
early global stories of an incandescent
cometary Venus, and battles between nine
planets hurling Thunderbolts of the Gods
which raised fundamental questions about
recent electrical activity and orbital
instabilities in the solar system.
That was the gauntlet Velikovsky
threw down at astronomers.
Electricity plays a role
in celestial dynamics.
Critical support for this
foundational challenge to
gravitational cosmology came at a
historic meeting in Portland, Oregon in
2000, where the leading expert in
high-energy plasma discharge phenomena,
Anthony Peratt, matched the various
worldwide petroglyph representations of
the cosmic Thunderbolt with the complex
forms of plasma instabilities he had
documented using the high-energy z-pinch
facility at Los Alamos National Laboratories.
He wrote later of the
"uncanny accuracy of mythology
originating in prehistory that precedes
by millennia what is discovered in
high-energy density plasma 
experiments today."
It explained why our prehistoric
forebears around the world had laboriously
chiseled the same strange-looking
stick figures and concentric
circles into hard rock.
Whatever they were
depicting must have been seen in the sky
and held the greatest importance for them.
The echoes of their existential
doomsday fears from that time, still
reverberate in us today.
Velikovsky's research should not have been
dismissed on the mere authoritative
pronouncement that it had disobeyed
Newton's law of gravity.
Neither Newton nor anyone after
him has explained the force of gravity.
So it was that
Velikovsky alone
predicted before the Space Age; the
extreme temperature of Venus, the
remanent magnetism in the Moon rocks
returned by the Apollo missions, and
electrically generated radio
noises from Jupiter.
The last prediction drew
Einstein's attention, but astronomers
showed they learn nothing from history.
As the noted astronomer Sir Fred Hoyle
wrote in his book "Home
Is Where the Wind Blows,"Velikovsky's
book caused a sensation both with the
public and among astronomers, the latter
becoming stirred to near violent
displays of outrage. Such eminent figures
as Harlow Shapley were heavily involved.
It could be said that Shapley became
angry even to the point of incoherence."
They set up a metaphorical modern-day
book burning by forcing the textbook
publisher Macmillan to cease publishing
their best-seller and hand it to Doubleday.
Astronomy is still ruled by
its fearful high priests.
Hoyle seemed to intuit the answer, could it be
that somewhere in the shadows there is a past
history that it is inadmissible to discuss?
So I'm pleased that, inspired by
Velikovsky's leading research into the
recent catastrophic history of the Earth
and humanity, the Electric Universe has
an unparalleled record of successful
predictions in the Space Age and is
freeing astronomy from its
misunderstood past.
In 1977, Juergens wrote, "One would
think that the sheer
weight of Space Age discoveries -- most of
them pointing to an Electric Universe in
the Velikovskian mode -- might have
rallied at least a few professionals. But
strangely enough, this has not happened.
And it is left to us who might rather be
bystanders to take up the study."
Earlier, in 1973,
Juergens wrote, "As I pursued the
phenomenology of electric discharges, it
gradually dawned on me that, structurally,
the atmosphere of the Sun bears a
striking resemblance to the low-pressure
type of electric discharge
known as the glow discharge..."
Of course, this questions
the Sun's internal
thermonuclear energy source.
Juergens stated the obvious, the
modern astrophysical concept that
describes the Sun's energy to
thermonuclear reactions deep in the
solar interior, is contradicted by nearly
every observable aspect of the Sun.
He opened up another major front in the
battle for recognition and acceptance,
this time with particle physicists.
Only now, it seems it's time for change,
with experts declaring
a crisis in physics.
But the experts
don't know where to turn.
Their training gives them
no historical perspective
beyond the October 1927, 5th Solvay
international conference in Brussels,
where the world's most notable
physicists met to discuss the newly
formulated quantum theory, which to this
day no one understands.
That is inexcusable.

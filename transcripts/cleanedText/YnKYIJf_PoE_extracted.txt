Welcome to Space News from the Electric
Universe brought to you by

Today, we begin a series of reports that will
discuss the latest scientific papers on the
European Space Agency's Rosetta mission to Comet 67P.
In addition to countless unresolved puzzles
facing comet scientists, we have
discussed in previous episodes the
problem of the comet's double-lobed
shape, however that particular form of a
comet nucleus is apparently not unique.
Several other of the comets imaged to
date have displayed similar forms.
Multiple asteroids, including this one
imaged on July 25th of this year, have
displayed distinct peanut-like shapes
with a marked narrowing at the body's
neck. And recently, NASA's New Horizons
mission has revealed that the Plutonian
moon Hydra also has a double-lobed form.
Why do so many of these different types of bodies
in the solar system display this particular shape?
The Electric Universe theory states that
comets and asteroids were electrically
excavated from planets and moons in a
relatively recent epoch of planetary
instability, as discussed in previous
episodes. Plasma scientist
Dr. C.J. Ransom produced these familiar
double-lobed forms in experiments with
electrical discharges to samples of Heamatite.
In fact, Comet 67P has revealed countless
distinctly planetary features, including wind-
streaked rocks, fields of boulders and rubble,
mountainous terrain that appears to have
been uplifted from a planetary body and
even sand dunes. However, as Wal Thornhill
explains, the only explanation that Rosetta
scientists can offer for the comet's
shape is a remarkably improbable
low-velocity collision
between two comets.
A report by the European Space Agency
published on 28 September titled,
"How Rosetta's comet got it's shape",
concluded from some important research published
in the journal Nature (the same day) that,
"Two comets collided at low speed in the
early solar system to give rise to the
distinctive rubber duck shape of
Comet 67P Churyumov–Gerasimenko". Earlier, there
were two competing ideas: Did two comets merge or
did localized erosion of a single object
form the neck? Now, scientists have an unambiguous
answer to the conundrum. They have shown
that the shape arose from a low speed
collision between two fully fledged,
separately formed comets.
Matteo Massironi - lead author from
the University of Padova, Italy, and an
associate scientist of the OSIRIS
team said, "It is clear from the images
that both lobes have an outer envelope
of material organized in distinct layers,
and we think these extend for several
hundred meters below the surface ... This
points to the layered envelopes in the
comet's head and body forming
independently before the two objects
merged later", concludes Matteo.
"It must have been a low-speed collision in
order to preserve such ordered strata to the
depths our data imply". Co-author Bjorn
Davidsson added, "In addition, the striking
structural similarities between the two
lobes imply that despite their initially
independent origins, they must have
formed through a similar accretion process.
Layering has also been observed on the
surface of other comets during
previous flyby missions, suggesting that
they also underwent a similar formation
history". Holger Sierks, OSIRIS principal
investigator at the Max Planck Institute
for Solar System Research in Göttingen
said, "How the comet got its curious
shape has been a major question since we
first saw it. Now, thanks to this detailed
study, we can say with certainty
that it is a 'contact binary'."
So much for the reports, but how exactly
do you get two widely separated bodies
experiencing similar primordial
stratified accretion? And why primordial?
That's simply an assumption, and the
mechanism of gravitational accretion has
never been shown to work!
Notice also the emphasis on gentle and
low-speed collisions. Just how slow does
it have to be, so the result is not
mutual fragmentation and dispersal?
And how does a collision form a neck between
these two lobes?! On top of that, what are
the chances of collision of two tiny
bodies of a few kilometres cross-section
in a volume of space in the outer solar
system that is unimaginably huge! The
explanation requires so many post-hoc and
unlikely conditions that it is
unbelievable. It only passes the critical
faculties because it's a story that is
being repeated and repeated until we no
longer think about it. The Nature paper
refers to the stratified rocky-like
material, seen on the comet's surface
it shows how experts can become blind to
what the untrained eye can plainly see -
that Comet 67P is rocky. The selective
blindness occurs because it destroys a
cherished belief in the centuries old
story of the primordial solar system, but
that story has failed repeatedly. It is
not predictive. Each new discovery is a
surprise - the most recent being Pluto and
it's moon. And now that we have
information from more than 2,000 XO
planetary systems, our solar system seems
like the odd one out. But modern
specialization and fragmentation of
science allows such disconnects to exist,
and spread, which must lead to an
inevitable crisis. The history of science
shows this to be the case with centuries
of stagnation followed by sudden
breakthroughs and often the
breakthroughs have come from outsiders
who look at problems with a beginner's
mind. Old beliefs die hard. The astronomer,
the late Tom Van Flandern, in his 1993 book
"Dark Matter, Missing Planets and New
Comets" made the comparison between
comets, minor planets and asteroids and
suggested they are the same basic types
of rocky bodies. Comets are dark,
reflecting a few percent of sunlight
which is not expected for icy bodies.
And radar echoes from Comet Encke implied a
non-porous, probably rock surface
material. An expert in celestial
mechanics, Van Flandern is perhaps best
known for his exploding planet
hypothesis which he proposed as the
origin of asteroids and comets and which
is supported by showing that the orbits
of comets and asteroids could be
understood in terms of an origin in a
late explosive event in the asteroid
belt. His exploding planet hypothesis is
discounted, of course, by the lack of a
plausible mechanism to cause a planet to
explode. And now, by the onion-skin
layering in the two lobes of Comet 67P,
which implies formation by accretion
rather than fragmentation in an
explosion. But his arguments are
compelling for a cataclysmic event in
the asteroid belt to produce tens of
thousands of asteroids and comets. What's
most persuasive is, that he's unusual
hypothesis predicted stable asteroid
satellites, which was surprisingly
confirmed. So, what was the explosive
event and how did it form peanut-shaped
comets and asteroids? The chances of
direct collisions of tiny rocks in the
vastness of interplanetary space to
produce the peanut-shapes are negligible.
Multiply that by the odds of the
colliding rock sticking together and
forming a neck and the chances are about
zero. Gravitational capture and tidal
forces do not enhance the odds
significantly. The serious nature of this
problem was highlighted in July this
year when Lance Benner, who leads NASA's
Asteroid Radar Research program said
that, "Radar imaging has shown that about
15 percent of near-Earth asteroids larger than
600 feet (or 180 metres) ... have this sort of
lobed, peanut shape. There must be a process
that forms the double-lobe shape naturally."
A clue comes from experiments done by
C.J. Ransom using an electric
discharge striking Haematite powder to
simulate the red Martian surface. The
Martian "blueberries" were replicated in
color and shape by the laboratory
discharges. It was also found that
interlocking blueberries are a property of
spherules formed during an electric
discharge. It may also be significant
considering the apparent low density
of Comet 67P, that the Haematite
spherules were hollow with thick walls. It
seems that the catastrophic event
required by Van Flandern's research was
of an electrical nature. There is a
cosmic electric discharge - an
interplanetary thunderbolt - which has
been graphically depicted many times in
our Space News. Van Flandern, an expert
in orbital dynamics, traced his exploding
planet event to the asteroid belt beyond
Mars. So, it is highly significant that Mars
was identified with the cosmic thunderbolt
and was reported to have received
a scar, visible at the time
from Earth, following a battle using this
favored weapon of the planetary gods.
The great canyon system of Valles
Marineris, which stretches a third
of the way around Mars, is that scar.
Almost four billion cubic kilometres of
rock and dust was excavated from Mars within
the memory of mankind - a great deal of it
accelerated into space by gigantic plasma arc.
Meteorites from Mars are still arriving
on Earth today, and in 1988, I published a
paper arguing that of 17 mysteries
associated with common meteorites a
plasma arc process could explain all of
them. The discharge attracts and heats
matter along the discharge axis. Repeated
lightning strokes along the same path
will produce layering of matter
accreted along that discharge axis. The
appearance of that discharge could be
likened to bead lightning - a string of
glowing rocky beads. Matter is also
accelerated along the axis giving a high
probability of forming lobed asteroid
and comet precursers. The spatially and
temporally confined nature of this process
is also ideal for forming stable
asteroid and comet satellites. So, when
Rosetta project scientist Matt Taylor says
of Comet 67P, "This result adds to our
growing knowledge of the comet - how it
formed and it's evolution", he is dead wrong.
The accepted story of the slow formation
and evolution of the solar system over
billions of years is fictional. The story
I have told here is one of chaos and
violence in the solar system within the
last ten thousand years or so. As one
philosopher has written, Newton
on consciously religious, rather than
scientific grounds, gave currency to a
new form of the old belief that the
celestial order is altogether superior
to the terrestrial and cannot, in
particular, be the scene of any catastrophic
change. That belief has not changed much
in 350 years. When researchers are met with
endless surprises in space exploration,
they must be open to re-examining
old beliefs and assumptions -
only then will mankind benefit
fully from their remarkable
space engineering and exploration feats.

The theme is "Future Science,"
and this will be our sixth annual conference
August 17 to 20 in Phoenix, Arizona.
Perhaps you already know that
the Electric Universe paradigm
is gaining greater
traction year by year.
Who could deny today that
the vastness of space
is animated by a life-like sea of
charged particles called plasma?
Well, the plasma universe
is an electric universe,
and that's a far cry from the electrically
sterile cosmos of standard theory
throughout the 20th century.
When we speak of future science,
we mean science minus the fiction
-- no Big Bang, no dark matter, no black
hole singularities, no neutron stars,
no thermalnuclear core of the Sun, no planets
on clockwork orbits for billions of years
and few, if any, dirty
snowball comets.
The Electric Universe movement is a
reconsideration of fundamentals in the sciences.
Independent research is converged
on a series of electrical findings.
The confidence driving this movement
comes from the demonstrable power
of the electric force acting on planetary,
stellar, and galactic evolution.
No subatomic domain and no corner of the
remote universe is free from this influence:
the electric force,
the long overlooked underpinning
of the natural world.
EU2017 will include a roster of experts on
naturally-occurring electrical phenomena.
Our first recommendation
to you is, don't be late!
The first highlight
will be a talk
by the internationally recognized expert
on electrified water, Dr. Gerald Pollack.
Dr. Pollack will report on the
surprising role of separated charge
in the organization of
global weather systems.
Then will come our conference
keynote speaker, Dr. James Ryder.
Before his retirement in 2011, Dr. Ryder
served as a Vice-president at Lockheed Martin
and as head of the company's
Advanced Technology Center.
Dr. Ryder is currently Chairman of the Board
of the International Science Foundation
which funds the SAFIRE project and advises
on scientific aspects of the experiment.
Dr. Ryder's update will help to
set the tone of the conference,
in particular the anticipated report on
SAFIRE by Project Director Monty Childs.
Our Chief Science Adviser, Wal Thornhill,
will outline a vision for the future,
science incrementally discovering
one surprise at a time -
The Electric Universe.
And retired Professor of Electrical
Engineering, Donald Scott,
will review recent findings that now confirm
the presence of Birkeland currents in space.
The environment through which the earth
itself moves is not electrically neutral.
Add to this electrified mix the
contribution of Ben Davidson,
founder of the
Suspicious0bservers group.
Ben will speak on the interdisciplinary
implications of the electrical paradigm,
ranging across such diverse
fields as space science,
earthquake prediction, biomedical
engineering, and new energy prospects.
Of special interest, we will also be devoting a
full day to the Immanuel Velikovsky Controversy,
one of the most critical scientific
debates of the 20th century.
Suppression of Velikovsky's
work continued for decades
and the core issues raised still
haunt scientific discourse today.
Contributors to this discussion will include the
people closest to the controversy in recent years.
More than 15 additional experts will be
contributing as speakers and panelists.
Key themes will include
the electricity of life,
electrical scars of
planetary violence,
and the impact of planetary catastrophe
on the ancient civilizations.
We invite you to join us in this three and a
half day exploration of the Electric Universe.
That's EU2017 in Phoenix,
Arizona, August 17 to 20.

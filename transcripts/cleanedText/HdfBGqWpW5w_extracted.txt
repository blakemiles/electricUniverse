Gareth Samuel is a science educator and
frequent contributor to the Thunderbolts
Project. He also produces an outstanding
video series on Electric Universe Theory
that aims at the very heart of science.
He chose the perfect title for his YouTube
channel and you should check it 
out. It's called “See the Pattern”.
If a repeating pattern emerges from 
nature we should recognize it as significant.
To truly understand it, we should be able to
explain its cause and effect and reproduce it.
Seeing the pattern and discovering its 
cause and effect is what science is all about.
The proof is in recreating the pattern.
Not by subjectively programmed and data-
fixed mathematical models, but by physical
demonstration of the physics involved.
This essay presents a challenge for
those with a knack for playing with
electricity. I'm going to show you a
pattern - call it the ‘keystone pattern’,
because it's a pattern of key significance 
and its effect can be found in geology,
so it's written in stone. It's 
a pattern that results from
electrical discharge. I'll show you this pattern
and explain it in the best plain language I can,
and then it'll be up to you to reproduce it. It 
shouldn't be hard, in fact it's been done before.
You may know the pattern as the “crooked
smile” if you followed the Electric Universe
for several years. Michael 
Steinbacher and Billy Yelverton
produced the pattern in the image shown.
I believe it was Michael who called it
the crooked smile. I'm giving it a new name, 
the keystone name, because the smile
is only part of the pattern.
Michael intuitively understood this
pattern was the result of a multi-phase discharge.
He was trying to reproduce the shape of
Valles Marineris on Mars. He assumed 
correctly that by creating a discharge
in Billy's laboratory with the proper
setup, they could reproduce Valles
Marineris and they did. Unfortunately
they didn't explain their experimental
setup so we'll have to guess. My guess is they laid
a metal plate on a table to form one electrode.
They covered the metal plate with 
a dielectric plate, probably glass or
plastic to add resistance and enhance the reactive
power. Then they hung another electrode a few
inches above the plate and covered the plate 
and sand. I believe they then took two leads from
a three-phase power source, stepped into
high voltage, and connected one lead to
the plate and one lead to the hanging
electrode, creating a point-to-plane
electric field between two out-of-phase 
circuits. The pattern is caused by electrical
induction currents spread out in the
horizontal plane from the vertically
oriented, multi-phase discharge between the 
electrodes. These type of induction currents are
called ‘reactive power’ currents.
You can think of it like aiming a fire
hose at the floor. The stream of water from the nozzle
is an analogy for the vertical discharge current.
In terms of electricity, we call that ’real
power’ because it's going where we want it.
The water that splashes from the floor
are ‘reactive currents’ or ‘reactive power
currents’ in the case of electricity. There
is splashing across the electrode plate.
The stream of water hitting the floor is
like electric current hitting resistance.
Reactive power is the energy of currents
that gets redirected by the resistance.
The splash pattern that reactive power makes is
peculiar and very specific to electromagnetism.
Unlike water that splashes away vectored
by kinetic energy and gravity, an
electric current generates moving electric and
magnetic fields that vector its reactive energy.
So it generates a repeating fractal pattern.
Reproducing in the lab is as compelling
as scientific evidence can get. It's 
also compelling when you can find
it in nature. over and over again.
We're going to use it to identify
several electrical craters here on Earth,
and doing so dispel the silly notion
that Earth has been bombarded by asteroids and 
comets. This image shows the keystone pattern
again. Only this time I've annotated
certain features over the Billy Yelverton/
Michael Steinbacher experiment.
The pattern occurs over the duration of
the discharge while it is in contact with
the ground and making a complete circuit.
Over time the voltage vector of reactive
power, shooting out from the focal point,
rotates around the pattern like the second hand
of a clock, pointing to all points on the compass.
Only it sweeps around counterclockwise instead 
of clockwise. The current that follows this voltage
vector lags behind it, like the minute
hand of the clock chasing the second
hand, but never catching up. At 
the same time, magnetic fields are
pulsing outward in concentric waves from the
focal point and inducing current to follow it.
This sets up an interference pattern of
positively and negatively charged regions
around the circle formed by the induced
currents, where the sand grains which
also carry charge, are either attracted or 
repelled. It's much like a cymatic pattern created
by a particular frequency of vibration.
Only this is caused by induced out-of-
phase currents, where the charge on the
plate is the same as the sand. The sand
is levitated away which is technically called
‘sputtering’. And it's levitated to a region of
opposite charge where it sticks to form a 
mountain. Within the image, the red cross
represents primary reactive currents
that splash at particular vectors from
the discharge focused at the center of 
the X. C is a filament of electrical induction
or capacitive reactive current, and the
one marked L is a filament of magnetic
conduction reactive current. The 
green dashed circle that surrounds the
formation represents stray
capacitance generated in concentric
rings around the focus of the
discharge made by magnetic fields.
These are rings of step potentials that
are expressed as hills and valleys,
mountains or crater rims in geologic form-
ations. The blue lines shown are the crooked
smile that portray induction currents that
follow the electric or magnetic fields, or both.
On the left-hand quadrant, formed 
by the red X, the electric field induction
dominates, and the current flows straight
to the encircling ring and makes a 90-
degree turn to follow parallel to the
ring, because the capacitor ring is a
standing potential wave in the electric 
field. The quadrant on the right is the
magnetic induction-dominated region, so
the current streams out perpendicular to
magnetic field lines induced by the magnetic field.
These lines intersect the green rings at 90 degrees.
In the center through the top quadrant are bars
of blue. The bars are unipolar winds that drag
straight across the focal point of the
discharge. They probably aren't truly
unipolar winds; they're plasma winds, but
they're heavily ionized and so they move
extremely fast across the center of the discharge.
They're probably the easiest feature to identify
from reactive power currents.
The crooked smile is a fractal circuit
pattern of capacitive and inductive eddy currents
in these particular quadrants of reactive power.
The direction of current flow can go
either way depending on polarity, so I
don't usually show arrows in the diagrams. In the 
top and bottom quadrants formed by the red X
are where reactive currents form updrafts and
downdrafts. The yellow star shown in the top
quadrant is a downdraft current and the pale
green swirl in the bottom quadrant is an updraft.
These would be tornadoes and down-
bursts of plasma, wind and lightning.
They generally leave circular patterns of depressions
or hills. The next image shows the same features
more fully annotated. Note how the right-
side magnetic induction currents marked Il,
meet the encircling capacitance at 90 degrees,
while on the left capacitive induction currents
marked Ic bend 90 degrees to
parallel the encircling capacitance.
Note also that the upper half of the
right and left quadrants are more
inductive with tendrils crossing perpendicular to the
encirclement, and the lower halves are more capacitive
with parallel flows. The upper half also has currents
flowing upward towards the top of the circle,
whereas in the bottom half the current is parallel
and flow downward towards the bottom of the circle.
The difference is leading and lagging currents that
are either following or leading the electric field.
The left or capacitive quadrant will
sometimes also develop z-shaped currents
with current alternating its vector
between magnetic and electric fields.
The top and bottom quadrants produce up-
and down-currents that circle the crux
of the discharge in a ring- or toroidal current.
The yellow star and green swirl are the
face and footprint of this current.
For those interested in math and
fractals, phasors are calculated with complex 
numbers. The complex numbers have a rational
number of multipliers in the equations that
apply to these top and bottom quadrants.
The action of eddy currents is better
understood with the following gif
illustration that portrays the magnetic
flux generated by the discharging current.
The left hand side of this ‘compare’ image
shows the field lines of magnetism
created along the ground plane at 90 degrees
to the discharge. The right-hand side has black
lines indicating the path of induced
reactive eddy currents that are created
by this moving magnetic flux.
I first discovered the pattern while
examining the Laramie mountains in 
Wyoming. The pattern can be a crater or a
mountain, depending on polarity. I published 
two articles on these mountains last year.
It wasn't until this year that I recognized
the pattern I found, was the same as
Michael's crooked smile. The Laramie pattern was
caused by a plasma mesocyclone with its central
updraft representing the real power dis-
charge, the firehose current in other words;
a positive ion current, flowing up from
the ground into the storm. The ground was
negatively charged and so positive ionic
matter from the winds collected there by
static attraction, adhering to form the mountains.
The mountains retain the shape of the winds,
like a sand dune does, except for the influence
of electromagnetism that form the keystone pattern.
The pattern can be quantified and mapped
with something called a phasor diagram.
Phasors are 3D graphs of vectors.
For electrical circuits they're used to
determine the amplitude and direction of
energy flow or power at a given time.
In an alternating-current multiphase system there
are two or more waves out of phase with each other.
Phasors are used to determine the
resultant vector for the flow of power,
voltage, and current, when there are multiple 
waves. Man-made circuits work fast when the
energy sent down the wires is
aimed straight and doesn't splash.
Although some reactive power is needed,
unwanted splashing is inefficient. It
shows up as heat loss, signal noise and
can even create plasma streamers from
high voltage power connections. We 
manage this with physical things like
insulation, capacitors, transformers
and generators to control frequency and
amplitude and maximize what is called
the real power, the fire hose power, as
opposed to the reactive power or splashing.
Nature lets energy splash all over the
place and it results in plasma winds,
storms and tornadoes. It also results in
rock and mountain formation. The next 
image you'll recognize is the Richat structure.
The ‘compare’ image shows the basic
keystone pattern features. The wind
direction is verified, where possible,
by the triangular faces of tetrahedral
hills formed by supersonic shockwaves
and rock dikes, that are not marked on
this image, caused by wind and shock-
waves. The Richat was created by a plasma
tornado, spinning like a buzz saw,
between two opposing jet streams.
Tornadoes have a down-streaming core 
wind inside the spinning updraft. A tornado
electrically is called a Marklund current, and 
it has a central core downdraft of ionic wind.
That's why tornado genesis begins with a descending
column of condensate meeting a rising swirl of dust.
It's a connection being made - a down
coming leader meeting our upcoming
riser from the ground, to complete a circuit of
opposing positive and negative current flows.
The keystone pattern in the case of the
Richat was caused by induction winds
that hug the ground being fed by the pour
downdraft that blew out beneath the up-drafting
whirlwind. The next images show the wind pattern
of the whirlwind, and the shock waves that
resulted from the induction winds,
crossing under the whirlwinds.
The winds cross orthogonally and
leave cross-hatched shock features.
The Shoemaker crater in Australia
provides another example of the keystone
pattern. The crater doesn't show signs of
rotation on the ground, like the Richat
does, but the red cross of induced 
ground currents formed a rock dike that is
fairly pronounced, as are wind pattern
mountains at the green encircling ring
of capacitance forming the crater rim.
Induction features can be either
anodic or cathodic. If the ground is
charged negative, and a windfall of
positive ionic matter blows over, a
mountain of adhering matter will form.
If the negative ground is exposed to
a ground-to-ground discharge it will
sputter, or blast earth away and leave a de-
pression. If the ground has positive matter in it,
that will suck to the discharge, and fuse to form a
rock dike. Examples of rock dikes formed by ground
currents are shown in the next images.
Anode and cathode features will appear
alternately, as current passes through
the encircling rings of capacitance,
making interference patterns in the hills and
crater rims. If you're wondering, do you find these
patterns on the moon? No. Lunar 
craters are from direct current - DC
charges, because the moon is not alive
with the geomagnetic field like Earth is.
Earth is a multi-phase circuit and these
patterns result from multi-phase,
alternating current interactions.
There are several craters that exhibit
the fast unipolar winds crossing the crater
rims caused by induction across the blue bar.
Here are three in the next collage of images.
The striations cross in each of these
images show that winds crossed right across
the center top of each of these craters.
No one crater exhibits every feature
perfectly. Some features are covered by
sand, water, farms and cities; some have eroded,
and some simply don't develop in every condition.
The patterns develop from reactive
currents in both the air and ground.
There is, however, pattern consistency,
when several features are evident in the
correct position with respect
to the quadrants of the phasor.
Here are several craters from around the
Earth most of them falsely attributed to
meteors. They are the result of a
discharge current flowing between Earth
and sky; all exhibit aspects of the keystone 
pattern. Note the ‘Q’ in each ring. At roughly the
five o'clock position, each crater
exhibits a hook-shaped slash or other
anomaly through the ring. Of 
course I've oriented the pictures so
they are consistent. But note that 
there is also similarity in the pattern of
river channels connecting to the ring to either side
of the Q mark. So there is a quick and dirty way to
identify the keystone pattern. Just look 
for the Q with a lightning bolt through it.
Truth is always holistic. We've been
trained to think our consciousness is
constrained to the brain. It's not.

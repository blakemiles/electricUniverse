Welcome to Space News from
the Electric Universe,

In part 1 of this presentation, Thunderbolts
contributor archaeologist Peter Mungo Jupp
began his comprehensive analysis
on the nature of comets
including the Electric Universe
perspective that comets are not
4.5 billion year old icy
leftovers of the early solar system.
Included in his analysis, Jupp
presented outtakes of his interview
with physicist Wal Thornhill
recorded a few years ago
discussing Thornhill's
perspective on comet origins.
In this episode, we begin
with Thornhill explaining
why the notion of comets
as sublimating ice balls
cannot explain most
comet activity.
The other thing is that if you
have one of these objects,
if it was just a ball of icy
dust approaching the Sun,
what would happen is that
the ice would turn to a gas
and it should just blow
off like a kind of a wind.
But that's not what we see. We see
these very well-defined jets
and we also see bright spots on the
nucleus when they photograph the nucleus.
And those bright spots
are unexplained
but in the electrical model, of course, that
is the point where the arcs are coming from.
Okay, yep.
And that's from within
the comet itself
and is this the reason you get this huge
tail of discharge on the comet, is that?
It's one of the reasons why you get these
well-collimated jets of very fine material
because it's the sort of technique
used in electrical sputtering,
- the coating of astronomical
mirrors and so on
- Yeah
where you just take atoms
at a time off a cathode
and then attract them
towards a charged surface
or you just have them floating in space, if
you like, and then they land on the mirror,
the glass surface, and form this
coating of metal, just a few atoms thick.
And so these atoms are shunted way out
in space on the tail of the comet.
Yes, and they're,
and they're
phosphorescing...
...well they are glowing because they're
an electrical discharge, yeah.
And the trajectory that they take is that
which is also seen in the laboratory
in an electrical discharge.
This a parabolic curve.
And there's plenty of evidence that this
is the kind of thing we should expect.
For instance, on Io, the so called
volcanoes of Io, they too are cathode jets
and they're very distinctive in
that, unlike any volcano known on Earth,
they deposit their
material in a ring
but this is characteristic
of an electrical discharge
because it sorts the material according
to atomic or molecular weight...
Okay...
and it follows a
distinct trajectory.
Okay, now so we've got a little
bit of the nature of a comet now
which is basically a negatively
charged body moving towards the Sun
and something else happens then.
It can either go past the Sun,
it can split and explode, just
like Shoemaker-Levy 9 did,
when it impacted on, flash-
impacted, I like to call it, on Jupiter,
or it can actually
hit the Sun. Now,
what happens when
it hits the Sun?
Well this is, we've got photos or movies of
this sort of thing and usually it seems...
Yes, well, the electrical influence of a
comet extends to the boundary of its coma
and the coma of some comets, like the recent
one of Hartley, was bigger than the Sun.
So this tiny lump of rock has an electrical
influence which extends over a vast volume.
So they're incredibly powerful
compared to their physical size?
Absolutely, and so you can
understand then that that
intrusion of a charged
body near a charged Sun
can give rise to a sudden
discharge from the Sun,
in other words a
coronal mass ejection.
Okay, and that's on the opposite side
of the Sun, at least in the films I've seen?
Well, actually, you get effects occurring on
opposite sides of the Sun almost simultaneously
which is absolutely impossible
if the Sun is powered internally.
Yep.
However, if the Sun is an
electrical body, that is possible
because the influences
are coming from outside
and they can be
synchronized electrically.
So this huge coronal
thing you called it,
as it flies towards the Sun, is
exhibiting a massive impact
in fact not impact, effect or
discharge effect on the Sun...
yes...
and this coronal mass ejection is nearly as
big as the Sun in some cases if not bigger.
They're huge, yeah.
So the puny little comet
isn't quite so puny
and carrying on this thing,
when Shoemaker-Levy 9
split into 23 pieces as
it headed towards Jupiter...
On the first go-around
Jupiter, it split up.
Ah, that is when it
split in 23 sections.
And then it went into an orbit where
they were able to predict that it would impact.
Now, you think this split up is
another electrical phenomenon?
Sure, comets inexplicably
split and fragment
as they cross the ecliptic, usually,
which is the current sheet of the Sun
or when they're
approaching the Sun
when the voltage on the
surface is changing rapidly.
And the reason for that is that any body
in the universe, of any considerable mass,
will have an internal gravitational
field, albeit maybe weak,
but that gravitational field will offset
all of the positively charged particles
which are heavier, more massive,
towards the center of the object
and the electrons will then
adopt elliptical orbits
with the nucleus at a focus
which is nearer the center.
In other words, every atom in that
object will be a tiny electric dipole.
Okay.
So every object of any
considerable size in the universe
will have the characteristics
of an electret
which is an object which
maintains an electric field.
That's an interesting
term, electret.
Electret, yeah.
So, a comet, if sufficient charge is either
removed or added to one of these bodies,
it can cause internal discharges
through the body of the comet
and this is what I call earthquake,
this is the harbinger of an earthquake.
Now, on a small body like a comet,
that earthquake is sufficient
to shatter it, quite often.
So this is the
effect ...
Yeah, this is the
electrical effect, yeah.
I mean, the same thing happens on earth,
earthquakes are underground lightning.
So that explains
the fragmentation
and the very fine particles
that you see in the jets
that are all just part of this
whole electrical aspect of comets.
So we have some good
ideas as to how comets
are created by ejection from
say Jupiter, Saturn, etc.
and we have some understanding
about their electrical nature.
But what about what we now
know is it's rocky terrain,
gone are the days of the
farcical dusty snowball comet.
If, for instance, we take
comet P-69 as an example,
there is no doubt its topography
closely resembles that of many planets
such as Mercury and Mars.
It's complete with valleys, electrical
erosion, sand fills and rocky outcrops.
But comets, unlike major planets
and most moons, are not spherical.
We're not sure why
but in fact a large percentage of imaged
comets, and their similar sisters, asteroids,
have nuclei that are
double, even triple-lobed.
Now, where have I
seen this before?
Many comets and asteroids
have a remarkable similarity
to the thunder egg
seen on earth
and if, as Wal Thornhill often says,
electrical phenomena are scalable,
we may have an example, on a much
smaller scale, of a comet structure.
Creation of similar tektites by C.J.
Ransom in the Vemasat Laboratories,
by electrical discharge,
may hold the key
to an understanding of both
asteroids, comets and planets.
Now, thunder egg rocks come
in an incredible array.
Look at these ones I'm about
to show you. Some are hollow,
some have crystalline interiors,
some have gaseous inclusions
and some are filled with liquid,
star-shaped interiors,
you name it.
Depending on the layer the
thunder eggs were found in,
rapid progression from spherical to
double- and triple-lobed rocks develop.
I'll just read a little
bit from Robert Colburn
who wrote, if you like, the quintessential
information on thunder eggs.
This is his quote on the
formation of thunder eggs,
"On the bedrock, in contrast with the ashy
clay, some eggs could be pried off whole.
With more melded into doubles,
triples or even clusters,
most broke apart revealing a hollow top
consisting of a thin layer of chalcedony
coating the walls of
the egg's interior.
Horizontally banded, waterline opal is
contained within the thin concentric layer
and occupying from 1/4 to 1/2
of the interior at the bottom
with the tops being flat floors,
some with chalky surfaces
that can be scraped
with the finger nail.
Perhaps we can get closer to
understanding thunder eggs
by approaching them as gas cavities
filled with water-based minerals
like those of amygdules, an idea fairly
well accepted by most geologists.
An amygdule is a mineral-filled gas
cavity found in basalt and endocyte lava.
So let's begin with a question,
how homogeneous is the earth and for
that matter comets and meteors?
Is it molded within by
strict circular boundaries,
or is it perhaps, like the internals
of this classic thunderegg
with a 3d star-shaped interior?
Plasma pioneers such as
C.J. Ransom, remember,
recreated spherical
Martian rock blueberries
in the lab with electrical
discharge techniques.
Were thundereggs created
by similar measures?
And if electrical
effects are scalable,
could a large Earth body perhaps
replicate a thunderegg formation
with its gaseous enclosures
and spiky outreaches
that may, perhaps, resemble
the jets of a comet.
Now, let's take this
a little further.
Thomas Gold, in his book 'The Deep
Hot Biosphere', makes a strong case
for the intervention of gas upwelling
as a powerful but neglected process
in the workings of large
hydrocarbon deposits,
either gaseous, liquid or solid
from deep within our own Earth.
But perhaps even Gold failed to realize the
effects of electrical telluric currents
swayed by cosmic effects
as the primal cause
of the chaotic meandering of gases
and liquids within charged bodies.
Were they the agent that
caused cometary instabilities?
As Wal Thornhill has
always pointed out,
the planets, comets and asteroids
are electrets or charged bodies
revolving in a constantly changing
cosmic electromagnetic environment.
They thus react with
other charged bodies,
working towards
electrical equilibrium.
Thus our big question: Could
common interiors also possess
hydrocarbon enclosures; the
kerogens, oil, coal etc.?
Nicolas Biver of the Paris Observatory,
France, lead author of a paper
on the discovery published
october 23rd, in Science Advances,
found that Comet Lovejoy was
releasing as much alcohol
as at least 500 bottles of wine every
second during its peak activity.
The team found 21 different organic
molecules in gas from the comet
including ethyl alcohol and
glycol aldehyde, a simple sugar.
Further in July, the European Space
Agency reported that the Philae Lander
from its Rosetta spacecraft, in orbit around
comet 67P, detected 16 organic compounds
as it descended toward, and then
bounced across the comet's surface.
According to the agency, some of the
compounds detected play key roles
in the creation of amino acids, nucleobases and
sugars from simple building block molecules.
So where does this all lead us?
We certainly learned the comet
is an electrical phenomenon.
We've learned that it's not
a dusty snowball, it's solid.
It moves in elliptical orbits
of various combinations
but most important of all, I
believe the next comet revelation
will be the fact that it
sustains the molecules of life.
The carbohydrates, the hydrocarbons, the
kerogens, coal, oil, methane gases
contained within the
body of the comet.
These are common fundamentals
of the solar system.
Perhaps we've seen a
traveling Z-pinch
creating all the molecules
necessary for life
and the fundamentals
of this solar system.

Welcome to the Electricity of Life,

The Electric Universe and plasma cosmology
have laid the foundations for a new
understanding of our Sun and of all
stars. Many decades ago, the father of
plasma cosmology, the Nobel Prize winner
Hannes Alfvén, proposed that stars form
electromagnetically along vast networks
of filaments, like pearls on a string.
Later, the electrical engineer Ralph
Juergen's went a step further and
developed an electrical model of the Sun
as an anode, a positively charged body
powered by galactic electric currents. In
the last year, the project scientists
with the independent SAFIRE experiment
announced a series of findings in
agreement with the Electric Sun model.
Indeed, we learn more everyday about
the extraordinary electromagnetic
connection between our planet and its
parent star, including the discovery in
2014, that powerful outbursts from the
Sun result in increased lightning on
Earth. Perhaps even more remarkably, a
number of scientific papers have
reported an apparent correlation between
surprising changes in radioactive decay
rates and solar activity. But not only
does our planet, and all of its complex
atmospheric systems, share a remarkable
relationship with the Sun, so too is all
of life affected by the Sun in ways that
science has only begun to recognize. And
here the electrical nature of the Sun
shines through with striking clarity.
Consider the recent scientific discovery
of a surprising correlation between
solar storms and the beaching of grey
whales and certain other cetacean
species. The apparent connection was
originally noted by a biologist and his
team at Duke University, who found that
when dark sunspots cover the Sun, the
marine mammals are more likely to beach
themselves. With the help of an
astronomer, they were able to confirm the
connection. Their findings have been
published in the journal Current Biology
in the paper “Grey whales
strand more often on days with increased
levels of atmospheric radio-frequency
noise.” The paper’s abstract states that
the findings suggest “The potential
for magnetoreception in this species.”
In fact, this is not the first scientific
paper to demonstrate such
a correlation. In 2016,
Cambridge University's International
Journal of Astrobiology published the
paper “Solar storms may trigger sperm
whale strandings.” The authors state in the
paper’s abstract “... magnetic fields
can affect terrestrial life such as
migrating animals. Thus, terrestrial life
is connected to astronomical
interrelations between different
magnetic fields, particle flows and
radiation. Whales’ magnetic sense may play
an important role in orientation and
migration, and strandings may thus be
triggered by geomagnetic storms.” Of
course the concept of magnetoreception
in some animals is not new. Many
biologists have long proposed that the
mysterious abilities of homing pigeons
is resolved by the presence of magnetic
particles in the pigeons heads. This
apparent magnetic sensing has also
been found in other animals, perhaps
surprisingly, including cattle. As
reported in a study published in the
Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences USA in 2008, “We demonstrate that
domestic cattle across the globe and
grazing and resting red and roe deer
align their body axes in roughly a
north-south direction. Direct
observations of roe deer revealed that
animals orient their heads northward
when grazing or resting. Amazingly, this
ubiquitous phenomenon does not seem to
have been noticed by herdsmen, ranchers
or hunters.” Other species that seem
sensitive to Earth's magnetic field
include frogs, lobsters, snails and
perhaps most intriguingly of all, humans.
While a human magnetic sense has long
been a subject of interest and
investigation, the most powerful
scientific evidence to date came in 2019
with the publication of the paper,
”Transduction of the Geomagnetic Field as
Evidenced from alpha-Band activity in the
Human Brain.” In the experiment,
conducted by a team of
Caltech scientists, 34 subjects sat in an
aluminum box which shielded them from
electromagnetic noise. The box was lined
with coils through which electric
currents flowed, and the investigators
created a magnetic field which sloped
downward, similar to the geomagnetic
field at the mid-latitudes of the
Northern Hemisphere. They
then rotated the field, producing a
measurable change in the brain activity
of nearly 1/3 of the study's
participants. In an article in Science
Magazine, biologist Margaret Ahmad states
in the findings ”I'm not
surprised there's an effect.
There's something in a cell that is
different in the presence of a magnetic
field. We see this effect in human
embryonic kidney cells; you're not going
to convince me that an effect in brain
cells is of any greater or lesser
significance.” And here, the great
significance of the electromagnetic
connection between the Sun and the Earth
comes into focus. The Earth is a rotating
charged body and electric currents from
the Sun touch down at the Earth's
poles, producing the aurorae and modifying
our planet's magnetic field. Evidence of
the profound biological effects of both
electric and magnetic fields, increases
with each passing year. So, the question
is, do geomagnetic events impact the
physiology of human beings? Increasingly,
it seems the answer is yes. In fact, it
was over a century ago that the Soviet
era scientist Alexander Chizhevsky
founded the field of heliobiology, the
study of the Sun's effect on biology. As
noted in an earlier Electricity of Life
by Alex Fournier, Chizhevsky conducted
exhaustive data analysis, which compared
solar activity with prominent historical
events in human society. Using a
”mass excitability” index, Chizhevsky found
that the timing of these prominent
events consistently linked to outbursts
from the Sun, which led to Chizhevsky to
propose that geomagnetic storms had a
significant impact on the human mind and
behavior. As a result of his scientific
endeavor, after refusing to retract his
findings, he was placed in a labor gulag
for eight years by Soviet leader Joseph
Stalin. Today, scientific research into
the Sun's effects on the human body and
mind continues, with an emphasis on the
role of electromagnetism. For example, a
number of studies have reported data
suggesting a connection between
geomagnetic storms and dramatic changes
in blood pressure and other effects on
the heart. And as suggested by earlier
research, some scientists have found an
apparent linkage between geomagnetic
storms and major changes in behavior.
In 2006, the peer-reviewed journal,
Bioelectromagnetics, published a paper,
“Do Ambient Electromagnetic Fields Affect
Behaviour? A demonstration of the
Relationship Between Geomagnetic Storm
Activity and Suicide.” The authors
studied the geomagnetic storm activity,
and the national suicide statistics for
Australia, between the years 1968 and
2002. Their conclusion was that the data
”...suggests that perturbations in
ambient electromagnetic field activity
impact behavior in a clinically
meaningful manner.” In February of 2020,
another study, this time focusing on
suicide statistics in Taiwan, reported
similar results. Such findings might
sound strange, but the purpose of
this series is to explore the role of
electricity in nature and biology,
including the body's electrical
circuitry. In fact, the connection between
major health changes and geomagnetic
activity might actually be predictable,
in light of the remarkable scientific
research of our previous guest, Dr. Jerry
Tennant. Dr. Tennant has proposed that
many health problems are essentially the
result of a disruption of the natural
voltage in the body's muscles and organs.
Emotions, Dr. tenet suggests, are stored
in and around our bodies in the form of
magnetic fields. The treatment he's
devised involves the use of other
magnetic fields and scale our energy to
restore the body's voltage and
”erase the residual effects of trauma.” In
describing the relationship between
celestial objects and the greater cosmos,
we have stated that
”...no islands exist in our Electric
Universe.” Of course, this applies not
only to astronomical objects, but to all of
life. And thus, it is unsurprising that
the evidence of the electrical nature of
the cosmos, continues to illuminate
the interconnectedness of all things.

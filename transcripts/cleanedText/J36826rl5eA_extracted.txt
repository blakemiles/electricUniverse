Welcome to Space News from

In part one of
this presentation,
Thunderbolts colleague Peter Mungo
Jupp began a provocative reassessment
of the standard geological and
anthropological timetables on planet Earth.
We have proposed a radically
alternative history for planet Earth
and indeed our
entire solar system.
In relatively recent times, there was a
chaotic period in the inner solar system,
when planets approached one another close
enough to exchange electromagnetic energy
taking the form of
interplanetary lightning.
One of these planets was Earth.
Whose close encounter with
Venus, the great comet,
was recorded in ancient
texts around the world.
In this scenario, in
an era of prehistory,
the Earth was bombarded with
tremendous electromagnetic radiation.
What effects did this have on our
planet and its living organisms?
Most geologists and biologists work
from a uniformitarian viewpoint,
i.e. that's only small incremental
changes in the last thousands of years.
One though has only to read
Claude Schaeffer's works,
the archaeologist in the Middle
East, to realize that many violent
perturbations have occurred within
the last few thousand years.
We're talking roughly no more than 8,000
years and if one is to believe historical
and many of the myths as
argued by Rens van der Sluijs,
then continent-encompassing floods, earthquakes,
volcanoes, and massive electrical phenomena
must have played a huge part in
altering the carbon-14 isotope's
concentration in living species.
Also, dead carbon-13 from underground
sources in huge volcanic eruptions
must also falsify
carbon-14 ratios.
The concept of dead
carbon contamination.
Now, before we go on to the atomic
clock mitochondrial DNA Theory,
let's just touch on one of the last archaeological
modern science dating technologies.
Electric spin resonance, uranium-
thorium, thermoluminescence
and optically
stimulated resonance.
How accurate are these other methodologies
used in establishing chronology?
Electric spin resonance and uranium-
thorium series dating methods
are secondary in the sense that they
rely on measurements of isotopes
and others not originally
present in the living body
and the modeling of process
taking place after burial.
For instance, thermo-luminescence and optically
stimulated luminescence dating methods
are applied to quartz grains in
sediments containing skeletal remains
but not directly on the bones.
Again, these must be subject to interpretation
of the environment at the time of inception.
Brian notes that he found thermo-
luminescence dating highly inaccurate
with echoes of the Jinmium
affair which we'll go into.
When dating marine deposits, the laboratory
result was 20,000 years BP (Before Present).
He maintains this cannot be accurate for the
time the shoreline was well out to sea.
He also remarks that this technique
cannot be considered accurate
if the event that initially triggered the zeroing
of the quartz particles occurred at night.
It's light dependent
In this case, it will not
start the clock ticking.
He also notes serious age reversal
effects with carbon dating.
We have not always lived in
an uniformitarian universe
and what happens today may have been and
most probably was drastically different
to our own relatively
geologically calm world.
These methods too, could be
subject to gross error
without knowing the physical, historical,
geological history of the site.
Cataclysmic events have often shaped the
Earth in only the last few thousand years.
Our reliance on scientific
dating demands caution.
I touched on the Jinmium affair
with first declared the site is
possibly 170,000 years before
present, using luminescence dating.
But it was eventually found
to be only 3,000 years old.
Optical luminescence methods are highly
subject to contamination with Bowler,
from Melbourne University, noting
in his last studies of Lake Mungo
that one lower level came up at a
later date than the higher one.
Impossible?
He declared this
was contamination
but there are serious
flaws for this method
especially when water has, at some
stage, washed through an area.
In addition, it assumes
zero crystal attachment
when initially exposed to
sunlight at its foundation.
It depends on how it was formed
and this is how to assume
when the geologies was not
there at its inception.
Similarly, electric spin, electron spin
and uranium-thorium series methodologies,
make many assumptions gleaned from our
uniformitarian present-day world
and make no speculation on
conditions evident in the ice age
where unknown factors
were probably at work.
For instance, note the discrepancy between
Bowler and Thorne's work at Lake Mungo.
One came to 40,000 years before
present, the other 60,000.
A 20,000 year discrepancy.
Carbon dating if it's not
standardized with dendrography,
which only goes to 8,000
years, cannot be accurate.
Remember, we're not doubting the
accuracy of mass spectrometry used,
only its universal application
without time calibration controls.
And finally we move on to the atomic clock-
mitochondrial-DNA-phylogenetic theory.
Aha!
Is in fact mitochondrial DNA the atomic
clock genetic scientists claim it to be?
Eukaryote cells, that's mammal
and other living cells,
contain mitochondria within
the plasma of the cell
but outside its nucleus.
Amongst other functions, they are an
energy factory driving the cells.
Curiously, they most closely
resembled the bacteria Rickettsia
and have many
similar properties.
What has become of great interest is the
mitochondria's ability to transport,
that's with the exceptions the
female line to the next generation.
The quality that excites interest is that
a certain portion of the genetic chain
of the mitochondrial DNA, is subject
to mutation in what is believed to be
a constant rate
within any species.
Thus analysis of past generations should
reveal the number of generations,
noted at humans for 20
years per generation,
and thus act as an atomic clock
to peg the age of the specimen.
Recently, an attempt was made to
estimate the age of the human race
using mitochondrial DNA.
This material is inherited always
from mother to children only
and there are exceptions
but that's a distraction.
By measuring the difference in
mitochondrial DNA among many individuals,
the age of the common
maternal ancestor of humanity
was estimated at
about 200,000 years.
Is this true?
A problem is that rates of mutation
are not known by direct measurement
and are often computed based on
assumed evolutionary timescales.
Note that 'assumed
evolutionary timescales.'
As we have seen in the
previous work above,
all these age estimates
could be greatly in error.
In fact, many different rates of mutation
are quoted by different biologists.
It shouldn't be very
hard explicitly
to measure the rate of mutation of mitochondrial
DNA to get a better estimate on this age.
From royal lineages, for example,
one could find two individuals
whose most recent common maternal
ancestor was, say, 1,000 years ago.
One could then measure
the difference
of the mitochondrial DNA of these
individuals to find its mutation rate.
This scheme is attractive because it
does not depend on radiometric dating
or other assumptions about
evolution or mutation rates.
It is possible that in 1,000 years there
would be too little difference to measure.
At least, this would give
us some useful information.
Now along this line, Parsons,
one of these researchers,
has recently done some work to measure
explicitly the rate of substitution
in the mitochondrial
DNA control region.
That's a narrow region where
a lot of mutation occurs
and I'll read his summary,
"The rate and pattern of sequence substitutions
in the mitochondrial DNA control region
is of central importance to studies of
human evolution and to forensic identity.
Here, we report a
direct measurement
of the intergenerational
substitution rate in the human CR."
Now, this is a way we can
actually find the age.
He compared these to what they
call 'phylogenetic analysis'
that claim the use of mitochondrial
DNA to ascertain the age
of, let's say, a particular
Neanderthal for instance.
He found the observed
substitution rate reported
were very high compared to rates
inferred from evolutionary studies.
So, using so-called mitochondria
DNA in fact, 20 times higher.
"Using our empirical rate to calibrate
the mitochondrial DNA molecular clock
would result in an age of this
mitochondrial DNA of only 6,500 years,
clearly incompatible with the age of modern
humans (as estimated by evolutionary studies)
...it remains
implausible to explain
the known geographic distribution of
mitochondrial DNA sequence variation
by human migration that occurred
only in the last 6,500 years."
In fact, the evolutionary
molecular clock,
as measured by mitochondrial DNA,
has a long and troubled history.
Hampered by a lack of empirically
measured mutation rates,
the evolutionary molecular clock
researchers have historically assumed
mutation rates by dividing two
species' genetic differences
by their evolutionary
time of divergence,
e.g. human-chimpanzee
divergence.
Since the latter was inferred from the
evolutionary age of silence in the fossil record
which is basically not
very well understood,
the evolutionary molecular clock amounted
to a circle of evolutionary assumptions
and never, never an independent
test of a species' time of origin.
The advent of modern
molecular genetics
has resulted in an increasing
number of publications
in which mutation rates in various species
and in various genetic compartments
have been empirically determined
independent of the evolutionary age of
silence in the so-called fossil record.
Using the mitochondrial
mutation rates,
predictions can now be made on how
much mitochondrial DNA diversity
should result after a specific
number of years have elapsed.
These studies represent an important
and significant step forward
in our understanding of the origin of
human mitochondrial DNA differences.
Though the mutation rate was measured
only in European individuals,
predictions with this mutation
rate on the 6,000 year time scale
captured the mitochondrial
DNA diversity.
All non-African people groups
including the major Eurasian groups
and representatives of the
native peoples of the Americas.

In recent years, one of the
great shocks in space science
has been the discovery of just how
incredible the electromagnetic energies are
at the gas giant Jupiter.
Astronomers had long known that Jupiter possesses
an extensive and powerful magnetic field,
as well as tremendous X-ray
aurorae, super-fast winds,
and a mysterious, enduring anticyclonic storm
in the region called the Great Red Spot.
However, NASA's Juno mission has
shattered all conventional ideas
about the mechanisms
behind these phenomena.
NASA scientists have acknowledged
that the accepted model of a dynamo
deep within the planet,
producing its magnetic field,
cannot explain what they've
actually discovered.
Likewise, according to the Juno
papers, the data on Juno's atmosphere,
ionosphere, and interior has
provided nothing but surprises.
Today, in part two of his 10-part
series Eye of the Storm,
author Andrew Hall
explores the question,
what does the electrical
Jovian environment tell us
about the atmospheric and weather
phenomena throughout the solar system,
including on Earth?
Jupiter is our largest neighbor
and generates the biggest electromagnetic
field in the solar system except for the Sun.
It has a thick,
turbulent atmosphere
with swirling storms producing
winds of supersonic speed,
and lightning arcs that dwarf
the puny sparks we have on Earth.
So right off the bat, we see
attributes of electrical processes
like the processes we are exploring
in Earth's primordial past.
Nothing exemplifies the electrical
nature of Jupiter more than its bands
of counter-flowing winds and the giant
swirl known as The Great Red Spot.
Electric winds occur when an
electric field potential exists
that motivates ionic
species in the air to move.
Positive ionic species are
drawn in one direction,
and negative ions and free electrons
are drawn in the opposite direction,
as dictated by the polarity
of the electric field.
The ions may be only a small
percentage of the bulk mass of air,
but electrically they form
a current ― moving charge
that will drag neutral
molecules with it.
The result of these opposing
motions are unipolar winds.
A positive wind from one direction
and a negative wind from the other
attracted to or pushed away from
the "electrodes" in the circuit.
If the wind occurs in the
atmosphere surrounding a planet,
the winds will circumnavigate
the globe in alternating bands
in a direction transverse to the
magnetic polarity of the planet.
This is the effect on display
in Jupiter's atmosphere
as well as other planets in our solar
system with strong electric fields.
The "electrodes"
are nodal regions
where current flows through the
planet's atmospheric sheath and crust.
That's why they appear
at certain latitudes.
As these electrodes' unipolar
winds mix in whirlwinds,
the mixing of ions
results in a plasma,
where, with much condensation,
violent arcing, and swirling,
they electrically adhere to form
molecular bonds and precipitate.
This is what we
know as a storm.
The primary electrodes in a planetary
circuit are around the magnetic poles,
and the evidence of the
electric field strength
is in the glow-mode
currents called aurora.
Another type of "electrode" is an accumulation
of charge density from volcanic eruption,
where discharges internal to
the crust expel huge volumes
of charged pyroclastic
dust into the atmosphere
and spread hot magma
across the land.
Another "electrode" is where the
planet's electromagnetic field
produces regions of high
flux from cosmic rays,
driven by stellar winds or perhaps
some other motivating force.
Charged particles spiral
down magnetic lines of flux
and charge the crustal surface
creating electrode spots.
In every case, discharge follows
the geometry of a plasmoid Earth,
for the "Blue Marble" we
live on is just a bubble,
or drop of matter encapsulated
in an electric circuit.
The plasmoid circuit is what matters
― it's what controls everything ―
and it flows through the atmosphere
and crust to create the capacitance
that motivates weather,
earthquakes, and volcanoes.
Uni-polar winds are drawn to the electrode
spots like water flows to an open drain.
Only a solid crustal surface
provides no hole to sink into.
The winds are constrained
by the vacuum of space above
and the solid crust
(or ocean) below.
They circulate in induced vortex
currents to mix in a plasma storm,
recombining charged species into neutral
matter that rains to the surface.
Storms are evidence of
currents induced by capacitance
in the layers of atmosphere
and crust of the planet.
It doesn't matter if it's Earth, Jupiter,
or an exoplanet yet to be discovered.
A planet with an active
electromagnetic field
will form a spherical layer of
capacitance in its atmosphere and crust
through which loops of magnetic flux
will induce ring currents to flow
transversely through
those layers.
A ring current is the
simplest form of circuit.
In Nature, where there are no
insulating layers to guide current flow,
ring currents form naturally.
Unlike a Birkeland
current in space,
where current flows from one body to another
along the electric field between them,
a ring current simply
circulates on itself.
Ring currents rule the
universe, not gravity.
It's because magnetic
fields are closed fields
― they form closed
loops between poles,
and the magnetic flux induces
current to flow along these loops.
The induced current follows
to form ring currents.
Nature can't stop itself
forming ring currents.
They exist at the atomic
level, the molecular level,
the planetary level, the stellar level,
and the Galactic level of our cosmos.
Because Earth's ring
currents have no end,
they are infinitely long conductors
that induce current from the solar wind.
Because they are infinitely long, there
is no limit to the current they can induce.
The currents form a winding
that, like a transformer inside the
Earth, raises potential in the circuit.
The result is an internal electric
field that's in opposition
to the ambient electric
field of the solar system.
Earth's crust and atmosphere is
the 'almost' neutral boundary
― the dielectric plates between
the internal and external fields
that seek a charge balance.
Any change in the external field
causes a response internally,
because the internal electric field acts like
a mirror, reflecting a feedback response.
The mirroring effect is
caused by capacitance
because if charge builds on
one plate of a capacitor,
the other plate responds by building
an equal and opposite charge.
So change takes place both
internally and externally,
and the neutral balance
between ― where we live ―
is disrupted, until the internal and
external fields come back to equilibrium.
Of course, there's
never an equilibrium.
Because Earth is a sphere,
each capacitor plate of the sphere has
a bigger area, as a function of radius,
so there can never be two layers with
equal charge density across equal areas.
Layers of Earth and atmosphere are
always building charge and discharging.
It's physically
impossible not to.
This is the wisdom of the ancients,
which today we confuse with mysticism:
"As above, so below"
has a simple, classical
scientific meaning.
It refers to the capacitance in Earth's
circuit and the feedback (or reflection)
inside the Earth caused by whatever
is going on in the solar system.
To see this in action,
one need only look at the extremely
intense current loops that form on the Sun.
These are called coronal loops
and are produced by the same kind
of capacitance in the circuitry
that causes weather
on Jupiter and Earth.
The difference isn't
in the circuitry,
the difference is in the plasma
state the atmospheres are in.
The Sun is almost
completely ionized,
whereas Earth and Jupiter have
partial plasma atmospheres.
The ionized atmosphere of the Sun
produces ray-gun like currents,
whereas partial plasma
atmospheres like Earth and Jupiter
produce more diffuse hydrodynamic
currents we see as wind and clouds.
The ring currents are currents of excess
charge the solar circuit is shedding.
As in the Sun, the interior
Earth layers have less area,
so as charge accumulates by induction,
it develops greater charge density
in the ground and must shed current
outward through the atmosphere.
In a storm on Earth, the
ambient electric field reverses,
from a 200 kilovolt "clear
weather" current flowing outward,
to a 500 Megavolt current
aimed at the ground.
The Earth beneath a storm becomes
positive to a negative sky,
 as accumulated charge
finds a path to discharge.
Ring currents also produce
a magnetic field inside them
that is stronger than the
magnetic field outside.
Basically, it's because the geometry
of a ring causes magnetic flux
to disperse in a greater area
outside the ring than inside.
Therefore, there is such stronger
magnetic flux inside the loop
that induces a
secondary current flow,
perpendicular to
the coronal loop.
Current flows through the atmosphere and crust
both in the vertical columns of the loops
and horizontally in current
induced by the loops.
These currents travel through layers
of atmosphere and Earth's crust.
Another property of ring currents is
very strange and counter-intuitive.
When we look at a ring current generated
in a looped wire with a battery
― generating, say, one amp,
any two points in the loop will
measure a current of 1 amp.
But if we generate the same amount
of current in the wire by induction,
by passing a magnet
through the ring,
the current at any two
points may be different,
even though the sum of all current
in the wire still adds to one amp.
The induced current
may be different
where the wire's contact with
magnetic field is weaker,
but elsewhere in the ring the magnetic
field would be diametrically stronger
and generate current that
makes up the difference.
The result is that current density may form
in one part of the ring and not in another,
or in one part of the ring
it may even flow backwards
― a current of
opposite polarity.
Coronal loops on the
Sun display this.
NASA imagery shows plasma bolides
shooting through rings at varying speeds
and sometimes even
reversing direction.
On Earth, current rings formed
by the geomagnetic field
also display this
inductive behavior,
developing a severe storm at one leg
while doing nothing at the other.
It also allows direct current inputs from
induction to become alternating currents,
as currents in a ring will oscillate
as charge stores and discharges
in the capacitance
of the system.
Weather forms where currents pass
through the atmosphere and crust.
A whirlpool of mixing
plasma forms storms
where current draws up channels of
air and positively charged ions.
Coronal loops generate winds as
ionic matter follows electric fields,
dragging bulk air mass with it.
Ultimately, the winds form jet streams
and must thread in three dimensions
through the inflow and outflow,
updraft and downdraft regions
formed by coronal loops,
like rope wound into a knot.
If you look at the last image of an
electromagnetic wave in a double layer,
you can see, first how a double
layer of charge ― a capacitor ―
will produce waves of
electromagnetic peak and trough,
like rogue waves on the ocean.
If one also includes spherical geometry, as
in the capacitance of planetary circuits,
then it becomes simple deduction
that the geometry results
in higher charge concentration
inside Earth than outside
and will produce
these kinds of waves.
It cannot "physics-wise" be otherwise.
So waves like this form naturally,
consistently, and unavoidably.
And that results
in ring currents
― coronal loops, magnetic
field lines inducing current ―
 call it what you like.
It's electric.
In part three we'll see how ring currents
produce storms on Jupiter and Earth
and how they progress in fractal
elements from a common thunderstorm
to a storm like the Great
Red Spot on Jupiter.
Thank you!
Stay tuned for part 3

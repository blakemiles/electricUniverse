THE TIPPING POINT

Science Set Free
Part 1
I'm talking about
"Science Set Free".
And what science is being set free
from, is the science delusion.
The science delusion is the belief
that science has already understood,
the nature of reality in principle
leaving only the details to be filled in.
This is very widely believed in our
society it is one of the reasons
for the dogmatism that all of us
encounter which is so annoying,
but it's because people think
they already know the truth.
They sincerely believe that and this is
probably one of the most widespread delusions.
In our society we have now exported
it to the rest of the world.
There is a conflict in the heart of Science
between science as a method of inquiry,
about the testing of hypotheses,
looking at the evidence, finding out
what's really going on, open-minded
subject to correction and so forth.
The ideal of science which many people
think of is, what science is.
As what science ought to be
and I agree with that ideal.
The reality, as many of us have encountered
through bitter experience, is rather different.
For many people science has become
a belief system, a worldview.
This is sometimes called scientism where
people take the dogmas of science
to be a kind of religious belief system
or quasi religious belief system.
And it's this dogmatic belief system
which I think is now constricting
and holding science back
in a very serious way.
In almost every branch of science we
see the lore of diminishing returns,
more expensive research yields
fewer and fewer really new results.
And the reason for all that is
this dogmatic belief system.
If science could be set free
from it, new experiments
and new possibilities
open up in every area.
What I do in my book
'Science Set Free'
is take the 10 dogmas of institutional
sciences which are part
of the scientific worldview and
turn these dogmas into questions.
Treat them not as
beliefs or truths,
but as hypotheses that can be
tested against the evidence.
I then look at them scientifically
to see how well they stack up
when you take into account the
evidence, none of them do.
And in every case new
possibilities open up,
science would become regenerated
when we undergo this process.
I don't have time to discuss
all 10 dogmas today,
but what I do first is
just say what they are.
And first and foremost dogma:
1) Is the belief that nature
is mechanical or machine like.
This has been the foundational
principle of science since
at the beginning of modern
science in the 17th century.
Mechanistic science is based
on machine metaphor,
nature is a machine, stars are machines,
animals and plants are machines
that is why you can have industrial
agriculture, genetic engineering,
factory farming and so on.
They are just machines.
And we are machines too, lumbering robots
in Richard Dawkins favorite phrase,
with brains that are genetically
programmed computers.
The second dogma is the total amount of
matter and energy is always the same,
except at the moment of the Big Bang
when it all appeared from nowhere.
That is so, then the third dogma is
similar to that, the laws of nature are fixed.
The laws and constants of the world are same
today as they were at the moment of the
Big Bang, when they all suddenly appeared
like a kind of cosmic Napoleonic code.
As Terence McKenna used to say, modern
science is based on the principle,
give us one free miracle
and we'll explain the rest.
And the one free miracle is the appearance
of all the matter and energy in the
universe and all the laws that govern it
from nothing in a single instant.
The fourth dogma is that
matter is unconscious,
the universe is made up of
totally unconscious matter.
Fifth, nature is purposeless,
there are no purposes in nature
and the evolutionary process
has no purpose or direction.
Sixth, biological inheritance is material,
it's genetic in the genetic material,
DNA or possibly in epigenetic modifications
of the DNA, which are also chemical,
or in cytoplasmic inheritance,
but at any rate it is all material.
Seven, memories are stored as
material traces inside the brain,
everything you remember is
somewhere inside your head,
as a stored memory either in phosphorylate
proteins modified synapses
or some material form which has
not yet been fully identified.
As they say, the
details are very vague,
attempts to find these traces have failed
over and over again, but nevertheless it
is universally believed within neuroscience
that they're all inside the brain.
Dogma 8, the mind is inside the head,
mental activity is brain activity,
your mind is nothing but
what goes on in your brain.
Dogma 9, follows from dogma 8,
psychic phenomena are illusory.
Things like telepathy can not really happen
because they would imply the mind can
work to distance from the body and it can't
do that because it's all inside the head.
And dogma 10, mechanistic medicine
is the only kind really works,
alternative and complementary therapies
may appear to work, but that is only
because people would have got better
anyway or it's all the placebo effect.
But the real kind, the only kind that
really works is mechanistic medicine
which is why at most parts of the
world it is the only kind taught in
medical schools, is the only kind funded by
government funding agencies, and so on.
Well these are the 10 beliefs which are
more or less the default belief system of
most scientists and most
educated people today.
Wherever they are in the world
in India or China or wherever
this is the belief system
which is predominant.
Now, within science itself of course,
people at the leading edge of research
in many ways have moved
beyond this belief system.
Research scientists are not necessarily
committed to this in every detail,
but they are usually only at
the frontier of one region.
A physicist might be at the
frontiers of cosmology
and have gone beyond some of
these dogmas of physics,
but they wouldn't question the
dogmas of psychology or biology,
those would remain
more or less intact.
So, there are various people who
question bits of it,
but there is very little that has
been done to question the whole thing.
This is essentially the
materialist worldview,
and it became the dominant view
of science in the 19th century.
Science was as it were hijacked
by materialist philosophy and
since then has been wholly owned
subsidiary of materialism.
There is no reason why
science has to be materialistic, it
wasn't materialistic before the 19th
century it was dualistic as I'll say soon.
And I think we can go beyond
that to a new, more inclusive,
more organic, organismic
paradigm for science.
What I'm going to do first is
look at the dogma that the
total amount of matter and
energy is always the same.
This got built into the foundations of
Science in the 17th century,
it was not brought about by incredibly
detailed observations using nanogram balances
and so forth, it came about for purely
philosophical or rather theological reasons.
The founding fathers of modern
science were all Christians who
believed that the world was a machine,
that God was a machine maker,
an engineering mathematically minded,
god who created the world machine,
and he'd started off the world machine in the
first place by creating the matter that's in it.
Which he created in the form of atoms,
taking the idea from Greek atomism,
and these atoms by definition couldn't
be destroyed, they couldn't be broken up.
So, once god had created it, the
total amount of atoms or matter
must automatically
remain the same forever.
And god also endowed the universe with
a certain quantum of movement or force
which started it in motion and
thereafter because this god-given force
couldn't be changed by anything
else, the amount remained the same.
So the principles of conservation
of matter and energy were built into
science from the outset, not on the
basis of detailed measurements.
They've served as useful
accountancy principles ever since,
but they were formulated more rigorously in
the mid-nineteenth century in the law of
conservation of matter and energy and
in the first law of thermodynamics.
So it was assumed that that was the end of the
matter and that they were fixed forever
and most people take that for granted
today they've learned it in high school
and they never see any
reason to question it.
This was the dogma of science
which I myself didn't
question until quite recently.
I questioned all the others,
but it was only when I was writing this book
that I thought I should look at this one
and I actually rather wanted it to turn
out to be true because I thought if I
said that all 10 dogmas of science
were false it might sound a bit biased.
So I thought it would be quite nice if one of them held
up and I thought this was the best candidate.
But when I thought about it turned
out to be a shambles.
First of all well,
physicists are above the law
and they found themselves quite
free to invent or to hypothesize
forms of matter and energy that we
shouldn't ever have thought of before.
One of them is of
course dark matter,
observations of galaxies and the
way that stars moved within them
and also the ways that galaxies interact
with each other suggested that the
galaxies, if they were to be explained in
terms of gravitation, simply wouldn't work!
The, the whole thing
simply didn't work.
So, in order to make it work they
hypothesized there was extra matter,
which you can see, hence
the name dark matter,
that accounted for all the phenomena
of galaxies and their interactions.
Well how much dark
matter was there?
Well, simple, just invent the exact amount
you need to explain the observed phenomena.
You can tight rate the amount
of dark matter at will
to explain the phenomena
you're trying to explain,
if you find new phenomena peculiar
bulges in galaxies or something that a
one-size-fits-all dark matter weren't to explain,
then you add a bit more where it's needed.
The system works perfectly and you can
explain everything with complete accuracy,
because you can change
the amount at will.
The only trouble is, no one knows what it is
and there is no independent evidence for it,
people've been speculating about its nature
ever since it was first postulated.
Having created all this extra matter
in the universe then this meant
there should be more gravitation, and
physicists expected in the nineteen nineties
that the universal expansion, from
the Big Bang, would slow down,
the Universe would stop expanding,
then begin to contract
under the influence of all this gravitational
matter until it ended in tears
and the reverse of the Big Bang known
in the trade is the Big Crunch.
So, when in the late nineteen nineties
people observed that the universe appeared
to be accelerating because of redshifts
in distant quasars and so on in galaxies.
Then, there was a problem how do
you explain this acceleration.
Well, the answer was ready to
hand, a new form of energy not
known about before which
cause the universe to expand.
How much is that? well, just the
right amount to explain the facts.
So, we now have dark matter and dark
energy as huge amount to the universe,
they currently make up
about 96% of reality.
Physicists invented something
like 20 times more energy and
mass than anyone could ever heard of
until the 1980s, and no one has said,
no you can't do that, it's defying the law
of conservation of matter and energy.
And if you ask, is all this matter and energy
conserved?
Is the total amount always the same?
Well, for dark matter nobody knows,
for dark energy the most usual theory is
that actually the amounts're increasing
as the universe expands there's
more dark energy.
The universe is now a
perpetual motion machine.
So, the idea it's all rigorously conserved,
doesn't really make much sense in those terms.
There's also within the quantum physics
a zero point energy, a form of energy
which is supposed to be there underlying
the world we live in which is like
waves on an ocean of energy.
And there is huge amounts of it,
the amount in a teaspoon would be enough
to power the United States for years.
Not surprisingly some people claim that
they can tap this energy and have devices
which tap unconventional, unknown forms
of energy including zero point energy.
If you go online, you will find there are many
people who claim to have above unity
devices, machines that produce more
energy than you put into them.
Well these were immediately banned from regular
science because they violate the first
of sciences taboos established by
Galileo in the early 17th century,
the taboo against perpetual
motion machines.
This taboo long predated
the laws of thermodynamics,
and it's one of the most
deep-seated taboos in science.
So things like Cold Fusion or above
unity devices or free energy devices,
whether they're based on zero point energy
or peculiar electromagnetic effects
or parametric resonance
or various other theories
that we use to explain them, are
totally beyond the pale.
Nevertheless people claim they've
got them and they exist.
If they do exist, of course, it
would totally transform
the world economy and the
world energy situation.
So do they really work?
Well right now it's very very hard to find
out because these claims that may or may
not be substantiated, there's a universal rejection
within orthodox science with this.
A few people within the Department
of Defense, a few people
who are kind of maverick
investors are interested in this.
The Japanese government's
interested but basically
they're not part of the
normal discourse of sciences.
I myself think the best way forward
here would be to have a prize,
say a million dollar prize for
the best above unity device,
and those who came to have them
could then have them tested.
This is not an attempt to debunk them,
it's an attempt to see what really works.
They'd be tested under
fair agreed conditions
and if any of them do indeed produce more
energy than it's put into them
which can't be explained in terms of any
known energy source, they'd win the prize.
If the several do then the
best one'd win the prize.
I think this would be the best
way of bringing this whole thing
out into the open and finding
out what's really going on.
And I think that commercial betting
companies could open a book on this
as well and people could bet on
whether the prize will be awarded.
Then all the skeptics who say it's
impossible could put their money where
their mouth is and bet a million
dollars that no one would win the prize.
How much would they actually be prepared to bet,
that would be a very interesting question.
I'd be prepared to bet at least a thousand
dollars that someone would win it.
So I think this would put this thing
totally into the public domain, the media
would love it, everyone would be
discussing it
and if someone won it I think it
would completely change the climate.
I think investors would get
interested, governments,
how it works and the
situation could move on.
Right now we've been at a stalemate
for years with these things.
It turns out that in biology the whole
question of energy conservation is
much much more questionable
than most people assume.
We all assume that the total
amount of energy that
we produce can be explained
by the food we take in.
And this was assumed in the
1850s by Hermann Von Helmholtz who
was eager to prove that living
organisms were nothing but machines.
He didn't prove it, he assumed it, and since
then it's been a basic dogma in biology.
It wasn't tested in humans until
1899 by two American researchers,
called Atwater and Benedict, and they were
determined to prove that we're nothing but
machines, they were mechanists and they
started from the assumption this was true
and they did the experiments
not to find out if it's
true or not but as they
put it, to demonstrate it.
In order to further the cause of science.
They had people in calorimeters
and measured all the heat
produced, the carbon dioxide,
the oxygen taken in, feces,
urine, food consumed and so on.
Did a complete energy
balance sheet.
When they did it the results came out
wrong, so they changed the correction
factors for the value of food until
they got the expected result.
And this then became built into the
foundations of biology as a certain fact.
It wasn't reexamined till a independent-minded
American nutritionist Paul Webb
redid their experiments in the nineteen
seventies, he found huge discrepancies.
People who were overweight, overreaching
in doing very little exercise,
seem to have 25% or so of
the energy just vanish.
People who are not eating and doing
exercise gained about 25%, too much energy.
Where was it coming from?
Nobody knows, he called it X,
the unexplained amount of energy that
could either be disappear or appear.
He then reexamined Atwater and Benedict's results
and found that they got similar discrepancies,
but they'd made sure to adjust as many
people who had too much and too little
so that when they averaged them it canceled
out to give the expected result.
There are people who claim there
are other forms of energy,
'Chi', Prana, vital
energies and so on.
And this is usually treated as metaphoric,
but they may be much more literal
than we usually think and this
is a huge unexplored area.
It's not as if nutrition science is the
most successful branch of modern biology
And I think that this is something
which bears reexamination, in my book
I suggest several quite radical
experiments that could
be done quite simply and
cheaply to look at this.
Well, now let me turn briefly to the idea that
the laws and constants of nature are fixed.
The idea that laws are fixed is a
hangover from Greek philosophy,
Plato and Pythagoras thought that the world
was governed by mathematical principles
beyond space and time, eternal ideas.
In the 17th century people thought these
were ideas in the mind of a mathematical god
and that God had these mathematical
ideas and that scientists were actually
finding out about the mind of god by
finding out maths of nature.
People thought Newton's laws of gravitation
we're not just human hypotheses,
mere guesses or mere working principles,
they thought this was a direct insight
into the Divine Mind, superior to that of
religion, much more precise, much less disputable.
And this was really the basis for a
enlightenment ideology of science and reason
they though science and
reason transcended religion
in giving a direct insight
into the divine nature.
Now you don't hear much about that today, but
there's still this strong enlightement tradition
and the idea the laws of nature are fixed is
a hangover from that point of view.
But in a radically evolutionary universe,
which the Big Bang postulates,
why shouldn't the laws of
nature themselves evolve?
In fact, why should
it be laws at all?
Law is a very human metaphor, only humans
have laws and only civilized societies.
Why should we project this anthropocentric
metaphor onto the whole of nature?
I myself think that the idea of habits
of nature makes much better sense.
This is the basis of my own idea of morphic
resonance which is a memory principal in nature,
but I'm not the first
to propose habits.
The American philosopher C.S. Peirce, at
the beginning of the 20th century,
suggested that in an
evolutionary universe
the irregularities could be
thought of as evolving habits.
I think it's a much better way to think
of it, and it's a testable hypothesis.
The theory of morphic resonance predicts, for example,
that if you crystallize a new chemical
compound for the first time it may be
very difficult to crystallize because it
hasn't yet got a habit to crystallize
in, with a particular lattice structure.
But if you crystallize it again
somewhere else, there'll be a resonance
from the first crystals across space
and time, morphic resonance,
that will make it easier to
crystallize and the third time,
it'll be easier still because of the resonance
from the first and the second crystals,
it'll get easier and easier to
crystallize around the world.
There's a lot of evidence
that that really happens.
Chemists explain it by saying there must have
been, fragments of previous crystals
must've been buffeted around
the world as dust particles.
But I'm predicting the same will happen even
if you filter dust particles out of the air.
The theory also predicts that if you train
animals, say rats, to learn a new trick.
If you train rats in Albuquerque to
learn the new trick then all over the world,
rats in New York and London
and Tokyo should learn the
same trick quicker, just
because rats learned it here.
Surprisingly there's already evidence
from experiments with a long series of
experiments with rats done at
Harvard, the University of Edinburgh,
University of Melbourne, Australia,
that this actually happens.
The same applies to people,
it should be getting easier
to learn things that others
have already learned.
Well I'm not going to go into detail on
this because this is the theme of my
own theory of morphic resonance and my purpose
in this lecture and in my book is not
really so much to push my own ideas as
to show how questionable the standard
ones are and how much we can, the
field is open for different answers.
But I'll turn just briefly to the
constants of nature because this
affects the Electric Universe,
or any model of the universe.
It's assumed that the constants of nature
are constant, the fundamental constants
like Newton's gravitational constant,
big G, or the speed of light, c.
Well, I began to wonder whether they really
were constant when I got into the habit
view of nature and so I tried to
find what their actual values were.
I started off by getting
handbooks of physical constants,
and looking at old editions, most people
only look at the latest edition
and they usually throw the old ones away but
I, in the patent office library in London,
I found they kept them all, and so I
got them all out of the reserve stock,
at 10-year intervals, they wheeled in a
trolley handbooks of physical constants,
dusting them off, and I looked through
these things to see how they've changed.
To my amazement I found that the speed of light
dropped by 20 km/s between 1928 and 1945.
I then looked up the data in more detail
and found that all over the world
people have been getting this much lower
figure, with very small error bars,
the original figure is up there with
little error bars and it goes down much
lower, little error bars it wasn't that
the error bars were 20 km/s, no, they were
point decimal places of km/s.
And I checked in the primary literature
and found this indeed seemed to be the case
and then they went up again after 1945.
I couldn't understand what was going on, so I
asked the head of the Metrology Department,
metrologist are people who measure
constants, at the British National
Physical Laboratory if I could go
and see him and I went to visit him.
He was very friendly, and
I said to him: Dr. Petley
I'd like to know how you explain this drop
in the speed of light between 1928 in 1945?
He said: "Oh, dear",
I said: "What?!",
he said: "you've uncovered one of the most
embarrassing incidents in the history of our subject."
So I said, well could it mean that the speed of
light really did drop at least as measured
on earth during that period,
he said: "Of course not!"
I said: "Why not?", he said:
"Because, it's a constant!"
So, I said well then, I can't see
any other explanation than that
people around the world they're
sort of fudging their results.
To get what they thought everyone else
would expect them to get and then
discarding outliers and stuff
and coming up with these
very narrow error bars that
agreed with everyone else.
And so, it then must have been produced
by some kind of fudging process.
He said: "We don't like
to use the word fudge."
OK, so I said: "What
do you prefer?"
Yep, he said: "We prefer to call
it, 'intellectual phase locking'."
So, I said to him: "It was happening then,
how do we know it's not happening now?"
He said: "We know it's not happening
now.", and I said: "Why?"
He said: "Because we fixed the speed
of light by definition in 1972."
- "So, said I it might still vary?" and
he leaned back looking very smug
and said: "But if it did,
no one would ever find out,
because we've defined the meter
in terms of the speed of light.
So the units would vary with it."
I said: "Ok, you fix that one, but what
about the gravitational constant,
I saw that's been very widely, and
even actually in the last 3 or 4 years
it has varied by more than 1.3% as
measured in different laboratories?"
The usual assumption
is, this is just error
and it's experimental error, it's
hard to measure, it's error.
So, labs all over the world
get quite different results
and the International Committee
on metrology fixes the results
every few years by averaging
ones from different labs,
weighting ones they think a more reliable,
discarding ones they think are not.
Indeed, when I left Dr Petley, thanking
him for his time he reached down
to a cardboard box beside his desk
full of pamphlets and said:
"By the way, these have just come
from the printers, you might like one."
He handed me this pamphlet 'The latest
values of the physical constants'
I looked to these data from different
labs on 'G', big 'G' and in 1 or 2,
the question that I was wondering
is, there's always big errors,
could it be that they're actually
changing together in different labs
as the earth rotates around the
Sun, as it rotates during the day
and as the whole solar system moves through
different astronomical environments.
To find that out, one would look at
the day by day measurements from
different labs and see if the errors or
so called errors are correlated.
I spent more than 10
years trying to persuade
metrologists to do this and
they simply will not,
because they say it's a constant so
there's no point of looking for variations.
And I say, you got these huge differences,
they say they're just errors, it's hard
to measure, but they simply won't do it.
An exercise in open science would be if
they put their raw data with the dates online
and then anyone could try and look for
patterns and they could be a website
where they're discussed, I think it would cost
nothing and we might find something out.
We'll find out nothing
by pretending it's fixed!
There are in fact already
papers that suggest diurnal
variations in accordance
with the sidereal day.
A group at MIT recently found a daily
variation and there's some evidence of annual
variations, but there may be other wider
fluctuations that happen in concert.
I myself think the so-called
physical constants may vary from
time to time and possibly even
chaotically within certain limits.
But I think the day may come when
in scientific periodicals like
Nature there will be a page, a bit like the
stock market reports you know.
This week's value of the
constants, you know.
This week the 'G' went slightly up the
charge on the electron held steady
there was a drop in the
fine structure constant.
And if that were the case
then they would give varying
qualities of time when
different things could happen.
The idea they're all rigidly
fixed is a hangover
from old Platonic point of,
way of thinking.
So there, right in the
heart of Physics is,
I think, a really open
and interesting question.

New scientific reports provide
yet another devastating blow
to the standard theory
of planet formation.
In recent years, we've reported on
a stunning series of discoveries
that completely confound the more than two
and a half centuries old nebular hypothesis.
The Electric Universe theory has always proposed
that planets do not form from accretion
in gravitationally
collapsing nebular clouds.
Rather, The Thunderbolts Project's
chief science advisor Wal Thornhill
has always proposed two
mechanisms of planet formation.
One is the formation of planets by
the electromagnetic z-pinch effect
along the same filaments where
stars are now known to form.
And other planets are later ejected
from the cores of the gas giants.
The accretion hypothesis has failed
both experimentally and observationally.
As noted in a recent news report,
"According to the traditional story
of the origin of the solar system,
the planets formed
slowly from accretion,
as particles in the circumstellar disk
clumped together to great pebbles,
then slightly larger spheres, on and on
until they reached their current size.
But when scientists try to re-create this
story with computer models, it breaks down.
Rather than growing, these incipient planets
tend to splinter after reaching pebble size."
And today, new scientific research
into the planet-forming conditions
in so-called young star systems has delivered
another shocking blow to standard theory.
In a paper published in the
journal Astronomy & Astrophysics,
scientists describe their attempts
to determine how much material
is present in the
disks around stars
that are thought to be only one
to three million years old.
When they compared their estimates
to the masses of star systems
that have fully formed planets,
they realized that the so-called young stars
did not have enough matter in their discs
to eventually form planets.
The conundrum is described in a
recent phys.org report which states,
"Until now, space scientists have
believed that star systems form
due to space dust
coalescing into a star.
Once the star gets going, a protoplanetary
disk usually forms around the star.
It is believed the gas and
dust that make up the disk
are leftovers from material
involved in creating the star.
As more time passes,
the material in the disk tends to clump
together until gravity takes over,
attracting more of the
material in the disk.
Eventually, most of the
material from the disk
is incorporated into planets
that orbit the star.
But this new evidence suggests that there
is not enough material in the disk
of the average early star system
to create the average
number and size of planets
that come to exist a few
million years later."
A very similar conundrum has been posed for
the standard theory of star formation.
In our Electric Universe, it is not a
coincidence that stars tend to form in groups
along spectacular
snake-like filaments.
Standard theory had
originally proposed
that massive stars would form in
individual proto-stellar clouds.
But consider these images of a stellar
nursery in the aptly named Snake Nebula
where a number of stars are
forming along the filament
and the stars themselves
break up along a cylinder.
This is in stark contrast
to gravitational theory
which predicts that a
center of mass exists
toward which all of the
surrounding material in the cloud
tends to move and to congregate
to eventually form a star.
What's more, just as a fatal deficit of
matter is observed in the disks about stars
to form a typical
number of planets,
scientists studying
the Snake Nebula
found that the material needed to
be drawn in to form massive stars
is far less than gravitational
models predict.
In 2014, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center
for Astrophysics issued a press release
which stated,
"Previous theories proposed that high-mass stars
form within very massive isolated 'cores'
weighing at least 100 times
the mass of the Sun.
These new results show
that that is not the case.
The data also demonstrate that massive
stars aren't born alone but in groups...
The team also was surprised to find
that these two nebular patches
had fragmented into individual star seeds
so early in the star formation process.
They detected bipolar outflows and other
signs of active, ongoing star formation."
Of course the detection
of bipolar outflows
does not match a gravitational
infall model at all.
However as Wal Thornhill has proposed in
his theory of electrical star formation,
when material is drawn in radially into
a filament and begins to form a star
if the energy stored in the material falling
towards the star exceeds a certain amount,
it will discharge
causing proto stellar jets which go
out along the axis of the filament
which has also been observed.
Yet another aspect of star formation that
fits far better with the Electric Universe
is the astonishing
abundance of binary stars,
an admitted intractable problem
in standard astronomy.
In the next episode
of Space News,
Wal Thornhill will explain why the
double-lobed form seen throughout the cosmos
is the product of the predominant
electromagnetic force
shaping matter at all
scales in the universe.
We now offer this brief
preview of his presentation.
On August 24th, phys.org published
The Origin of Binary Stars.
It makes the admission that
"The origin of binary stars has long been
one of the central problems of astronomy."
It's been found that
protostars and young stars
are more likely to be
found in binary pairs
strung at intervals along a
filament inside a molecular cloud.
"About half of the binaries are
in elongated core structures,
and they conclude that the initial cores
were also elongated structures...
One of their most significant
major conclusions
is that each dusty core of material is
likely to be the birthplace of two stars,
not the single star
usually modeled."
This raises the real issue that
astrophysicists don't understand
how either the filaments
or the stars are formed,
something that plasma cosmologists have
shown for half a century or more.
Here's an image taken at submillimeter
wavelengths of a star-forming core
showing that it contains
two young stellar embryos.
The caption says,
"Astronomers have concluded from a
systematic study of very young cores
that most embryonic stars
form in multiple systems,
and later some of
them separate."
The problem is that astrophysicists are
using a gravitational accretion model
based on the concept
of a center of mass
which doesn't lend itself to
preferentially producing pairs of stars.
Meanwhile, the plasma cosmology
model is electromagnetic
driven by a linear twisted pair
of Birkeland current filaments.
It's an inherently
binary phenomenon.
In the Electric Universe, stars and planets are
formed along the Birkeland current filament
by a powerful and long-range 1/√r
electromagnetic scavenging force
acting on the diffused dust
and gas in a molecular cloud.
This compares to the puny short-range
1/r² gravitational force
which cannot form a
filament anyway.
On the basis that nature doesn't
do anything the hard way,
gravity just isn't the answer!

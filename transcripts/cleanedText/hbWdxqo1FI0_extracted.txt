A new scientific study has
proposed a new hypothesis
for a longstanding mystery
in atmospheric science.
For many years scientists have wondered
why the concentration of electrons
in Earth's atmosphere suddenly drops in a
region dozens of miles above the Earth,
which some call the
'D-region ledge'.
According to a recent Space.com
report, an investigative team
is now hypothesizing that tiny meteor
dust particles higher in the atmosphere
might be responsible for "sucking up"
the so-called missing electrons.
One of the study authors says
of the electron deficiency,
"It's the most dramatic gradiant
anywhere in the ionosphere.
It really is very conspicuous, so
it's begging for an explanation".
To place this mystery into a larger context,
we reached out to Dr. Michael Clarage,
one of the lead researchers
of the SAFIRE Project.
The SAFIRE Project is an independent
team of researchers building a unique
plasma discharge chamber to study a
wide variety of electrical phenomena.
We asked Dr. Clarage for his
thoughts on the electrical conditions
in Earth's environment, and a comment
on his role on the SAFIRE Team.
[Dr. Michael] My job on the
SAFIRE Team is to connect
astronomical phenomena to experiments
we can do in the SAFIRE chamber.
Making the connection between
something at a planetary scale
and something happening in the
lab is always challenging.
And, we are by no means the first
to be doing such experiments.
Since Birkeland's original work in the late
1800's there have been maybe twenty chambers,
I know about, built specifically to study
the Earth's electrical environment.
To call out just two: In 1974, Dubinin, at
the Institute of Space Research in Moscow,
put a magnetized sphere in a vacuum chamber,
and shot high-energy electrons at it.
The spatial pattern of electrons
precipitating onto the sphere
mimicked electron flows around the
Earth, into our own magnetosphere.
That was really a
breakthrough experiment.
In 2012, researchers at the
Russian Academy of Sciences
also put a dipole magnetized
sphere into a chamber,
and blew a wind of
plasma past the sphere,
and were able to measure
electrical potential differences
across the poles of this
sphere that are similar
to electrical structures known
to exist around the Earth
where we know that the part of
the Earth experiencing sunrise
is at a higher electrical potential than the
parts of the Earth experiencing sunset.
Now, that was a very
impressive experiment
and really shows that laboratory
experiments can be very relevant
to exploring what might be happening
electrically around planets and stars.
The SAFIRE chamber is
considerably more flexible
than these other two
chambers I mentioned.
We are hoping to be able to
explore a much wider range
of not only planetary phenomena,
but also stellar phenomenon.
The mandate of the SAFIRE
Team is quite broad:
to explore electrical phenomena
at stellar and planetary scales,
but as to any particular
theories about
the electrical nature of planets
or stars, we are quite agnostic.
As Monty Childs has sometimes said,
"we don't have a horse in the race".
We think that it's important because
once a research group gets too locked in
to trying to prove a certain theory,
or a specific scientific model,
then they usually end up ignoring
data that does not fit their model.
We are going in there with as
few preconceptions as possible.
We want the data to lead us to the
model, not the other way around.
[Host, Michael] As one moves
away from the ground on Earth,
the atmosphere gets more
rarefied and more energized.
At around 50 kilometers
above the ground,
the atmosphere begins to
take on plasma properties
with electrons and ions coexisting
in a highly conductive medium.
Some well-known fluctuations
in electron density
including the so-called 'missing electrons'
described as the 'D-region ledge'
are not easily explained using the
standard models of the atmosphere.
We asked Dr. Clarage for
his thoughts on the recent
Space.com article which
describes this mystery.
[Dr. Michael] The first thing I
think of when reading this article
is how far we still have to go
in terms of describing the large-scale
electrical structures of planets.
It is still difficult for many astronomers
and geophysicists to conceive
that an entire planet
might have a charge
relative to other planets
or the space around it.
Even though we know from direct
measurement, on our own Earth
that the sky overhead has a
persistent positive charge
relative to the ground we stand on,
and that's around the entire Earth.
So, that is, the entire sky is charged
relative to the entire surface of the Earth,
and that's called the
'fair-weather potential'.
I've been following research
into this for years,
and most geophysicist are trying to
describe this assuming the Earth
is in electrical isolation from
the rest of the Solar System.
So, the explanations use only
lightning, and winds, and heat
- that is, only events
happening locally on Earth.
But, both the fair-weather potential,
and what the Space.com article called
'The Case of the Missing Electrons', can
also be seen as ordinary plasma structures.
I don't mean to minimize the
complexity of the systems
- we are talking about very
complex systems here -
I only mean to say,
it's worth considering
that all planets are immersed in
a larger electrical environment.
These charge separations of
the fair-weather potential,
and the persistent electron density
fluctuations in the ionosphere,
are examples of plasma
structures that have been known
by laboratory plasmas
physicists for decades.
And, these structures arise
when one part of your system
is at a different electrical
potential than its surroundings.
Let me take a minute here, and describe one
aspect of charge separation in plasma.
I'm going to place a sphere in a
vacuum chamber filled with plasma,
and I put a negative
charge on that sphere.
In a plasma the charges can move, so the
available positive charges is in the chamber
will be attracted to the negative sphere
until overall, the charge is neutralized.
This is understandable, if I put a
negative charge inside a plasma,
a bunch of positive charges
will collect around it.
And, this is usually the only diagram you'll
find in most plasma physics textbooks.
And, the thickness of that
positive layer can be predicted -
it's called the Debye length
of that plasma environment.
But, as plasma laboratory physicists
have known for many decades,
and as we study in the SAFIRE chamber,
the actual case is often more complex.
Now, here are a few pictures from the
SAFIRE chamber showing not just one layer
of negative-positive, but multiple
layers of negative-positive fluctuation.
These results were published in the Journal
of Plasma Sources, Science and Technology.
These are beautiful dynamic phenomena
- I wish more people could be in
the lab to watch these unfold.
Each of those layers contains a persistent
separation of positive and negative charges.
The electron density ultimately increases and
decreases as you move through the layers.
Now, the exact formation is quite dynamic
and very sensitive to conditions
such as gas types, electrical
potential, magnetic fields, etc.
The whole theory of electrical double
layers is still in its infancy
- there's still much
we do not know.
Practicing plasma physicists have
known these layers to rise,
but, for historical reasons,
astronomers have believed
that such charge separations cannot
arise at the planetary or solar level.
If we look at the drawing presented
in the Space.com article,
you see on the right that
wavy red line heading up?
That represents increasing and
decreasing electron density
as you move up, away
from the Earth.
As the redline wiggles to the right that
represents increasing electron density,
as the line wiggles left that's
decreasing electron density
- this is the sort of oscillation in
charge we see in the plasma double layers.
In other words, if you
accept that the Earth
is at a different electrical
potential than the Sun,
then this sort of up-and-down fluctuations
in electron density is expected.
I'm not trying to oversimplify - the planet's
ionosphere is a very complicated structure.
But, if you start with a
simple electrical hypothesis
you can predict such features, whereas,
if you start with the opposite hypothesis
that a planet cannot be a different
electrical potential than its Sun,
then you have to construct
much more complicated models
to explain what you see
happening in the atmosphere.

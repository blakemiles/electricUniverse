Welcome to Space News from

Today we delve more deeply into a
highly promising ongoing investigation
in the Electric
Universe community.
In the previous episode, physicist Eugene
Bagashov introduced the analysis
he and several others in
the community have conducted
into the evidence for the pervasiveness
of a type of electric current,
called a Birkeland current
within or nearby our
cosmic neighborhood.
Of course when electric currents can't
be directly measured by space probes,
the task of inferring their
existence in space is complicated.
Eugene and his colleagues have
followed Dr. Donald Scott's model
of the structure of
a Birkeland current.
In Part 2 of this
four-part presentation,
Eugene outlines in finer detail what he
and his colleagues have found to date.
In the previous video, we've discussed Dr. Scott's
model for cylindrical Birkeland currents
and have hypothesized that one major
example of such a structure around us
might be represented by
the so-called local chimney;
perhaps with more localized sub
filaments on smaller scales inside it.
But at the same time, at least one argument
against such an idea might be made.
If these are indeed strong electric
currents, why don't we actually see them?
In particular, where is any
synchrotron radiation from them?
And moreover, if there are strong
magnetic fields in this structure,
why can't we observe
them in some way?
The answer to the first
part of that question
lies in the fact that these are most
likely force-free field-aligned currents,
just as the ones analyzed
in Dr. Scott's works.
What that means is that
the electric currents
are in all points of this structure
parallel to the magnetic fields.
So this is a minimal energy configuration
with little to no electromagnetic stress
and therefore as the charged particles
are not accelerated by the magnetic fields
but rather move right along them,
no significant synchrotron
radiation is being produced.
This is just a plasma current
in dark mode and that's it.
The second part of the
question is a bit trickier.
At first we should consider the main method
of detection of magnetic fields in space.
It rests on the so-called Faraday
effect, or Faraday rotation.
Without getting into the
physical reason for that effect,
as it is slightly complicated,
we might just say
that the Faraday effect
causes the rotation of the
plane of polarization of light.
That is the directions in which
the electric and magnetic field
of an electromagnetic
wave are oscillating.
And for it to happen, we should have
some medium in a magnetic field in it.
The effect is only valid for the
component of the magnetic field
that is parallel to the direction
of propagation of the wave.
But the most important property
of that effect in our context
is that it is reversed, if one
reverses either the field direction
or the direction of
propagation of light.
So, if we now consider again the structure
of the Birkeland current filament
as follows from
Dr. Scott's model,
what we see is the cylindrical
shells where each consecutive shell
has the magnetic field that is reversed
with respect to the previous one,
which would mean that
indeed any such shell
would change the polarization
of light to some degree.
But as the light enters the next
shell with an opposite magnetic field,
we get the opposite change which effectively
eliminates any change that took place
as light passed through
both of these layers.
In that way we might argue that any
Faraday effect would be virtually absent
and the best we might count on is seeing
some much weaker background magnetic field
that the filament as a
whole is spiraling around.
Well, let's assume then that we can't
directly detect the currents themselves,
then what can we detect to at
least recognize their presence?
One of the possibilities here might be
represented by plasma refraction of light,
that is bending of light when it
interacts with the charged particles
that carry the current itself.
Previously the works of
Dr. Gupta and Dr. Dowdye
have shown that the bending of light in plasma
might alter the trajectory of light rays,
and among other things, imitate the
hypothetical gravitational lensing of light.
It might be expected therefore
that the areas with higher current density in
the Galactic neighborhood of the solar system
might also impact the measurements of
the direction of propagation of light.
In general, any inhomogeneity
in plasma distribution
would introduce various errors if
not properly taking into account.
Let's look at some
examples of that.
One well-known technique of the distance
estimates to the nearby stars and clusters
is the parallax method.
So, the parallax method is based on the
idea that as the Earth moves around the Sun,
we might observe the same star
at slightly different angles,
as our own position
and space changes.
From this angular difference one may geometrically
determine the distance to the star,
or in principle any other object.
This angle is usually very small
as the stars are very far from us.
The largest parallax angle is
obviously observed for the nearest star,
Proxima Centauri,
as it apparently moves in the sky
the most as we proceed in our orbit.
And even that angle is only
about 0.76 angular seconds;
that is about two
tenthousandths of a degree.
However, the precision of modern observational
methods based on space telescopes
in principle allows us to measure parallax
angles as small as about 10 micro arc seconds,
which corresponds to distances of
tens of thousands of light-years.
But let us now
consider the situation
when the space between us
and the star is not empty,
but rather filled
with refracting plasma.
In this case, the reading of the
parallax angle might be distorted,
and the parallax determination of
the distance would be erroneous.
One of the famous examples of that is
the so-called Pleiades distance problem.
So, according to modern astronomy
it is possible to determine the
distance to Pleiades cluster
at least in two different ways.
First, one might do that by
looking at smaller stars in it
in infrared wavelengths,
determine their brightness, or correctly
speaking, the absolute magnitude,
and then compare that to the apparent
brightness or apparent magnitude
and get the distance measurement.
Applied to Pleiades, this procedure would
return a result of about 435 light-years.
And second, one might utilize the
current theory of stellar operation
and estimate the mass from
the surface temperature.
Then, if we're looking at some
binary star system in that cluster,
we might track their orbits.
Since before we
estimate their masses,
we might find the real size of
the orbit from Kepler's laws
and thus find the distance to them
from simple geometrical considerations.
In that way, the distance to the cluster
was estimated to be about 430 lightyears.
But the problem appeared when these estimates
were compared to parallax measurements,
especially the ones performed
by the Hipparcos satellite.
The satellite did measure the
parallax angle of the cluster,
but the according distance turned
out to be only about 385 light-years.
Moreover, some later
analyses have shown
that Hipparcos systematically gives smaller
distances for many other stellar clusters.
The later measurements made by the Hubble Space
Telescope and radio telescopes from Earth,
using the very long baseline
interferometry method,
seem to discount
Hipparcos data also.
And, finally, the new Gaia satellite essentially
using the same technique as Hipparcos,
has also acquired the result which
is inconsistent with Hipparcos.
This seems to have
ended the debate,
basically meaning that something
is wrong with Hipparcos itself.
Although one could argue that the
difference could have been caused by
different statistical
processing of the results.
In particular Hipparcos data was
analyzed using a weighted mean
of parallaxes for different
stars in the cluster,
when there seems to be a correlation between
distances and distance errors for stars in it.
The later estimates were
made using an unweighted mean
for separate stars
in the cluster.
Another source of
discrepancy could have been
the various methods of
measuring the parallax itself.
Hipparcos and Gaia were measuring the
so-called absolute or direct parallax,
whereas Hubble and radio
telescopes from Earth
have been measuring the so-called
relative or differential parallax,
basically taking some distant objects
right behind Pleiades as a reference point.
So we might assume that the
differences in these readings
and the need of invoking different statistical
procedures for the stellar clusters
might have been caused by the
refraction of light in plasma
in the Pleiades cluster
itself or on the way to it.
Moreover, there might
exist a certain dispersion,
that is the dependence of the
refraction amplitude on the wavelength
so that the radio telescope data might
introduce additional shifts of position
with the respect to
visible range observations.
The importance of plasma bending of light for
Pleiades in the framework of our hypothesis
might be reinforced by the fact that this
cluster is situated in the constellation Taurus,
the line-of-sight to which lies somewhere
close to the axis of the local chimney.
So, if there is indeed an enhanced current
density at the center of the chimney column,
it is not surprising that the objects
observed in that area of the sky
would demonstrate some
anomalies of that sort.
Perhaps it is worth
noting that earlier works
have also demonstrated some correlated
erroneous readings for the Hyades star cluster
which is also situated in Taurus.
Another prominent example of suspicious
parallax measurements would be Polaris,
the pole star.
Various parallax measurements of
Polaris made in the last two decades
have been steadily returning
incompatible results.
The according distances range from
about 330 to about 800 light-years,
which doesn't seem to be
very precise and consistent.
And there are some
other examples like that.
All of them might be related to the behavior
of plasma in the local interstellar chimney
and nested cylindrical shells of current and
sub-filamentary structures on smaller scales.
In the case of Polaris,
as Jim Weninger argues,
even the smaller scale Birkeland current
filament that is connected to Earth's North Pole
might be the cause
for the discrepancy.
I have certain doubts about that, but it
sounds like an interesting hypothesis anyway.
The importance of both Pleiades and Polaris
in astrophysics and cosmology is very high.
The Pleiades represent
a model star cluster
and the properties of stars in it
that we infer from our observations,
are directly related to
the distance to the cluster.
And Polaris is a
so-called Cepheid variable star.
Cepheid variables
are widely used in astronomy to determine
the distances to various objects
as it is assumed that we
know how exactly they work.
In particular, it is assumed
that there is a direct relation
between their pulsation period
and their absolute luminosity.
And Polaris is the
closest one to us;
so if we don't know
the distance to it,
all the other distances determined
through Cepheids should also be questioned.
To get a proper reading of that
distance, we need to firstly figure out
the proper arrangement and properties
of plasma structures in our vicinity.

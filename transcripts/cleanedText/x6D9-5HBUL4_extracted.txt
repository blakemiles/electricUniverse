Several years ago, on the planet Mars,
NASA's rover Curiosity discovered something so
strange it forced planetary scientists
to begin rewriting Martian history, a
process that continues today. The anomaly
was found in Gale crater, a more than 150
kilometer wide so-called impact basin.
At the center of the crater is Aeolus
Mons, also called Mount Sharp, a central 
peak reaching Heights of about 18,000 feet.
Among the layered minerals in this
terrain the most curious of all the
Rover discovered is Tridymite, an
extremely rare mineral which only forms
at super-hot temperatures and 
which is linked to volcanism on Earth.
At the time of the discovery in 2016,
NASA scientist Richard Morris stated, “It
was the last mineral we expected to see.
If this stands the test of time, it has a
lot of implications for how Mars evolved.
We may have to rethink a few things.”
The reason tridymite was the last
mineral NASA scientists expected to find
on Mars is simple. The red planet is not
believed to have the kind of dynamic
subsurface plates that have always been
thought necessary to create volcanic
activity. A similar dilemma was presented
when Mars was recently found to have
significant seismic activity; a complete
surprise to planetary scientists.
Indeed both conundrums reveal the
striking limitations of the standard
theoretical toolkit in planetary science,
including plate tectonic theory. Today,
the discovery of tridymite on Mars
remains problematic. A recent ScienceAlert
article noted, “Although Mars shows
extensive evidence of past basaltic
volcanic activity in some regions, the
once putatively water-filled Gale crater
is not one of those regions, leading scientists to 
puzzle about how the mineral came to be there.”
A new paper published in Earth and Planetary Science
Letters attempts to resolve the puzzle. A team of
investigators has proposed the ad hoc
hypothesis that billions of years ago, a
magmatic chamber existed underneath 
Gale crater at a time when the crater is
believed to have contained a substantial
lake. This chamber, the paper suggests,
remained dormant for an unusually long
time, eventually exploding massively,
releasing silica-rich ash in the form of
tridymite which then fell back down into
the waters of Gale crater. One basis the scientists
cite for this speculation is the extremely focused
location of the anomalous tridymite. Mars
geologist Kirsten Siebach states, “We argue
that because we only saw this mineral
once, and it was highly concentrated in a
single layer, the volcano probably
erupted at the same time the lake was
there. Although the specific sample we
analyzed was not exclusively volcanic
ash, it was ash that had been weathered and sorted
by water.” Of course the investigators have no
awareness of Electric Universe theory,
including the hypothesis that Mars and
other rocky planets in the solar system were
ravaged by high energy electrical discharge.
As explained in the feature length
documentary film “The Lightning-Scarred
Planet Mars,” this hypothesis can explain
countless Martian anomalies, including
its dozens of weird geologic formations.
Such as frequently bizarre cratering;
it's long unexplained hemispheric dichotomy;
its weird networks of rills and trenches;
and the stupendous Valles Marineris, a
vast Canyon which stretches over 3,000
miles across the Martian surface.
The question is, can very powerful
lightning produce tridymite?
Tridymite is a crystalline form of quartz
which forms under low pressures at extremely high
temperatures. Consider the relationship between
tridymite and another high temperature
silicate called lechatelierite which is
a form of silica glass found in lightning strike
features. In fact tridymite has indeed been found
as a product of lightning. In the book “The Data of
Geochemistry” tridymite was reported as the product of
lightning on a roofing slate. No volcanism required.
The very focused and limited range of
tridymite's presence at Gale crater's
central peak should be expected if it
was produced by a stupendous lightning
bolt. It must also be mentioned that
craters with central peaks have been
commonly observed for many decades in
experiments with electrical discharge to solid
surfaces. It's also important to consider another
type of mineral on Mars known as perchlorate.
The mineral is found in such abundance
on Mars that some have considered its potential
as a health hazard to future astronauts.
Various perchlorates are known to form by
electrochemical processes or by electrolysis,
and it's been discovered that lightning strikes can
produce perchlorate in the presence of chlorite.
Amazingly, perchlorates are 10,000 times
more abundant on Mars than sands or soils.
Again, we're left to question the
potential for meaningful progress in
astronomy and all of the theoretical
sciences when the major surprises fail
to force any real reassessment of consensus 
theory. Institutionalized science does indeed
rewrite history through ad hoc
provisions of theory, but always in a
fashion that never challenges the underlying 
paradigms. A beautiful parallel to the Martian
tridymite mystery can be found in just one
of the endless puzzles in comet science.
The Electric Universe has always stated
that our solar system's comets, asteroids
and meteoroids were formed in the 
same epoch of planetary instability that
produced the dramatic geology of the rocky planets.
Of course from this perspective, comets
are not the primordial dirty snowballs of standard
theory. Comet nuclei should appear exactly as
they have in every instance they've been
photographed: rocky, desiccated and
displaying extreme planetary geology.
If these bodies were indeed electrically
blasted from the surfaces of planets,
then of course we expect to find
minerals that form at super-hot temperatures.
This prediction was confirmed over a decade
and a half ago when NASA's Stardust Mission
returned dust samples from the comet Wild-2.
When scientists on Earth tested the
material, what they found was so
unexpected, they initially thought that the early
sample may have been contaminated by the spacecraft.
Rather than the expected ancient
interstellar grains, the Wild-2 dust
grains were much larger than expected
and contained minerals such as anorthite
and diopside which require temperatures of thousands
of degrees. NASA curator Michael Zolensky said of
the discovery, “That's a big surprise.
People thought comets would just be cold
stuff that formed out...where things are
very cold...It was kind of a shock to not
just find one but several of these,
which implies they are pretty common in the comet.”
Like the aforementioned efforts to fit
the Martian tridymite enigma into the
conventional framework of our solar
system's four and a half billion year
history, comet scientists responded to the shocking
Wild-2 discoveries with similar ad hoc speculations.
These range from the comet forming very
close to the Sun, then being hurled into
the outer solar system, to explosive
collisions in the early solar system and
ironically, even lightning in the primordial nebular
cloud. Again, the alleged causative events are
placed billions of years in the past and
are always restricted to the unproven
and very limited processes in 
the standard theoretical toolkit.
A recurring statement I've made over
many years is that the Electric Universe
community can only hope for a fair and thorough
hearing in the court of scientific investigation.
One cannot claim that this hearing 
has occurred unless, or until,
institutionalized science actually tests the
predictive theories of the Electric Universe.
Why this has taken so long to happen, may itself prove
to be a mystery for future generations to ponder.

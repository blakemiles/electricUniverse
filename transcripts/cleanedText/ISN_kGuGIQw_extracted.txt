Welcome to Space News from

It's a notion that
generations of astronomers
have agreed upon with
nearly unanimous consent,
that the clockwork predictability
we see in our solar system today
can be traced back over
countless eons of time.
The planets and the Sun formed about
a swirling disk of gas and dust
through a process of gravitational
collapse and accretion
and for billions of years their respective
orbits have remained undisturbed.
On our own planet, it's presumed that the
geological processes we see on earth today
can be traced back over
many millions of years
since a giant asteroid impact killed
the dinosaurs 65 million years ago.
This is the picture of our solar system's
four-and-a-half billion year history,
sanctioned for publication in
educational textbooks for many decades.
But this picture is
incrementally changing
in the face of an ever-growing
evidentiary crisis.
The belief that our solar system
formed from a collapsing nebular cloud,
finds no parallel in the thousands of
exoplanetary systems scientists have discovered,
including planets with
bizarre retrograde orbits
and Jupiter-sized planets
orbiting tiny parent stars
at a fraction of the distance
separating the Earth from the Sun.
In fact, with increasing regularity,
mainstream scientific literature
acknowledges that our solar system
has undergone dramatic changes,
making it a very different place
than it was after its formation.
Recently, scientists surveying
nearly 1,000 exoplanets
in over 300 multi-planet systems,
discovered an astonishing pattern.
Planets that share a star
appear like "peas in a pod"
with planetary neighbors of consistently
similar sizes and regular orbital spacing.
On the ramifications of these findings for
an understanding of our own solar system;
a recent Phys.org
reports states,
"...in our solar system, the inner planets have
surprisingly large spacing and diverse sizes.
Abundant evidence in the solar system
suggests that Jupiter and Saturn
disrupted our system's
early structure,
resulting in the four widely-spaced
terrestrial planets we have today."
As those who have followed the
Thunderbolts project are aware,
for many decades our chief
principals have proposed
such a disruption to our
solar system structure
though not to billions
of years in the past
and these catastrophes were
not typified by random impacts
but by electrical
discharges between planets.
Rocky planets and moons reveal
bizarre cratering patterns
and other features that
have been easily reproduced
in decades of laboratory experiments
with electrical discharges.
Material removed from
planetary surfaces
formed our solar system's comets,
asteroids and meteoroids.
A "radical notion" to which scientific
discovery lends increasing support.
Today, scientific research into
arguably the most perplexing meteorite
ever found on earth is "rattling"
the solar system's status quo,
challenging astronomers
fundamental ideas
about our solar system's
formation and history.
Since 2013, scientists on earth
have been studying fragments
from the so called Hypatia stone,
a tiny meteorite found in the Libyan
desert glass field in southwest Egypt.
In 2015, a number of research teams
announced that the material
cannot be identified based on any
known type of meteorite or comet.
As reported by phys.org
in January of this year,
new scientific research by a team at
the University of Johannesburg has,
"...provided unsettling
answers that spiral away
from conventional views of the material
our solar system was formed from."
The matrix of minerals composing the Hypatia
stone has been described as a "fruitcake"
resembling no known
meteorite or comet
and consisting of strange and
never-before-seen combinations of minerals.
And the dust material
found in the fragments
confounds the very core of
the solar nebula hypothesis.
As described by phys.org,
"Generally, science says that our solar
system's planets ultimately formed from a
huge, ancient cloud of interstellar
dust (the solar nebula) in space.
The first part of that
process would be much like
dust bunnies coagulating
in an unswept room.
Science also holds that the
solar nebula was homogeneous,
that is, the same kind
of dust everywhere.
But Hypatia's chemistry
tugs at this view."
Lead investigator, professor
Jan Kramer states,
"For starters, there are no silicate
minerals in Hypatia's matrix,
in contrast to chondritic meteorites (and
planets like the Earth, Mars and Venus),
where silicates are dominant.
Then there are the exotic
mineral inclusions.
If Hypatia itself
is not presolar,
both features indicate that the solar nebula
wasn't the same kind of dust everywhere -
which starts tugging at the generally accepted
view of the formation of our solar system."
In part one of this
two-part presentation,
Thunderbolts colleague Peter Mungo Jupp
begins an examination of the Hypatia stone
as we explore the object's ramifications
for the Electric Universe theory.
The Hypatia stone, was it a
comet or a cosmic thunderbolt?
Now, the Hypatia stone is a chemically
unique carbonaceous tektite
considered alien to earth.
In 1996, Egyptian
geologist Ali Barakat
discovered a tiny one-ounce
stone in the Eastern Sahara.
And ever since, scientists have
been trying to figure out
where exactly the mysterious
pebble originated.
Recently, research at Jan Kramer’s team
from the University of Johannesburg
found its chemical composition doesn't
resemble anything found on earth
or in the comets or
meteorites they have studied.
They therefore concluded it was
a deep-space extraterrestrial
from behind the
Kuiper asteroid belt.
It was discovered
amongst the supposedly
29 million years old Libyan
desert glass-strewn field.
Jan's team proposed
that the Hypatia stone
is a remnant of a
cometary nucleus fragment
that impacted after incorporating
gases from the atmosphere.
Its co-occurrence with Libyan desert
glass suggests that this fragment
could have been part of a bolide
that broke up and exploded in the
air burst that formed the glass.
Chemical analysis from the team
suggests the fragment was a deep-space
extra-terrestrial from behind
the Kuiper asteroid belt.
In normal chondritic meteorites,
we expect to see a small amount of
carbon and a good amount of silica
but Hypatia's matrix has a
massive amount of carbon
and an unusually small
amount of silicon.
Even more unusual, the matrix contains a high
amount of very specific carbon compounds
called poly(cyclic)aromatic
hydrocarbons or PAHs,
a major component of
interstellar dust,
which existed, the team claims, even
before our solar system was formed.
In another twist, most but not all,
of the PAHs in the Hypatia matrix
has been transformed into diamonds
smaller than 1 micrometer
which are thought to have been
formed in the shock of impact
with the Earth's
atmosphere or surface.
Carbon isotope data does not fit terrestrial
coal or carbonaceous chondrites
as the source of the pebbles, due
to the high carbon-13 content.
Carbon-12 is the norm for so-called
fossil fuel surface deposits
containing vegetable and
animal fossil inclusions.
But is there a
better explanation?
I believe their conclusions, although
possible, are not the only explanations.
I will build a questioning case
against this controversial theory.
Some of the team's foundational paradigms,
in my opinion, are suspect.
Now, firstly the claim that the
pebble is 29 millions of years old
relies on dating procedures such as
uranium, thorium and potassium argon
that demands a constant half-life
of an isotope over eons of time.
I suspect this is a fallacy when
applied all the catastrophic scenarios
that have revisited earth.
Synchrotron and many other forms
of radiation may well order
the internal structure of atoms
and thus their half-life.
Linear half-life is impossible
to verify over eons of time
being merely an extrapolation based
on a very narrow time sampling,
in other words the present-day.
Some indications are in strong denial
of this proven scientific fact.
Now, for instance, Rick Firestone who I
interviewed, a world expert in isotopes,
who ran the cyclotron at Berkeley
National Laboratory, revealed as an example
that the same isotope of cobalt-60 can
have dramatically different half-lives.
He couldn't explain why, other than to
suggest internal changes in the nucleus.
Could cosmic discharge events be involved
in altering stable isotopic half-lives?
Big question.
So, in other words, suspect dating
methods were used by Jan's team
to support explanations
using millions of years
to place the Hypatia
pebble’s creation
as part of an assembly of
unchanged pre-solar matter.
They claim this matter
existed in space
before our Sun, the Earth and other
planets in our solar system were formed.
But slow relentless change over
millions of years is totally unproven
and more often dodges
the real explanation.
This concept of
uniformitarianism,
that is everything happens gradually and
only as witnessed in our present world,
is at odds to the observed catastrophic
events that have often driven periods
of extremely rapid change in the
Earth's and solar system's development.
The result mass extinctions
and planetary chaos
are but one example of radical
chemical transformation.
Old Might Just be Young
Now, I was fascinated to
talk to Louis Hissink,
a former diamond
geologist with De Beers.
He enlightened me on his escape from the
confines of classical geological theory.
His epiphany came when confronted
with Aboriginal mythology
that explained recent diamond formation
in the Australian Kimberley region.
This may also explain the presence
of diamonds in the Hypatia stone.
Louis was expanding exploration from
the famous Argyle diamond mines,
biggest in the world, to the alluvial plains
near Kununurra some 150 kilometers away.
Alluvial diamonds were
found in a nearby river
but the site was yet
to be isolated.
A magnetic anomaly pointed
to a concentration point.
Now once obtaining local approval
from the Gija and Miriwung tribes,
a fascinating local
legend came to light.
The verbal Australian Aboriginal legend
stated that a giant, shining Barramundi,
that's a fish,
had jumped out of the ground at
Argyle, where the diamond pipe was.
The magnetic anomaly
site at distant Kununurra
was where the aboriginals insisted
it dived back into the earth.
Both sites were rich in diamonds
around their deep diamond pipes.
Was the Barramundi
legend nonsense?
Or had these people witnessed perhaps a giant
plasmoid causing transmutation of elements
and the creation of
diamonds on a grand scale.
Now, regardless, Louis Hissink
started to question
the crusted paradigms
of modern geology
which, as its backbone, maintains
that millions of years
are required to change
the topography of Earth.
Foundational geologists Hutton and Lyell's,
classical theories of the 19th century,
maintained that slow, erosional
decay and gentle chemical change
is the steady tool of Earth's
geological dynamics.
This theory of uniformity asserts
that nothing has happened on Earth
that's not witnessed today.
Louis pondered that if these
paradigms were correct,
how could historical aborigines
witness a diamond creating event
supposedly millions of years old?
Louis Hissink concluded,
and I quote,
"Some of the cherished geological
theories we hold may be quite wrong!"
Our first objection to the University
of Johannesburg's hypothesis is blunt.
The age of the Sahara Desert is
nowhere near 28 million years old.
Insightful, as a witness, are the pictures
by David Roberts, painted around the 1850s,
which show many ancient
Egyptian destruction sites
such as the Kom Ombo temple; and
the Sphinx, half buried under sand.
This deposition of sand and earthquake
damage is obviously an historical event.
Even more direct evidence of the
Sahara desert's relatively low age
is shown by Barth's 1850 discovery
of drawings of herds of cattle
rendered by the desert's
early dwellers.
The animals depicted no longer inhabit
this area and many are generally extinct.
Neolithic implements, vessels and weapons
have also been found near the drawings.
The drawings of the cattle
contain disk on their horns
similar to Egyptian drawings of disk,
circa 4 to 6,000 years old time frame.
Pictures of chariots, drawn
by horses, are found in areas
where horses today
couldn't possibly survive.
They've been revealed in both the
eastern and western parts of the Sahara.
Men lived in these densely populated
areas where cattle pastured,
but where today are enormous expanses of
sand, stretched for thousands of miles.
Even the ancient document Papyrus Ipuwer
describes a calamitous time
when the deserts of Egypt
were created. Our quote is,
"The desert is throughout the
land, the nomes are laid waste."
So it's, that's evidence that
the creation of the sands
where the desert glass and the Hypatia
stones were found, are only recent creations.
They're thousands of years old and not
due to an episode 28 million years ago.

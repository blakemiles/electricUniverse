Welcome to the
Electricity of Life,

In part 1 of this presentation, our guest
Dawson Church discussed his remarkable
investigation into the role of
consciousness in one's physical well-being.
In his book 'Mind to Matter'
Dawson cites voluminous scientific
research which suggests that our minds
can profoundly affect our bodies and
even the external world.
Emotions can be "stored" in the body and
over time can lead to imbalance and illness.
In this conclusion,
Dawson begins by addressing the notion,
which is highly controversial in Western
medicine, that energy exists in the body
and can aid in healing.
I've read critics, for example, who say there's
no plausible role for energy in biology
or in medicine or in healing and when I
read those comments, I think hey
guy, have you ever looked at an MRI
of our magnetic field?
Our EEG is reading our electrical field,
it's reading the electro-activity of the brain.
You can measure those fields of the body,
15 feet up from the body with a simple device.
I carry a little pocket device
called the galvanometer with me when I
go to conferences or to do the
demonstrations and in just a few seconds
I can show where your acupuncture points are
because they have a different electrical
charge than the skin around them.
So we are energy beings and MRI’s, EEGs, all
these things, use those phenomena to
diagnose and to treat people who are
sick, so they're energy medicine too, energy
shifts produce dramatic changes in cells
and in bodies and again, I have a lot of
these stories in Mind toMatter, a
lot of these studies in Mind to Matter.
There's lots of case histories,
lots of evidence, there are lots of
randomized controlled trials.
On our nonprofit website, we have over
600 studies, people healing from anything, from
Alzheimer's to ADHD to obesity to kidney disease
to metabolic failure, all kinds of healing studies.
are people who use energy
therapies like Reiki, like EFT, energy
medicine, Johrei, therapeutic touch and so
on and so yeah, this isn't, you know, three
studies, this is over a thousand studies
cumulatively of these kinds of
techniques and they show that
energy therapies are, not only are they
often effective, they're often effective
really quickly.
Dawson explores in 'Mind to Matter' the
scientific research of Dr. Bill Bengston
which showed remarkable effects of quote
'energy healing' in many laboratory experiments.
While The Thunderbolts
Project, as always, takes no position on
these questions, we asked Dawson to
enumerate the findings of Dr. Bengston’s studies.
Yeah, Bill is unique because
there are a lot of animal trials,
Bill's method which is called cycling.
It's the energy healing technique where
people hold their hands over a human
being or over an animal and they do
a mental process that is designed to
shift the energy of the disease and
Bill's work is unique because there are
now 13 randomized controlled trials that
various people have done of his method
on, usually on mice and the usual way
these experiments are done is that
the mice were injected with a
substance that causes them to develop
cancer and they develop these large
mammary cancers which eventually crush
the organs and they die in usually 15 to
20 days. The longest a mouse has ever
survived in these trials is 21 days.
And in Bill's research, in the
research of Bill's method, just a study
after, he finds that these mice heal.
These mice heal and not only do
they heal from those cancers, they did
live out the full lifespan of a mouse,
which is about two years, and they're
immune to cancer after that as well.
In one really cool trial I report in Mind to Matter,
they had Bill sending energy to a
group of mice at a distant location and
they were measuring the electromagnetism
in the room right below the
cage that held the mice.
And so, at random intervals
a buzzer was sound
in Bill's home a long way away, he would
then send energy to this cage of mice in
a room at a university, distantly,
and then there are other mice in other
cages in other parts of the university
but only one, which was in a room painted
green, that he was targeting.
So mice in the green room got energy from Bill, the
mice in the red and purple rooms,
different parts of the campus, didn't get
that and they had this magnetometer
underneath the cage and at the very
moments when there were those signals
for Bill to send energy to those mice,
the magnetometer fluctuated by about 25
percent so massive shifts in
electromagnetism, this is an energy field.
It supposed to be totally stable at any
geographical point on the Earth's
surface, and energy fluctuated hugely and
only at the very moment when Bill sent
energy to mice in the green room and the
magnetometers in the purple and red
rooms were unaffected.
So energy heals, there's so much evidence
for this that I really urge people to use
energy approaches, they're not invasive,
there are no bad side effects,
they don’t hurt your body, in fact in one
review I cover in the book in Mind to
Matter, I show that there are
175 studies published over
the last 50 years showing the beneficial
effects of various energy therapies on
our bodies and these 
effects Nare not small.
Stem cells regenerating, stem cells adhering to
diseased tissue and repairing it,
telomeres lengthening, enzymes that are
helpful to our metabolism--increasing
in amounts; stress hormones, like cortisol--
decreasing, immune factors like
immunoglobulins increasing, all of these
things happening on the basis of energy treatments.
So even though it's energy,
its producing massive shifts to the
physical material of our bodies.
When I began to look at the science of how our
consciousness affects the world around
us, I thought I would find a few
suggestive studies.
What I was surprised at was how many
things I found and what they show.
And so it turns out that there is
evidence, either subjective evidence or
really solid evidence, that our
consciousness, human consciousness
affects the four fundamental forces of
physics and those are electromagnetism,
gravity, the strong nuclear force that
holds the atom together, and also the
weak nuclear force which is measured
in the radioactive decay of
uranium, plutonium, americium, francium, all
of those elements, they give off
these particles and then degenerate
over the course of years.
That is the weak nuclear force, but there's evidence
that all four of these forces are
affected by human awareness and the
most interesting practical studies I
talk about in the book are those
conducted on water.
And so, water is a very simple molecule, it has one big
oxygen atom, two small hydrogen atoms
attached to it and the bonding angle
between those three atoms is 104.5
 degrees and that's
just a constant, it's been measured for
close to a century, we know the
angle at which those two hydrogens join
that big oxygen, is always 104.5 degrees.
That's just a fact, so one
of the most intriguing
studies was done looking at that bonding
angle after water had been blessed by a
Healing Touch practitioner.
So the practitioner held his hands over the
vial or glass of water, didn't actually touch
it but held his hands near it, had the
intention of healing flowing through his
hands and then the water
was measured again.
And that bonding angle between
those two hydrogens changed from 104.5
degrees to less than that. There was a
substantial change in the actual
molecular structure of water that was
blessed by a healer.
Then in another series of studies,
researchers took water
that had been blessed and used it to
water plants and they found that the
plants that had been watered with
blessed water, grew much faster, much stronger,
had a higher chlorophyll content than
those that were watered with control water.
And so it looks from these kinds of trials
that we are literally able to shift, purely
by intention, the molecules at least
of water around us.
Now, there's other research which I talk
about in the book showing that we can
affect DNA and this series of phases was
really intriguing because they had
people intend to change the
configuration of DNA and DNA of course
is a double helix, has certain degree of
twist, it looks like a ladder but a
twisted ladder and the amount of twist,
the degree of twist in a sample of DNA
can be measured using some elaborate
equipment, so researchers said to
these volunteers in the study they said,
ok, here's a beaker containing
human DNA and we want you to make that
DNA twist tighter and so these people
sat there in the room at the beaker thinking
of DNA, focused their attention on the DNA
to put the twist tighter, the scientists
measured the DNA after the attention,
nothing happened.
But then they had those volunteers enter
a deeply coherent state
so when you're meditating, when you're in
deep meditation, your heart rhythm
becomes coherent, your brain rhythm
becomes coherent and those entrain your whole body.
When those coherent people
projected their attention into the DNA
flask, the DNA did indeed twist tighter.
So then, the researchers (they) did a whole
series of these experiments and then said
ok, we'll leave you three vials of DNA.
So they're across the lab, you see there's a
middle one, there's a left hand one,
there's a right hand flask of DNA,
identical samples of DNA.
We want you to intend to twist the one, the DNA in
the middle flask tighter and leave the
flask on the right and the left untouched.
And again, when they weren't in
coherence then it happened, when they
were in coherence, they changed the
middle flask but not the two other flasks.
The researchers then said ok,
let's see if this is an effect, an
artifact of your own individual energy field,
let's move these things 50 miles away.
They then put the three beakers 50
miles away, they then said okay, now we
want you to change the twist at only the
right-hand one, and not the other two
and the meditators were able to do that.
So here we have human attention
literally affecting the conformation of
the DNA molecule and if that isn't
exciting, think that your thoughts,
your consciousness, your degree of coherence
is literally shifting molecules,
distantly away from your body in the
next group, 50 miles away, in the case of
one Chi master
1,200 kilometers away, the effect was
still seen so this is really amazing
that science is now giving us the tools
to show these effects and we're just at
the dawn, of being able to use them
therapeutically and for human good.

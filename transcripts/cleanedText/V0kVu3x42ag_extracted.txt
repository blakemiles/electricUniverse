Well, about a week or so ago at a NASA press
conference, the investigators who are in
in charge of the Parker Solar Probe
described their new findings from the
first flybys of that probe. Now as far as I have
been able to find out, the probe has made about
three closer and closer passages to the
Sun and it will continue to do that for
several years and hopefully, if it doesn't 
burn up, it'll continue to do that.
But in any event, the NASA press
conference included the statement,
which is sort of typical of them, quote,
“This is the first time we've been
able to fly a spacecraft into the atmosphere
of a star.” I said that last time too and I
commented on that kind of statement,
it all depends on what you call the
atmosphere of a star. What is the Sun's atmosphere.
Well, the Sun's local plasma extends out to
the end of the heliosphere which
ends in what we call the heliopause,
and that's several times the distance out of 
Pluto. So, by definition, any probe or satellite
that gets out of Earth's atmosphere
is in the Sun's atmosphere, if you
realize the Sun's atmosphere goes out that 
far. But actually the proper question is how
close to the Sun's photospheric surface
will the Parker probe get? Will it get
into the Sun's corona? Will it get below the corona?
No, certainly not. It will not get below the
corona. Nothing in the foreseeable future will
ever get through that kind of temperature. But
NASA says that the probe will in 2025
get within a distance of four million
miles. Okay, I think as I said last time,
that four million miles is about nine
solar radii. That is, if you take a picture
of the Sun during the full solar eclipse and
see the corona there, if you look and scale the
distance let's say from the center of the Sun to the
edge of the black dot, the shadow
of the moon in front of the Sun, that's
of course the solar radius. And so, if you 
measure out 10 times that distance,that's
where ‘closest approach’ of the Parker probe
will get. It used to be said that the farthest out
that the corona extends is about five solar 
radii. So I said last time, and I still think it,
that the Parker probe was not going
to get even close to the outermost
regions of the corona. But recently 
NASA says no, no, the corona
extends out to something like five
million miles: 12 solar radii. And so,
depending on, I guess, the feelings of the
Sun at the moment, how far it extends its
corona, it may touch the outer reaches of 
the corona. But they're assuming it's going to.
The press release goes on to say that
the present data that they're getting
back quote, “...hints at the likely
birthplace of dynamic solar winds, which
bathe our entire solar system in energy.” And that's
certainly true. They continue to say, “It describes
startling reversals (that is to say
switchbacks) in the Sun's magnetic fields.
It detects dust in the solar wind
and it shows that solar winds spin.”
And they say of course in their airy
frivolous language, “...it spins like
children riding on a playground carousel.”
Anyway, if you can get through that,
whenever you hear about things spinning,
just quietly think about the fact that
force-free currents are collections of
counter-rotating spinning magnetic field
and current pathways. I submit 
and I have submitted for a long
while, that they're about the only natural
phenomena that do consist of concentric
counter-rotating cylinders, that do
indeed spin, or at least a twist. In one of
our last Space News segments, we discussed
reports that the Voyager probes have observed
unexpected rotation of the magnetic
field through which it is traveling. That
is the Voyagers, they're out at the heliopause
and my comment at that time says that wow,
that's fantastic because that would
fit like a hand into a glove with our
Juergens’ Electric Sun model. And that
would say that, yes they have left the
heliosphere out through the heliopause, but it still
hasn't left the giant Birkeland current that feeds
this whole solar system and feeds our
Sun, still seeing the rotating magnetic
fields within that Birkeland current.
To get back to the present though, and
the present report, I feel it's very
likely that the pointed tops of the
so-called coronal caps, regions where
the arrays of plasma that are leaving up
through the corona, instead of diverging
from a central point, i.e. the Sun,
after they leave, they seem to at
certain places at least, come back
together again and form a triangular or at least a
conical kind of a cap. But anyway, a long time EU
member, a good friend of ours, Chris Reeve
apparently asked the question, isn't it
possible that these switchbacks are
simply the probe moving through the
counter-flowing Birkeland current cylinders of
each filament? And when I saw that, I said hurrah,
thank you Chris. Yes, it absolutely is, of course, 
yes. It's quite likely that the coronal caps,
those pointed hat shapes we observe 
in the outer regions of the corona, are
exactly where Birkeland currents form.
Those Birkeland currents extend out to
places like the north poles of the planets.
So, Birkeland currents would explain the
spinning and the reversal of direction of
magnetic fields that the Parker Solar Probe
observes and that the investigators
have found so typically surprising.
Why are there all sorts of different
elements? You know manganese, calcium, iron
sulfur, oxygen you name it, all the 
other elements, in addition to the
hydrogen and helium that their model
says has to be there. But their model
of nuclear fusion does not produce
manganese, calcium, oxygen, sulfur and all
the raft of other elements.
And so, where does it come from?
In deeper outer cosmic space there are
novae explosions. Suns explode and they
pepper the universe with
(and Scott adds parenthetically, fairy
dust) that sprinkles throughout the
galaxies and intergalactic space
and that's how all these other kinds of elements
that the Sun doesn't generate, that's how
they get on the Sun. It's like a snow
storm and they come in from
deeper outer space. Now, if you believe
that, I got a bridge that connects Manhattan
and Brooklyn that I would be very willing 
to sell you. Alfven and all the earlier
plasma physicists were well aware that most
plasmas are what are called dusty plasmas.
And that means that they contain neutrals.
A fully ionized plasma is very rare.
They say that the outer regions of the
coronas of our Sun and probably other stars,
are fully ionized plasma. But 99% of 
most plasmas are not fully ionized.
In fact, Hannes Alfven was quoted as saying if the
plasma was more than ten percent ionized it could
be considered a fully ionized plasma,
because the forces between the ions and
electrons that were there,
are so much stronger than the
gravitation between the neutrals, that the neutrals
and the gravitational effects just don't count.
So, that's a long-winded way of saying,
sure, plasmas are dusty, that's where the
dust comes from. It comes from within the Sun.
As the ions and the electrons come blasting
out of the Sun, they bring neutrals with them
and that's where it came from. I don't think
you have to depend on asteroids
melting near the Sun to explain that.
In describing the switchbacks, or magnetic 
reversals, the Parker Probe is seeing,
the press release stated, quote
”These reversals happen at a high rate of
occurrence. That high rate is surprising. In fact
the nature of these structures remains unknown.”
Well, we can help them with that, I think.
But anyway, we know that the Parker Probe
is traveling at a speed of approximately
430,000 miles an hour. Now, that's fast.
In fact it's 190 kilometers per second.
And so in in a couple of minutes the
probe travels about 15,000 kilometers.
That distance could very well be the
thickness of one of the layers in the
Birkeland current which would be the
cause of those magnetic reversals
as the probe goes through the
Birkeland current. The press release also
announced that close to the, Sun the
solar wind seems to get sped up by powerful
”rogue waves” quote, unquote, that move
through the magnetic field. The quote 
from the press release states quote,
”We'd suddenly see a spike in the flow
where in just a couple of seconds the
solar wind would start flowing at 300,000
miles an hour faster. That's about
134 kilometers per second increase in the
speed of the solar wind that they're observing.
And if the velocity of the wind is about
400 kilometers a second, the press release
said they were doubling the speed -
it's not quite doubling. Also, they
said there are jets of plasma in 
these streamers. Well, I maintain the
increases in the solar wind speed may
indeed be caused by double layers.
Now in the in the past our viewers have seen
this image that I've included here, of what a
double layer looks like. So just to 
refresh for the viewer. There are three
plots there. The top graph is the voltage
that we would measure as a function of
radius distance out from the Sun. So you
can see that the voltage is dropping
rather precipitously from point c to d, to e.
And that results in the middle plot
which is the electric field that is
produced by that sharp drop in voltage.
Now there's nothing mysterious about
that electric field. It's just the force
on a positive ion and if the electric field
is positive, as you see it there it is,
that means that the force on that
positive ion is outward in the positive
direction. Outward from the Sun is the
positive direction. So, the bottom plot
there is the plot of the charge distribution
that would be there to cause what those other
two plots look like. That's from
Maxwell's equations, but
if we look at the charge distribution there,
you can see that there are two spherical shells.
One of positive ions and then
right on top of that a shell of
negative charges, mostly probably electrons,
and that's why it's called a double layer.
The plus and the minus layer are right there
together. And there are two different spherical
shells in that double layer: the inner half
is positive and the outer half is negative,
and in between, in the center of that double
layer is an extremely strong electric field.
Now that electric field, if it's strong
enough, can actually rip apart any charged
intruder into the double layer. So the
SAFIRE experiment that everybody has
been hearing about and that's worked out so
well for us, that experiment produced an image
of a whole series of these double layers
surrounding the anode, the Sun.
And the most powerful one is right there
above, or actually on the surface of the anode.
And that's completely consistent with
Juergen's Electric Sun model, because
that's the photosphere. That's 
where the sunspots all happen and
in that double layer there's where all sorts
of things occur. And then, as you go out from
that layer, outward from the Sun, the 
double layers get dimmer and weaker.
You can see them finally disappear, off in 
the distance. We don't see any of those
double layers around the Sun with
our eyes or with telescopes now,
simply because if they're there, they're 
in the dark mode of plasma operation.
They're in the same mode of plasma operation that
surrounds the north pole of the Earth, and it's the
dark mode, we don't see that either unless
of course there's an aurora at which time
the plasma jumps into the glow mode
as it did in that photograph that
Monty (Childs) so kindly sent us.
But normally it's not visible,
it's a dark mode plasma and so are
those double layers around the Sun.
Also, things are happening very
quickly these days. In a new paper
entitled, “Probing the energetic particle
environment near the Sun,” the authors
seem to acknowledge that magnetic
reconnection can't actually explain some
of the effects they're observing. I was 
waiting, predicting that we would hear about
magnetic reconnection, but I'm very pleased that
they have essentially written that off, at least in
this paper. They said instead, “We find a
variety of energetic particle events accelerated
both locally and remotely, including 
by co-rotating interaction regions,
and impulsive events driven by acceleration near
the Sun and an event related to a coronal mass
ejection.” Unquote. So they use the word
co-rotating and I wonder if by using the word
co-rotating did they actually mean counter 
rotating? Nothing more was said and so we'll have
to wait to see what they have 
discovered. But they've discovered,
everything that they have discovered is
certainly explainable by Birkeland currents.
Also, incidentally, regarding the question
of how all those other elements get onto
the face of the Sun, that we discussed earlier,
one of the most important results of the
SAFIRE team, was their discovery 
that in their electrical plasma discharge
(and remember that was in a hydrogen
atmosphere just like the Sun is hydrogen),
the transmutation of elements occurs.
That's the kind of process that the old
prehistoric alchemists were looking for.
They wanted to change lead into gold or
something like that. Well, actually
SAFIRE has done it, in microscopic
amounts, but they've done it. So that in a plasma
discharge, hydrogen apparently can give birth to a
long list of other elements. Not just one, that 
were not there before the discharge started.
So that may well be how those other elements got
onto the Sun and get out of the Sun, as we speak.
And the point is fairy dust has nothing to do with it.

Welcome to Space News from

The following presentation is an
adaptation of the Mel Acheson picture
of the day article Another Fogged Image
of Stephan's Quintet.
The link to the article may be
found in the description
box of this video.
This image of Stephan's Quintet is
befogged with the same obsolete
commentary as previous images:
the foreground galaxy, collisions,
shock waves, and heat.
The foreground galaxy, on the
bottom-left, is believed to be in the
foreground solely because of the
consensus belief that redshift is a
measure of distance: the foreground
galaxy has a redshift of z=0.0026;
the others range
from z=0.019
to z=0.0225.
The consensual conclusion is that the
foreground galaxy is 250 million light-
years closer than the others.
This belief in redshift as a
cosmic meterstick has
been disproved since the 1960s,
but facts seldom affect
institutionalized belief systems.
Unremarked is the fact that the
differences in redshift to the
background galaxies place them, under
consensus belief, farther from each other
than the foreground galaxy
is from the Milky Way.
Does that make the foreground
galaxy a member of our Local Group?
Apparently, the illusion of
foreshortening with distance works on
beliefs as well.
Another fact that's consistently
overlooked is that the
bright ionized hydrogen regions in the
background galaxies are about the same
as those in the foreground galaxy.
Since it's also consensually believed that
bright ionized hydrogen regions tend to
be of similar size, the consensus has
simply ignored the fact.
Perhaps the dark matter in the
foreground galaxy is positioned exactly
right to magnify the bright ionized
hydrogen regions beyond through
gravitational lensing.
The long tails on both the foreground
galaxy and the one
immediately above it are mentioned and
then dismissed as due to "complex
interactions in the past."
The interactions must have been complex in
the extreme to have affected the
foreground galaxy.
A characteristic of consensus
astronomy is a flight into
tunnel vision: attention is narrowed to
single objects or even to parts of
objects and larger connections
are disregarded.
So with the long tails.
On deep images, both tails trail off, in
parallel, far toward a large active
galaxy, NGC 7331.
Radio observations reveal a
bridge of radiation that
follows the path of the tails and connects
Stephan's Quintet with the active galaxy.
The bridge continues on
the opposite side of NGC 7331 to a
cluster of quasars, which coincidentally
have similar redshifts to the high-z
members of the Quintet.
This is obviously another instance
of paired ejection from an active galaxy.
Of course, what's
obvious to one eye is not to another
because eyes tend to
see what they believe.
It's no shock that Consensus eyes
are blind to the facts of ejection pairs.
Another consensual blind spot
covers a high-z quasar that lies in
front of the upper-left galaxy.
According to its redshift, the quasar should be
billions of light years behind the
galaxy and therefore as
invisible as dark matter.
The galaxy is full of dust,
completely opaque, and displays an
energized region leading
right up to the quasar.
When scanning this galaxy,
consensus astronomers blink in unison.
The ridge of X-ray radiation and the
core of Stephan's quintet is
consensually ascribed to gas heated by
shockwaves from colliding galaxies.
At 70 million Kelvin,
the heating is truly shocking.
Overlooked is the fact that
long before such a
temperature is reached,
the gas has been
fully ionized into a plasma in which
electrical and magnetic forces dominate.
The 70 million figure is an artifact of
runaway extrapolation from a theory about solids.
In reality, the X-rays are
synchrotron radiation from high-speed
electrons that is an electric current
spiraling in a magnetic field.
Since temperature is based on random motions
and the electrons are aligned in the
magnetic field, the concept of
temperature is not even relevant.
A final observation that appears not to have
been mentioned before concerns this X-ray ridge.
Stephan's quintet is
considered to be a "compact cluster,"
of which several thousand are known.
George Abel catalogued many of them
before X-ray observations were possible.
A review of several of them shows similar
ridges of X-ray radiation across their cores.
Others show simply a spot.
If these compact clusters are fragmenting
quasars on their way to
becoming companion galaxies around the
parent active galaxy from which they
were ejected, the X-rays delineate the central
pinch in the parents' ejection circuit.
Ridges of radiation show up in
clusters whose axis is inclined to our
line of sight; the spots result from our
"looking down the barrel of the discharge."

On this series, a clear picture of
cosmic scale phenomena has emerged.
Networks of filaments
pervade space
and are closely linked to the formation
and evolution of stars and galaxies.
The Electric Universe and Plasma
Cosmology have always predicted
that these filaments are in fact
electrical Birkeland currents
which light the stars and connect celestial
bodies across vast cosmic distances.
Recently, two separate
teams of scientists,
both of whom were attempting to resolve
the so-called missing baryon problem,
have published papers identifying
vast intergalactic plasma filaments.
In this episode, our
guest Eugene Bagashov
analyzes the significance of
these independent findings.
Eugene Bagashov: I would like to talk
about two recently published papers
discussing the large scale
properties of cosmic plasma.
What is interesting in this case is
that both teams worked independently
but ended up using the same
methods and instruments.
Somewhat encouraging is the fact that
their conclusions are also very similar
meaning that at least the
technique is reproducible
and, as far as the
assumptions are correct,
there have been no mistakes
made in the process.
Now that I've mentioned it,
I personally have serious doubts
about the assumptions themselves,
so let us take a closer look at the
picture presented by this research
and see if we could make some
alternative conclusions.
The research addresses one of the key
problems of observations of cosmic processes,
the so-called missing
baryon problem.
It has been known for some time that if
one considers the Big Bang cosmology,
with its model for
primordial nucleosynthesis,
and at the same time look at the properties
of the so-called Cosmic Microwave Background,
one would get a figure for the matter
content in the observable universe
that is at least 30% too high
with respect to the observations
that is, if we directly sum up
all the known mass content.
I should note that this is not to be
confused with dark matter problem
that we've discussed in detail in
some of the previous episodes.
Dark matter was invented to solve
the smaller scale problems
with incorrect description
of galactic rotation curves
which roughly corresponds to spatial
scales of 100,000 light years or so
whereas in the case of missing baryons
we're talking about intergalactic scales
that are hundreds to
thousands of times bigger.
So in these two papers the researchers have
tried to implement a new method of detection
that potentially could solve
the missing baryon problem
capturing the yet unobserved
fraction of matter
and thus reconciling the observations
with Big Bang hypothesis
and hypothetical Cosmic
Microwave Background.
It is supposed in their work that one
might observe the missing matter
by looking for its emissions in consequence
of the so-called Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect.
The effect is quite simple.
Plainly put, when a low-energy photon
encounters a high-energy charged particles,
such as electron, it might interact
with it and become more energetic.
It is the so-called Inverse
Compton scattering.
So it is supposed that photons of the
hypothesized Cosmic Microwave Background
could also be scattered in such a way
by the hot intergalactic plasma,
thus increasing in energy and we might
detect this more energetic signal
on top of the supposed
background radiation.
Both research teams have
devoted their efforts
to looking for the electromagnetic
signal of such sort.
They've been looking at the
data from Planck satellite
in the frequency range from 30 to 857 gigahertz,
that is microwave to far infrared range,
for which the Planck research team have
released the Compton scattering maps.
They've compared these maps with the
data from Sloan Digital Sky Survey
to identify the actual sources of
the signals received by Planck.
The main attention was focused on
the regions in-between galaxies
where the contamination of the signal
by the known sources, such as stars,
is supposed to be minimal.
The total sample used in the research
included over a million of pairs of galaxies
with average separation of
about 30 million light-years.
So what they found was a
quite noticeable signal
coming from the regions
in-between galaxies.
The authors conclude that these galaxies
must be connected by the plasma filaments
that are supposedly providing additional energy
to the Cosmic Microwave Background photons,
so in these areas we see a
stronger signal from it.
So the minimalistic conclusion that
one might make from this research
is that it confirms the existence
of intergalactic plasma filaments
which is of course no surprise from
the Electric Universe perspective.
The authors claim that the supposed
density of those filaments
is enough to solve the missing baryon problem
in the standard cosmological scenario.
Be that as it may, as
I've noted before,
for our purposes it might be productive to
analyze the assumptions that have been made
and see if their revision might
provide additional insights.
In order to do that, I would like to
remember Pierre Marie Robitaille's work
on Cosmic Microwave Background.
In short, his independent
research shows that the signal
that is considered to be a
Cosmic Microwave Background,
might actually be generated
by the Earth's oceans.
These oceanic emissions are then
scattered by the Earth's atmosphere
and are thus apparently
coming from all directions.
The microwave background was also observed
from low Earth orbit by COBE mission
but, as Robitaille has shown, the
signals received in this case
resemble the ones that
will be coming from Earth
and undergoing diffraction on
the edges of the horn-antennas.
One has to remember that even at
about 900 kilometers altitude,
where the COBE satellite
was positioned,
the Earth still blocks more than the
quarter of the whole celestial sphere.
Planck satellite was positioned
much farther than that,
about 1.5 million kilometres from
Earth, at the Lagrange L2 point.
An independent analysis shows that it should
detect virtually no microwaves from Earth,
so there should be no
Cosmic Microwave Background
detected by Planck in
Robitaille's theory.
Contrary to that, the research
team working on the Planck mission
have claimed to have detected the
microwave background signal.
But Robitaille's analysis of
the Planck's instrument layout
seemed to indicate that its
readings have been misinterpreted
because of the flaws in the design of the
reference loads onboard the satellite.
These loads were supposed to be giving off
thermal radiation at about 4 Kelvin temperature
but because of the almost
perfect heat conduction,
allowed by the design
of the instrument,
the favorable way of transmitting heat
and achieving thermal equilibrium
was through conduction,
not radiation,
making the laws of thermal radiation
inapplicable in this case.
So according to Robitaille,
Planck satellite reference loads
were giving off near-zero
thermal radiative signal
and as the instrument was
matching this near-zero signal
to the signal received by the
antenna pointed into space,
which also yielded
near-zero reading,
the detector showed a good match
and a strong output signal.
I should note that there
was another mission
that supposedly observed Cosmic
Microwave Background far from Earth.
It was a Soviet experiment RELIKT-1
on board of the Prognoz 9 spacecraft.
It had an apogee of about
700,000 kilometers
from where it made observations
of the background radiation
as well as some
other measurements.
It would be interesting to hear Dr.
Robitaille's comment on that.
Anyway, if Robitaille's
theory is correct,
then of course Big Bang Theory
loses one of its main arguments.
Well, Big Bang contradicts
all the known physics laws,
namely the conservation laws and the
causality, so it's not that big of a loss.
But let us look at the findings outlined
before, to see what the complete absence
or at least the significant weakness of
the Microwave Background would mean.
First of all, the Compton scattering
maps, used in aforementioned research,
come from the combination of data
from both the high frequency
and low frequency instruments
of the Planck satellite,
and it was the low
frequency instrument
that supposedly detected the
background signal in the first place.
Now, let us imagine that we subtract this low
frequency background signal from the map since,
according to Robitaille's
theory, it is false.
This would leave us a lower
near-zero background
but the higher frequency part characteristic of
the detected filaments would remain in place
and become even stronger in comparison
to the now lower baseline signal.
It's as if one would look at
Hawaiian mountain Mauna Kea
after lowering the water line
to the ocean floor level.
The mountain would actually stand
higher than the Mount Everest.
Though if it is partly hidden by the so-to-speak
background of the surrounding water,
it would appear to be much
less prominent as it does now.
So if Robitaille is correct,
their observations seem to show
that the detected filaments
are actually brighter
than what would be
expected otherwise.
Now the question arises about the
nature of the observed emissions.
They might indeed be caused by
the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect
but now the initial
low-energy photons
would not come from a hypothetical
remnant of the Big Bang
but rather be produced
by real objects
such as dust, stars, galaxies
and other plasma structures
emitting electromagnetic waves
over the whole spectral range.
These emissions might not
bear the thermal spectrum
that is expected for the Cosmic Microwave
Background in the Big Bang scenario.
Moreover, if these background
emissions would, on average,
yield a lower photonic
flux in the given range,
then the model used
by the authors
would underestimate the density of
the filaments and their temperature.
There are other
possibilities, of course.
The registered photons might not
result from some scattering process
but actually be emitted by these
plasma filaments themselves.
In fact, in this case they could be subject
to Regular, not Inverse, Compton effect
and initially have a higher energy
than that detected by Planck.
They might give off some
portion of their energy
to the charged particles in the filaments
and the colder surrounding plasma.
This, of course, also leads to the
conclusion that the detected filaments
could be more dense and more energetic than
what follows from the Big Bang interpretation.
Then there is also a scenario in which
these photons might be the result
of the intergalactic currents that shape
the filaments in the first place.
The energy range of photons,
that Planck was able to detect,
corresponds to one
milli-electron volts or so.
So any of those photons could
be emitted by an electron
that was accelerated by one
milli-volt of potential difference
and here we assume that it has lost all
of its energy to the outcoming photon.
But in reality, this emission might represent
only a tiny fraction of the electron energy.
We don't really
know any of that,
and depending on the actual nature of the
processes that lead to this emission,
it might have very different
directional distribution.
The filaments described
in the mentioned research
are observed in the direction
perpendicular to the line of sight.
Maybe when observed head-on, looking into
the filament like into a barrel of a gun,
one would get completely
different readings etc.
Now the energy gained from
the electric potential
would also depend on the length
of the acceleration path.
So if one underestimates
the filament density
and thus overestimates
the acceleration length,
one would come with a smaller overall
potential difference measure than otherwise.
So, to conclude my notes on this subject,
I would like to repeat two key points;
Firstly, under any
possible scenario,
this research acknowledges the existence
of intergalactic plasma filaments
that make up a significant portion
of the matter in the universe.
And secondly, depending
on the used assumptions,
one might get dramatically different picture
of the parameters of those filaments
and draw different conclusions about the
processes that take place in these regions.
Outside the Big Bang framework, the filaments
might demonstrate higher temperatures,
higher plasma densities and significant
electric current and potential values.

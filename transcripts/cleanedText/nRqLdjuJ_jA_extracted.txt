In a recent video, I've discussed how stars
can become stressed, expelling vast amounts
of material outwards. In other scenarios
the stars are thought to explode, causing
the entire system to malfunction,
creating repeating discharges that
travel across the plasma which acts like a
transmission line. There are a number of
different waysthat stars are thought to explode, 
or nova. And although mainstream has an idea
of how these scenarios can occur, there
seem to be many exceptions that break these.
So, let's explore some of these strange explosions.
Strange Novas. A nova is a sudden explosion
of bright light from a two-star system. The main-
stream concept is that these are created in a binary
system, where one star is a white dwarf
which pulls material from a companion
star. Over time, the white dwarf draws
enough material which heats up and
causes an uncontrolled reaction that
releases a burst of energy. This in turn
shoots matter away at high speed.
These events are therefore long-lived and
usually fade over a couple of weeks or longer.
On the 12th of June 2021, the Nova V 1674
Herculis underwent what appeared like
a nova event with a sudden brightening
which made it visible to the naked eye.
By the next day it had already faded.
When astronomers studied the emissions,
they discovered that it seemed to be pulsing.
Every 501 seconds, there was a sudden
change, or pulse in the light and X-rays.
Even after the light faded this 501-
second wobble was still present.
When they went back and studied the
emissions just prior to nova, they
discovered that this wobble was present
even before the outburst and remained
through the brightening event and afterwards.
Supernovae are more energetic and leave
little or nothing behind, unlike a Nova.
Ten years ago, supernova SN 2012Z was
spotted in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 1309.
The event should have been the final
swan song of the star. The galaxy has
been observed for a long period of time,
so it was possible to use this to work
out exactly which star went “bang” by
looking for the now empty space. They
were expecting to see that the star was
either completely gone, or maybe that it
should still be there, meaning that the
star that they observed was not the one
that blew up. What they discovered was
something that they did not expect to
find. The star had survived, but it had
somehow become brighter. This was not the
first time that they had observed a star
surviving a supernova and was another
star which would be added to the growing
pile of stars that defied the supernova.
Even when they die, some seem to defy
even this process. In a recent analysis,
astronomers used the data from the Hubble
telescope to document the demise of a 
giant star 35 million light years from Earth.
These seem to show something very
unexpected: the cool, yellow star had no
hydrogen outer layer. In theory, if a star
explodes without hydrogen, it should be
extremely blue, meaning it is really very 
hot. It should not be possible for a star to
be this cool without having hydrogen in
the outer layer. The scientists examined
every single mainstream model, and they
all required the star to have hydrogen
which they knew from the supernova it didn't have.
When they looked back to the images before
the supernova, they saw a very normal
hydrogen-free star, but the star did not
match with the type of supernova they observed.
They suggest that maybe the star shed its
hydrogen shell years prior to the event, but it 
remains a mystery. In theory these large supernova
explosions should be final. The energies
involved should rip the star apart, but
even here, scientists have discovered a
rather remarkable star that seems to be
able to repeatedly supernova.
In 2014, scientists captured a fading
supernova near the constellation of 
Ursa Major. At first it looked like every
other supernova. Over half a billion
light years away in a galaxy so far, it's
little more than a smudge, a star
exploded. Not just once, but over five
times over the course of two years. In
the process, it ejected a vast amount of
material equal to 50 Jupiters and
emitted more energy than 10 quintillion
(that's 10 to the power of 18) suns.
Five months later, when they went back to
examine the data, someone spotted
something strange. When they looked at a
plot of the emissions over the last 137 days,
it appeared like the explosion was getting brighter.
So they decided to look at the spectrum
of light from the star. This seemed to
indicate that the nova was only 30 days
old, and yet they had concrete proof that
it had in fact been going on for months.
They continued to study it and followed
the supernova as it brightened,
then faded, then brightened again.
It hit five peaks of brightness before
finally dwindling out in the summer of
2016. At 600 days old, it was already the
longest-lived supernova ever observed.
They now turned to the historical
archives and found that the same portion
of sky had been observed in 1954 and
1993. In 1993 no supernova was evident,
but in the 1954 image there was a
noticeable bright spot in the galaxy.
As the galaxy is far away, it is not
possible to make out individual stars.
So,there is a small possibility that the
1954 explosion is caused by another star.
No mainstream model of stellar evolution
can fully explain these observations. The
energy released in the 2014 explosion
is greater than their models predict. An
analysis of the light coming from the
explosion indicated that its chemical
composition is different from
what astronomers would expect.
These findings question how much mainstream
astronomers really know about supernovae.
Maybe it's time for a new model.
Thank you.

Not so long ago, the whole of North
America across to Siberia and Europe,
were shattered and destroyed in nights of 
hell. In a series of deadly catastrophic
events, mammoths together with the
Clovis Indian people were wiped out.
These memories are still retained in cloudy mythology.
What agent of destruction rendered them
extinct? Did it happen just once, or was it a series
of events that determine these mass extinctions?
Siberia, Alaska, Malta. Three mass-slaughter 
sites. Sites littered with carcasses
and skeletons. Some are petrified as rocks,
others invaded and buried in limestone.
Some are entombed in bitumen, still 
more buried in ice and peat bogs.
Their instantaneous end was horrific.
Some are impeccably preserved, but the
vast bulk are shattered and dismembered by
forces so potent, they are not evident today.
We are naive to these mysterious powers.
The last mass extinction was not so long ago.
Perhaps only three and a half thousand years
ago and it's etched in mankind's mythology.
Let's chase this mystery. There are numerous sites
all over the world that illustrate the spectrum of
mass destruction. Larry Agenbroad's
charts pinpoint the megafauna sites
right across North America. Then spreading right
through to Europe, Russia and even into Japan.
Here at the La Brea tarpits in Los
Angeles. You can see the gases bubbling
up through the water and bitumen. Like much of
Los Angeles, it is rich in petroleum products.
This bituminized area stretches extensively
and conceals the bones of not only mammoths,
but saber-toothed tigers, short-
nosed bears, camels, horses
and all extinct. But not only large animals,
mice, birds, flora and insects, all preserved
within the tar to a depth of 60 feet.
The most detailed site is in South
Dakota where Dr. Larry Agenbroad
invited us over to check his
excavation of a limestone bolus on a hilltop.
The site is around 100 feet by 120 feet
across and some 70 feet deep, and 
contains a wide variety of extinct
animals in this calcium bolus, packed with 
bones. The bodies have lost most of their
collagen and are part of a huge calcium
deposit that is micro-layered to its bottom.
Species include yesterday's camel, short-
faced bear, coyote, antelope and
altogether some 84 species, most 
of which are primitive micro-fauna.
Carbon dating of the site places it 
at around the 26,000-year mark.
I was also intrigued by the minute
layering of the calcium in the sinkhole
as it progressed through the bottom of the hole.
These layers actually went through the bodies,
so could not be caused by slow deposition.
Layering however, can be caused by
electrical discharge. Were these forces
involved in the destruction at this site?
Larry's explanation of the death of all these
species revolved around drowning in this
sinkhole as they fed around its edges. This is
similar to the explanation of the La Brea tar pits.
However, mythology does not support this theory.
We already discussed with Adrienne Mayor
The Mythology of the First American people.
She found it amazing the part that the cosmic
thunderbolt played in the destruction of
the megafauna. According to legend
the creator killed the giants with a cosmic
thunderbolt. She emphasizes this was not the ordinary
lightning, but a world shattering event.
The Lakota nation had sent
hunting tribes down here for many, many years.
And they had a different interpretation
on what had caused the fossil-
izations of these great beasts.
Here is an excerpt from the Lakota mythology.
”The creator sang the song of destruction
and sent down fierce Thunderbirds to wage a great
battle against the other humans and the giant animals.
They fought for a very long time because the
evil humans and animals had become very powerful.
And neither could gain an advantage.
Finally at the height of the battle, the
Thunderbirds sent down their most
powerful thunderbolts, all at once.”
”The fiery blast shook the entire world,
toppling mountain ranges and setting
forests and prairies ablaze. The 
flames leapt up to the sky in all
directions, sparing only a few people
at the highest peaks. It was so hot
that the world's lakes boiled up 
and dried before their eyes.”
”Even the rocks burned red hot and the giant
animals and people burned up where they stood.
A great flood followed and when
the survivors went out they found
bleached bones of the giant animals
in mud and rock all over the world.”
What were these cosmic thunderbolts?
A revolution occurred when plasma physicist
Anthony Peratt discovered a relation-
ship between rock art petroglyphs and
electromagnetic plasma instabilities. These 
rock art figures and geometric scribblings
mimicked the images produced
in government laboratories,
whilst the mythology of thunder-
bolts such as Zeus's weapons
reflected these very same formations. These were
mythologically tied to many destructive episodes.
Not only lightning, but earthquakes and other natural
disasters such as comets, creation myths, and plagues.
I strongly suspect that massive discharges
from Peratt’s plasma instabilities hold
the key, not only to mass extinctions, but 
even species changes after such an event.
I want to discuss the ramifications of
the mass extinction of the megafauna
and the mythological evidence with physicist
Wal Thornhill. As an advocate of the Electrical
Universe, he is adamant the plasma
instabilities, whatever their origin, were
the fundamental cause of these massive upheavals.
I met with him in the grounds of the Australian
National University some time
ago to discuss the evidence.
(Wal) Once you look at it from a
forensic point of view of, for instance,
even going back pre-history, you look at
petroglyphs, the carvings on rocks, the
formations that we see and we think are
strange looking stick figures, or maybe aliens,
are actually all forms of plasma
discharge instabilities. And these are
the instabilities we see in laboratories
in plasma tubes. That's right and these
are the sorts of things that the ancients
drew and sculpted when they talked about
Jupiter's thunderbolt. And these 
are actually cut in what and I
might add painted by anything from the
Australian aboriginals to the South American,
North American, all around the world.
And this comes down to fine details
like the Australian aborigines
have the lightning brothers,
where you have a figure with their arms out
raised like this and their legs spread and
they've got the lightning coming
from the knees and the elbows.
And this is exactly where you'll get the 
discharges from, a sharp curve in a
plasma discharge. And of course,
this is backed up by mythology. I'll
be interviewing Adrienne Mayor who's an
expert on let's say early American fossils and
one of the claims of these let's say early
Americans, was the lightning bolts, these things
we're talking about now, it actually destroyed
the megafauna or mammoths, dinosaurs.
And not so long ago, I might add.
Well, particularly in the case of the
dinosaurs, you need far more than just
a simple impact. It requires a global
change in the Earth's gravity and this comes
back to what is gravity? It really isn't
understood. All we've got is an equation which
describes it, and it includes a so-called physical
constant, the universal gravitational constant
which is the most inconstant thing in any textbook.
Every time they measure it, it's different
and it's got people scratching their heads.
But once you understand that gravity itself is
a very weak electrical force between all matter,
then it all becomes clear. Because if you change
the charge with one of these cosmic thunderbolts
on the earth or another body, the first 
thing that changes is the gravity. Right,
and so what some of the effects, so let's
say we're getting a discharge, we could
get a number of things. I mean for instance
we're talking about maybe a localized
reversal of the magnetic field, we can get
according to let's say yourself and Dave Talbott,
we can get electrical geological
etching of the landscape, such as
carving out river valleys and building of mountains,
and flattening of mountains. For instance, some
of the old literature talks about in
these catastrophic events, the land,
the hills skip like lambs. Yes, I like that.
Literally. Yes, and unfortunately everyone
misinterpreted it as metaphor. Well there's 
so much that seeming metaphor which they
certainly weren't saying it was
metaphorically as they saw it. Well the
very fact that all of these oral
traditions and religious texts that
come down to us over thousands of years,
these were considered to be the most
important message that the ancients
could pass to their descendants.
And what do we do? We misinterpret 
them. Yeah and so much of this stuff,
you can see they were living in fear.
I bring up one of the topics. They
used to give human sacrifices to try and control
the planet. Absolutely. It's very hard actually to
even imagine what they were experiencing.
And this is the problem of course, and this is why
we misinterpret these things. It's because it's
beyond our imagination to have a sky that's
riddled with colossal lightning bolts,
millions or billions of times more powerful than
anything we witness today, with puny lightning 
sparks. And also, to consider that they
were observing planetary objects in
the sky up close and personal. I mean,
you can understand why people hid
in caves from the sight of the Lord.
I wanted to talk to Rick Firestone from
Berkeley National Laboratories.
He is a nuclear physicist of the first
rank, but he also has an impeccable
belief in the validity of mythology and
he matches it with his scientific studies.
Rick wrote the table of isotopes which is used
by scientific scholars throughout the world.
This is the result of many years of being in
charge of Berkeley's revolutionary cyclotron.
Remarkable is the application of both mythology
and nuclear physics in his groundbreaking book,
The Cycle of Cosmic Catastrophes,
in which he combines both modalities to
unearth the causes of mass destruction.
Rick's interest in archaeology began
when he was sent samples from the
ancient Ganey Clovis people's site,
which was associated with mammoth 
remains. This location showed radioactivity.
The clovis people's use of stone
manufactured spearheads revealed tracks
of what he believed were cosmic rays, which
seemed to indicate a cosmic cause of their demise.
He replicated these cosmic ray tracks in
the very synchrotron laboratory. The site
itself looked very strange as if it'd been blasted.
But even more curious, chemical discoveries
were afoot. In related mammoth sites, it was 
found that the tusks had suffered a shower of
metallic spherules containing iron and titanium.
In addition was the discovery of minute
carbon spherules, a millimeter across and
quite large compared to the metallic ones.
The carbon spherules were reticular and when
cut open revealed millions of nanodiamonds.
This was important as they are often seen at an
impact site. Was this product the result of high
energy discharges? Similar sites were discovered
and they lay below a layer called the “Black Mat,”
a sort of clay- vegetation ensemble.
Above or within this mat no Clovis
evidence was discovered, and more
remarkable, no megafauna remains.
This Black Mat was a termination point to
recording a mass extinction. To Rick Firestone
this was as if the megafauna had been
destroyed overnight. An actual example,
witnessed by mankind, illustrates precisely
the type of destruction and rebirth
Earth has undergone in quite recent times.
Israel's city of the plains (Strabo claims 13 cities)
were hit by just such a cosmic thunderbolt.
Sodom and Gomorrah were entirely
destroyed, and the Dead Sea depression
some 720 meters below the Mediterranean was
created, together with mountain building and hill
flattening. The resultant geographical carnage
probably extended right along
the entire African Rift valley.
Immense electrical discharges rent the air
with vast deposits of sulfur (that's brimstone)
falling from the skies. Vast transmutation of
elements occurred, with vast cliffs of salt
(sodium chloride), nitrates and 
other compounds being created.
Mythology attributes this to the
activity of Jupiter, also known as the
Zedek, Zeus, and Amon.
Other upheavals in more distant times are
attributed to other planets and comets.
In future episodes we will delve into
these claims and attempt to place a date
on these world-changing events.

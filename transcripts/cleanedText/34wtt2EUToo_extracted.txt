SYMBOLS OF AN ALIEN SKY
Episode 3
THE ELECTRIC COMET
Presented by
THE THUNDERBOLTS PROJECT™
A comet can be a wonder to behold.
For thousands of years these visitors have
mystified, enchanted and terrified humanity.
And even today, despite much
attention from astronomers,
the popular science of comets is filled
with enigmas and unresolved mysteries.
We have long thought of these bodies as mere
chunks of dirty ice warming in the Sun.
But since the beginning of the space age
it seems that the key comet discoveries
have all come as huge surprises.
"Every time we look, we find
our textbooks were wrong."
What did this continuing stream of surprises
mean for the future of comet science?
It means that the core theoretical
assumptions must be reconsidered.
"It's a mystery to me how
comets work at all."
The new facts about comets underscore
the long ignored electrical behavior of
the Sun and here the biggest surprise
changes the picture of comets altogether.
It is not rising surface
temperatures and evaporated
ices that provoked the dramatic
discharging of comets.
It is charged particles erupting
from the Sun to exchange
charge with both, the coma
and nucleus of a comet.
And there's much more to this picture
because direct evidence will rewrite
planetary history, as well.
It seems that comets are born from the
very stuff of planets themselves,
they are the residue of
shattering planetary catastrophe.
Today, we can test two views of
comets against decades of discovery.
We can pose the long
unasked question.
Is a radically new interpretation
of comets now required?
Standard View of Comets
It was only in the
mid-twentieth century that a
scientific consensus emerged
on the nature of comets.
In 195,0 astronomer Fred Whipple proposed
a model that came to be known as
the "dirty snowball" hypothesis.
Whipple envisioned comets as
conglomerates of frozen gases,
mainly water, carbon
monoxide and carbon dioxide,
together with the primordial
dust of the early solar system.
But a dilemma had to be solved.
Comets lose considerable material
at each pass around the Sun.
This means that the comets we see
cannot have been around all that long.
So, the Dutch
astronomer Jan Oort
envisioned a vast horde of
icy objects circling the Sun
about 1,000 times more
distant than remote Pluto.
He imagined that after billions of years
one of these "dirty snowballs" could be
deflected from the icy
cloud by a passing star.
It might then fall into the inner solar
system to produce an active comet.
As astronomers came to accept the idea, they called
this theoretical source of comets the Oort cloud.
But by the 1990s, it became clear
that numerous objects circle the
Sun at much closer distances
than the conjectured Oort cloud.
Astronomers came to imagine short
term comets originated from the
disk of debris called the Kuiper Belt,
extending outward from Neptune's orbit.
But then advanced computer simulations
suggested that Kuiper Belt objects
were too stable to be the source
of most short term comets.
One surprise at a time the origin of
comets has become increasingly uncertain.
But always it is assumed that comets
are composed of dust and ice,
warmed by the Sun to create a coma
and tail, leaving a variety of dust.
The theory suggests that beneath the black
and shallow crust pockets of gas form.
At critical moments the pressure
breaks through the surface
creating jets, blasting vapor and
dust away from the nucleus.
But, how well does this
popular theory explain
what we've more recently
learned about comets?
Electric Model of Comets
In an alternative view, comets
have a much different history.
This view sees comets as debris
left by intense electrical activity
in an earlier phase of
solar system evolution.
Not billions of years ago - but
a much more recent epoch of
planetary instability and violence, one
that reached even into early human times.
This new perspective
combines historical facts
with surprising recent
discoveries about comets.
In the electrical interpretation, not just
comets but asteroids and meteors, as well,
were born in planetary
upheaval as electric
arcs blasted material from the
surfaces of planets and moons
to produce fused formations
identical in appearance
to fused material in laboratory
experiments with electric discharge.
Here, an arriving comet moves on an
elliptical path to the Sun's electric field.
An exceedingly weak field
but immensely powerful
across the great distances
of interplanetary space.
As the comet draws closer to the Sun
the charge imbalance triggers electric
discharge creating a coma
and long cometary tail.
The mysterious jets of comets can then be understood
in terms of arc discharges to the nucleus,
very similar to industrially
electric discharge machining.
The excavated material is accelerated into
space along the jets filamentary pathways.
Intermittent and wandering arcs erode
the the surface and burn it black,
leaving the distinctive scarring
patterns of comet nuclei.
The jets explode from the
nucleus at supersonic speed
and retain their coherent structure
for hundreds of thousands of miles.
Seen in terms of an electrically
neutral vacuum in space,
nothing of this sort should occur.
The tails of comets reveal well-defined
twisting filaments extending up
to tens of millions of miles without
dissipating in the vacuum of space.
For proponents of the electric model, this
contradiction of neutral gas behavior is no surprise;
it is the testament to the
comet's electrified environment.
The proponents of this interpretation also
say it's the electric force that holds the
spherical coma in place against the solar
wind as the comet races around the Sun.
The diameter of the visible coma
will often reach millions of miles.
And it's surrounded by an even larger and
more "improbable" spherical envelope
of fluorescing hydrogen
visible in ultraviolet light.
The "Laws" of
Compositional Zoning
For decades we've been assured
that comets were made
in the deepest of deep freezes
in interstellar space.
Comets coalesced from interstellar stardust,
the primal material of the universe
before the emergence of the Sun as we
know it, or it's planets and their moons.
A foundational principle of comet theory - and of
modern cosmology as a whole - is compositional zoning.
At the outermost regions
of the Sun's domain,
formative processes were limited
to the most rudimentary material,
raw dust constituted in an environment close
to absolute zero, with no complex chemistry.
In contrast, bodies later formed
close to the emerging Sun
would exhibit minerals formed at
relatively high temperatures.
For decades this theoretical
claim stood fast,
and the claim was even
carried into space.
It's was what prompted the
Stardust mission to Comet Wild 2.
As indicated by the very name
of the scientific mission,
the theory required that a comet
be constituted of stardust.
"Today we know that comets are black and cold, consisting of
ices and dust that coalesced from an interstellar cloud
as it collapsed to form the solar system."
But the core assumptions of comet
theory could not withstand
the shock from the data returned
by the Stardust mission.
Launched on February 7th, 1999, Stardust
carried with it a tray of aerogel
to capture samples of
comet dust from Wild 2.
And it returned these
samples to Earth.
Scientists could then view microscopically
the raw material of a comet.
The first surprise was the size of the
dust grains - much larger, stronger,
with far more complex structure and
chemistry than theory allowed.
And the gel did capture trivial amounts
of the expected microscopic dust,
invisible to the naked eye and leaving
shallow bowl shaped pits in the aerogel.
But more common by far
were much deeper tracks,
more in the shape of
carrots than shallow pits.
The particles themselves were
clearly visible to the naked eye.
To their amazement, the mission
scientists found elaborately
developed crystalline structures in the
Wild 2 dust. It was an exciting discovery,
but one that challenged all prior
theory of a comet's origins.
Crystalline structures cannot form in
the absence of minimum temperatures,
temperatures unavailable
in interstellar space.
The spectra of silicates
in cometary comas were
evident as far back as the probes of
Comet Halley, though largely ignored.
But the mystery couldn't be ignored after
arrival of the Comet Hale-Bopp in 1997.
This comet's spectra placed an exclamation point on
crystalline silicon structures in cometary comas.
To get past the problem
astronomers hedged their bets.
They surmised that
billions of years ago,
the raw material of the comet was ever
so slightly warmed by an emerging Sun.
Then all of the discrete particles
in a vast circle around the Sun
were transported outward
by means only guessed at,
to the far away and
frigid Oort cloud.
But this rationalization
failed outright
once the scientists had real comet
dust in their laboratories.
The grains were simply too
large and the mineralogical
and chemical compositions
far too complex.
"The comet samples collected by Stardust contain abundant
crystalline minerals and in most cases it is clear that they did
not form by the predicted mild heating of interstellar dust."
One puzzle was
followed by another.
Comet theory assumed that water ice was
a primary constituent of active comets.
But no water ice was detected
on the nucleus of Wild 2
and not a trace of water was found
in the well-preserved comet dust.
And yet, paradoxically, the rock
comet material of Wild 2 contained
iron and sulfur minerals that can only be
formed in the presence of liquid water.
Liquid water, not in the near-perfect vacuum
of deep space and not in a deep freeze.
"The sulfide minerals formed between 50 and 200°C
(122 and 392°F), much warmer than the sub-zero
temperatures predicted for the interior
of a comet. The discovery shatters
the existing paradigm of comets as 'dirty snowballs',
whose icy bulk never gets warm enough to melt."
Instead of trivial warming,
the Wild 2 minerals
revealed a diversity of
formative processes.
Various sulfide minerals
requiring liquid water
can only exist below 210ºC, or 410ºF.
These minerals have never
seen higher temperatures.
But, also occurring in the comet
dust was the mineral olivine,
who’s molecular structure rapidly breaks
down in the very presence of water.
It's a common igneous form, an
abundant by-product of volcanism.
Perhaps, the biggest surprise was that some
of the comet minerals such as Forsterite,
in the instant of their formation,
were heated to thousands of degrees.
Forsterite is formed in the most
intense volcanic heating of
silicates, but occurs also in
lightning strikes to silicate rocks.
The message could not
have been more emphatic.
"That's a big surprise. People thought comets would just
be cold stuff that formed out...where things are very cold."
When these minerals formed they were
either red hot or white hot grains,
and yet they were collected in a comet,
the Siberia of the Solar System."
It was not just the hypothesized Oort
cloud that failed to work as advertised.
The entire concept of
compositional zoning
as applied to comets failed
it's first acid test.
"If this mixing is occurring, as suggested by these
results, then how do you preserve any kind of
zoning in the solar system?"
Comet material requiring moderate
temperatures in liquid water.
Comet material formed at
exceedingly high temperatures.
Only the most trivial levels of the presumed
raw material of comets, interstellar dust.
A complete absence of water despite cometary
material originally formed in liquid water,
though the olivine abundances
could not have been formed
or even survived in the
presence of liquid water.
And of course, liquid water requires
atmospheric or other pressure.
It cannot exist in the extreme
vacuum of interstellar space.
To this seemingly contradictory picture,
we must add extreme selective heating.
Selective heating because much
of the compositional material
could not survive the super
heating that created olivine,
forsterite and other
crystalline minerals.
Wild 2's discoveries have
forced upon comet science
one inescapable fact: in our
own cosmic neighborhood
the diverse mineral content of
Wild 2 is typical only of planets
in the habitable zone of
a fully developed Sun.
"Most of the components from the comet have isotopic
compositions similar to Earth and are of solar system origin."
Is a coherent explanation possible?
When the fundamentals of a theory are
falsified by unexpected findings,
a new vantage point is required, one
that explains and predicts the surprises
without introducing
new contradictions.
The conjectured Oort cloud freezer,
forming and preserving comets
for billions of years, is
falsified by the Wild 2 findings.
Only the diverse surface environments of rocky
planets can provide the required raw material.
And only the recent formation
of comets can explain
why these rapidly degraded
objects are still with us.
The bold question
must now be asked:
were comets created in recent periods of planetary
instability and intense electrical events?
Would minerals formed in liquid
water then come as a surprise?
Would comets now exhibiting
no water be a surprise?
Or crystalline structures
suggesting igneous processes?
Or, minerals pointing to the exceedingly
high temperatures of lightning?
A more unified picture of comet
formation is available to us.
And, if comets were born electrically,
what might the causative connection be
to asteroids and meteorites, the
apparent cousins of the comet?
The Wild 2 mineral cubanite,
a copper iron sulfide,
is abundant on Earth,
and so too, on Mars.
In fact, it's found in Martian meteorites
now known to have been blasted
up to escape velocity from the surface
of Mars, later to arrive at Earth.
A few years ago, things now stated by astronomers
would have been considered preposterous.
Astronomers now acknowledge that the
Martian moon Phobos, long called a
captured asteroid, was formed out of
material blasted from the Martian surface.
For the source of a comet's
constituent materials,
planets close to the Sun's habitable zone
are the most reasonable places to look.
The foremost candidate
is the planet Mars.
In this intellectual adventure, we must revisit
all earlier ideas about solar system history.
Evidence for high energy electrical
events can no longer be ignored.
The popular billion year scenarios
describing a comet's origins
will be displaced by things
now established as fact.
And the changing picture
of solar system history
will surely not stop with
the new story of the comet.
Where's the Water?
Modern comet theory has
long proclaimed that
active comets are the
result of sublimating ices.
And yet, the comet
Wild 2 was active,
though no water could be detected on
it's surface and none was found in the
well-preserved comet
dust returned to Earth.
The theory requires
cometary ices.
And that's what scientists
were certain they would find
when the Deep Space 1 probe
reached Comet Borelly in 2001.
But the probe could find
not even a hint of water.
"The spectrum suggests that the surface is
hot and dry. It is surprising that we saw no
traces of water ice."
In fact, an absence of detectable water
on comet nuclei is the common finding.
When astronomers discovered the fragments
of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 in 1993,
they expected to observe volatile gases from
sublimated ices, but no such gases were found.
When Comet Linear disintegrated, astronomers
were shocked by the absence of water in the
immediate debris - exactly as later occurred in
the case of the disintegrating Comet Elenin.
But, the momentum of theoretical
claims is not easily overcome.
When Borrelly's surface was
found to be hot and dry,
astronomers were not dissuaded
from theoretical assumptions.
Water must be emitted by the comet, even
if not a trace is observed on the nucleus,
not even at the very places where
the jets erupt from the surface.
"We know the ice is there. It's just well-hidden."
But the mystery of missing water
need not haunt comet scientists
if they will question their
theoretical assumption
that water is necessary to
create cometary displays.
There's more to this mystery than
common theory has even considered.
Astronomers assure us that abundant water is
detected in the luminous comas of comets.
But this is where the
real mystery begins.
Cometary comas exhibit
the hydroxyl radical O(sup)H.
O(sup)H is not water (H²O), but just one
hydrogen atom bound to one oxygen atom.
Hydroxyl radicals can be produced from
water molecules by photo-dissociation.
When a photon of a ultra violet light
from the Sun strikes a water molecule,
it can break the bond holding a
hydrogen proton to the oxygen atom.
If one of the hydrogen nuclei breaks
free from the water molecule,
what is left is the
hydroxy radical
and a freely moving hydrogen
proton or positively charged ion.
What comet scientists believe they
see is water released from the
comet's nucleus breaking down to
produce the hydroxyl radical.
They don't see the water itself,
but that's how a theory interprets the
presence of O(sup)H in cometary comas.
And, it does seem reasonable. Except perhaps
for the missing water on the nucleus,
and one additional mystery -
the much greater accumulation
of hydrogen than of O(sup)H
in the comas of comets.
These great envelopes of
fluorescing hydrogen -
entirely out of proportion
to the presence of O(sup)H -
suggest that something is happening
around the nucleus of comets
that the theorists have
yet to comprehend.
More than 25-years ago,
scientists examining the Comet
Tago-Sato-Kosaka noted the problem:
the ratio of O(sup)H to hydrogen was
clearly too low if the
original source was water.
"...Cometary scientists need to consider
more carefully whether H2O-ice
really does constitute a major
fraction of comet nuclei."
Here is a fact that has yet to enter
official discourses on comet science.
There is a simple and direct way
to produce the hydroxyl radical
in abundance, and it does
not require water at all.
Laboratory experiments
by Nobel laureate
Hannes Alfvén have
shown that silicates,
when bombarded by protons, produce
abundant hydroxyl and other species
found in cometary comas - with
no prior involvement of water.
"[The experiments] resulted in a substantial yield
of hydroxyl ions and also hydroxyl ion complexes."
The experimental evidence points directly
to charged particles from the Sun,
not light, and it directs us to the
negative charge of the comet nucleus.
The evidence for negatively charged comet
nuclei has been with us for decades,
since the Giotto spacecraft encountered
Comet Halley in March 1986,
discovering in the coma of Halley the negative
ions prohibited by prior comet theory.
"As negative ions are easily destroyed
by solar radiation at ~ 1 AU,
an efficient production mechanism, so far unidentified,
is required to account for the observed densities."
In the electric model, comets on elongated orbits
pick up negative charge while far from the Sun.
As they move into the Sun's
positively charged environment
electric discharge is
the predictable effect.
Electric discharge machining
of the nucleus sputters
negatively charged oxygen
atoms from the surface.
These negative ions then combine
at some distance from the nucleus
with solar wind protons to form the
O(sup)H radicals so prevalent in the coma.
Numerous variations in the electrochemistry
of the coma are certain to follow
and such reactions would
be expected, even when
no water is present
on the comet nucleus.
The hydroxyl radical may not mean what
astronomers have routinely assumed.
High Energy Emissions
The electrical interpretation
places a new light
on the surprising high-energy
emissions of comets.
It was only as astronomers began to view
comets beyond the spectrum of visible light,
that they discovered the massive
envelopes and more energetic emissions,
including not just ultraviolet
and extreme ultraviolet light
but X-ray emissions, as well.
In common human experience, ultraviolet
light means an electrical event.
It can be a natural emission of glow
discharge, or arcing, in ultraviolet
lamps and mercury vapor lamps.
In intense electric arcs, UV
emissions are always involved.
That's why arc welders wear
their protective masks,
to shield their eyes from
the ultraviolet emissions.
To explain these surprising levels of
UV emission, astronomers envisioned
atoms of the coma reflecting, or
re-radiating, UV light from the Sun.
But, if comets are electric discharge
phenomena, their remarkable glow
and ultraviolet wavelengths could
well be a new window to discovery.
Surprising Energies of Comet X-Rays
Recent telescopic explorations of
space far beyond our own planetary
system have revealed pervasive,
explosive X-ray emissions,
the one thing never expected in
supposedly electrically neutral space.
X-rays are close to the most
energetic forms of light,
well beyond the visible spectrum,
with exceedingly short wavelengths.
These emissions are created
when high speed electrons,
moving at millions of miles per
hour, release energy when striking
an atom or their course is rapidly
altered by a magnetic field.
Because of the energies
involved in generating X-rays,
only the rarest astronomer expected
X-ray emissions from comets
due entirely to reflection of diffuse
X-rays from an external source, the Sun.
"We had no clear expectation that comets shine in X-rays."
One of the great discoveries
in comet science
came quite by accident
on March 27th, 1996.
That's when the ROSAT satellite detected
highly energetic X-ray emissions
from the Comet Hyakutake - far
beyond any astronomers expectations.
"[Astronomers] were shocked by what they saw.
ROSAT images revealed a crescent-shaped region of S-ray emission
around the comet 1000 times more intense than anyone had predicted!"
In the sciences an event a 1000
times more energetic than expected
is a call to reconsider
theoretical assumptions.
In July 2000, when the Comet
Linear disintegrated explosively,
the Chandra Observatory
confirmed profuse X-rays.
In recent years it's become
clear that X-ray emissions
from comets are business
as usual for these bodies.
But why? All theorists acknowledge
that an electrical event is occurring,
but the meaning of the event - the
relationship between cause and effect -
needs to be made more explicit.
The electric comet model
explains this occurrence by a
strong electric field across
the comet's plasma sheath.
The sheath surrounds the
negatively charged comet
and isolates it from the more positively
charged environment of the Sun.
Where the sheath is most compressed
in the sunward direction,
it's not surprising that the electric
field is strong enough to accelerate
charged particles
to X-ray energies.
Without that electric field,
nothing dramatic would occur.
That's why in the debris cloud of
the disintegrating Comet Linear,
we saw intense X-ray emission from
the sunward face of the cloud.
The emissions occurred at the
interface of the cometary coma
with the more positively
charged solar wind.
The electric comet model predicts that all
active comets will produce X-ray emissions.
"We now recognize that X-ray emission is
a characteristic of all active comets."
In an electric field the required electron
speed can be achieved almost instantly.
This fact was discovered
over a century ago when
Wilhelm Röntgen produced X-rays
in his use of a Crookes tube.
Both, X-ray production and the fluorescence
of neutral hydrogen around comets,
are readily explained by
simple electrical events.
Attempts to explain such behavior of
comets in an electrically neutral
environment will always
require hypothetical effects
more energetic than the
conjectured cause.
Deep Impact
The single most critical test of the
electric comet model came on July 4th, 2005.
That was when NASA's Deep
Impact probe fired an
800 pound copper projectile at
the nucleus of comet Tempel 1.
Cameras on the probe
recorded the event.
And even the projectile
itself contained a camera
to transmit data up to
the moment of impact.
As early as 2001, looking ahead
to this event electrical
theorist Wallace Thornhill
began registering his
expectations of surprises
in store for comet science.
On the evening of
July 3rd, 2005,
the day before the encounter, the
Thunderbolts website published the
explicit predictions of
Thornhill and his colleagues.
These predictions would highlight
the contrast between the
standard and the
electric comet models.
"Advocates of the Electric Universe expect a 'shock to the system'
with revolutionary implications. They say that a comet is not a
primordial object left over from the formation of the solar system."
As the Deep Impact probe
approached Tempel 1,
key NASA figures gathered
in the control room.
The comet was racing toward the probe
with some 23,000 miles per hour
when the probe launched its copper
impactor toward the nucleus.
If the comet was
electrically charged,
how would the electronics of the
impactor respond to the electric field?
"Electrical interactions with Deep Impact may be slight, but they
should be measurable if NASA will look for them... Electrical stress
may short out the electronics on board the impactor before impact."
For most of its journey, the
impactor's signal was clear.
But in the final seconds the
signal was indeed disrupted.
This apparent electrical disturbance
was not all that Thornhill predicted.
Also noteworthy was
his expectation of an
advanced flash ahead of
the projectile's impact.
"The most obvious would be a flash
(lightning-like discharge) shortly before impact."
This is exactly what occurred.
The advanced flash left NASA
scientists scratching their heads.
"What you see is something really surprising.
First, there is a small flash, then there's a delay,
then there's a big flash and the whole thing breaks loose."
NASA scientists involved
in the Deep Impact Mission
were well aware of the
kinetics of impact explosions.
But would the projectile be
striking a solid icy surface
or a more loose aggregation
of snowy fluff?
What they did not anticipate, but the
electric model explicitly predicted,
was a major contribution from the
electrical energy of the comet.
The explosion would therefore be greater
than any NASA scientist envisioned while
working with electrically
neutral conditions.
"More energy will be released than expected
because of the electrical contributions of the comet."
It seems that the spectacular explosion that
followed the impact was the greatest surprise.
Every scientist viewing the live
images expressed his astonishment.
"How did we make such a big splash?"
"I'm at a loss to explain it."
The scientists had expected to
peer into a deep hole in a cometary
"dirty snowball" before the Deep
Impact vehicle was too far away.
But the erupting cloud of
silicate dust was so thick
and the explosion so sustained that it
completely obscured the local terrain.
To the electrical theorists the exploding
cloud was a predictable effect.
"The impact/electrical discharge will be into rock,
not loosely consolidated ice and dust."
Fortunately, the Swift satellite
provided a view of the comet
explosion not just in visible
light but in UV wavelengths
which often give the best
pointers to electrical events.
"Swift scientists have seen a quick and dramatic rise in ultra violet light,
evidence that the Deep Impact probe struck a hard surface,
as opposed to a softer, snowy surface."
The ultraviolet emissions required
temperatures of over 3,000ºF.
The temperatures of the last
will explain why the initial eruption
saturated the sensors on
the Deep Impact probe.
Calculations based on pixel saturation
indicated a minimum initial
temperature of the flash at
almost 6,000ºF.
Though, saturation means the temperature
could have been much higher.
Still Looking for Water
The first purpose of the Deep Impact Mission was
to excavate the envisioned subsurface water ice.
But electrical theorists have consistently
predicted little or no water on most comet nuclei.
"An abundance of water on or below the
surface of the nucleus is unlikely."
Nothing approaching the expected
levels of water was detected.
Absence of volatiles as a dominant
factor can only mean that
something is fundamentally wrong
in standard comet theory.
"The material that came out was a surprise to scientists:
a cloud of fine powdery material emerged, not the water,
ice and dirt that were expected."
"Theories about the volatile layers below the surface of
the short-period comets are going to have to be revised."
The last resort in the search for water
was the effort to identify the vents
from which, according to popular
theory, pressurized gases were
escaping at the extraordinary
velocities of Tempel 1's observed jets.
The vents were never found.
"It has proven difficult to identify specific landforms that can be identified
as the ‘vents’ discussed for many decades in classical comet literature,
as it is difficult to locate them on Borrelly and Wild 2."
When viewed through the
lens of standard theory,
some predictions of the electric
model could only appear absurd.
Thornhill anticipated that the
locations of the comet jets
could actually shift as charge
re-distribution occurred
on the nucleus after a
significant electrical event.
"The discharge and/or impact may initiate a new jet on the nucleus and
could even abruptly change the positions and intensities of other jets
due to the sudden change in charge distribution on the comet nucleus."
Confirmation of this prediction came from the
Nordic Optical Telescope in La Palma, Spain.
As released by the observatory
two images of the comet
before impact and hours later
tell the story emphatically.
15 hours after the blast, new jets appeared
far from the location of the impact itself.
Surface Features
The Deep Impact Mission promised to give us
the best images ever of a comet nucleus.
On the eve of the impact, the
Thunderbolts group stated the
electrically predicted surface
features in no uncertain terms.
"The model predicts a sculpted surface, distinguished by sharply
defined craters, valleys, mesas, and ridges—the opposite of
the softened relief expected of a sublimating 'dirty snowball'."
The surface of Tempel 1
astonished the experts.
Expansive mesas and steep vertical
ridges did not belong on a comet.
And the presence of craters sparked
a debate that continues today.
Fortunately, scientists had an opportunity
for a second look at Tempel 1.
After the Stardust Mission to Comet Wild 2
that probe was re-directed to the
object of the Deep Impact Mission.
Stardust was then renamed NExt
or New Exploration of Tempel 1.
It would give additional views
of the comet's surface.
Arrival of Stardust/NExT
With the arrival of the NExT probe, old
mysteries only grew more perplexing,
leaving scientists to debate
the contradictions of theory.
Even the scalloping of mesa walls
and nearly vertical ridges,
something we've mentioned so often in
connection with electric discharge
machining, was duly noted
by NASA scientists.
"The image reveals topographic features, including ridges,
scalloped edges and possibly impact craters formed long ago."
At least 60 craters were counted, though
collisions along the comets path would
be exceedingly rare,
if occurring at all.
And the surfaces of active
comets are rapidly eroded.
Far too rapidly to preserve a record of
rare impacts across geologic time scales.
In fact, most astronomers now reject
explanation by impact and that includes
Michael O'Hearn the Principal
investigator of the Deep Impact Mission.
"Another process must account for the
depressions, according to Michael A'Hearn."
What, then, was responsible for the pervasive
cratering of the Tempel 1 surface?
Laboratory experiments have shown
that entire fields of craters
are readily produced by electric arcs
to a negatively charged surface.
Nothing observed on cometary nuclei has
contradicted the electrical interpretation.
Surface Arcing
Here is the most fundamental question
one could ask about active comets:
is electric arcing
occurring at the surface?
If so, should we not see this arcing where
there is sufficient camera resolution?
We have a good example in the energetic
plumes of Jupiter's moon Io,
where the sensors of the
Galileo probe were saturated
by apparent electric arcs,
producing blotches of whiteout.
A second example came
with the Stardust Mission
and the appearance of small saturation
points on the surface of comet Wild 2 -
but with insufficient resolution
to make a definitive case
for what the electrical
theorists suspected.
The enigmatic whiteouts on the
active surface of Tempel 1 were
everything the electrical
theorists could have asked for.
And the most prominent were placed exactly
where the electric model envisions them.
Eroding the cliffs of
mesa walls and extending
the floors of numerous
craters and depressions.
And yet these extensive
blotches of whiteout, are
receiving occasional comments
from the specialists,
have yet to provoke any deeper
curiosity as to their cause.
View from impactor
But now, with a second look at Tempel 1,
we can contrast the surface activity of
the comet under two
different circumstances.
Deep Impact occurred just one
day before the comet reached
perihelion or its closest
approach to the Sun.
But the Stardust NExT Mission
arrived 34 days after
perihelion, as the comet
retreated from the Sun,
and the electrical activity
of the Sun itself was
far below its activity at
the time of Deep Impact.
On July 2nd, 2005,
two-and-a-half days before Deep Impact
the Space Weather website reported a
remarkable surge in sunspot apparent a
direct indicator of surging solar activity.
"What a difference a few days makes. Three days ago,
the sun was almost blank, now it's peppered with sunspots."
An active Sun
versus a quiet Sun.
For Tempel 1, this means different
levels of proton bombardment
a couple a days after the ejected
particles left the solar surface.
The contrast is remarkable.
The more active comet presents
an abundance of whiteouts.
The less active almost none.
NASA scientists originally estimated
that the Tempel 1 nucleus lost about a
third of a meter in
depth with each orbit.
But the electric model emphasizes
selective and focused excavation.
The new look at Tempel 1 showed
that the most prominent mesa cliff
had been dramatically excavated.
The mesa was an estimated 15 meters high,
and it had retreated some 50 meters.
The most dramatic change on Tempel 1 occurred precisely
where the pixel saturation was the most dense.
The only remaining plausible
explanation for pixel
saturation on the more active
comet is electrical erosion.
NASA scientists also say that existing craters
were extended between the two visits.
Three craters close
to the dominant mesa
had been further excavated
to form a single trench.
Electric arcs extend crater floors and erode
the ridges of mesas and elevated terrain.
The typical signature of both is the
scalloping effect of rotating arcs.
And it is no surprise to
the electrical theorists
that these processes
energize a comet's jets.
In fact, almost all of the jets of Tempel 1,
when captured in its less active phase
are said to have emanated from the
erosion of a prominent scalloped cliff.
Selective erosion is a trademark of
the electric discharge machining.
"Most of the jets observed during the SN flyby can be
traced back to an apparently eroding terraced scarp."
Deep Impact Crater
Before the Deep Impact projectile
was fired at the comet,
scientists were confident they would
strike a dirty, snowy surface,
penetrating well below the surface
to excavate deep material.
That's how the mission would expose the
primordial stuff of comet creation.
What would this deep crater look like?
Of course, if the projectile struck a
rock are discharged above the surface
in an electrical event, the target
area might look a lot different.
Then the removed material would
be silicate dust and debris
but with very little penetration
beneath the surface.
"The impact/electrical discharge will be into rock,
not loosely consolidated ice and dust.
The impact crater will be smaller than expected."
To facilitate the investigation
after a sub-surface explosion,
the Deep Impact probe targeted the space
between two well identified craters.
So, in return to Tempel 1, mission
scientists knew exactly where to look.
But almost nothing could be seen and
certainly there was no resemblance to
the deep crater the
scientists had envisioned.
"There was a surprise in the sense that you could
have expected a crater that was very well defined."
To identify the crater location, the
scientists published a view of the
region with the circle of
arrows around the impact site.
How are we to understand the
absence of a deep crater?
"The images did not show much of a crater.
The scientists say they believe the debris
blown into air settled right back down."
On this question, the investigation appeared
to move into weird in theory defying science,
a typical comet's gravity is perhaps
one billionth that of Earth.
Mere walking speed would be sufficient
to escape the nucleus altogether.
How would accepted theory allow
material exploding from the comet at
thousands of miles per hour to return
to it's finite point of departure
and to refill the crater?
"It appears that the crater partly healed itself."
Energetic Coma Activity
A key to our understanding
in the Deep Impact events
is water production in the
coma of an active comet.
Abundant water or hydroxyl in the coma
of Tempel 1 was readily confirmed,
though NASA investigators saw only
trivial levels of water on the surface.
Patches of surface water in false color
"What is significant is that the extent of this ice on Tempel 1’s
surface is not sufficient to produce the observed abundance
of water and its by-products in the comet’s coma."
According to the scientific
reports, the observed
jet and coma activity of the
comet would require 200 times
more exposed water ice on the
surface then was actually detected.
This fact could only accentuate the
absence of any vents to the previously
supposed pressure chambers
beneath the surface.
No theoretically acceptable cause could be
found for the energies of the comet jets.
And nothing was observed
that could account for
the abundant hydroxyl
or water in the coma.
But this dilemma is removed
by the electric comet model.
The model explains the absence of
water, the energies of the jets
and the absence of vents
to subsurface chambers.
And the presence of hydroxyl
and water in the coma,
but not as a general rule on the
surface or beneath the surface,
is a prediction of
the electric model.
"Negative oxygen ions from cathodic etching of rock
minerals in the nucleus will combine with protons from
the solar wind to form water in the coma and tail."
The evidence points to high-energy
electrical exchange, electrically
sputtered silicates from
a negatively charged
comet nucleus transacting with the
charged particles of the solar wind.
Water production through the
electrochemistry of charge redistribution.
The paradox of trivial surface ice on
Tempel 1 then finds a coherent explanation.
"The particle size of the water ice, is greater than
the icy grains in the coma and is probably
recondensed onto the comet's surface."
The surface ice was produced
electrically in the coma.
Meager amount of this water ice later
drifted from the coma to the surface,
condensing as a few
shallow patches of frost.
Scattered frost seen in false color
It's the hydroxyl radical that
gives us the persuasive answer.
Investigators thought they saw an
injection of water into the coma
from the nucleus several days after the
eruption of dust had returned to normal.
But that conclusion arose from
an unsupported assumption.
Based on data from the Swift satellite,
investigators from the UK and US
reported a spectacular increase
in water content within the coma.
But that increase did not begin
until five days after Deep Impact.
When the normal production
of 16,000 tons per day
increased by at least 250%,
continuing for five more days.
"After the Deep Impact probe hit the comet,
this rate increased to 40,000 tonnes per
day of the period 5-10 days after impact."
As reported the rise in
water content of the coma
all occurred with no increase in
dust content. No increase in dust.
That's the fact that precludes the
investigators interpretation,
comet outbursts are
never dust-free.
In electrical terms the rapid
increase in hydroxyl or water
would predictably come
days after Deep Impact.
And this is why the comets X-ray
emissions continued to grow.
Above the nucleus, highly energetic explicitly
electrical events created a flood of X-ray emission.
And water of the coma
was the by-product of
that electrical
exchange not the cause.
A reconsideration of water production
and it's direct link to a comet's X-ray
production is now essential.
In fact the contribution of charged
particles from the Sun to comet
activity is now acknowledged.
It happened in 2012 when the distinguished
Russian astronomer Subhon Ibadov´s paper
appeared in the Journal
"Advances in Space Research".
Prof. Ibadov's paper
described a comet nucleus
responding to charged
particles from the Sun.
His calculated capacitor like
discharges or equivalent to observed
energies of comet flaring in
ground-based observations of comets.
Now that the door has been opened to
discussion of the Sun's electrical role
in comet discharging, how long can that role
be overlooked in comet investigations?
The Message of Deep Impact
Taken as a whole the message of Deep
Impact is remarkably consistent.
But why did the crucial findings all
come as a surprise to comet scientists?
And what does it mean
that these surprises were
the explicit predictions
of the electric model?
Deep Impact provided us with a stunning
confirmation of the electric comet,
confirming as well the larger
electrical environment of the Sun.
Converging evidence from every
line of investigation makes
clear that the space sciences
will be forever changed.
Comet Hartley 2
Perhaps no flyby of a comet
produced more instant surprises
than the visit to Comet Hartley
2 in early November 2010.
It was achieved by the
original Deep Impact probe,
subsequently renamed EPOXI, for
its encounters with Hartley 2.
Even the shape of the comet
caught investigators by surprise.
The awkward bookends are
double-lobes made no sense.
Astronomers likened it to a pickle, a
peanut, a dog bone and a bowling pin.
Why would accretion of a dirty
snowball or icy dirtball from the
homogeneous primordial cloud produce
such a remarkable configuration?
Standard accretion theories never
envisioned anything of this sort.
The theories always claimed that comets
preserved the original raw material
out of which the Sun and planets slowly
accreted over billions of years.
Hartley 2 revealed a split personality.
Astronomers were in disbelief when they
discovered that the two lobes exhibited
radically different compositions.
That finding flatly excluded
prior assumptions and
eliminated the imagined Oort
cloud of earlier theory.
One end of the comet was highly active
and the other much less so. But why?
"We have a very heterogeneous nucleus.
The lobes are different."
"How you'd get what looks like a volatile-rich object
linked up to a volatile-poor object is a bit of a puzzle."
The primary outgassing of Hartley 2
was coming from the smaller lobe.
Astronomers were forced to a
highly incongruous conclusion -
that the two end-pieces of the comet formed separately
in much different regions of the solar system.
And here again, we meet undeniable
evidence of a common history
for planets and comets, both forming
from well-differentiated materials
in the habitable zone of the Sun.
"The ingredients for both comets and planets must have
been mixed up early on in the formation of our solar system.
Without this mixing, comets would have more homogenous composition."
A collision of two comets in the
vastness of the heliosphere would
involve the most extreme
improbabilities.
And, if two small comets originated in much
different regions of the solar system,
how likely would be a merging
by gentle collision?
"We are speculating that this means that the two lobes of
the comet formed in different places in the Solar System.
They came together in a gradual collision..."
Hartley 2: Enigmatic “Waist”
The strangely smooth "waist" of
Hartley 2, seems to have invited
extreme speculations
from NASA scientists.
A comet just a mile wide would
have no appreciable gravity.
But could gravity have, nevertheless, guided dust
from the ends of the comet toward the waist?
"We think the waist is a deposit of material
from other parts of the comet, our first
evidence of redistribution on a comet."
"Material coming off the ends of the comet then
falls back into the lowest point, the waist."
The electric model does not force
scientists to such conjectural extremes.
The electrostatic deposition is well established
in environments of electric discharge.
High-Energy Jets
The spectacular jet activity of Hartley
2 continues to haunt comet scientists.
Jets erupted from the sunward face of the
comet but could also be seen exploding
from regions in shadow with the same
force as those exposed to sunlight.
"We have jets in the night time, we have jets along the edge,
we have jets in the sun...We have a lot of work to do to
try and understand what’s going on here."
What was driving the velocities
of Hartley 2's jets?
Traditional theory has
always explained cometary
jets through both surface
and subsurface warming.
Surface sublimation in areas of
brightness or exposure to the Sun alone
would not be sufficient
to drive the high-speed jets.
Subsurface pressure
chambers are a requirement.
Investigators found that
dust and carbon dioxide were
being emitted by the comet
in consistent proportions.
This led them to the
conclusion that CO₂ pressures
building up in chambers beneath the
surface were driving the explosive jets
and in the process carrying
dust along with them.
Fortunately, Hartley 2 investigators could
trace the jets to topographical features.
But these features did not include the
expected openings to subsurface chambers.
Without the required pressures, the
acceleration of material away from the
comet would have no
identifiable cause.
In the vacuum of space, a mere surface
response to light from the Sun
would involve virtually
no pressure all.
"The real surprise was that the [surface]
brightness was sufficient to do that... Putting
it together is something we’re struggling with."
The Cyanide Anomaly
Here is a remarkable fact reported by
NASA investigators in September 2010.
Prior to the arrival of EPOXI, Hartley 2
produced an immense cloud of cyanide or CN gas.
The explosive increase in cyanide
occurred over a little more than a week,
an event investigators
dubbed the "CN anomaly".
"We don’t know why the amount [of CN] coming off the
comet changed so drastically for a short period of time.
We’ve never seen anything like this before."
Typically, during the ebb and
flow of a comet's activity,
we see a consistent proportion of
removed dust to the gases emitted.
But the EPOXI probe detected
no dust increase at all.
"In other cases where a comet has had a big outburst,
a lot of dust has been released at the same time. But in this case,
the amount of dust did not change, yet the CN gas abundance exploded."
Equally stunning was the fact that the cyanide
increase did not show up in the comet's jets,
though this is exactly where one
would look to identify a source
if this source was, in
fact, on the nucleus.
"If observers monitoring Hartley 2 do not take into
account this new phenomenon, they could easily get
the wrong picture of how the comet is changing."
Is it possible that the cyanide abundance
did not originate from the surface
but from the electrochemical
activity in the coma?
Could electrical exchange
between a highly active comet
and charged particles from the Sun resolve
the mystery of cyanide production?
To clarify this issue, we consulted
with Dr. Franklin Anariba,
an electrochemical researcher and
lecturer at the Singapore University
of Technology and Design.
Dr. Anariba agreed to
explore the question,
and we subsequently invited him to
present his findings at the recent
Thunderbolts Project™ conference
in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
In his investigation, Dr. Anariba
found that electrochemical events
could account for several
key features of comets.
These would include:
plasma generation in the coma,
the observed hydrogen gas cloud
surrounding the comas of comets,
dust tail formation,
the ionized plasma tails of comets,
and gas production within the comas.
Electrochemistry requires
a voltage difference.
And the coma of Hartley 2 was
well suited for the electrical
production of water, cyanide
and a good deal more.
As for cyanide, the confirmed presence of methane
and of ammonia would be quite sufficient.
Add electric discharge and
cyanide WOULD be the byproduct.
Hartley 2 is a hyperactive comet with
a continuing potential for surprises
and anomalies to
standard comet science.
But, when is a mystery
really a mystery,
and when does it mean the breakdown
of an onboard instrument?
As pointed out to us by Dr. Anariba,
NASA investigators recently announced
that the so-called CN anomaly
was actually an instrument failure.
It appears that no further analysis of the
claimed failure has been made public.
Did an instrument really
fail to perform properly,
or did speculation take over
when the standard theory
could not account for a recorded event?
Either way, the electrochemistry
of cyanide production in the
comas of comets is a crucial
issue that must be explored.
The Mystery of Exploding Comets
December 2010. Russian astronomer
Leonid Elenin announces
the discovery of a new comet roughly
400 million miles from Earth.
Calculations show that the comet,
moving on a highly eccentric orbit,
will intersect the orbit of the Earth.
Based on the size if it's coma, most
astronomers viewed the comet as
typical and unexceptional, suggesting
a body two or three miles wide.
But the projected
earth-crossing orbit sparked an
outburst of Internet rumors
and Doomsday predictions.
Most remarkable were the
suggestions that the comet was a rogue
planet, and claims that it would
profoundly disturb the Earth,
causing earthquakes, or a
shifting of the poles,
and even the end of the world.
Respected astronomers
were dismayed.
How could such scientific
illiteracy attract
millions of viewers to
Internet articles and videos?
Experts reminded us of the trivial mass
of a comet just 2-3 miles (3-5km) wide,
passing millions of
miles from Earth.
"Just driving to work every day in my subcompact
car is going to have far more of a gravitational
effect on Earth than this comet ever will."
The Surprise
As it turned out, what
actually happened to Elenin
posed a profound mystery
for comet science.
In the summer of 2011, Elenin
grew brighter than expected,
and astronomers began to
anticipate a respectable show.
But, the situation changed when a powerful
coronal mass ejection erupted from the Sun.
On August 19th, the CME
struck the Comet Elenin.
The comet flared brightly, appearing
to disintegrate explosively
followed by rapidly dimming before it was
visually lost against the glare of the Sun.
On October 24th 2011, only days after
the expected closest approach to Earth
Italian astronomers captured
the remains of Elenin on film.
An extremely faint and diffuse cloud
of dust was all that could be seen.
How did the disintegration and virtual
disappearance of Elenin occur?
The answer appears to lie in the role of
charged particles in an electrical event.
When the charged particles of a coronal
mass ejection struck the Comet Elenin,
the oppositely charged nucleus could
not withstand the electrical stresses.
It disintegrated like
an exploding capacitor.
The electrical theorists assure us that
comets are not what we are taught in school.
No practical experiment ever
demonstrated that a dirty chunk of ice
would disintegrate explosively
under gentle warming from the Sun.
The explosive demise of comets
cannot be due to solar heating.
In fact, eruptions and comet
disintegration have occurred in regions
so remote from the Sun that
warming is not even a factor.
We saw one of the most
improbable flarings
in the case of Comet Halley, a regular
visitor to the inner solar system.
In 1991, 5 years after Halley's
closest approach to the Sun,
it was well beyond the
orbit of Uranus, where
temperatures hover
around minus 330ºF.
Then, it erupted, producing a dust
cloud a 180,000 miles (289,682km) across.
"The cloud was more than 1,000 times brighter than the comet was
supposed to be at that distance. To have something turn off
and suddenly brighten at that distance is unheard of."
"It is not a simple matter to explain the outburst."
If thermal stresses are excluded, it seems
that only one consideration remains.
Shortly after the Halley outburst, a
few astronomers began to wonder:
could charged particles
from the Sun be a factor?
At the time, solar wind
activity had peaked at
a higher level than had
been seen in decades.
Then, two astronomers observed that
the charged particles of a powerful
solar flare on January 31
would have likely reached
Halley around February 12,
the date of the outburst.
The coincidence of the outburst with that
arrival seemed too great to dismiss.
"A kick from the solar wind is the cause of
the Comet Halley’s February 1991 flare."
Could electrical events be the key to
comet outbursts and fragmentation?
To this day, astronomers have no
explanation for the sudden and
spectacular brightening
of Comet Holmes in 2007.
It had been moving rapidly away
from the Sun for about five months
when it's coma size suddenly
grew by a factor of a million,
making it even larger than the Sun.
"We have guesses, but we don’t
yet understand what happened."
"This is really a remarkable event.
We're at a loss."
Was it a coincidence that just two
days before the comets display,
there was a sharp spike in the
output of the solar wind?
In the electrical view, this sudden
arrival of charged particles from the
Sun will explain what otherwise
would have no known cause.
Electrical surges and capacitor
breakdowns go together.
High-tech image processing later showed
that the nucleus of Holmes had broken apart
with many fragments contributing to its
brightening, confirming a general pattern.
Comets flare brightly when breaking apart.
In 1976, Comet West brightened greatly in a
series of outbursts, perhaps a dozen or so,
then shocked astronomers by
breaking into fragments.
Warming by the Sun is not a reasonable
explanation of such events.
When Comet Wirtanen
fragmented in 1957,
it was just inside the
orbit of icy Saturn.
Much the same occurred in the
case of Comet Biela/Bambert.
"Most of the comets observed to split
have done so for no obvious reason."
"We still do not know why comets split.
The problem is left unsolved."
More than once, comets have broken up at
their greatest distances from the Sun,
well beyond the orbit of Neptune, and
when break up occurs the fragments have
separated at inexplicably high velocities.
Mainstream theory has no explanation
for the energies driving such events.
"One really does require an explanation
when the velocity of separation is some
20% of the velocity of the comet itself!"
The progressive disintegration of the Comet
Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 beginning in 1995
left astronomers grasping for answers.
Though 150 million miles away,
it brightened spectacularly,
shining hundreds of times
more brightly than expected.
Then, astronomers discovered that the comet
had broken into at least four pieces.
Then in 2006, the Hubble Space Telescope
captured the spectacular disintegration of
the comet in progress while it was
still out beyond Earth's orbit.
It was then clear that the comet had broken
into more than three dozen fragments
as house sized chunks of the comet
appeared to disintegrate completely,
some within the span of a single day.
Remarkably similar to the
fate of Elenin, was the
explosive demise of the
Comet Linear in July 2000.
Like Elenin, Linear entered
the inner solar system from
its outermost regions on a
highly eccentric orbit.
For the electrical theorists, that means a
maximum change in the electrical environment.
As it approached it's perihelion, some
70 million miles (112 million km) from the Sun,
it flared, then rapidly
disintegrated.
The disintegration of Linear provides a
strong parallel to the story of Elenin.
The tear-drop form of the flare and
the relationship of the flare to
disintegration are
virtually identical.
All that was left of Linear
was a cloud of dust.
The expected abundance of
water was simply not there.
And what of Elenin?
As reported by Leonid Elenin himself,
the expected water
vapor was missing.
"American radio astronomers report
they did not detect water coming
from any remains of Comet Elenin."
If charged particles from the Sun
are triggers for outbursts or
disintegration of comets, the
behavior of these bodies has almost
nothing to do with relative
masses, or surface temperatures,
and everything to do
with the electric force.
Is it possible that one question
could remove the anomalies?
That one answer could
explain the flaring,
the fragmentation and the catastrophic
demise of these cosmic intruders?
When Planets Gave Birth to Comets
In the Electric Universe view of comets,
these bodies were excavated from
planetary surfaces in an
epoch of cosmic violence.
From this vantage point,
even asteroids and
meteors originated in the
same or similar events.
Electrical theorists have gathered
many volumes of evidence to show that
planets once moved on much
different courses than today.
In violent encounters, planets were
immersed in electric discharge
as stupendous arcs passed
between these charge bodies.
Electric arcs acting on planetary
surfaces and on the resulting
dense clouds of dust and debris fused
material into the unique shapes of
comets and asteroids, including the
double-lobed forms often observed.
Was Comet Hartley 2 fused into its
odd shape by electric discharge?
In one of the first electrical experiments
by plasma scientists, C.J. Ransom,
the fusing of surface material
produced a near-perfect
replica of Hartley 2's
unique morphology.
The only appreciable difference was in the relative
sizes of granular material, as we'd expect.
Could this remarkable similarity
be merely accidental?
At Hartley 2's smaller end,
mission scientists observed
what they called "shiny clumps", or
"cubicles", reaching up to 16 stories tall.
They were not just oddly
configured, they were two or
three times more reflective
than other surface materials.
But, look again at the Hartley 2 counterpart
produced in Dr. Ransom's experiments.
Here we see materials fused
electrically into shiny
more reflective clumps, giving us the
very answer that NASA scientists missed.
Fusing of material into glassified
texture will multiply reflectivity.
"These are spectacular features, but at this
point we don’t know whether these are
deposits or growths, or something else."
The Electric Comet
Questioning the core assumptions of popular science
And so, the mysteries
of comets deepen.
And the most urgent need is to reconsider
the nature of comets as a whole.
It seems that anomalies are just
too easily ignored or forgotten.
But recurring anomalies can
be the door to discovery.
What better way to move science
forward that to ask the question:
what is a comet?
"Every time we look we find our textbooks were wrong."
Popular astronomy has long
imagined the comets to be dirty
chunks of ice moving through
electrically neutral space.
But, a growing number of electrical experts
see comets as charged bodies responding
electrically as they move more deeply
into the electric field of the Sun.
One question leads
inexorably to another.
How are comets formed?
What holds the spherical coma in place
against the force of the solar wind?
How are the long filamentary
tails created and
maintained in the extreme
vacuum of space?
What force creates and confines the
powerful collimated jets from the nucleus?
What is the source of the intensely
energetic X-ray emissions?
Spacecraft have now visited
a half-dozen comets,
and popular theory cannot withstand
the surprises that followed.
"Comets are perhaps at once the most spectacular and the
least well understood members of the solar system."
"It’s a mystery to me how comets work at all."
The collapse of theory began with
the visit to Comet Halley, and the
discovery of forbidden negative ions
close to the coma of the comet.
Astronomers were stunned to find that
the bone-dry surface of Borrelly
was the opposite of the
"dirty snowball" expected.
Then the foundations of the Oort cloud
theory were overthrown by a series of
discoveries beginning with the
recovery of comet dust from Wild 2.
The dust could not be
distinguished from the diverse
materials of planets in the
habitable zone of the Sun.
In 2005, we fired a projectile into
the nucleus of Comet Tempel 1.
The outcome of that comet visit
contradicted every theorist's expectations
while confirming the explicit predictions
of the electric comet model.
Disruption of radio signals
from the impactor,
the advanced flash,
the astonishing energies of the impact explosion,
the sharply carved surface of the nucleus,
direct evidence of surface arcing,
the changing jet positions,
the overwhelming dominance of dust, not water,
in the immediate explosion.
Then, we returned to the comet in 2011, and
found that the excavation of mesas and
ridges on the nucleus had occurred exactly
as the electric model has long claimed.
We visited the highly active
Comet Hartley 2 in 2010,
for the electrical theorists the
findings that so surprised and perplexed
mission scientists were
in no way surprising.
The radically different composition
of the two lobes of the nucleus;
the jets erupting from
regions in shadow;
the absence of vents to the imagined
subsurface pressure chambers;
the smooth dust-covered waist; and
the shiny cubicles on the surface;
all point emphatically to
the electric comet.
Decades of comet exploration
have now demonstrated beyond any
reasonable doubt the inseparable
connection of comet activity
to electrical attributes
of the Sun and it's domain.
The erratic flaring of comets and the
explosive disintegration of such bodies
occur naturally in the
Suns electric field
and particularly in response
to a sudden increase
in charged particles
ejected by the Sun.
Nor can comet science afford to
ignore the experimental evidence.
Most significantly the ability of
the electric arcs to create the
extraordinary morphologies of comet
nuclei and their cousins, asteroids.
Our understanding of comets is
already and forever changed.
And this new perspective
does not stop with comets.
Verification of the electric
comet, will eventually
touch everything we thought
we knew about the cosmos,
about solar system history and about
the history of our own planet Earth.

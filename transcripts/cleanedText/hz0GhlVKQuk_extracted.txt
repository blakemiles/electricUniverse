New scientific reports are
again forcing planetary
scientists to rewrite the
history of our Moon.
A new study into the lunar surface
contradicts the notion that
cratering on the moon occurs
incrementally over vast eons of time.
A team of scientists studied
several thousands of
before-and-after images of
the Moon's surface
with the visual data covering
nearly a million square miles.
What they found is that lunar
cratering appears to occur at a rate
more than 100 times faster than the
standard impact model has predicted.
The lead author of
the study states:
"Before the Lunar Reconnaissance
Orbiter was launched in 2009,
we thought that it took
hundreds of thousands
to millions of years to change the
lunar surface layers significantly.
But we've discovered that the
moon's uppermost surface materials
are completely turned over in
something like 80,000 years."
A Phys.org report on
the study states:
"The number of craters is
greater than anticipated
by standard impact-modeling
rates used by lunar scientists.
The discovery has the effect of giving
lunar surface features younger ages.
Theory says that a lunar geologic
unit should accumulate a certain
number of craters of a given size
in a million years, for example.
But if it turns out that impacts
are making craters more quickly,
then it takes less time to
reach the benchmark number,
and the geologic unit is in reality
younger than theory predicts."
Unfortunately, the only process
the scientists have considered
for the astonishingly high rate of
cratering is impacts from space.
However, many of recent discoveries
reported on this series should
provide a doorway to alternative
theoretical possibilities.
A clue can be found in
investigations into dramatic
electrostatic dust raising events on
various bodies in the solar system.
In August, we reported on a recent
NASA funded study which confirms
that electrostatic dust transportation
occurs on airless bodies in space.
This includes the electrostatic dust
storms and electrical discharges
that are regularly
observed on the Moon
when it passes through
the Earth's magnetotail.
As described by NASA
scientist Tim Stubbs:
Earth's magnetotail extends well
beyond the orbit of the Moon
and once a month the
Moon orbits through it.
It's gonna have consequences
ranging from lunar dust storms
to electrostatic discharges.
Could at least some of
the new lunar craters be
the result of this kind of
electrostatic activity?
Electrical discharges to solid
surfaces and to plates of dust
result in cratering and many other geological
features familiar to planetary science
as we repeatedly referenced in
these experiments by Billy Yelverton.
In fact, in recent years the scientific
mainstream has begun to recognize
the role of electrical forces
in altering the lunar soil.
A scientific paper in 2014 explored
the possibility that so-called
"electrical sparking" may occur
under the Moon's surface.
But the surprisingly high rate of new
lunar craters is only the latest
of many unresolved problems with
the Moon's speculative history.
In the 20th century the discovery
of apparently discrepant ages
of melted lunar rocks contributed
to the invention of an era called
"The Late Heavy Bombardment" though
astronomers do not roundly accept the theory
and it's not clear where the bombarding
objects would have come from.
In the Electric Universe theory,
as developed by the chief principles
of The Thunderbolts Project,
the massive cratering on the Moon and
every heavily cratered planetary body
was a product of electrical discharge
scarring at an interplanetary scale.
Numerous references to past
presentations on this theory
can be found in the description
box of this video.
Of course any new electrical
cratering occurring on the Moon today
would be at a vastly smaller
scale than the events
that violently scarred
its surface from pole to pole.
In any case, new scientific data
will continue to make it more clear
that cratering is not the result of periodic
impacts from space over eons of time.
Electrical cratering is just one
of many new pathways of discovery
waiting to be explored in
our electric universe.

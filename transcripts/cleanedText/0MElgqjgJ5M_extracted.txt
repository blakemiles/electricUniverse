Scientists today are expressing their
surprise over the detection of water deposits
on an asteroid that is
thought to be pure metal.
The asteroid is
called 16 Psyche,
and it's described as a largest
metallic asteroid in the solar system.
The co-author of a new paper on the
asteroid says of the discovery:
"We did not expect a metallic asteroid like
Psyche to be covered by water and/or hydroxyl.
Metal-rich asteroids like Psyche
are thought to have formed
under dry conditions without the
presence of water or hydroxyl,
so we were puzzled by our
observations at first."
The authors of the paper have suggested
that the water was delivered by impacts
from other asteroids
in 16 Psyche's past.
However, they have also
considered the possibility
that the water was formed
by solar wind interactions
with silicates on the
asteroid's surface.
In previous Space News episodes,
Dr. Franklin Anariba,
a specialist in electrochemistry, has
proposed that a similar mechanism
may be responsible for the detection
of water molecules at Comet 67P.
Today, we asked Dr. Anariba for his
analysis of this new discovery.
[Dr. Franklin Anariba] Observations indicate that comets
and even asteroids appear to us to behave unexpectedly.
This is partly due to the lack
of complete understanding
of cometary phenomena
due to its complexity.
I've previously proposed the presence
of 3 competing mechanisms in action
in cometary bodies for the identification
of water and other organic volatiles.
These are: 1. Sublimation of volatiles
from the nucleus due to solar radiation.
This option applies once their presence on the
surface of the nucleus has been confirmed.
2. Water formation on the surface of
refractory materials, such as silicates,
due to proton implantation
through the solar wind.
3. Water and organic material
formation driven electrochemically.
This is realistic since charge
separation, voltage differentials,
the presence of electric fields, and ion
re-concentration due to the electric fields,
have been reported, which allows for a
serious consideration of the mechanism.
Recently, it was published
that asteroid 16 Psyche,
which consists of
mostly Fe-Ni metal
and is thought to be the largest
metallic asteroid in the solar system,
may have traces of water
molecules on its surface.
The authors find that near infrared absorption
features in the proximity of 3,000 nanometers,
can be attributed to the presence
of water or hydroxyl ion.
This is particularly relevant
because a similar phenomenon
was reported to be present
on the surface of the Moon:
"The Deep Impact
observations of the Moon
not only unequivocally confirm the presence
of OH or H2O on the lunar surface,
but also reveal that the entire
lunar surface is hydrated
during at least some
portions of the lunar day."
Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that this
phenomenon is also hydrating asteroid 16 Psyche.
Within the framework
of a neutral medium,
the corresponding reactions can be
thought of as gas/gas reactions
if they occur above the surface
and gas/solid interface reactions
if they occur on the surface, which is
nominally called proton implantation.
Collision theory can
explain both reactions,
mostly driven by kinetic energy gained by the
particles from the solar wind or solar radiation.
The authors state:
"... the detection of a three-micrometer
absorption band suggests
that Psyche may not be metallic
core, or it could be metallic core
that has been impacted by carbonaceous
material over the past 4.5 billion years."
The infrared data is not clear-cut in
term of the definite presence of impacts
over such a long period of time,
but it's likely that such a statement is a
reflection of the current dominant paradigm.
In a non-neutral medium,
one where there is the existence
of a dynamic voltage differential
giving rise to non-zero electric fields,
charged particles such as hydroxyl (OH-)
and proton (H+) can gain kinetic
energy from electric fields,
resulting in the re-concentration
of ions along the electric fields.
Due to opposite polarities, these charged
particles will be attracted to one another,
and if their guiding
electric fields cross paths,
one can imagine a rapid and turbulent
gas/gas reaction taking place,
which could lead to large quantities
of instantaneous water formation.
In the absence of solar radiation or
heat, these water molecules can migrate,
redistribute and
condensate on surfaces.
Nonetheless, of particular importance
is that the surface of comet 67P
contains both the presence of small amount of
water on its surface and carbonaceus materials.
These are facts.
And perhaps the same mechanism
is at action on both bodies;
asteroid 16 Psyche
and Comet 67P.

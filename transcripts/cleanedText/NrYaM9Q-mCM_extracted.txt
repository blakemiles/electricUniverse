Welcome to Space News from
the Electric Universe,

A new NASA report describes the
potential dangers that the electrical
environments of asteroids could pose to
astronauts and future space missions.
NASA scientists are now attempting
to create computer models
that will successfully predict
dangerous electrical interactions
between an approaching
spacecraft and an asteroid.
The report begins with a brief,
surprising description of space,
rarely seen in official
NASA press releases,
"Space may appear empty ― a soundless
vacuum, but it's not an absolute void.
It flows with electric activity
that is not visible to our eyes."
The Electric Universe theory,
as developed by Wal Thornhill,
has always stated that comets and
asteroids are charged bodies
that sometimes discharge as they interact
with the Sun's weak electric field.
However, while NASA's new investigation may
seem like a concession of these points,
a closer examination reveals that little
has changed in their theoretical approach.
It could be forgiven for
thinking, after reading
a report from NASA on
June the 25th titled,
'New NASA model gives glimpse into the
invisible world of electric asteroids'.
that somehow or another, NASA was beginning
to take heed of the Electric Universe.
But when you read the article, you realize
nothing could be further from the truth.
The article begins with some
promise. It says and I quote,
"Space may appear empty ― a soundless
vacuum, but it's not an absolute void.
It flows with electric activity
that is not visible to our eyes.
NASA is developing plans to
send humans to an asteroid,
and wants to know more about the electrical
environment explorers will encounter there."
It seems that this concern really sprang
from unexpected electrostatic effects
when the astronauts
first visited the Moon.
It was found that the dust from
the surface clung to everything
and there were obvious electrical
effects in the dust's behavior.
This particular article goes on
and talks about the solar wind
"...which is blown from the surface of
the Sun at about a million miles per hour
and flows around all
solar system objects,
forming swirling eddies
and vortices in its wake.
Magnetic fields carried by the
solar wind warp, twist, and snap
as they slam into the magnetic fields
around other objects in our solar system,
blasting particles to
millions of miles per hour
and sending electric currents surging in
magnetic storms that, around the Earth,
can damage sensitive technology
like satellites and power grids."
So this electricity is
really dangerous stuff,
but here we see the
usual false ideas.
A solar wind blown from
the surface of the Sun?
It is not blown from
the surface of the Sun,
it accelerates away from the Sun.
And what's more, the high speed winds
come from the coolest parts of the Sun
known as coronal holes.
So it's not the heat of the Sun
that accelerates these particles
throughout the solar system.
It is an electric field.
And then this article goes on to talk about
magnetic fields which do all the work,
they twist and snap.
Well, there is no way you
can snap a magnetic field.
The magnetic field line is a concept
like a line of longitude or latitude
which cannot snap. It
is merely a concept.
So, if the magnetic fields are not
causing these energetic events, what is?
Well, the Electric Universe
turns it all around
and says the very things
that you're observing,
these electric currents surging in
magnetic storms, are that main drivers,
they are the things that actually create
the magnetic fields in the solar wind.
So when you treat the Sun and the other
objects in the solar system as charged bodies,
and that the solar wind
is actually a plasma
which can transfer current
from one object to another,
you begin to see things in
an entirely different light.
Occasional cometary
displays by asteroids
is a long-standing puzzle
for mainstream science.
The puzzle became more
complicated in late 2013
when astronomers observed an asteroid
with an astonishing six comet-like tails.
The asteroid has since been officially
recategorized as a main belt comet.
While NASA is now investigating the
electrical environments of asteroids,
the limited surface effects that
mainstream theory describes,
will never explain the
observed phenomena.
The article says,
"On airless objects like
moons and asteroids,
sunlight rejects negatively
charged electrons from matter,
giving sunlit areas a strong
positive electric charge."
Now, this is taking a very simplistic
view, rather like we see with comets,
what happens on the surface of the
moon or on an asteroid or on comets
is all due to solar radiation
and surface effects,
photoelectric effects,
that kind of thing.
The Electric Universe says that an asteroid
is a charged object, rather like a comet,
and that the charge on its
surface will be greater
than anything imagined
by scientists at NASA.
It's merely common sense when
sending astronauts to an asteroid,
that you should make sure that they are
earthed to the spacecraft or to the asteroid.
It's the same kind of problem
that electronics engineers face
when messing around with
transistorized circuits.
They must also be earthed
so that they don't discharge to the
electronic circuits and blow the transistors.
The last thing the astronauts
want is for their electronics
to fail on touchdown
on an asteroid.
In 2005, Wal Thornhill and
The Thunderbolts Project
published a series of
successful predictions
before NASA's Deep Impact
mission to comet Tempel 1.
Among these, Thornhill suggested that the
copper projectile fired at the comet,
would produce not one
but two bright flashes
including an advanced electrical flash
before impact to the comet's surface.
The Electric Universe makes
a more significant warning.
Based on the electrical model
of comets and asteroids,
I made the prediction before
the Deep Impact mission
that, when the probe
approached the comet
there would be a spark
before it touched the comet.
And this is what we're seeing.
It's been explained a way, in various ways
which are hardly sensible or feasible.
But having predicted it,
it was something that should have
been investigated as a possibility.
But it hasn't been.
And this is one of the things
which will dog the astronauts
who try and land on an asteroid.
That the charge on the asteroid
may be greater than expected.
But there is one saving
grace with plasma.
And that is that, if the
approach is slow enough,
the plasma itself will
act as a conductor
between the spacecraft and the
asteroid and will equalize the charge.
So that all that is
required in my opinion,
as the astronauts in their
spacecraft approach the asteroid,
is that some kind of lightning
conductor is aimed at the asteroid
from the spacecraft before
the closest approach.
The Electric Universe theory proposes
that neither comets nor asteroids
are primordial leftovers from the
formation of the solar system.
But rather, they are the products
of recent planetary catastrophes.
An opportunity to test this
theory arrived in 2004,
with NASA's Stardust mission
to the comet Wild 2.
A chemical analysis of a sample
from the comet's dust tail
astonish scientists around the world revealing
a mineral composition vastly different
from the expected aggregation of ices
and primordial interstellar dust.
Despite these findings,
scientists continue to assume
that both comets and
asteroids are Rosetta stones
providing insight into
the early solar system.
Like many of the space probes by NASA, the
reason given for the actual experiments are
that we are visiting asteroids because
they are 'relatively pristine remnants
from the formation of the solar
system' quoting from the article.
So, they give clues as to how the
planets formed and life originated.
Now, this is one of the areas
where NASA is completely wrong
because the story of the solar
system and how it was formed,
has never been shown to
work. It is merely a story.
The Electric Universe,
on the other hand,
has looked at the recent
history of the solar system
as recorded by our ancient
forebears in various ways
and it seems that the solar system
has had a recent chaotic spasm
during which material has been ripped
from the surface of Mars, in particular,
but also other bodies,
and hurled into space.
And asteroids and comets, in that scenario,
are the remnants of planetary surfaces.
Now, it's always been acknowledged that
asteroids show some kind of processing.
The minerals and so on from the asteroids, show
that they have been on a planetary surface.
But this is assumed to have
been the result of collisions,
early on in the formation
of the solar system.
We're saying these
things are quite recent
and that there is no real difference
between comets and asteroids.
And this particular claim has been borne
out by almost every experiment done
to determine the
composition of comets.
So it's important that we do try
and find out more about asteroids
because this will tell us about the
recent history of the solar system
and may actually give us the clues
we need to be absolutely certain
that the story of the chaotic
history of the solar system
and the destruction of the
Martian surface is correct.
It should be made clear
that the magnetic field
contained by the solar
wind, is not explained.
The magnetic fields on the Sun
are not well explained either.
The so-called convection zone
beneath the surface of the Sun,
that is supposed to generate the
magnetic fields, has not been found!
So, NASA keeps falling into this trap of
using magnetism mysteriously generated,
or magically generated, to explain everything
that goes on in the solar system.
And that even applies to the electric
currents, which they acknowledge,
between Jupiter and Saturn
and their respective moons.
Until we can see that the electric
currents are primary causes
and not merely effects, NASA
will find more anomalies.

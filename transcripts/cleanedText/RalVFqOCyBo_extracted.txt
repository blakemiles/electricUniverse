Central to this series has been the
argument that cosmology is presently at
a crisis point and headed towards an
inevitable paradigm shift, or revolution.
And secondly, that the Electric Universe model has an
important role to play in the cosmology of the future.
The term ‘paradigm shift’ underlines 
much of the series. It was made popular
through Thomas Kuhn’s seminal work 
“The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.”
Since the publication of this book in 1962,
there has been much misunderstanding and/or
misrepresentation of its overall thesis.
Let's revisit Kuhn's work and clarify
its meaning and give some examples of
why cosmology is still in crisis in 2023.
It is important to note that Kuhn did not set out
to write the book that he eventually ended up with.
He originally set out to write a book
about the history of science, and
discovered something unexpected about
how science is done along the way.
In the process of exploring the history
of scientific change, Kuhn discovered
that predominant or institutionalized
science operates much differently than
how we've been led to believe it does.
The larger and deeper thesis of
”Structure” is that predominant science
ultimately does not do science the way it
claims to-meaning that it is not absolutely 
empirical. Through historical study of science,
Kuhn discovered that once a paradigm becomes deeply
entrenched and institutionalized, it often becomes
dogmatic, hegemonic, and unyielding to falsification
and change. Almost by accident, Kuhn's work became an
interrogation of science in and of
itself, and it paints an unflattering but
arguably more realistic picture of
science than the idealized or utopian
image of science as presented by for instance,
one of Kuhn's biggest critics, Karl Popper.
Popper was an Austrian-born philosopher
with a doctorate in psychology.“
For Popper quote "...the ‘core scientific
ethic’ was falsifiability-meaning that all
knowledge, at all times, should be exposed to
constant and deliberate criticism.” End quote.
This is what distinguishes science from
non-science, according to Popper. Kuhn
would wholeheartedly agree with Popper. Falsifiability
should be the core scientific ethic or principle.
The problem is, that in reality, or in practice, 
it is not. And this is what Kuhn's work reveals.
Another critic of Kuhn’s was Austrian-born
philosopher of science Paul Feyerabend.
Feyerabend is most known for his book ”Against Method”,
wherein he argues that there are no universally valid
methodological rules for scientific inquiry, and instead 
champions theoretical pluralism. Both Feyerabend
and Popper accuse Kuhn of glorifying normal science
and hiding behind it. Kuhn argued that science does not
progress gradually, organically, but is
actually forced to change due to crisis
and model breakdown. This happens through
a paradigm shift process with distinct
stages. Normal science is the stage where a field
or discipline has a scientifically based model of
understanding that works, and can properly guide 
the field. Because Kuhn uses the word ‘crisis’ to
describe later stages, Feyerabend and
Popper accused Kuhn of wanting science
to always stay at the stage of normal
science and therefore of resisting
paradigm criticism and change. This is a blatant
misreading and misrepresentation of Kuhn. Kuhn
did not insist that science should not
progress beyond the non-problematic
stage of normal science. On the contrary,
he revealed and lamented that scientists
tend to insist that they are doing normal
science, meaning that their model and
paradigm has no holes or problems, long 
after the model has started to drift and fail.
His book “Structure” problematizes the
fact that in practice, predominant
science attempts to force a model to
stay at the normal stage-meaning
’business as usual’, despite mounting
anomalies and contradictions that the
model cannot adequately address. This is 
especially true in the field of cosmology.
As the esteemed philosopher of
science Ian hacking points out in his
introductory essay to the 2012 edition
of Kuhn's book, Big Bang cosmology is
quote “...full of outstanding problems
pursued as normal science.” End quote.
This is the crux of the problem and this
is why Kuhn's work is indispensable for
any critical analysis of the present state of 
cosmology. For Kuhn, after ‘normal science’ the
predominant model of understanding
starts to drift due to the accumulation
of anomalies and phenomena that the
model cannot explain. This is the ‘model
drift’ stage. At this stage, rather than address the
problems directly and re-examine their premises and
assumptions, Kuhn found that scientists
working within a predominant model, focus
on patching the model up and attempting
to manage the problem. This process of
perpetual patchwork actually creates
more problems and more contradictions,
and eventually leads to crisis and model 
breakdown. This is where standard cosmology
presently finds itself - at the stage of
’model crisis’ and ‘model breakdown’.
Contemporary cosmology is still in deep
crisis and the awareness of this crisis
is increasing every day. Mainstream
cosmologists even openly use the word
’crisis’ to describe their present reality.
And mainstream media is full of
headlines that suggest that cosmology is in 
deep trouble. As physicist and science writer Eric
Lerner points out, in 2019 there were 130
media references to the crisis in cosmology,
which marks an exponential increase from the mid-
2000s where there were only 12 references a year.
We first explored the crisis in 2021 and it
has only gotten worse since then. In 2023,
there have already been numerous expert
panels and symposiums that discussed the
growing crisis in cosmology and astrophysics.
The crisis in cosmology centers around
new information, measurements, and/or
findings that undermine or contradict the
major principles, assumptions and/or
expectations of the Big Bang Theory in some way.
These include, new information or
measurements that suggest that the
universe is not expanding as we thought
or at all, known as the Hubble tension;
that the universe is older or younger
than the standard model claims; and that
the universe is more or less homogenous than we 
thought. There are also numerous foundational
predictions of the Big Bang Theory that
have been contradicted by abundant
observations, including various
observations and accurate predictions
made by Electric Universe proponents such as the late
Wal Thornhill. The most recent problems have been
sparked by even more contradictory
measurements and observations that are
coming back every day from the James
Webb Space Telescope. In a recent video
Michio Kaku states that “The James
Webb Telescope is upsetting the apple
cart. All of a sudden, we realize that we
may have to rewrite all of the textbooks
about the beginning of the universe.”
Kaku: “Well that's the problem, the James
Webb Space Telescope is upsetting the
apple cart. All of a sudden, we realize
that we may have to rewrite all the
textbooks about the beginning of the
universe. Now, it takes many billions of
years to create a galaxy, like the Milky
Way galaxy with a hundred billion stars,
many billions of years old. But the James
Webb Telescope has identified six
galaxies that exist half a billion years
after the Big Bang that are up to 10
times bigger than the Milky Way galaxy.
That shouldn't happen. There should not be
primordial galaxies that are bigger than
the Milky Way galaxy that are only half a billion years
old. Something is wrong. We may have to revise our theory
of the creation of the universe.” In another recent
video, Science Time 24 magazine reports that the
James Webb Telescope has discovered
six ancient galaxies that shatter our
understanding of the universe.
Beyond these individual contradictions
or discrepancies, the larger and
deeper crisis has to do with Standard
Cosmology's underlying narrative and its very
approach to cosmology in the first place.
As theoretical physicists Sabine Hossenfelder aptly
pointed out at a recent symposium entitled: ‘What is wrong
with current physics’, a good scientific
explanation should quote “...be as simple as
possible and you shouldn't add any
unnecessary assumptions, no matter how
much you need them to justify your hypothesis.” 
End quote. It's interesting to note that simplicity
is actually one of Thomas Kuhn's main criteria
for model revolution and paradigm change.
Hossenfelder maintains that the stories
and assumptions of current physics are
all quote “...creation myths written in the 
language of mathematics.” End quote.
She concludes that while we don't know
if Big Bang creationists are wrong, we
also cannot say that they are right,
because quote “...they just add this
unnecessary structure at a time where
we don't have any data.” End quote.
At the same symposium, Eric Lerner argued
that the Big Bang is a theory that quote
”...requires imaginary entities that are
made up after the fact.” End quote. He
explains that without imaginary concepts
and entities like inflation, dark matter,
and dark energy, the theory basically collapses.
These concepts were introduced to quote
”...prevent or overcome severe conflicts
with observation.” End quote. For instance,
as Lerner explains, without dark energy
under the Big Bang, the universe would be
younger than the Milky Way galaxy.
And without dark matter, the universe
wouldn't form any clusters or galaxies at all.
He maintains that quote “...you can't say
that you want a pure Big Bang without
all this fairy dust.” End quote. Lerner
concludes that we should look to alternative theories
that rely on verified laboratory evidence and points
to his own work on plasma phenomena as an 
example. In a very recent Symposium entitled
’Beyond the Darkness, Dark Matter,
a Baseless Hypothesis?’ scientist and
professor John Joe McFadden points out
quote “...decades of searching have so far
revealed exactly zero dark matter
particles, and now some cosmologists are
starting to look for alternative models of the
universe that don't posit dark matter.” End quote.
For Eric Lerner, the real crisis in
cosmology is that the Big Bang never
happened a sentiment that is echoed by
Electric Universe proponents. Whatever
alternative one chooses to explore,
it is becoming increasingly apparent that
current cosmology and astrophysics are
in deep trouble, or to use Kuhns language,
are presently at the ‘crisis stage’. At the crisis stage,
scientists continue to attempt to patch up the model, but
also go beyond this, inventing convoluted
ad hoc revisions in an effort to deflect
or mask the mounting contradictions and
inconsistencies. Now, with respect to the
current crisis in standard cosmology,
scientists are doing this and so much
more. Many working within the Standard
Model actually double down and triple
down on the model's contradictions and inconsistencies,
and have even gone as far as to celebrate them and
characterize them as exciting
opportunities for future research.
One example is a claim made in a PBS
space-time video entitled ‘The New Crisis
in Cosmology’. In this video, the host
argues that, while contradictory
measurements on how fast the universe is
expanding, or the Hubble tension, are
getting worse, this is actually exciting
because the growing contradiction and
crisis opens up new avenues for research.
One can imagine that if and when the
James Webb Telescope brings back even
more contradictory measurements and
observation-let's say that the Big Bang
happened much, much earlier than they
originally thought-that Big Bang
scientists will again move the goal
posts, giving them enough patchwork to keep 
them busy and in business for generations to come.
This die-hard reluctance to question
a failing model flies in the face of
falsifiability which, as we recall, is the
underlying ethic of science according to
Karl Popper. The fact that science shuns
falsifiability, which is supposed to be
its fundamental principle when it is most
urgently needed, begs the question why?
Either science is not what Popper claims it to
be, or there's something else at play, or both.
When viewed from a socio-cultural
perspective, one begins to see power and
hegemony at play and this is what Kuhn’s work
strongly implies. What begins to emerge at the crisis
stage, is the idea that institutionalized
and entrenched scientific models, and
those working within them, tend to become
more concerned with not relinquishing
power and self-preservation than
empirical observation and problem
solving, or the pursuit of truth and new knowledge.
The main takeaway from Kuhn's work and
from the present state of cosmology,
is that entrenched, or institutionalized
science does not do, or is not willing 
to do, what it claims to do-test the
theories and hypotheses empirically
and change course when needed.
If that is the case then can we still call it science?
Popper and others were infuriated by such
findings and implications, not least
because it tarnished the idealized and
noble image of science that had been
espoused up until the publication of
Kuhn's book. It is worth restating that
Kuhn also held science to a higher
standard, and he hoped for it to conduct itself
empirically. Kuhn did not set out to tarnish the
image of science. He was a trained
physicist after all. But as any truly
empirical scientist can attest to,
scientists often end up with unexpected
results once they enter the lab and
conduct their experiments and analyses.
In the case of Kuhn, his lab was history
itself, and as a true empiricist, he was
not willing to deny or skew his findings,
no matter how unpleasant or inconvenient
they may be to the status quo. And he
suffered tremendously for his integrity.
Since the publication of his
groundbreaking book Kuhn has been
attacked, both personally and
professionally, for shining an
unflattering light on the true nature of institutionalized
science. For his opponents, one of Kuhn's biggest
crimes was making conclusions in what
they perceive as predictions about how
science operates based on history. In other 
words, they condemned him for being historical.
We should point out that historicism is
defined as quote “...an approach to
explaining the existence of phenomena,
especially social and cultural practices
(including ideas and beliefs), by studying
their history, that is by studying the
process by which they came about.” End quote.
Now it seems strange, if not duplicitous,
to condemn the author of a book on the history
of science for using history in his analysis.
This criticism of Kuhn is in fact an
Orwellian act that condemns historicism
for philosophical reasons that date
all the way back to philosophical
disagreements from antiquity, when Kuhn
is merely using history as a method. And
it begs the question, why not just refute
or attempt to disprove Kuhn's findings?
But rather than refute Kuhn's findings,
his critics condemn him for arriving at
them in the first place. In what appears
to be an obvious case of ‘shoot the
messenger’. For instance, in his critique
of Kuhn, American social philosopher and
hardcore proponent of transhumanism, Steve Fuller,
accuses him of presenting an image of predominant or
institutionalized science and science
education that resembles a quote “mini-
Vatican”, a “Royal Dynasty”, and even “the Mafia”,
end quote. For opponents like Fuller, Kuhn is guilty
of presenting a predominant paradigm as
quote “...an irrefutable theory that becomes
the basis for an irreversible policy” end 
quote. It is interesting to note that Kuhn's
detractors never attempt to disprove
this particular view of dominant science.
They simply complain and condemn Kuhn
for having the nerve to come to such a
conclusion in the first place and for
using historical analysis to get there.
While Fuller and others may be outraged
by Kuhn's depiction of institutional
science, evidence of his findings is not
hard to find, especially in cosmology.
For instance, for an example of the
circular and self-preserving nature of
predominant science, one need only
look at an article in Discover magazine
entitled “Could the Big Bang be Wrong?”,
author Corey S. Powell states that quote
”...we have a lot to learn about our place
in nature's grand scheme. But we can be
quite confident that, wherever future
theories and discoveries take us, the Big
Bang will be part of the picture.” End quote.
Given Powell's statement, we can assume
that the answer to the article's title ”Could
the Big Bang be Wrong?” is a resounding no.
The article more or less implies that there 
can be no advancement from the Big
Bang to any alternative theory, since the
Big Bang is the best one to ever exist.
Now, if this is not an example of an
irrefutable theory that becomes the
basis for an irreversible policy, then I don't 
know what is. Given the current state of
institutionalized science and the
current crisis in Standard Cosmology, I
think it is fair to say that Kuhn's findings still 
hold and are presently more valid than ever.
Sorry Popper and Company, but if it looks, sounds 
and acts like a duck, then Kuhn must be right.
Kuhn's work is a paradigm shift in 
and of itself in so far as it radically
changed the way we view and understand 
science. This is why it angered, and continues to
anger, so many mainstream scientists
and philosophers. Its larger thesis is a
commentary on how science is done
and how we as humans carry it out.
Essentially, Kuhn's work reveals that,
at the institutional level, science often
ceases to be empirical and becomes
unyielding, preventing its own progress.
Kuhn’s paradigm shift cycle is presently
unfolding right before our eyes. The
current crisis in cosmology proves this
and has vindicated Kuhn from beyond the
grave. Mainstream cosmology even uses
the word ‘crisis’ which is one of Kuhn’s
definitive stages to describe its present reality.
At the same time, Standard Cosmology has
been unwilling to address the crisis in
any meaningful way and is not open to
new ideas or falsification. These are telltale signs of
the unyielding dogmatic and self-preserving nature of
institutionalized science. For this reason, Kuhn's work
is even more relevant today and is indispensable for
understanding the true nature of predominant science,
and the present state of cosmology in particular.
One cannot ignore the similarities between Thornhill
and Kuhn. Both of these great thinkers were unwaveringly
empirical in their search for truth, and
both dared to report their findings with
honesty and integrity, no matter how controversial
it made them. In light of Wal’s passing, it is more
important than ever to highlight the implications of
Kuhn's work and what it reveals about the true nature of
predominant science, and allows us to appreciate just how
important, and how courageous, Wal’s work and legacy are.

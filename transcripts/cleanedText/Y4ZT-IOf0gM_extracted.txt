several thousand years ago events of
beauty and Terror provoked an explosion
of human
imagination this was the myth making
epic of human
history first came the enchanted realm
the theater of venerated gods and
goddesses the gods were
prodigious their Celestial habitat
towered over the world a model for
temples and commemorative monuments on
[Music]
Earth
but the gods grew
capricious one Celestial power
metamorphosed into
another Preposterous creatures never
seen on Earth roamed the
sky
[Music]
the gods turned violent as Heaven itself
fell into
chaos then Celestial Warriors and
monsters appeared to battle in the
heavens wielding weapons of thunder and
fire and
stone our challenge will be to account
for this outpouring of Mythic
content
the eminent psychoanalyst Carl Yung
called these deep patterns the
archetypes he saw them as universal
structures of the unconscious lyed
Beyond rational or scientific
[Music]
explanation yes the myths seem
incomprehensible to us but the
archetypes offer a pathway through the
confusion
they are the points of agreement between
the far-flung
cultures and this agreement rises above
the carnival of confusion and
[Music]
contradiction every major culture
remembered a cosmic Mountain around
which the heavens
[Music]
turned
[Music]
and every culture chronicled the
terrible aspect of the mother
[Music]
goddess were there no common experience
the archetypal agreement would not even
be
[Music]
possible all that is required here is a
willingness to meet the archetypes and
without fear or Prejudice or any
advanced assumptions to hear their
[Music]
message the existence of hundreds of
archetypes is a fact and it is a fact as
well that no archetype speaks for
natural events occurring today not a
single
[Music]
one
at the dawn of civilization all of the
archetypes were already
[Music]
present today we are fascinated by the
Monumental scale of the antique
civilizations
but what were the essential memories
that drove the Monumental culture so
[Applause]
[Music]
obsessively the threads of evidence
traced deep into the prehistoric past a
world barely recognized but not entirely
lost
more than 10,000 years ago pic artists
painted these images on the walls of Las
Skull Cave in France they were realists
with an exceptional eye for
[Music]
detail why these talented artists of the
Stone Age disappeared remains a
[Music]
mystery but the greater mystery is the
Epic that
[Music]
followed it seems that Neolithic artists
lost the ability to depict nature as we
know
it accurate representations of nature
are
present but the dominant style produced
a carnival of ghostly creatures and
absurd forms never seen in our
[Music]
world how did this tendency arise not in
one land alone but on every habitable
continent absurd yes but what provoked
the distinctive
patterns a stick man with no head just a
duck or other bird on his
shoulders hundreds of variations on this
theme occur in the American
southwest but the pattern doesn't end
there notice the twin dots on the two
sides of these crudely crafted stick
figures one instance alone is just just
a
[Music]
curiosity but widespread patterns must
have an
explanation and other details only
accent the
[Music]
irrationality recently an answer to
these Mysteries came from outside
traditional archaeology from plasma
science and laboratory experiments with
electric
discharge plasma scientist Anthony parat
of Los Alamos Laboratories has shown
that these sck forms recorded electrical
events in the
sky something like the Northern Lights
we see today but a thousand times more
energetic and he matches the rockart
forms precisely to the configurations
taken by Electric discharge in the the
laboratory the rock art images are
explained as sheets of intense electric
current in the evolution of a plasma
discharge the central column you see in
this stylized representation is the axis
of the
discharge wrapped around the axis is a
Taurus or donut like tubular sheet of
charged particles The Observer sees
through the transparent formation
champagne glass above squashed bell
shaped below so the plasma density is
greatest at the
limbs drawn in two Dimensions the
formation matches the stick man carved
globally on Stone by the
thousands the two dots under the stick
man's arms are the exceedingly bright
high energy radiation called sron
radiation emitted from the center of the
Taurus
[Music]
the current sheets continually warp as
the electric discharge progresses and
this form is not
uncommon a two-dimensional
representation might look like
this Pratt's work has shown that the
stickman the duckhead version of the
American southwest and variations from
Hawaii to Saudi Arabia is a plasma
discharge formation a subject in which
he is an acknowledged World
[Music]
expert parat investigation is entirely
independent from our
own thousands of rock art images have
enabled a supercomputer to identify
formations as seen from different
positions on Earth the fit that he has
documented cannot be
accidental

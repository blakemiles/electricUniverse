Throughout the 20th century, the science
of comparative mythology has been
characterized by an ever-increasing
specialization and narrowing of interest.
Unifying theories of myth are nowhere to be found.
The so-called Saturn theory represents a
notable exception in this regard.
Proponents of the theory, including David
Talbott and myself, have argued that
extraordinary astronomical events in the
relatively recent prehistorical period,
had profound and formative influence on
all primary institutions of human
culture, including mythology, religion
language, monumental architecture,
funerary practices, marriage ritual,
cosmology, athletics, dance and music.
Stated this boldly, our historical
reconstruction seems so ambitious as to inspire
incredulity. Once the evidence is fully laid out
however, it speaks for itself.
While it would be impossible to
summarize a lifetime of research within
a 10-minute presentation, and we intend to
use the next several videos to
illustrate some of the most salient
evidence supporting the theory,
interested viewers can turn to our
manifold publications for additional information.
A testimony of ancient religion is
especially compelling. In ancient 
Mesopotamia and Egypt, the
principal gods are identified with celestial bodies.
In the earliest strata of Mesopotamian
Uruk, conventionally dated the last 
third of the fourth millennium BCE,
it is the worship of the planet Venus as
Innana that predominates. So too at the
dawn of history in Egypt, the leading 
god Horus, is explicitly identified with a
star. In our reconstruction that star is
Mars. And yet mainstream scholars rarely
ask the all-important question, why
planetary bodies assumed this prominent
role in the oldest religious texts?
The evidence from the earliest written
languages corroborates this picture.
Writing was first invented in ancient
Mesopotamia in the fourth millennium BCE and
the earliest script was pictographic in nature.
I.e. the vast majority of the written
signs were pictures of the object being
described. For example, a foot 
signified a foot or, ‘to walk’.
In perfect keeping with our hypothesis that
the earliest gods were astronomical in nature,
Sumerian scribes denoted the concept of
God with an eight-pointed star. This is a
so-called ‘An’-sign. The 
earliest pictograph for Inanna
Venus in turn, depicted a comet-like object.
Our theory, and our theory alone, can
explain these facts. The first 
gods were identified with the
most prominent celestial bodies and the
queen of heaven, as Venus, spent a portion
of her early career as a comet-like body.
The Saturn theory is most famous perhaps
for the claim that a giant pillar-like
structure formerly spanned the
circumpolar heavens and seemingly linked
together a number of nearby planets.
Hence the name polar configuration
coined by Talbott, the subject of much
controversy over the decades.
While it is well documented that the
mythological traditions of cultures
around the globe celebrated a luminous
world pillar in the sky, critics tend to be
skeptical of the testimony from ancient myth.
It is here that the evidence encoded in
monumental architecture is especially
instructive and difficult to explain away.
Witness the towering pyramidal
structures and ziggurats in Egypt and
Mesopotamia that took thousands of
people and multiple generations to
construct. The ziggurat at Ur, for example,
is estimated to have weighed several
hundred thousand tons.
What could possibly have possessed the
ancient sky watchers to erect these
towering structures? What were 
they intended to represent?
According to terminology applied to the
monumental structures by the builders
themselves, the answer is patently obvious.
The ziggurats represented the world
mountain, atop which the planetary 
gods lived, loved and died.
Thus it is that among the earliest
Sumerian names for the ‘ziggurat’ are
’giant mountain’ and ‘stairway to heaven’.
And to whom were these first ziggurats
constructed and devoted? To the
aforementioned star gods Inanna Venus and An.
The earliest ziggurats and pyramids, like
sacred architecture everywhere, were
specifically patterned upon the unique
celestial configuration overhead in
accordance with the prevailing
philosophy of ’as above, so below’.
It stands to reason accordingly, that
early monumental structures will include
a number of telltale architectural
details that have no conceivable
function or rationale in the present
natural world, and point instead to the
unique features of the polar configuration.
As a case in point, consider the massive
set of shiny horns that formally
adorned the apex of early ziggurats.
At the tail end of the third millennium
king Gudea of Lagash could be found
boasting of a ziggurat quote “One makes
the house grow upwards like a mountain,
...makes it lift its horn like a bull.”
How on earth is it possible to explain
this bizarre bovine imagery? For 
anyone familiar with the writings of
Talbott and myself, the answer is obvious.
The gigantic crescentine horns model the
heaven-spanning crescent that formerly
distinguished the polar configuration
during one particularly memorable phase in its
history. But you don't have to take our word for
it. An archaic pictograph from China
dating the third millennium BCE is
believed to depict the mountain of the
Sun. While the image in question has no
conceivable reference in the present sky,
it illustrates perfectly a central claim
of the Saturn theory, namely 
that a crescent formally adorned
the world mountain and served as
the perch of the primordial Sun God.
Human institutions, not surprisingly, were
indelibly impacted by the unique and
awe-inspiring events associated with the
polar configuration. The institution of
kingship offers a perfect example. It 
will be remembered here that Sumerian
tradition held that kingship had
originally descended from heaven.
Early kings in Mesopotamia, Egypt and
Mesoamerica referred to themselves as
the son of the land and modeled their
behavior in accordance with the mythical
behavior ascribed to the prototypical
son. If the prototypical son engaged in
sexual intercourse with the planet Venus,
the Sumerian king made a public show of
simulating sex with Inanna Venus in
order to legitimize his hold on the
throne and signal his own divinity.
So too, if the prototypical son was said
to have formerly appeared as a
diminutive orb at the breast of Venus,
the Sumerian king had himself
depicted in monumental artworks
as a babe at the breast of Inanna or 
Ishtar. If the prototypical son fought
apocalyptic wars against the powers of
chaos, the kings of Sumer in Babylon
purposely sought out barbarian hordes to 
vanquish. This while proclaiming that the warrior
goddess Venus accompanied them at their
side, protecting them from all harm and
guaranteeing victory. The 
sacred garments of kings reveal the
clear imprint of extraordinary astronomical events.
Check out the royal garb of the Assyrian
king. It is as if the king wrapped
himself in iconic stellar images, namely 
those of the primordial son and Venus.
It will be noted that not one of these images has
any recognizable counterpart in the current sky.
In the earliest attested rituals of
royal investiture, each and every detail
of the king's regalia reflected the
celestial original. Crown worn by the
king for example, was expressly modeled
upon that worn by the prototypical son
at the time of beginning and is
identifiable with the planet Venus.
Thus it is that Sumerian hymns report
that the ancient Sun God tied on a mush
band as a crown, wherein the word 
'mush' is the aforementioned comet-like
pictograph denoting Inanna Venus.
The local king following a long
tradition, tied on his mush crown in 
imitation of the celestial prototype.
Nearly two thousand years later,
Assyria's great king Esarhaddon
reiterated this belief, claiming of Inanna
Venus that quote “She guards me like the
crown on my head.” What is
true in ancient Mesopotamia is
also true in Egypt and Mesoamerica.
There too the king tied on a headband
crown carefully modeled upon the planet 
Venus. Thus it is that the Egyptian ‘seshed’
headband shows the same spiraling form and 
two flowing streamers as a Sumerian mush sign.
The word ‘seshed’, as Talbott and I
pointed out 30 years ago, means ‘comet’.
Recall here the statement from a third
millennium Sumerian hymn quoted in our
previous video wherein the king
invoked Venus as follows “The ever-
sparkling lady gives me my kingship.”
The word translated as ever sparkling
here is mul-mul-e = “to shine, or radiate”, a verb
formed from the Sumerian word for star: mul=”star”
and hence referring to the
luminous splendor of Venus itself.
The clear import of this passage accordingly
is that kingship is a gift of the planet Venus.
Venus's profound influence on ancient
conceptions of kingship is simply one of
hundreds of archetypal mythological motifs that
conventional scholarship has no answer for.
Our historical reconstruction on the
other hand, explains the connection with
an unrivaled elegance and logical rigor.
Truth be told, in order to achieve a
fact-based history of our solar system,
it is sometimes necessary to ignore the
strictures of modern science and pay careful
heed to the testimony of ancient myth.

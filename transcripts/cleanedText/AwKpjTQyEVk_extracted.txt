Welcome to Space News from
the Electric Universe,
brought to you by The
Thunderbolts Project™

On this series, we have explored the
significance of the filamentary
structures seen at all scales
throughout the cosmos.
From the streaming filaments
seen in the ion tails of comets,
to the giant snake-like filaments
reaching from the surface of the Sun,
to the dark cores of sunspots.
To the stupendous filamentary
networks intimately linked
to star formation in
the Milky Way galaxy,
to the web-like filaments along which
galaxies form, like pearls on a string.
Filaments in space are the
expected features of a universe
where electric currents connect celestial
bodies across cosmic distances.
Electrical circuitry pervades interplanetary,
interstellar and even intergalactic space
which can be seen when electric
currents meet regions of dusty plasma
and pinch the material
into visible filaments.
It's therefore no surprise that the
discovery of huge filaments in space
continues to send mainstream
scientists searching for answers.
Recently, astrophysicists using
the Very Large Array telescope
have made what for them is a
completely unexpected discovery
near the center of
the Milky Way galaxy.
What they have found is a nearly
two-and-a-half light-year long filament that is
"probing the hypothetical
Black Hole at Sagittarius A".
The December 20, 2017, Phys.org report
describes the discovery as follows,
"The center of our galaxy has been
intensely studied for many years,
but it still harbors
surprises for scientists.
A snake-like structure lurking near
our galaxy's supermassive black hole
is the latest discovery to
tantalize astronomers."
The leader of a study on
the discovery stated,
"With our improved image, we can
now follow this filament
much closer to the Galaxy's
central black hole,
and it is now close enough to indicate
to us that it must originate there.
However, we still
have more work to do
to find out what the true
nature of this filament is."
The investigators are only
considering three possibilities
to explain the
mysterious filament.
One is that the hypothetical black hole
"kicked away" high-speed particles
somehow forming the
light-years long filament.
This would involve the black hole's
rotation pairing with spiraling gas
to produce an incredibly
powerful magnetic field.
Another possibility
they've entertained
is that the filament is a mathematical
conjecture called a cosmic string,
which theoretical physicists have proposed
may have formed in the early universe,
but which have never been discovered.
Ironically, as described
in the phys.org report,
it's believed that
hypothetical cosmic strings
"... are long, extremely thin objects
that carry mass and electric currents."
The final notion the scientists
have considered is that
the alignment of the filament with
the galactic center is coincidence.
However, as the
phys.org report states,
such a coincidence is quite
unlikely to happen by chance.
Unfortunately, the investigators are not
considering other more promising possibilities,
namely, that the hypothetical black hole at
the galactic center simply does not exist.
As we noted in the recent episode
'Black Holes Behaving Badly',
in astrophysics today the black hole
has become an unfalsifiable concept.
In our own Milky Way it
appears that no discovery,
including the recent observation
of star formation occurring
much too close to the
hypothetical black hole
where tidal forces must rip the gas and
dust apart before it can form stars,
will force any doubt of the
black hole's existence.
As we've outlined many times,
the position of Plasma Cosmology
and the Electric Universe
is that it is not a black hole
at the center of galaxies
but an ultra-high density
energy storage phenomenon
demonstrated for decades in
laboratories, called a plasmoid
which is a kind of load in the
Galactic electrical circuit.
The plasmoid concentrates
and stores energy
and is connected to a larger
network of electric currents.
When the plasmoid reaches a
threshold density, it discharges,
usually along a
galaxy's spin axis.
This is in fact the source
of stupendous galactic jets.
The discovery of a vast filament, such
as that recently observed, is expected
and is in fact required if it is
a plasmoid at the galactic core.
As we've noted several
times recently,
the role of magnetic fields in
sustaining cosmic filaments
is now being discussed with increasing
frequency in astrophysics.
Earlier this year, scientists reported
the first-ever measurement of the
"magnetic bridge" linking the
Milky Way's two nearest galaxies.
Known as the Magellanic bridge, the
filament stretches for approximately
75,000 light-years connecting the
Large and Small Magellanic Clouds.
One of the researchers stated,
"Not only are entire
galaxies magnetic,
but the faint delicate threads
joining galaxies are magnetic, too.
Everywhere we look in the
sky, we find magnetism."
The lead author of
the study stated,
"In general, we don't know how such
vast magnetic fields are generated,
nor how these large-scale magnetic fields
affect galaxy formation and evolution.
Understanding the role the magnetic
fields play in the evolution of galaxies
and their environment,
is a fundamental question in astronomy
that remains to be answered."
But of course, magnetism is
only a part of the story
and will always remain mysterious without
the recognition of the electric currents
required to produce and
sustain the magnetic fields.
However, we do see increasing signs that this
inevitable recognition is beginning to occur.
The December 25, 2017, issue of 'Astronomy
& Astrophysics' published the paper,
'The jets of Active Galactic Nuclei
(AGN) as giant coaxial cables'.
In looking at the properties of
stupendous parsec-scale jets,
the authors conclude that,
"...our results have now yielded firm
evidence that many ― possibly all ―
Active Galactic Nuclei jets have
inward currents along their axes
and outward currents in a more
extended region surrounding the jets.
It also indicates that astrophysical jets are
fundamentally electromagnetic structures,
which must be borne in mind when
interpreting observed features
in the distributions of both their
intensity and linear polarization."
We note the counter-rotating
magnetic fields the authors depict
in this diagram of the
jet's environment.
As those in the Electric Universe
community are well aware,
the counter-rotation has
special significance.
In recent years, Dr. Donald
Scott has developed
the mathematical modeling
of a Birkeland current
whose influence can be seen visually
in the form of counter-rotating shells
as observed in Earth's
cylindrical auroral sheets
and at the north poles of the
gas giants Saturn and Jupiter.
Dr. Scott will discuss the role of
Birkeland currents in galactic jets
in a forthcoming Space News.
Another scientific paper
published in October, 2017,
also proposes that giant electric
currents flow through the Galactic jets.
The author states:
"Several researchers have
reported direct evidence
for large-scale electric currents
along astrophysical jets.
Quite unexpectedly, their directions are
not random as would have been the case
if the magnetic field were generated
by a magneto-hydrodynamic dynamo.
Instead, in all kilo-parsec scale detections,
the inferred electric currents
are found to flow away
from the galactic nucleus.
This unexpected break of symmetry
suggests that a battery mechanism
is operating around the
central black hole."
However, we again note the futility of
scientists looking to colossal gravity
as the cause of stupendous
electromagnetic cosmic phenomena.
The question is, what can any so-called battery
do that is not connected to a circuit?
The central object in an
active galactic nucleus
must be an electromagnetic
energy storage circuit element,
the aforementioned plasmoid in a far
grander galactic and extra-galactic circuit.
Plasma cosmologists
recognized this decades ago
and it was explained excessively in the
book 'The Big Bang Never Happened'.
Yet, these concepts are nowhere to
be found in mainstream astrophysics,
leaving working scientists to ponder
undeniable electrical phenomena
with little hope of resolving
the underlying cause.
And so as we enter
the New Year of 2018,
our basis, at The Thunderbolts Project, for
optimism and confidence has never been stronger
as groundbreaking discoveries lead
scientists closer to our Electric Universe.

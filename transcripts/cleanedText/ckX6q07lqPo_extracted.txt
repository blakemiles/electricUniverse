in the next eight to ten minutes i want
to preview the presentation i'll give on
the opening night of the eu 2014
conference in albuquerque march 20th to
24th
the electric discharge formation you see
here rising above easter island was
originally outlined to me by plasma
scientist tony peratt in 2002
at the time he was the leader in his
field heading up projects at los alamos
laboratories
but let's start with just one question
has the sky changed completely in recent
millennia
today's theorists in the physical
sciences and in the study of the human
past are addicted to projecting our sky
onto the ancient landscape as today so
before
in our investigation this uniformity
principle will never work
here's a brief video sequence
highlighting the reason why
it happened just a few thousand years
ago
when we lived in the presence of the
gods
powers ruled the celestial theater in
the lost age of gods and wonders
planets gathered in close congregation
as if alive
engaging each other electrically
but then the gods grew violent and they
went to war
driving human witnesses to take shelter
in caves and rocky enclosures
humans left to remember
to remember the powers of the gods
formations and cosmic events
not to be forgotten
and so the question
if anything like the event suggested
here did indeed occur
how could we know
my own inspiration on this question came
from emmanuel velikovsky one of the most
controversial theorists of the 20th
century
i published a 10 issue series on
velikovsky in the early 1970s
transforming a local student journal
into a popular international journal and
leading directly to a highly publicized
debate between velikovsky and astronomer
carl sagan in 1974
we know now that velikovsky was wrong on
many details but what about the deepest
questions that he raised he found in
ancient testimony the undeniable echoes
of planetary catastrophe making clear
that the modern idea of billion-year
stable planetary motions cannot be
correct
and the centerpiece of his argument was
evidence repeated around the world that
the planet venus approached the earth as
a devastating and frightful comet
it's indeed ironic to find a reliable
footing in this field we have no choice
but to plunge into the origins of
ancient myths and symbols and magical
practices
that's because this is where we find
hundreds of converging human memories
globally fitted together like the pieces
of a jigsaw puzzle
the world altering fall of heavenly
bodies
the dying god and the dark clouds of
ensuing chaos
the universal goddess venus including
her frightful or terrible aspect
the cosmic warrior mars
and the warriors defeat of the
improbable dragon who imprisoned the
goddess figure or threatened to destroy
the world
the celestial serpent
whose own body came to form the steps of
a cosmic stairway or tower of heaven
and of course the story of a former
stationary sun or central luminary of
the sky why did the world's first
astronomers name this primeval power as
the planet saturn
saturn a planetary god said to have
presided over a lost paradise and
identified as the primeval son the
central son the true son or best son
ruling before the present age
but enigmatically this exemplary power
was also the displaced god and the
devourer of his own children exiled to
remote realms
it's all truly a ludicrous fabrication
unless we've misunderstood our past
completely such that we can neither
comprehend nor explain the stunning
convergence of ancient testimony
i had the privilege in 1972 have seen an
outline of velikovsky's claim
unpublished at the time that the planet
saturn was originally seen as an immense
sphere in the sky in close connection to
earth
for me that claim cried out for
exploration and it led directly to my
own life's work and to publication of my
book the saturn myth in 1980 when the
publisher double date was the largest
publisher in the world
as the reconstruction stands today it
goes far beyond velikovsky's claims
it encompasses virtually all of the
archetypal themes of the ancient world
just consider the global image of
so-called sun wheels
this form has nothing to do with our sun
today
carved on stone everywhere it was
central to all ancient cultures but what
did it signify
all lines of evidence point to a dynamic
and evolving configuration of planets
planets that are named close to the
earth and immense in the ancient sky
when we place the configuration in
three-dimensional space the demands of
perspective are extraordinary
then we must take into account the
respective sizes of the bodies the
relative motions systematic changes in
the number and appearance of discharge
streamers
and the shifting position of earth as
these changes occurred
seen in three dimensions it's not even
possible to just make up explanations
whatever provoked the ancient images
they are historical fact irrespective of
any modern interpretation
and the facts include the stunning
astronomical identification of saturn as
the ancient sun definitive patterns
stand out above the carnival of later
forgetfulness localization fragmentation
and cultural invention
the bedrock of fact will not allow for
mere guesses at things
beneath the carnival of cultural
confusion lies a global substructure of
human memory
the archetypes the points of agreement
this is why my own convergence with wal
thornhill in the mid-90s was so
important to us he was just beginning to
emerge as the premier spokesman for the
electric universe when he stepped
forward to support the reconstruction in
electrical terms
then came the convergence with the
leading plasma scientist tony peratt in
2000 a convergence that forever changed
his life and my own
spectacular forms in the sky i had
reconstructed were suddenly illuminated
by tony's expertise
the turning point came instantly when i
sent one prehistoric pictograph to him
from cayenneta arizona he immediately
recognized what could have no other
explanation
in fact the research team at los alamos
had named this highest energy discharge
form after him a parat instability
what i did not know at the time was that
this form in the laboratory collapsed
into another more commonly recorded form
in the ancient world what tony came to
call the squatter man
then a series of mysteries fell into
place in terms of a known discharge
sequence including the mythic chain of
arrows over which i'd puzzled for years
the stairway or ladder of heaven
and the eye mask or allied goddess all
finding clarity and well-documented
electric discharge forms in the plasma
laboratory
i'm hoping that these bearish glimpses
of a very large story will attract you
to the upcoming thunderbolts project
conference
in the course of this event i'll show
much of the content scheduled for
episodes four and five of symbols of an
alien sky
and if you've not seen the original
episode the full documentary is
available on the thunderbolts project
youtube channel
hoping to see you in albuquerque
you

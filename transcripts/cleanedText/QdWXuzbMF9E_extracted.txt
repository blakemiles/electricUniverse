In the previous episode, physicist Eugene
Bagashov began his four-part presentation
on the latest discoveries from NASA's New
Horizons mission to the dwarf planet Pluto.
The mission is one of many recent
opportunities to test the predictions
of the standard story of our solar
system's history and origins.
In this story, called
the Nebular Hypothesis,
the solar system formed through gravitational
collapse in a cloud of gas and dust.
Proponents of this theory
proposed that water ice
was a primary building block
for Pluto and its moons.
But countless discoveries in recent
years have proved highly problematic
for the standard theory of our solar
system's formation and history.
Today, Eugene Bagashov explores the
question of Pluto's composition and origins
and contrast the predictions
of the standard theory
versus those of the
Electric Universe.
Eugene Bagashov: It
is interesting that,
while describing the Pluto and
Charon geological features,
the New Horizons' mission scientists have
often referred to the "water-ice bedrock."
Indeed, it seems they consider the
water ice is a primary building block
for both of those bodies and probably
the smaller satellites, too,
which to me seemed
quite unusual.
As far as I understood, the only
reason for such an assumption
is the Nebular Hypothesis
of planetary formation,
plus maybe a few other
popular theories,
which in their interpretation doesn't
allow anything else to be present
in those faraway regions
of the solar system.
It is then supposed that water-ice might be
as strong as rock in these harsh conditions
and is capable of maintaining form
long enough to allow for the existence
of these high mountains and deep valleys
that we see on Pluto and Charon.
Well that might be
the case, who knows.
But why wouldn't we just suppose that
it is just made of regular rock?
I'd like to reiterate the
thought from previous video
that if Pluto was formed
in some other conditions,
for example being a
moon of a giant planet
or simply being closer to the
Sun or maybe some other star,
then it might have
different properties
and represent something different
than what is expected.
One of the possible points in
favor of big water-ice abundance
on Pluto and Charon
is their density,
which is around 1.8 g/cm³ or roughly
twice the water-ice's density.
This is two to three times smaller than
the density of terrestrial planets
and comparable to the density of the
other well studied dwarf planet Ceres.
It is supposed to mean
there's less rock
and heavier things like
metals and more ice inside.
But we know that in our system there
are other bodies made of rock
that also exhibit quite a low
bulk density, comets for example.
Philae lander data has shown that
it's the internal structure,
namely the porosity of the material
that makes the Comet 67P so light,
not the high ice content.
Basically, it's
something like pumice,
and it completely agrees with the
results of previous missions to comets,
such as Stardust, that have shown that
the comet nuclei exhibit materials
that are formed in high
temperature conditions.
Same thing might be
applicable to Pluto.
In fact, the surface of Pluto shows only local
patches of water-ice spectral signature
but the surface of Charon has shown
signs of it almost everywhere.
I think this ice that we see on Charon
might actually be only a thin veneer
that was created under the
influence of solar wind
when its protons have joined
with the oxygen atoms
taken from the surface
rocks, or maybe regolith,
as it's supposed in the Electric Comet
Hypothesis popular in the EU community.
On Pluto such process
might be somewhat damped
because of the presence of its atmosphere
and also other contaminants so to speak,
by which I mean
nitrogen, CO, CH4 ices
and also more complex organic
molecules, the so-called tholins.
All of those substances might
mask the water-ice layer
on the surface of
Pluto, if there is any.
Now that I've mentioned tholins,
let's look at what that is.
They are the complex hydrocarbons
that are supposed to be produced
in the atmosphere of Pluto under
the influence of solar radiation
from more simple molecules,
such as methane and nitrogen.
Tholins have quite a
distinct brownish red color
that is readily recognized
on the surface of Pluto.
Basically all the surface of
the planet is slightly red
and supposed to bare
some tholin layering.
But aside of that, we might see a
very distinct dark equatorial band
which supposedly has a very
rich tholin abundance.
It might be that the equatorial
position makes it easier
for those materials to be formed under
the more pronounced insolation,
and I'd like to mention the very specific
contrast of this equatorial band
with bright Tombaugh Regio,
also situated on the equator.
As I've mentioned in the
previous part of this review,
such a prominent anomaly probably
should have a very special origins.
What also caught my eye, concerning this
equatorial band and the map of Pluto in general,
is its striking similarity with
the map of Saturn's moon Titan.
It is interesting that not only does this
body have the similar nitrogen atmosphere
but it also exhibits the
rich tholin abundance
and other hydrocarbons
right in this dark band.
Maybe there're organic
molecules on Pluto and Titan
and, who knows, maybe even
Earth shares similar origins.
We also have a nitrogen atmosphere
of all of other things.
And from the Electric Universe perspective,
it is important to notice that scientists,
who were trying to recreate Titan
like tholins in the laboratory,
have actually succeeded in this
endeavor by using electric discharges.
Could it be that the atmosphere
of Pluto as well as Titan
is filled with electrical activity
today, giving rise to those substances?
Or maybe it is a sign of such
an activity in the past?
Let us look again at the encounter
hemispheres of Pluto and Charon.
Those are available in
fairly good resolution
and allow us to see a significant
amount of very sharp valleys or rills,
especially in the left
side of Pluto image
and almost throughout the
whole visible part of Charon.
In fact, earlier images
of Charon's other side
have shown that these channels
almost encircle the whole body.
Of course, we know this
line of reasoning.
When people see dendritic channel
figures on Mars for example,
they might say that they were
created by flowing water,
though the current atmosphere
cannot support it.
Maybe the atmosphere was
a bit thicker before,
and so water could exist in large
amounts in liquid state etc etc.
But what did they say when they see
dendritic channels on Pluto and Charon?
What are the reasonable
alternatives
for electric excavation and
deposition we have here?
It seems that, at this point,
the only plausible explanation
that New Horizons Team have come
up with is plate tectonics.
So, as far as I understand, it
is thought that those valleys
might represent some sort of cracks
in the outer shells of those bodies.
I'm not a specialist in EDM so I
probably cannot comment on this much.
But I just hope that one day we're
going to get images of those regions
with better resolution and that would start a
discussion on their possible electric origin.

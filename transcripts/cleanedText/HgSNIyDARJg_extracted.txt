While walking and talking with a friend who was
a mechanical engineer, he asked me, what is science?
Great question, which eventually led us to
talking about what is lacking in today's science.
I proposed that when an astronomer
looks at a beautiful nebula,
the first question should be what is the
function of that? But of course, that is not
the first question most astronomers ask. This is
the crux of why astronomy is currently broken.
Our first question should be, what function is
that serving? And yet that is never even asked.
Hence, modern astronomy can never
understand anything it is looking at.
With a surprised smile he said, give me an
example [of] cosmological things having a function.
I replied, did you know that the atmosphere
above our heads has seven or eight distinct
layers before it meets the magnetosphere?
And the magnetosphere itself has seven
or eight layers and structures which
complete the connection to the solar wind?
It takes all these layers and structures
to connect the solar wind to the Earth.
That is the function of those layers. If those
layers were not present, then the solar wind
would crash into the surface of the Earth
creating a mix of ceramic and molten glass.
These layers are not an accident. One of their
purposes is to allow organic life to exist on
Earth. The presence of plants and animals is
a vital importance to the Earth, and hence to
the solar system as a whole. To say that all
of life on Earth is an accident, typifies how
out of touch modern scientists are with reality.
I feel the need to say that again: to say that
all of life on Earth is an accident, typifies how
out-of-touch modern scientists are with reality.
Why would a planet have a magnetic body, and a
plasma body, and a monoatomic body and a gaseous
body? Why would the electric currents from the
Sun go into and out of the poles of the Earth?
Answer. The energy of the Sun must be digested
by the Earth. Outside our Earth is a world of
almost inconceivable fire, rarified beyond our
understanding, so energetic, most atoms cannot exist.
One must come down into the sphere of a planet
before the electron and the proton can settle
down enough, to come together into even the first
molecules. And yet, here on the surface of the
Earth, everything lives in a cool, wet world with
rain and wood, and ice, and fish, rivers and fields.
This is an enormous stepping down. This is a
condensation, more extreme than liquid into ice.
The matter itself must be carefully brought,
through stage after stage of cooling and
solidifying. These functional layers are what
is needed to convert the solar wind energy
to be usable here on Earth. My engineering friend
said, that's a very poetic way to describe things.
I thought about it and responded. Yes, but it's
also the solution to an engineering problem.
Where else have we seen the union of engineering
solutions with beauty? Oh, that's right. We see it
everywhere here on Earth. Every butterfly wing,
every spider web, every musical instrument, every
flower, every perfectly tuned car engine, all
built to solve a very practical problem and
all beautiful. The Victorian idiot warmongers who
have forfeited their sex and the Darwin school
flunkies, have somehow convinced many of us that
life is ugly and brutish and somehow makes sense,
only if profits are kept up, and new territories
are conquered. Nature always makes a profit, but
not at the expense of itself, and somehow does
it by maintaining a very high standard of beauty.
If our current scientists are not trained in
beauty, they will forever miss the mark. Tell me
your explanation of things; if it lacks beauty,
then I will know you are on the wrong track.
The Electric Universe position helps with all
this. I am still at a bit of a loss how this is so.
In 2010 I came across Wal Thornhill's work
on how supernovae make much more sense as an
electrical phenomenon and that began my journey of
seeing that including electricity in the models
naturally paints the correct
picture of a hierarchical universe.
Maybe it's because electricity naturally
travels between larger and smaller worlds.
Maybe it's the other way around, and people who
feel that we live in a living Universe are drawn
to using electricity as a way of describing what
they see. For too long the progress of contemporary
science has been made absurdly slow because we
have no idea what we're looking for. Whereas if
we started with the idea that we live in a living
Universe which is a structured hierarchy, and that
energy and influence must travel from the larger
worlds into the smaller, and then again be brought
up from the smaller back up to the larger, well
then the progress of science would go much faster.
Instead of being surprised that our atmosphere has
layers, we would begin the research expecting such
an arrangement. And we'd look for the role
of electricity in maintaining these layers.
A colleague of mine sent me this link about the
ACES II mission. Let's spend a little time looking
at the mission. Here are some images of the flow
of electric current around the solid, rocky Earth.
The electric and magnetic body
of the Earth is quite complex.
It is important to change your thinking
about what is the body of the Earth.
Because we all have received no training in how to
use our five senses, we generally believe that the
body of the Earth is only the rock below our feet.
But this is only a part of the body of the Earth.
Maybe we could call the rocky part the bones
of the Earth. Around this solid core is a body
just as complex and multi-layered as the
rest of your body that surrounds your bones.
Plasma has an amazing ability to segregate to form
walls, membranes, and tubes. The flow of electricity
through this larger body of the Earth is just
as segregated as the flow of blood in your veins.
The plasma flows only where it is supposed to.
And just like your arteries and veins, the plasma
membranes are semi-permeable. The right things get
in, the right things get out. And still, the whole
system is highly pressurized and self-contained.
Long before the mammalian circulatory system came
to be, the Earth had solved all the problems
of a self-contained circulatory system
with semi-permeable membranes. Only it did so in
the realm of plasma, electricity and magnetism.
Getting back to the ACES II
Mission, look at this image.
The orange lines coming into and flowing away
from the Earth are electric currents. The flows
have an interesting double in-and-out structure.
Energy comes from far away, and then it goes
back into the magnetosphere, and then it returns,
and then it is sent back into the solar system.
Most of this activity is along
the sunrise and sunset lines.
if you pull back from the Earth, you will see that
there is only one sunrise and sunset because the
shadow of the Earth remains fixed, while it is
the surface of the Earth that spins underneath
that shadow. Along this shadow line electric
currents flow both into and out of the Earth.
We don't know what happens to this current
close to the Earth's surface, and this is the
focus of the ACES II Mission: fly two [sounding rockets]
through this lower region and collect data.
While the mission is very exciting, it is
half  a mission. It is half  a mission because
it is not starting with the question
of what is the function of the aurora?
The aurora must transfer its energy to the
body of the Earth and must also translate the
digested energy back up into the solar current.
The circuit does not just come down willy-nilly,
make a right turn, and head back out to the
magnetosphere. End of story. The current is
coming down to interact with the Earth and
all that lives on the surface of the Earth.
This is like breathing; this is like digestion.
The Earth is receiving solar energy and the
Earth gives something back. This is physics, this
is engineering. It is also permeated with beauty.
Quite literally, solar energies enter into the
Earth at sunrise. We all, animals and the
plants and the lichen, all use this energy as we
live a day on this Earth. And when we lie down to
sleep, something is taken back up into the solar
wind current. The ACES II Mission needs to be
paired with measurements of the electric currents
and magnetic fields in the surface of the Earth.
The aurora and surface of the Earth might be
connected directly, like a flashlight current
flowing through a filament. The solar current
could flow directly into the body of the Earth,
or the aurora might make a connection through
induction, like an AC Transformer where vibrations
in the input current are communicated to
the receiving coil, but no electric charges
flow from one to the other. My bet is that both
induction and transfer of matter are happening.
This is the sort of question that needs to
guide missions of this kind. I've been looking
for updates on the mission since its successful
November 21st launch, but cannot find anything yet.
Millennia ago, the word ‘cosmos’ was used to
designate a living whole. All ‘cosmoses’ are built on
the same blueprint, the only difference being the
size and how physical laws manifest at that scale.
You and I are each an example: citizen cosmoses
that live in the larger cosmos of the Earth.
Planets are an example: citizen cosmoses that
live their life in the larger world of stars.
Star is an example: a citizen cosmos of the larger
beings we call galaxies. Going the other direction,
every plant and animal on Earth is composed of
cells which are built on this same blueprint.
A cosmos is born and dies, eats and eliminates. A
cosmos has power to heal after injury or sickness.
Coming back to the very start of this lecture, a
nebula in our galaxy is not a cosmos. At least I
don't think so. The nebula is an integral part of
a larger being or of an organ within our galaxy.
Yes, galaxies have organs that perform specific
functions. Like this beauty. What's the standard
explanation of this? Oh, just another random
explosion crashing into pointless surrounding
gases. What's a better explanation? This
highly structured object is doing something.
Nature always links structure and function.
So, let's try to understand what it is doing.
The Electric Universe paradigm somehow brings all
of this into better focus. Electricity and light
as the finest matters we know, permeate all levels
of the universe. Electricity and light can organize,
and manifest, at all levels large and small.
And can travel between the large and the small.
By comparison, I would say for example that gravity
plays a very small role in the world of cells.
If you believe that nothing in the universe is
alive, that is a belief, not science. You have done
precisely zero experiments to test your belief. If
you believe that stars are not conceived and born,
that is based upon precisely zero experimental
evidence. If you believe that love and yearning
are not powerful forces for stars and galaxies and
cells, okay, that is a belief. If you call yourself a
scientist, it is time to grow up and admit that
these are beliefs based upon, you know not what.
Perhaps you no longer trust your feelings and
trust only your instruments, made of metal and
glass. An instrument made of metal and glass
is not alive, and hence can only measure other
things that are not alive. A living being
can only be sensed by another living being.
One of us looks out and sees a dead
universe, the other sees a living universe.
Those who study the dead are always
surprised by the new findings,
while those who study the living often
have an inkling of what we would find.

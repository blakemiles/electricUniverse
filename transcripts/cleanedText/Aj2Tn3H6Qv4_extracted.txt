Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe,

What does the future hold
for the space sciences?
interest in space exploration was
remarkably high among the general public,
as humanity's attention was held
rapt by the race to the moon.
However, in the 21st century, the public
face of space science is less the astronaut
than the physicist and astrophysicist.
When young people wish to learn of
space science, they learn of big bang,
gravity-centric cosmology. They hear of
the respective works of Newton and Einstein
and they must try to make sense of
concepts such as warped space-time,
infinities and singularities.
They're told of a universe that is
96 percent dark, comprised of
matter and energy that are unproven,
invisible and “poorly understood”. To find
that a scientific foundation exists for any
different way of seeing the universe, the
young and the curious have little choice
but to seek outside the confines
of institutionalized science,
and beyond the narratives its celebrity
spokespersons promote in popular media.
On such a journey, one has a chance 
to discover that an astounding scientific
foundation exists for another cosmology,
a cosmology which recognizes it is not
gravity that governs the universe,
but rather electromagnetism. The
forefathers of this cosmology are
not named Newton and Einstein.
They are the giants of
electrical and plasma science,
the renowned experimentalist Kristian
Birkeland and the Nobel prize winners
Irving Langmuir and Hannes Alfvén.
A universe filled with electrically
conducting plasma is not 96 percent 
dark. It is alight with electric currents,
and the physical mechanisms that 
spark the phenomena we see,
are both understandable and easily
replicable in laboratories on Earth.
Recently, we spoke with a member
of the Electric Universe community
who has made it his mission to introduce
the young and the curious to the ideas
of the Electric Universe. His 
name is Benjamin Hyde and he is a
science presenter on the news station,
Fox 13 out of Salt Lake city, Utah.
We asked Ben to introduce himself and to
describe his efforts to spark inspiration
and interest in the sciences
among today's youth.
This is Benjamin Hyde and I have been
studying physics, specifically quantum
physics, for the better part of
two and a half decades. It's been a
passion of mine, it's something that I
love and I really enjoy and now,
two and a half decades later, I realize
that the reason
why I was so fascinated with it, is
because I like
understanding the fundamentals of
things. Reality and quantum physics
from my old understanding was that where
that explanation was going to come from,
you know. I wanted to know
what everything was made of
and so I studied it and I did what
everybody in this field did. I
just took what was given
to me and accepted it, and
because I didn't have 
anything different at the time,
I just  said OK, this is what it is.
And it didn't really dawn on me
that it didn't make sense, and 
if it didn't, I'm just like, well
I'll just roll with it. I remember 
specifically a few years ago,
when dark matter and dark energy
really hit the stage, and I learned
that 96.5 percent, or whatever 
it is, of the known universe
was either dark matter and dark 
energy. And I thought wow,
that is a profound amount of stuff in the
universe that we don't know anything about.
So I justified it in my mind that,
basically anything was possible, because
most of what we knew
we didn't know. So, as I'm studying
quantum physics, particle physics,
cosmology, I
of course ran across videos from the
Electric Universe.
Because I would go to YouTube and I
would watch, you know Brian Greene,
the World Science Festival videos; loved
those for a while.
And of course the Electric Universe
videos would pop up every once in a
while. And I'm like, great 
I'll watch those too,
and I did. But, what
happened, and this is funny,
every time I would study physics,
    I would get to a burnout
mode. You know, I would study it for a few
weeks and I would just get so frustrated,
I just would lose interest in it. And now,
looking back on it, I realize that was
because I was studying 
nonsense. And I was trying to
bang this garbage stuff into my head;
and there was a part of my head that was
just saying, you know Ben,
this isn't real you know, this is
a mistake. So, after one of these up
and down times with quantum physics,
I went into the Electric Universe and
became enthralled.
You know, I learned who David Talbott was,
I learned who Wal Thornhill was,
and I learned what they had to say and
it was just captivating.
And, as we all know, I mean all of us who
are in this, understand this feeling
of like, oh finally all the stuff we've
been studying our whole lives,
now finally makes sense. And
I've never stopped, and what
was interesting is, that I never
went back into that up and down
pattern of studying it and then
not studying it, studying it.
I've just been constantly
studying Electric Universe stuff
because, you know,
we don't know everything.
And there's still questions clearly,
but it feels like we're on the right path.
For a person with a previous focus in
mainstream physics and cosmology,
we asked Ben what might have caused his shift
in interest toward the Electric Universe:
I think what it was, is that
I got to the point with particle
physics and quantum physics,
where it was just so absurd
that I couldn't help but drop it.
But you know, drop particle physics,
I mean the whole idea that a thing
can be both a wave and a particle,
is just so colossally absurd
that it begs to be dropped.
The fact that the Electric
Universe, I think the first thing
that really got me into it, is the 
fact that they were talking about
that everything in the universe is
basically moved and affected by charge
differential. I mean, 
I played with a battery. I've
rubbed my feet across the carpet.
I can create a charge differential.
You can see it and the lightning discharge
between my fingertip and a wall socket,
when I rub my feet across the floor,
is just a scaled-down version of
lightning, what I see in the sky. And
then, when the Electric Universe talked
about scaling, I'm like, scaling 
yes, I understand scaling.
Because one of the things I found out
that was just absolutely absurd. Another
one of the absurdities
in the current model,
is that quantum physics wasn't scalable. I
was like, wait a minute guys, if there are
fundamental principles of the universe, 
they would by definition have to be scalable.
But quantum physics, by its own definition,
says that our rules, the quantum physics
rules, only work up to the
scale of maybe a molecule
and everything smaller than that.
And above that, they don't work.
That's just silly in every sense.
I mean it just defies common sense.
And I have to tell you that, this is
getting a little personal, but at the
time I was going through a 
faith crisis, a faith transition,
and I just learned that
everything I had been taught
you know, religiously up until
that point in my life was also,
it was just a story.
And all of a sudden,
when I allowed myself to think that,
everything in my life suddenly made sense.
All the ideas and questions I had 
that religion was supposed to
answer, but didn't answer, I realized
I had just been making justifications
for. And so, when I lost the ability
to justify what I had been told,
that skill leaked out into science and
all of a sudden I saw the same things
with quantum physics and with science in
general, that I had been just assuming and
justifying and rationalizing what
these teachers of science have told me
my whole life. And so, it was
easy in that respect, to go into the
Electric Universe because
they had very simple concepts
that were easily identifiable.
Stuff that you could do at home
in a very simple sense,
which is what I've done,
to show the principles.
See, I could never show
quantum principles here at my house,
or to the kids that I teach. You could
never do that. I mean the closest it came
was pointing a laser at a double slit and
saying, ‘’look you can see refraction
patterns,” but
you know even then you're not
demonstrating that light is both a
particle and a wave.
You're just telling people that that's
what's happening.
And that's as close as I could ever come
to demonstrating the principles of
quantum physics.
And I'm thinking, if there's actual real
fundamental laws of the universe, they
should be demonstrable and
they should be scalable.
And that was one of the first things
that Wal Thornhill talked about,
you know and mentioned I think, that
Hannes Alfvén said that the effects
of the plasma cosmology were scalable
to like you know 10 to the
19th or 10 to the 16th.
I'm like, great, perfect,
that envelops the
macroscopic world that I can interact with,
and the cosmological world. Perfect, let's
go. After beginning
his research into the
concepts behind the Electric Universe,
Ben began performing his own experiments
on Electric Universe Geology,
that is, reproducing the familiar
features of planets and moons through
electrical discharge to a solid surface.
We asked Ben if he could identify the
catalyst for his own experimental research.
Of course, it was Valles Marineris and
you know Wal and David talking about how
that there are
scalloped craters and that electrical
discharges could do this.
I'm like,, you know, I was just fascinated
because it was so brilliant to see
Valles Marineris and realize
how big it was and the thought that
electricity could do that,
was just captivating. So, I'm of course
looking for how to do this.
It was really funny, I was so blind
by this, it's amazing because I
had in my possession a transformer
that took, you know 120 volts and bumped
it up to 12,000 volts. And I've had that
for years, but it never dawned on me that I
could play with it, until I 
told one of my co-workers
about the Electric Universe and he
said, you know what Ben, I've got a
transformer at my house that I use to
create Lichtenberg patterns in wood. I'm
like, yes, yes, yes, yes, that's 
what I'm talking about. He
said I'll give it to you and
so I'm like great I'll take it.
But I didn't even realize that I
already had one in my possession.
I'd been using it to create a Jacob's ladder
for my science experiments for the kids
that I do with spark science.
And so I ran out and dismantled
the probes or the two electrodes
from my Jacob's ladder and just put them
on the dust plate,
like, what you say, the little
metal plate and then I just created an
electrode out of a screwdriver. And bam,
I started throwing different powders on
there, different dust and just creating
you know, the butterfly effects
that we see, the lightning scars,
everything. Everything that the
Electric Universe Geology folks
deal with. And it was just fun
and so I've just been out there
for the last month, throwing 
different powders on there.
As a side note, I'm actually 
a licensed pyrotechnician
which means that I build fireworks 
as well. So, I've got a whole
arsenal of different compounds
and I'm really curious to see how they
all react to an electric field. And 
so, I've been putting each one of
these in the different fields,
and I found that boric acid works
and [that it] creates some really
interesting effects. Baking soda
creates really interesting 
effects, and charcoal
creates really interesting effects and 
I have not gone through and tested
all of my powders yet. But I’m in the middle
of that. That's what I do and then I post
a lot of this stuff to Facebook Live
and to my Spark Science channel.
And it's so fun and anybody can do it.
Like many other members of the Electric
Universe Geology community, Ben himself
resides in the American Southwest.
We asked Ben if his locale provides
unique opportunities for exploring
electrical geology concepts. Yes, 
oh absolutely. It literally feels
like I'm at ground zero for the 
supposed electric discharge
phenomena that happened between the 
earth and Mars, as we understand it. Now I
realize that the earth has a couple
different places on it that have,
you know, just striking features,
but Utah is one of them.
Now I live in Utah Valley and the Wasatch
mountain range is to my east. I mean I'm
literally five minutes from it;
I can walk to the mountains.
Well there is a canyon just like 10 miles
away, that was featured in Andy Hall's
episodes and he's taken pictures of it, and 
he talked about it and I've always noticed it.
it’s just startling, because you have
the mountain range that's basically
smooth. And then all of a sudden
there's this horrible jagged crack,
right there, and then the mountains get
smooth again. and I've gotten out,
I've taken pictures of it. I've actually
hiked up this canyon. My father-in-law
lives right at the base of it right, at the 
mouth of that canyon and we've just
explored it. And then seeing that Andy
Hall thought it was significant as well,
I finally went up there and climbed
up there and have taken pictures.
And I told you this before, but the rock cliffs
up there, there's one of them that has a
hairpin turn in it. Now, regardless of
whether that was electrically made or
or lava made or whatever,
it was something catastrophic
and well worth investigating.
When I learned about
these different features, I started
looking at Google Earth in my local
neighborhood, and everything that
everybody talks about, you know these
wind-driven triangular buttresses,
I can see in my own backyard.
It's amazing, I mean just 
right here in Utah county.
You know how Andy Hall describes
triangular buttresses and supersonic winds,
is right here. I mean I don't even have
to go to Google Earth; I just could
literally walk outside. So, I've been pulling
out my astronomy binoculars, looking at
the mountains. We just got back from a
family vacation down in southern Utah. We
were 30 miles away from
Canyonlands and a lot of the
features that Andy Hall
has talked about. And so,
this is what I did, and this is what
I'm doing right now. In fact, I'm
glad that I have this platform to
talk, because I want people to
send me rocks and soil samples
from wherever they live.
Because I want to put them under
my arc and see what they do.
Because I just brought
two samples back of rock
that looked very volcanic, rock from southern
Utah and soil samples. And as soon as I'm done
here talking to you, I'm going out and
I'm putting them under the arc to see
what they do. And of course I'll
film it and share it with everybody.
I'm going to show you here what
the arc does with baking soda. And
you can see right here,
that as I turn on the arc,
this butterfly pattern just erupts. I
mean you can see that as it comes
down to a point, it creates a chevron
here and the moment that I turn it
on, you'll see the poof of dust
going around it, which tells us that
there are particles of the baking soda
that are ionized. Not all of them,
but enough of them are, to where they're
immediately expelled from the region.
And if I do this just
right, and if i position the
electrode in just the right area, you
will see
that the arc will form. It'll strike
the powder and create a little
nodule, I guess is what I call
it. But as the arc dissipates, or
if I make the arc, if I bring it
further away from the dust plate and
just go back to the electric field
effects, you'll see that that little nodule
remains. It stays in place and you
can touch it, and of course you
can smash it with your
finger, it doesn't take much,
but what's interesting is that it's like
that instant petrification that we
hear about, that Peter Jupp 
talked about. It literally looks like
something like that is happening: it
forms a little column, a little bead,
that holds itself in place, even though
all the dust around it, as you can see,
is flying away, is being excavated.
Now this one is barium,
(not barium, I'm sorry, barium 
also makes green in fireworks),
this is boric acid and as you can see, if
we apply the arc to it, boric acid also
burns green. But as you'll notice, it also
can create these beautiful butterfly
effects and these are the 
same ones that we see
in different places all over the planet.
Andy Hall has pointed them out:
very, very stark examples of them in
southern Utah.
People in the group have talked
about the ones in Russia,
but they're everywhere and you
can create them in the lab right here.
The last one I have is just charcoal
which, of course, is just
burned wood. It's carbon and as
you can see, as I turn it on to
strike the arc, you get a 
big cloud of dust of just
excavating the dust and then 
as we let the arc continue,
it will form that familiar chevron shape
or butterfly. It just depends on how long
you leave the arc. If you 
leave it on for a few minutes,
you'll get the full butterfly wings, as
you can see. If you leave it on for just
a couple seconds you'll get the formation
of the chevron, which you can see.
So I'm not done; those are just the three
most interesting ones that I've found.
And I'm going to do more; I'm going
to use just regular dirt. I've got
clay I'm going to use and try and create that
effect that Wal Thornhill and Dr. Ransom
created, but that's still up and coming.
I don't have that done yet.
Given the significant differences
between the Electric Universe
and standard cosmology, we asked Ben
for his thoughts on the best approach to
introducing the subject to newcomers.
Well, there's two things that strike me.
The last time I was in public talking
about this, I said the following. I said
science is all about learning and
progress and if anyone ever tells
you that we have decided, and we've finally
landed on it, you know that that's not
science. And everyone you
know, they know that. And so,
I start off my conversation
with them and I tell them that,
and then I say, our old knowledge
is that comets were icy snowballs,
but we have since sent out probes that
have landed on comets, and we've seen,
they've taken pictures, and we've
seen that they're not icy snowballs,
and here's those pictures. So, the icy
snowball was the old thinking, you know
from Fred Whipple in the 1950’s and the
new knowledge that we're gaining is this.
That's palpable, that's a spoonful
of sugar right there. You know
that's not saying that all science is wrong 
and scientists are stupid and they're
egotistic maniacs that are just
chasing the dollar. I was able to explain
it like that and the
people responded very well.
It was palpable to them and that was the adults.
Now the kids are actually a lot easier,
because kids especially at the age that
I deal with mostly, you know, right around
10 years old, they are naturally curious.
They have big questions and I know this,
because I have eight kids myself and I've
got five of them in that range right now;
they ask me about where
did the universe come from?
You know just big, big questions and it's not
because their dad is really into science,
it's because they themselves are
interested. And so, when I tell them
that the things they're learning 
in school, are stories,
they are an explanation based on
our best knowledge at the time,
it's easy for them to say, oh what else
is there? And I say, well here's what else
is there. So, kids, it's really easy to
introduce them to the stuff, because
they're naturally curious. So you 
don't have to come up with clever,
soft ways of telling it. You 
just answer their questions.

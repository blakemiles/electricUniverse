It's always a pleasure
to be here and to see
so many new faces and I wouldn't say
old faces but longtime friends.
Well, let's see.
Last year I described
for you a model,
mathematical model of
the Birkeland current,
the cross-section of
the Birkeland current
and what it looks like, how
it counter-rotates inside
and how it manages to go from
the Sun to the Earth, to Saturn
and create the auroras
on those planets..
And I thought maybe this year
we take a look at the other end,
not the Aurora but the Sun end
and talk a little bit
about the solar wind
because Birkeland, when he came up with the
idea of what the auroras were caused by,
said they were corpuscles,
electrical corpuscles that were
coming from the Sun to the Earth.
Of course he was laughed
at severely for that
but we now know
that that is true.
And astronomers, instead of calling it the
Birkeland wind or giving him credit for it,
they just call it
the solar wind.
So it's a bunch of, essentially,
protons and electrons that
come off the Sun
in steady-state.
Now I'm not talking about, of course,
CMEs, coronal mass ejections or flares
or any of the transient phenomena
that happened but the steady-state
DC as Ben would say, currents that are
coming from the Sun as a normal thing.
One might ask why the
solar wind is important
and I think that Ben has
done a very good job
of talking about why it's important that
we know what's coming off of the Sun.
It's obviously a stream
of charged particles
that speeds up to about a
million miles an hour.
That's moving.
And before it streams
past the Earth.
And disturbances
in the solar wind
pump energy into the Earth's
radiation belts and polar regions.
Space weather clearly,
as Ben points out,
can change the orbit of satellites, shorten
mission lifetimes, create all sorts of havoc.
The solar wind distorts the
Earth's magnetic field
and this causes current surges in transmission
lines and pretty much we know this.
So I'm not going to mention
those things again.
What I'm going to talk about, I
think, I hope, for the first time,
is some of the lesser known
properties of the solar wind
and most importantly how
well those properties,
those very subtle properties
of the solar wind
fit in exactly with Ralph
Juergens' electric sun model.
And so as I've said so many times before
you can't prove anything in science,
you can disprove but
you can't prove it.
But you can always add
supporting evidence.
You can build that wall like the DA tries
to build a wall of evidence that is
insurmountable by the defense and
this is, "no he really killed him".
This is what we're
trying to do here
and that is to build that wall of
evidence that says, "you betcha!".
The Sun is electric.
We don't know whether it's powered
completely by electricity,
we think it might be
but we don't know.
But one thing we know for certain
and that is that the effects,
the major phenomenon that we
see on the surface of the sun,
those phenomena are electric and i'd
like to show you in some detail
what, why I say that
and what's going on.
So there are actually two
different types of solar winds.
Perhaps some of you know that.
And I'd like to explain the
reasons why these properties
are quite different
from each other.
The standard
mainstream finds these
observations to be quote
"enigmatic" as always.
They're not enigmatic,
they're very simple.
Elegantly simple.
I'd like to explain how the different
points of origin on the surface of the sun
explain those differences between those two
different types of solar wind that we see.
One of the things that, by
the way I should say that
one of the things i want to
show you is a short video clip
that Monty Childs was kind enough to
lend to me from the SAFIRE project.
That shows that the things
that I'm talking about here,
as far as Juergens
model is concerned,
are being repeated here
on earth in Monty's lab.
So the Juergens' sun model was
proposed in the early 70's
and today I'm trying to propose
a slight extension to that.
And this, these proposals
that I'm trying to make
are based on Juergens',
Ralph Juergens' work
and also on something that I came up with
and presented 3, 4 years ago called,
I call it the transistor model
of the sun because the sun..
we'll talk about in a minute.
But sun surface works very analogously
to the way a PNP transistor works.
And we'll see that in..
briefly at least.
Anyway, again to state the
obvious, we all probably know
that the major three layers on
the Sun that are are important,
and as you, if you come toward the Sun
in the order in which you see them,
would be the corona, the
chromosphere and the photosphere.
Now the corona is perhaps the
most beautiful thing in the sky.
It is this colorful, it's..
those are of course the same
colors that we see in the Aurora.
And why, because
it's the same thing.
It is plasma in the glow mode.
And it is the same sort of
stuff, helium, hydrogen..
mostly hydrogen,
excited electrically.
Again, everything I say please ask
yourself while I'm saying it,
how does the.. how does the
standard model explain this?
The standard model has no explanation for
why a corona exists in the first place!
If.. if the Sun is just a nuclear
furnace like a wood stove..
My wood stove doesn't
glow like that!
And so clearly, everything that we
observe around the surface of the sun,
including the corona, is
electrical in nature.
Hm.. one other comment
and that is that
you can't see anything in the
night sky that isn't plasma.
"Oh yeah, I can see the Moon!"
But of course the moon is reflected
sunlight and sunlight is plasma.
The Sun, well all of
light that we see
if you look at Jupiter through a
telescope or Saturn or any other planet,
you're seeing reflected
plasma light
and the, we'll talk about the photosphere and
where that light comes from in a minute.
But the corona is pretty big thing,
it extends out about 3 solar radii.
If you look at half the
width of that disk
and then the 123, it takes you out
about the corner of that picture.
And you can see, that's about
the extent of the corona.
So it's large.
The Sun is what, 865 thousand
kilometers across, something like that?
The chromosphere, the second layer
going in, contains these spicules.
Spicules.. we've all heard,
you know, the pines of Rome..
Spicules are the
fountains of the Sun.
Not the fountains of Rome.
But anyway, they have
certain characteristics.
The spicules are really
towering fountains of electrons
that come up out of the Sun and then
back into the Sun again immediately
if our assumption is correct.
Juergens' assumption that the
Sun has a positive charge.
Those electrons once spewed are very
quickly brought back into the Sun again.
That's what the spicules are.
The photosphere is
where the action is
and that's what we're going
to be talking about mostly.
The, the photosphere
consists of these things
that the astronomers called
photospheric granules.
More proper name for
them is anode tufts.
The anode tufts consist
of plasma in the arc mode
and I've heard all
sorts, even my,
one of my good friends thinks the Sun
is liquid hydrogen or something..
It better be pretty
hot liquid because
plasma in the arc mode puts out
a horrific amount of power.
And as a matter of fact, but
I should say this, those
those granules come and
go with time, they grow,
they get bright and they
shrink and they go away.
The power put out by the
Sun is really fantastic.
That is to say, the the
radiation from the sun,
every square inch of the sun's surface
on average puts out 42,000 wats.
If you can think of what
about a square mile..
That's.. it's not, it's not boiling
anything, it's arc mode plasma.
The temperature of those
granular granules or tufts
is about 6000 Kelvin,
which is pretty..
you wouldn't want to spend your summer
vacation there but it's in relation to the..
to the temperature
of the lower corona,
which is 2 million Kelvin, it's
not, it's a medium temperature.
Anyway, the, there's a
picture of the granules.
That's a movie.
If you look at it very carefully
you can see it moving.
It's a real time motion
picture of the granules.
If you keep your eye on
one, especially near the..
I think that white stuff in the center is
a bunch of spicules coming up through..
I don't know, but I think
that's what it is.
And you see the they're, they're
all over the place let's see.
There's some down here,
there's some over here,
up here and of course a
bunch of them here..
If you keep your eyes on the
granules themselves, you see
them shrinking away to nothing
and the question is,
why do they do that?
Well, there's a typical
sunspot and you might say,
well what's a sunspot?
Sunspots are where the
photospheric tufts are not.
It's a region where the
photospheric tufts don't exist.
And so there's been a good deal of work
done on the laboratory on anode tufts
and we'll talk some about that.
The main, well, focus, I would say, of
Juergens' sun model is an anode tuft.
How does the anode tuft work?
That's one of the things I'd like
to spend some time on this morning.
There is of course the penumbra, that's
that orange ring that you can see.
The dark inner area
is called the umbra
and the temperatures in the
umbra have been measured, well,
just something in
worth of 3000 Kelvin.
So the umbra obviously is much
cooler than the normal spots,
I'm sory, the normal tufts which are the the
yellow region around the outside there.
Anyway, I said that Monty had sent me some
interesting pictures from from SAFIRE.
There is one.
Now the, the purple wine glass
in the back is not real.
Monty has not been drinking, that's
just an aberration of the photograph.
This was taken
inside a bell jar.
And he has managed, he and his team have
managed to actually create anode tufts.
The center / bright purple
thing is a spherical halo,
it's distorted some by the
shape of the bell jar.
It's pretty spherical
and it's the anode
and riding on top of that
anode are anode tufts.
And so, the major property
of these anode Tufts
is that they're made up
of positive charges.
And as such, you can think to yourself,
just basic knowledge of electricity..
If those things are each one
a group of positive charges
then they don't like each other.
They're going to be
repelling each other
and so you see they're quite evenly
spaced over the surface of the sphere.
And as you'll see in a minute
when Monty increases the current
he increases the number of tufts and he
increases the brightness of the tufts
and finally they turn into
something in the arc mode
just like we see on the
surface of the Sun.
So the, as I said before,
I think I said before,
the main basis of the
of the Juergens model
is an analysis of those tufts
so we're going to be thinking of travelling
in a line, if you can visualize,
from the purple surface there,
the surface of the anode,
up through the tuft and
then out beyond the tuft.
And let's think what, what
would we expect to see there.
I'll tell you what Juergens expected to
see there and I think it's exactly what
Monty is seeing and is going to
see in the SAFIRE experiment.
Anyway, Juergens' electric
sun model and there it is,
you've seen that picture many times,
every time I talk, I think I show it.
It's fairly complicated but let's take
it one step at a time and I think,
I think you can see
what I'm saying.
The upper one of the three
graphs there is a plot..
well on all three of them the
horizontal axis is the radial distance,
up from the surface of the sun, up through
the tuft and out into the corona.
The top graph plots the
voltage that you would see
if you had a voltmeter in your hand and
could have a ground someplace out in space
and look at the various, the
voltage, the voltage varies
as you come up out of the Sun through the
tuft and then out the top of the tuft.
On the left-hand margin of
the left-hand axis there,
the vertical axis that's labeled
energy per unit charge, that's volts.
Energy, that's what voltage is.
A positive charge
has more energy
if it's at a high voltage then
if it's at a low-voltage.
The analogy is, that's the cross-section
of a mountain and the positive charge,
the analogy there
is a tennis ball.
So suppose you threw a
tennis ball on top of the..
I'm sorry didn't I got ahead of myself here,
no i didn't, I'm sorry, this is fine.
I'm looking at the next slide.
I'm cheating on you guys.
The tennis ball thrown on
the top of the photosphere,
well if you throw a
bunch of them there
and they begin to have a
sort of a billiard game
at the top on that horizontal
surface of the photosphere,
if one of the tennis balls
goes too far to the left,
that is to say between
the axis and point A,
it will roll off down the hill
with increasing velocity.
Same thing if if one gets
bounced over beyond point B.
Can you see point B there?
And gets onto that ski jump that
I've labeled the chromosphere.
It will accelerate
off to the right.
The second plot, the middle plot there
if you can read it, the axis says,
the outward electrical field
which is force per unit charge
labeled in Volts per meter.
So the electric field, for those of
you who have learned any physics,
is the negative of the gradient of
the voltage, what I mean by that.
Well look at the voltage
and if it's sloping,
if it's going down that's a negative
slope like in the chromosphere.
That means that the electric field
to produce that is positive,
it's the negative of
what the slope does.
So we're, say, if you start at the
vertical axis of the the upper plot,
you can see that the voltage is increasing
as you move from the axis to point A.
So, the voltage in the middle of
the tuft is the highest voltage
that you're going to see
in this whole area.
And to get up there, to get that
positive slope on the voltage,
the electric field
is, is negative.
Now it's, it's more
negative right at the axis
because the voltage curve
is steepest there.
I don't know if you.. if you don't
follow me don't worry about it,
if you do you see what
I'm talking about.
At the top of the photosphere
where the voltage curve is flat
there is no electric
field, there is no force
on the tennis ball pushing
him one way or the other.
But if the tennis ball, i.e.
the positive charge,
gets over beyond point B,
there is a positive volt..
positive electric field and that will
tend to accelerate it toward the right.
The bottom curve is nothing
but the resulting velocity.
So clearly, once you get..
think of all three plots,
if you get at the point B
and slightly to the
right of point B,
the force is positive,
outer force is positive.
The electric field is positive
and getting bigger and the,
and the force is maximum
where the slope is steepest.
The skier is accelerating most rapidly
at the steepest part of the ski jump.
And so the voltage, I'm
sorry, the velocity
- the bottom curve, is
continuing to increase it in..
the increase in velocity, the
acceleration, is maximum at Point C.
Once you get beyond point D, there's
no more force on the skier,
the tennis ball or the positive ion
and so the velocity is constant.
But it's moving. It's fast.
Instead of talking about analogies
let me say it straight out.
A positive ion is accelerated
by a voltage drop.
The higher the voltage drop, the
higher the resulting velocity.
It's like saying, if you
drop a rock from a height,
to drop it from one foot it will get to a
certain velocity when it hits the floor,
if you drop it from 10
feet it's going faster.
OK, that's all of this.
The red marking there
on the lower curve
just talks about the region of
turbulence and that is as these,
as this stream of ions goes out into the
lower corona, there are some collisions.
Collisions mean, that's
what temperature is, right?
Most people, I think the
average person at least,
has a very poor idea about
what's a temperature.
I know it's hot outside
but how, what is it?
It's a measure of the
vibration of the atoms
in the stuff that you're talking
about the temperature of.
What's the temperature in space?
There's no temperature in space
unless you're in a cloud of stuff.
You have, you have to talk
about the temperature of
whatever it is
you're dealing with.
Lastly, in the in the central curve
there, the electric field curve,
you'll see there's some blue areas
and some salmon colored areas.
This is strictly from
Maxwell's equations.
If you're going to have an
increasing electric field,
doesn't make any difference what
the sign of the electric field is,
if it's negative or positive,
makes no difference.
If the electric field is increasing,
you're in a region of plus charge
and you can see that's what
happens there right next to the,
the vertical axis
in the middle plot.
So, that's the
positive charge layer.
Where the photosphere, the
voltage is not changing,
there is no electric field
so there is no charge.
And the little triangle out around,
between points B, C and D,
the electric field is at first
increasing and then decreasing,
always in the same direction.
The outward force is
still positive outward
but that force is increasing for a while and
then decreasing for a while back to zero.
That's the famous double layer.
You're going to hear people in
here talk about double layers.
Hannes Alfven was famous for
double layers, Irving Langmuir
got the Nobel Prize for his
work with double layers.
That's a double layer!
That's all it is,
that is what it is.
Why don't those positive
charges and negative charges
come together and
neutralize each other?
Why do they stay separate?
Irving Langmuir found out.
That's why he got
the Nobel Prize.
There has to be a continual
current through that double layer
in order to keep it stable.
And the reason that the spicules
pull, fountain those electrons
up through the chromosphere
is so that they can come back and
satisfy Langmuir's requirement
that that double layer has to
have electrons and positive ions.
So it all seems to work.
Langmuir's work, the double layer, Hannes
Alfven's work and now Juergens' work.
All works the way it does and
it's, it all, it all correlates.
Anyway I'd like to show you this,
courtesy of Monty, this short video clip.
The first thing you're going
to see is a set of anode tufts
under very low
current excitation
and then the currents going
to increase in strength
and the plasma tufts are going
to go into the arc mode..
You'll see the photosphere,
there they are.
They don't like each other.
It's like a bunch of Kabuki
Warriors pushing each other away.
They're both, they're all
positive and they're all
looking for advantage
and not finding any.
You might hear Monty's voice in the
background if they have the audio on..
There's this increase
of the current.
The tufts have begun to go
into that's, I know the word,
it is a high glow mode or..
That's arc mode.
You can see now, it's a better model
that you can see the sun spots,
sunspots are where
there are no tufts.
There's something that, he's got the excitation
such that it looks like the chromosphere.
That little black thing in the bottom, I
guess, Michael can tell me what it is.
Is this a spectroscopic probe
or it's a probe of some sort?
There's the corona.
The ring around the
outside is the cathode.
And, of course, in the model, in the
SAFIRE model, you need a cathode.
But in real space of course there is a
cathode, there is a virtual cathode.
But there's the, the corona.
The reason, the reason that the corona
there looks like it's only on one side
is because the, the anode
is closer to the cathode
on that spot where
you get the corona.
If they were equally spaced you'd
see the corona all the way around.
Sorry for the hooky ending,
that's a, that's what
Stanley Kubrick used,
it's the end of 2001
The Space Odyssey,
but I really do believe that
that's, it is the beginning.
Okay, down to business.
There are two different types
of solar wind and this diagram,
it looks complicated as all get-out
but it's not, it's very simple.
It, forget the nice
picture of the Sun.
Just, it's there for eyewash.
This is a radial graph.
The farther out you
get from the center,
it talks about the
velocity of the solar wind
so you can see that at latitudes,
of, higher than 30 or so degrees
and actually lower than
negative 30 degrees,
the maximum velocity
of the solar wind
is somewhere around 800
kilometers per second.
Maybe they're here, it's more like
600, they say it's about 800.
In the equatorial plane of the Sun you
notice that the diagram sort of collapses,
the maximum speed of solar
wind is low, it's about 400.
This is a picture obviously, look at the
upper left, from Ulysses, the Ulysses probe
- SWOOPS, that stands for "Solar Wind
Observation over the Poles of the Sun".
You're kidding?
They didn't get over the poles!
You see the diagram stops there, they
don't know what's going on up there.
But they did get to
about 85 degrees or so.
But Ulysses, when it got to 85
degrees, it was way out beyond Jupiter
so this is not a
closed-in measurement.
And what is, the plot here is what they
measure at about one astronomical unit,
which is where we are.
On the upper pole,
what Ben was saying,
the the upper half of this
is sort of tinged in red
and the lower half
is tinged in blue
and you notice on the lower
left it says, the outward IMF.
Outward Interplanetary
Magnetic Field
is coming from the north
at this, at this point,
and then back in to the
southern hemisphere.
But that's from NASA.
Anyway, the fast solar wind
comes from normal regions
from higher solar latitudes.
This is where we begin to divide into
two different kinds of solar winds.
A fast wind is one that comes from
the, not in the equatorial region,
and it gets up to about 800
kilometers per second.
The, it comes from normal
regions, that is to say,
it comes out of the tops of the solar,
of the photo.. photospheric tufts.
Out of the, out of
the anode tufts.
The slow solar wind comes from
active regions on the Sun's surface,
in other words sun spots.
Sunspots mainly are, they wander all over
the place but they're very often in,
generally in the what you'd say
the tropical zone of the Sun.
The near, near the equator.
So just to state it succinctly,
the fast solar wind emanates from regions
on the Sun where there are no sunspots,
generally at more than
20 degrees latitude.
And it comes out of the tops
of the photospheric tufts.
It approaches 800
kilometers per second
and it gets to that maximum
at about nine radii.
It's not too far out.
I used to think it
accelerated beyond Jupiter.
It doesn't, not too much anyway.
Another interesting thing is, it's
less dense, it carries fewer ions
than the slow solar wind.
So it goes faster but it carries, it's
less dense, it carries less stuff.
Question is why?
Well, I would suggest,
this is the reason why.
There's that first
voltage curve again
and the purple is an area where there are
excited ions trying to leave the Sun.
Sun, remember, is positive, positive ions
don't like that, so they're out of here.
It's kind of like the cross-section
of a dam at the end of a reservoir.
The reservoir is the purple
area in the upper left
and so you can, I think
you can visualize that if
the most excitable, the most
excited, the most energetic
positive ion in that distance, in
that, close to the surface area,
is just higher than the voltage
of the photospheric tuft,
some of those positive ions can trickle
over the top of the dam, if you will,
and just down the.. get accelerated
down through the corona,
down through the chromosphere
into the lower corona.
It's sort of reasonable that there
wouldn't be too much density in that.
It doesn't, not too many of these guys
are able to make it over the top.
So although they drop far and they're going
like crazy when they hit the bottom,
there are not too many of them.
Because not many of them are able
to get over the top of the tuft.
So that's the reason why the fast solar
wind is fast but it's less dense,
at least that's what the
Juergens' model says.
There's a sort of analogy.
That's Hoover Dam or part
of its associated dams.
The Hoover Dam is
up the road there.
A high-velocity,
low-density flow.
The water, not much water,
gets over the dam there.
Even less would get over if you
raised that wall a little bit
and that's my solar
transistor model.
This is kind of like the,
emitter, the base and the
collector of a PNP transistor.
If you raise the voltage on the
base you cut off the current.
So again, the velocity is
high but the density is low.
There is some turbulence
at the bottom
but it's intentional in
this hydraulic analogy.
You can see they put
rocks along the bottom.
They're trying to aerate the
water before it gets past.
If you could take those rocks away and
make that a nice smooth concrete surface,
there wouldn't be any..
that would minimize the
turbulence anyway.
How about the slow solar wind?
It emanates from the equatorial
region mainly, from sunspots.
The maximum velocity is about
400 kilometers per second
and the ion density is more than 3
times denser than the fast solar wind.
OK, so the slow
solar wind is slow
but it's got a lot
of stuff in it.
My, sort of my thought analysis,
my memory crutch on this
is that the fast solar
wind is like a sports car.
Goes like hell but it doesn't have
much space for the groceries.
The slow solar wind's
like a dumptruck.
Goes slowly but boy
can it carry stuff!
So, the ion density is more than 3
times denser than the fast solar wind.
So again the question is, why?
Well, is there an
analogy for this one?
Well, remember we said that
the slow solar wind emanates
from regions where there
are lots of sunspots.
What's a sunspot?
Sunspot is a place where
there aren't any tufts.
The dam is gone.
Somebody put a hole in the dike
and there's nothing
to prevent the water.
I used a, I'll show you a slide
in a minute, that I used to show
this hydraulic analogy of the slow
solar wind and I chose a bad one.
The real analogy for
the slow solar wind,
and if I've done it right I would have
gotten a photograph of the Mississippi River
right after Hurricane
Katrina busted the dike.
So that the water in the
Mississippi isn't much higher,
that's what, 8 feet or so
higher than the ground
outside and when you break the
dike, the water, the voltage drop,
the hydrostatic head, if you
wish, is not very high.
So there's no really high velocity
but when that Dyke breaks,
wow is there a flow.
So it's again, the slow solar wind is a
region of high density, low velocity flow.
It's like a broken dike.
Anyway, that's another movie
and I've heard people decry
that that cannot happen;
"Is that what you're seeing, don't
believe your lying eyes, believe me.
I'm gonna tell you
what happened."
No, that's what really
happens and that's a picture
of what the penumbral
filaments look like.
And it's kind of
interesting that..
I maintain and you
think of it yourself,
the umbra is a place where
there aren't any any tufts.
So if you look at a cross section
of this thing, you can see tufts,
tufts, tufts, tufts, tufts, they're
all pushing on each other, you know,
the samurai warriors, they
don't like each other..
But when it comes to the edge of the
place where there aren't any tufts,
these guys don't have anything to
hold them back so they fall in.
And you can see
that's happening.
The reason I say you can see it
happen is, concentrate on the,
on the circular ring right on
the outside of the penumbra,
right between the yellow and the,
what-is-it, ochre colored areas.
You can see that the regular
tufts, the yellow area,
right near where the tufts are
breaking away, are going outward.
Can you see that?
When the tufts in the
penumbra are going inward.
Sure they hate each other, they're both
positive, groups of positive charges.
They're elbowing each other and so when
the group that is not being held back
by anything and just falls off,
when it starts to flow, to move,
it's still pushing
on the other guys.
The space is opening up and so
some fall in and some fall away.
So there's, I think that that is
proof, the fact that the yellow ones
actually move outward while the
other ones are moving inward
when space opens up for
them to be able to move,
shows that what you're seeing
is an electric reaction.
It's not a gravitational
reaction,
at least I maintain it's not.
The analogy, of course, is
the calving of icebergs.
You get a glacier and you got the ocean
or whatever that water is out there
and these things eventually
break loose and fall in.
In this case this guy that's falling
in, the process of falling in,
is not pushingon anything.
So there's no tendency for the tufts,
if you will, the potential icebergs
there in the wall of the glacier, there's
no tendency for them to move away.
Because nothing is
pushing on them.
Only gravity is pulling the
one down that's falling in.
This is not the case, so
this is a partial analogy.
It is sort of like, makes you think
about what is happening on the Sun.
But on the Sun, this guy that's falling
is pushing back like crazy on the one
that he just came away
from and he's moving back.
Here's again that picture and this
is what I claim is happening.
Just look at the red dot,
dotted line there for a second.
The voltage V2, the higher voltage is the
voltage of the, of the photospheric tuft.
V1 is the voltage of the umbra.
And ions in the umbra look up
and they don't see anything.
They just ... it's outer space
out there, that's the corona.
So they tend to fall
along that dotted path,
the dashed red curve is a voltage
profile taken up through an umbra.
And how many of them are there?
Zillions!
Because there's a lot of positive ions
inside the Sun that would love to get out
and the only reason they can't all get
out is because in a lot of there is the,
the photosphere granules
that the dam stops them.
But at an Umbra there
is no dam wall.
That's d.a.m.
So they flood out voluminously but they
don't fall from such a high height.
They fall from V1 out to the low
voltage of the solar.. of the corona.
Whereas the fast solar wind
ions that come over the top,
they leak over the top of the dam and
go all the way down in front of it.
They fall from voltage V2 so the fast
solar wind comes over the top of the dam,
screams down that cor.. chromosphere, ski
jump if you will and fly out the bottom.
The slow solar wind,
many more of them
because they don't have to
just trickle over the top.
They just go.
So the slow solar wind
has a lot of ions in it
but they're not going as fast
cause they don't drop as far.
There is a side
view of a sunspot.
What you're seeing of course,
if you listen to mainstream
astronomers they say;
"Well that's a magnetic field!"
That's not the magnetic
filed, that's plasma!
You don't see magnetic fields,
magnetic fields are invisible.
So are electric fields,
they're invisible too.
But plasma, no,
you can see that,
and so you you're seeing there
the side view of a sunspot
and the plasma is pouring
up out of that sun spot.
Over on the edge, on the lower right,
that's where, that's a normal tufts.
Here are they.
Stuff is still coming out
but much less of it.
So that's the reason why there's the
slow, the voluminous slow solar wind
and the very fast but not very
voluminous fast solar wind.
There's the slide I wish
i didn't put in there.
I should have shown a
picture of a broken dike.
This is an interesting thing.
This is the reversing falls.
I think it's a
national monument.
Does anybody know where it is?
I think it's up in Montana or
maybe Idaho, I'm not sure.
But this is a, it's not a man-made
thing, it's a natural thing.
It's the reversing falls and it converts a
fraction of, or all, of the kinetic energy
that's coming down from the upper
left, into potential energy.
In other words it it's
coming down from the
upper left as a rather
large volume of water.
When it hits this stagnant, stable,
placid pond into which this thing flows,
there's a collision of
those atoms of water.
Then there is, there's
a turbulence.
The electrical analogy of course is that
you've got a high-current coming down
hitting a place where
there are static ions.
And there's a collision
and the kinetic energy
is turned back into potential
energy, higher voltage.
And so what you get,
the electrical analogy of that
turbulent high bunch of water
is a concentration of positive ions
right at the bottom of the ski-jump.
A concentration of positive ions is a
good place for an E-field to begin
and that E-field, I claim, is
what accelerates the solar wind.
Here's a sort of a wrap-up slide
that shows, it shows it all.
You can see the photosphere, you can
see the sun spots there to the center,
to right of center..
And then coming out of that is a
tremendous flow of slow solar wind.
At the chromosphere, there's collisions with
the stable static ions in the chromosphere
and in the corona even more so.
To the, to the left, so the
middle left of the corona
you see one of the
famous coronal holes.
Coronal holes hooo, mystery.
There's nothing mysterious
about a coronal hole at all.
It's just above one
of the normal posit..
normal places on the,
on the photosphere.
It's, the coronal hole is not
where there's sun spots.
That's all it really is.
And so, what comes out
of the coronal hole?
The fast solar wind!
Sure, where is it coming from?
It's coming from the tufts
in the photosphere.
So it all makes sense.
It's elegantly simple.
Here is, I have to put this
in because I think it's a,
it really says what
I'd like to say.
This is by R.R. Grail,
he's a very well-known
or was a very well known
solar astronomer.
He said; "Our results in
measuring the solar wind
indicate that the acceleration of the solar
wind is almost complete by ten solar radii,
much closer to the Sun that had
been expected." Okay, good.
"This suggests that the
acceleration of the solar wind
and the heating of the solar corona
occur in essentially the same region
and thus that the underlying
mechanisms may be strongly linked.
They're not strongly linked,
it's the same thing!
It's the same mechanism, there's only
one mechanism and that's what does it.
Juergens' model says it all.
And all of these properties of the fast solar
wind, the slow solar wind, the densities..
are all explained by..
OK, one sort of just,
I would call it a technical slide
but it's, it's the statistics.
What they say, statistics don't
lie but statisticians do.
Here's the statistics
so they don't lie.
The two columns are; one for the slow solar
wind and one for the fast solar wind.
The first line is
the flow speed.
And you're talking about the
velocity of protons, VP.
And so the slow solar wind's highest velocity
is around 400 kilometers per second,
by fast solar wind
it's about 800.
I hope you guys in the
back can read this.
The proton density however, in the slow
solar wind, is 10.7 per cubic centimeter.
In the fast solar wind it's 3.
So the fast solar wind is, contains
one-third less than the slow solar wind.
The proton temperature is, if you go down
there, it's a 2.3 times ten to the fifth.
It looks like you're comparing
2.3 to 3.4 but you're not.
3.4 is multiplied by 10 to the fourth so
it's kind of like comparing 3.4 to 23.
OK, so the fast solar wind,
that proton temperature is
much higher than the
slow solar wind, why?
Because it's been through the mixmaster,
it's been through the ski jump.
Then look at, and this is the last
thing I will look at this page,
the electron temperature.
It's just the opposite.
The electron temperature is 1.3 in the
solar wind and 1.0 in the fast wind.
So the electrons don't
take part in this.
Why?
Because the electrons don't go over
the hill, they don't get excited.
That hill is a hill
only for positive ions.
If you want to know what happens to
electrons, you have to take that
cross-section of the of the
dam and turn it upside down.
If you turn it upside down
it looks like a saucepan.
So if electrons are coming into
the Sun from the lower corona,
they collect in the saucepan.
What's the saucepan?
It's the photospheric tuft.
The electrons come pouring in, happy as
larks, because they're coming downhill,
"yeah here we are we're going
to collect in the pan"
and they build up and build up more and
more electrons and finally what do they do?
They neutralize the positive charges
and they kill the photospheric tuft.
That's why the photospheric
tufts disappear.
They fill up with
incoming electrons.
Anyway there's more I can say about that
but I'm running out of the time here.
The only quantitatively
determined force
capable of achieving a fast solar wind
acceleration is the electric force.
And I did some work on this.
I won't bore you with
the mathematics but
I simply would say that my
final result is step 3 there.
I've derived the electric field
strength necessary to accelerate
the fast solar wind to 800
kilometers per second.
All sorts of people have tried
to do that and have failed
to come up with a mechanism.
Remember, the corona is a
non collisional corona.
It's non-collisional plasma.
They don't bounce off each other,
they just increase in velocity.
And if you put a positive ion in an
electric field, it will do just that.
Well how strong this
electric field have to be?
There is the answer, less than seven
tenths of a micro volt per meter.
At a distance of about three solar
radii, the end of the corona.
Seven-tenths of a
micro volt per meter.
Monty, that's your next job.
Find out whether or not a
glow mode plasma can support
an electric field of seven tenths
of a micro volt per meter.
If it can, that's the answer.
OK
There's the advertisement.
That's my website.
If you go to electric-cosmos.org,
you'll get that.
The stuff in white at the lower right hand
is a, you can, they are clickable links
and if you're interested in the gory
details of the mathematics involved
in both, the first one is the Birkeland
Current thing that I presented last year..
The second one is the solar
surface transistor action
that says what happens if you
raise or lower the dam and
and, can you curtail
the fast solar wind..
Yeah, you can cut it off!
Just like cutting off a transistor,
the solar wind stopped for two days,
back about six or
eight years ago.
The third one is what I'm talking about
now, the solar wind acceleration.
So anyway, I won't
bore you further.
Juergens' electric sun model explains
why the plasma corona exists
and explains the
temperature profile
and I submit that my,
what I've just told you,
the photospheric tufts are
variable electrical barriers
for positive ions attempting
to escape from the Sun..
Explains why there are two very different
solar winds, one fast and one slow,
why the fast wind is faster
and the slow wind is slower,
why the electron temperature
is the same in both.
Because the electrons don't go through
that process, they're just there.
And besides, on the average
they're coming in.
Not that some don't
leave, they do.
But they're not affected by
that, the shoot to shoot,
the ski jump and all the rest of that
stuff that the positive ions are.
And it explains why tufts go away,
because they fill up full of electrons..
And why the first solar wind
comes out of coronal holes..
And the stretching of sunspot
punumbra is electrical.
Anyway, I think that only the
electric sun model can explain this.
Thank you!

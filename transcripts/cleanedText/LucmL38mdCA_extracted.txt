You've just entered the
theater of an alien sky.
If the words and images seem strange
to you, there's a reason for this.
Our world was once a
vastly different place.
To experience this won't hurt you, 
and there is nothing to fear.
The Labyrinth
The Crane Dance of Theseus
In following the ancient
story of the labyrinth,
the most obvious question is why?
From what human experience did
this remarkable ancient idea arise?
In our investigation of
the theme, the first clue
emerges from the archetypal
personalities we've come to recognize.
Mother goddess, warrior
hero, and chaos monster,
all with a displaced
sovereign power
lurking in the background.
For several decades, we sought
to illuminate such archetypes.
In that work, we've
described the emergence
and progressive evolution of an
extraordinary spectacle in the Heavens.
A gathering of
planets close to Earth.
Planets, inspiring the myth-making
epoch of human history.
A radical claim is that the
archetypes, the global patterns,
are explained uniquely and concretely by
the planetary history we've reconstructed.
Specifically, a gathering of
planets extremely close to Earth.
Yes, that idea will
appear preposterous,
but preposterous only until one
sees that hundreds of archetypes,
hundreds of global cross cultural
themes become predictable.
And not just as general themes
but down to hundreds of
highly specific details.
As newcomers to this topic
will quickly discover,
it's the apparent absurdity of mythology
that ultimately changes the picture,
to the extent that things
begin to make sense.
Nothing in our familiar experience
would anticipate, much less account for,
the archetypal theme of
externalized intestines.
A theme we noted briefly
in our prior discourse.
That theme arose in relation to the remarkable
face of the Mesopotamian giant Humbaba
displaying nothing else
than knotted intestines.
But actually, it's this transparently
absurd feature that opens the door
to a much broader
field of evidence.
From the Americas to Africa
and the South Pacific,
we find recollections of the
dancing warrior trickster hero
either unraveling
his own intestines
or the intestines of
an alter ego figure.
That such bizarre imagery would
occur from one land to another,
surely requires an explanation.
And a believable, fact-based
explanation must be possible.
One of numerous examples will be found
amongst the North American Ojibwe
whose trickster Nanabozho
loses his intestines
in his wanderings and
hangs them in a tree.
Well, that's not an idea one would expect
in the normal course of human experience,
either primitive or modern.
In some tales, intestines are pulled
from the trickster causing his death.
In closely linked stories, they
become food for other creatures,
or the trickster himself eat
fragments of his own intestines,
thinking they are food.
Well such absurdities are, as
we've repeatedly discovered,
the window to the hidden
substructure of collective memories
crying out for investigation.
For those who will follow the logical
ground rules of this investigation,
the outcome will be a full and
convincing explanation of world mythology,
down to virtually all of
the recurrent patterns.
If our fundamental
observation is correct,
it could not be otherwise.
It seems that the labyrinthine
dance of the hero Theseus,
as cited in our
previous Discourse,
gives us some powerful clues.
The dance had its own
unique and awkward form
called the crane dance,
made famous by the Warrior's successful
entry into the Cretan labyrinth.
At the level of common perception, the
whole thing is indeed ridiculous.
But that's why it's so
essential to view the story
through the lens of
our starting point,
the reconstructed
polar configuration.
Suddenly the crane dance of
Theseus becomes predictable.
A uniquely appropriate visual
image of the off-axis movements
of the legendary warrior,
the masculine power Mars
in his labyrinthian dance.
This awkward bobbing movement
would not even be possible
without the off-axis
displacement suggested here.
Of course, given our overarching
interest in the global sub-structure,
we could not possibly limit our
attention to test one localized idea.
Numerous Hindu myths
describing the dance of Shiva
are complemented by wide-ranging
images of a hero or trickster
whose arms and legs mimic
the whorl- or swastika- form
of the discharge streamers we've
noted in our previous Discourse.
It was said that the warrior Shiva
held his consort Sati above his head.
Again, as we should expect.
And in their violent whirling
movements the body or essence of Sati
was dispersed in flame.
Another seeming absurdity,
but a perfect reflection
of the discharge activity,
we've located at the visual
center of the labyrinth.
Here's the description of Shiva's
dance by Stella Kramrisch
in her book The
Presence of Shiva,
"He danced exceedingly,
his arms flailing the regions,
The stars were scattered
by the swish of his hair.
Death, love and despair syncopated the
escalating speed of his Tandava dance;
the earth shook while Siva went on
dancing in frenzy, his eyes whirling...
As Shiva danced on and on, the body
of Sati became lighter and lighter,
and he saw that limbs and
parts had fallen from it."
In the end, all that was
left was the mythic yoni,
the core feminine
identity of the goddess,
which means of course the
archetypal goddess, the planet Venus.
A comparative analysis will
show that the god's forearms,
here described as
flailing the regions,
are beyond any reasonable doubt
the arms of the equal end cross.
The cross that in prior,
more stable phases,
marked out the four regions of four
quarters of the celestial habitation.
In other words, the seemingly outrageous
depictions are indeed internally consistent.
As noted in our
previous Discourse,
when the fourfold discharge
was set in a whirling motion,
the effect was a
swastika-like pattern.
And so in ancient Sumerian symbolism
we see the arms of the swastika
in their undeniable connection to the
long flowing hair of female figures,
reminding us of the words of the
Sumerian Inanna, the planet Venus,
to her consort Damuzi,
"I will whirl my hair
in heaven for you."
When the mythic imagery is
seen in its original context,
no image of the swastika
makes more sense
than that of the goddess's
luminous whirling hair
at the center of the labyrinth.
An obvious complement is the
occasional image of the Medusa head
with its wildly disheveled hair
at the center of the labyrinth
giving rise to the symmetrical
three legs of the Triskelion.
As we previously observed,
it was from that chaotic
discharge activity
that the more stable symmetrical
discharge phases emerged.
Consider also the underlined similarity
of Theseus's archetypal dance
to the famous dance
of the hindu Shiva
also occurring in
conjunction with a goddess,
who becomes the warrior's
consort as we should expect.
And not just a goddess,
but the goddess Venus in
particular, as we should also expect.
In the Iliad, Homer tells us that the
legendary King Daedalus, quoting here,
"once wrought in Knosos broad a
dancing-ground for fair-haired Ariadne."
Of course the fair-haired Ariadne is a recognized
alter ego of the fair-haired Aphrodite,
or Venus.
But perhaps the best clue is provided
by the golden thread of Ariadne,
said to have been unraveled by Theseus
as he danced through the winding passages.
By this identification,
the unraveling thread
becomes a perfect analog
to the unwinding intestines
appearing in other variations
of the same archetypal theme.
As we repeatedly noted, the
symbolic spiraling life breath,
in its mythic interpretation as
a coiled cord or lock of hair,
meant nothing else than
the cometary essence
of the Venus goddess herself.
In this realization, it becomes clear
that the hero's unraveling of the thread
in his meandering dance
is in fact a corollary
to the Hindu Shiva's
whirling dispersal of the
essence of his consort Sati,
the goddess Venus.
To oversimplify a complex story, we can see
that the hero unwinding the golden thread
means the same thing as the hero
unwinding his own intestines,
which means the same
thing as the hero
making his way through the
passages of the labyrinth,
which means the same
thing as the awkward dance
or the crane dance of the
hero and the goddess.
So the seeming competition
between incompatible storytelling
is instantly resolved by allowing the
underlying events to shine through.

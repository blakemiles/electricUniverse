The SAFIRE technology was designed and
built to replicate the atmosphere of the
Sun in a laboratory on Earth, and
to test the Electric Sun model.
These are the
factors we control.
These are some of the things the
SAFIRE lab is now capable of.
These are some of
our recent discoveries.
In our tests and experiments, we have found
no disparities with the Electric Sun model.
In fact, all the evidence to date
indicates that electricity is the primal
force in the universe.
Michael Clarage arrives from Boston.
We have just completed our latest
experiments in the lab and were
confronted with mountains of information
and imagery from a score of data recorders.
The plan is to park ourselves in
my garage for two weeks and prepare
for the upcoming
conference in the UK.
Analyzing the SAFIRE data
is like going through a
door only to discover
another door beyond.
Doors upon doors opening
to unfamiliar territory.
We're looking for a coherent story
that we can present at the conference.
Something that happens in a few seconds
in the lab can take weeks to analyze.
Turning those analyses into a
45 minute PowerPoint presentation is
another challenge all together.
A year ago, the SAFIRE review team set
the agenda for the next 12 months.
The plan was to focus on three things: energy,
transmutation, and finding parallels
between the SAFIRE Sun in the
lab and the Sun in the sky.
During the year, we also gave
talks at the Electric Universe
UK conference in 2018, the New England
Venture summit, and MIT in Boston.
It is two days away from the conference in
Bath, and we still don't have our story yet.
Scott Mainwaring and I go over the
material to be presented at the
conference tomorrow.
Scott was responsible for our original
mandate which was to test the Electric
Sun model by replicating the atmosphere
of the Sun in a lab on Earth.
Given the discoveries of the last 12 months,
Scott states that we fulfilled our
research objectives
and our mandate.
The International Science Foundation has
given us the amazing luxury of doing
pure science for
the last five years.
Now it is for us to turn what we've
learned into something useful, something
beneficial to humanity.
I realize the story Michael and I've
been struggling to articulate is only
partly about what we've
discovered this past year.
The more complete story needs
to include our new mandate.
Ladies and gentlemen, Monty Childs and
Dr. Michael Clarage, the SAFIRE project.
You can hear everything can you?
I even hear myself.
So we're gonna start from the beginning,
there's two fundamental components to
thermodynamics when you're
heating something up.
If you have a pot of water and you
have a candle underneath it, it
might take an hour to heat it up to bring it to
a boil, then it stabilizes at that temperature.
So that's what we
call steady state.
What's important is that if you take a
blowtorch from the mine down the road, OK,
that they use to melt steel, and put
underneath the pot; that rise in
temperature is gonna happen maybe within
a couple of seconds, and the water will
come to its steady state or maybe
it'll go on and just vaporize.
So I want you to keep that in mind
as we walk through this section.
In the lab, when we're running
that particular bright ball, so
Ben's there, he's capturing his video, we're
capturing video on our screens and the computers...
The anode, you heard me saying that 'bring
it back, bring the power back, bring it
back, bring it back back,
please bring it back!'
Reason is because we're reaching the
reactor maximum temperature and we
weren't able to stop it.
Dr. Lowell Morgan, myself and a guy named
Tommy Mello who actually works in
development of computational fluid
dynamics code, and that code is used by
NASA and Lockheed and others, all
kinds of corporations to do
thermodynamic analysis, in other words
rocket engines, cooling systems and the
transfer of heat and energy.
It's very complex, very
expensive, but it's very
powerful software, and
that's what we use today.
So we can predict very accurately,
if we understand that the factors
involved, how something
should perform.
And that's how they design your car
engines, so they don't overheat any more.
Our calculations showed that we needed,
in order for us to reach maximum reactor
temperature, our power supply
had to be at 100% power output.
So just imagine a hundred percent, means that
you've got a blowtorch underneath the pot.
The max. temperature of the chamber
should be about 113 degrees Celsius.
The other numbers we just kind
of tested at different levels of what
kind of temperatures that
the chamber should respond to.
The seven percent, we're gonna
get into in a few seconds, is
actually where the power was set, when
you see that anode and where we're
actually creating the
transmutation of elements.
This is a model, some of you may have seen
it from 2016, when we did the analysis.
When it's cooled, with the cooling
systems at full power, shouldn't
reach much higher than
about 110-113 degrees.
At a full power, cooling system
on, steady-state, 110-113 degrees.
When we did our calculations, each of us did them
separately, we were all within 50 degrees of each other.
Without cooling the chamber, it
would heat up to 500 degrees Celsius.
So that hundred degrees, or 110, actually
represents 500 degrees Celsius without cooling.
So when I say 50 degrees,
you might say well that's 50%
but it's actually 50 degrees of 500 and
then we put cooling on it and it should come
to this, so for three years we've been
running the experiment and SAFIRE has
responded predictably, until now.
We have on our SCADA system, you see here in
the screen above, it's at 113 degrees,
we have thermocouples, we have 12
thermocouples all around the chamber,
measuring to make
sure that it's stable.
And we can monitor these
things cause it's important.
So what this graph
is, is a video.
The red line represents the infrared
camera, that's the one we're
looking at the anode to tell what its
temperature is, so it doesn't, it's not
compromised thermally or melt.
The blue one is called a
bolometer, it measures,
you might say, a relative energy
measurement of what's coming off the end.
It's not a total measurement of energy
as such of what SAFIRE is putting out.
The Gold Line is
actually the thermocouple.
So this is a day's worth of experiment
sped up a couple of thousand times.
That’s what our day looks like, we
work very quickly, as you can see.
Isn’t that interesting,
we're at the peak.
So it's climbing and falling, we're
changing chemistry, you might say the gas
composition, power settings, and we're
monitoring the thermal temperature of
the anode and the chamber.
Yes, that is the anode melting.
We didn't know it at the time, because it was
happening so slowly, but we realized what
was happening, we had to shut 
SAFIRE down, it got too hot.
What I want you to observe here is the
angle of that yellow line and that is
real-time rise in 
temperature over time.
This is the real-time, and the rise in
temperature over time is identical to
what we calculated at hundred percent
max power, but we're only at 7%.
The fall here represents after we shut it down, 
as you saw in the video, we couldn't control
at that point of time so we
start dialing the power back.
And we were only at 7%.
For me, doing mechanical engineering and
what I do, everybody gets excited, well,
it's all this heat, probably it's
like, can we run the reactor?
Now, this next picture is
not a black and white, this
next picture shows you when we change
the composition of the catalyst, it
actually takes heat out of the system to
a point where the anode, if you can see
it here, doesn't even register and that's
at max. power, dials turned up to 11, OK?
And that's what we get,
so we can cool it down.
So we can introduce certain compositions and
things and take energy out of the system.
100 percent max power gives
you a hundred percent maximum
thermal stable state energy
or heat in the chamber.
Seven percent gave us a hundred
percent plus because we couldn't
track where it was going to stop.
I don't like to boast about our error so our
calculations were only off by 93 percent.
I'm 62 and I'm telling the truth,
I've never been off 93 percent of anything
in the engineering I've done in the
past, and that's a big number.
It's not just me, it was Lowell, it was 
Tommy, chamber shouldn't be doing this.
SAFIRE can create, control, contain, and
repeat any number of plasma regimes.
For five years, SAFIRE has performed exactly within
the limits it was designed for, until now.
This recent catalytic event was not
predicted and according to plasma
physics, it should not
have happened but it did.
This is calling into question our
understanding of plasma physics and will
require a new math and a collaboration
of complementary disciplines to resolve.
These recent catalytic events have not
been observed before, they're new and
show the potential for a clean,
energy-efficient reactor.
Transmutation -- finally!
2017, we had some interesting
results but we weren't in a
place to talk about 
it with confidence.
Today we are.
So this is before, this is
during a plasma discharge.
What's interesting about this is that the
plasma double layers have collapsed down
and become very intense around the anode
and now it's giving a uniform coronal glow.
Just keep this in mind as we go
through this presentation.
And this is after, and we said
well, that's interesting.
In other words, so we decided
it was time to subject it to what's
called Scanning Electron
Microscopy (SEM) and EDAX.
They kind of go 
hand in hand.
Technology's been around for thirty years
and scanning electron microscopy is just
a very powerful microscope.
EDAX basically is technology where they
energize the elements that are on the
sample and they can tell you
definitively what those elements are.
And they use it for forensic sciences, all
kinds of things, and it's a standard
piece of equipment, it's about a million
bucks for one, I would say, standard or
common, but it's very good.
So this is June and
another lab that we work with
and what we did with the sample so, when
you go over a sample like this on
scanning electron microscope, it's almost
like scanning over top of a planetary
surface, so just imagine that you're
in a satellite or a rocket, and you're
saying well, that's interesting!
So pretend you're in there, zooming in with
the microscope, things get interesting...
And then we said, what
are you doing there?
A ball and then you can get into
all kinds of discussions about how a
sphere can form in 
an experiment like this.
And there's a lot of people who would agree
that to get a sphere like this has to
form in a non-gravitational environment,
so if you want to make spheres you throw
particles up that are heated and as they
glide through the atmosphere they become spherical.
We don't know what it was, we
didn't know why was there.
There's better pictures of this, but just
take a look at something, there's some
almost like tectonic 
thing happening here.
We can't tell you some of the
things that we did to get there
but we can show 
you the results.
So if you see some of the elements missing,
that's some of the elements that we
can't discuss, but what's interesting is,
these elements that you see were not in
the chamber before, and SAFIRE is
making lanthanum and it's making cerium.
It's making carbon, 
it's making oxygen.
So we went and scanned another region and
said well, that's interesting, that
doesn't look like the 
base materials at all.
And this is what we found, we found
phosphorus and silicon and titanium and
oxygen and magnesium and calcium and
sodium and potassium and aluminum and
carbon and chlorine and sulfur.
Those were also not, we know
definitively they were not in there.
What you see here in
the previous slide is that these
formations are actually
growing out of the surface.
Growing, that's 
what it looked like.
This looks like actually a
fish egg sack full of particles.
So we said well, nobody's gonna
believe us, because well, we’re the
SAFIRE team and of course we're
completely biased, that's how they're
gonna see it so we said, this particular
agency said, we have a lab for you if you
want to validate your results
and send it down to this lab.
And it's a lab that they use 
and Lockheed uses it and others...
We say OK, why don’t you go on scan 
the sample and tell us what you find.
And this is what they found.
Wow, that's a really interesting ball,
and what is going on there. It's like these
particles forming in here 
and they confirmed the
fact that the predominant elements of 
that ball are cerium and lanthanum.
These are heavy elements.
And they scanned another area,
and they came up with
titanium, chromium, zinc,
phosphorus and carbon.
What we did is, because our EDAX machine isn't
as good as theirs, they have a bigger budget.
They can resolve for carbon and
some of the lighter elements
and they resolved some of the predominant
elements there, in fact SAFIRE is making
carbon, zinc is not there
and neither is phosphorus.
So this is some of things that it's
making but there's even more coming.
What's interesting is the topography and
this is as close as we're gonna get.
This is basically, you might say 
it doesn't look like crystals but in
metallurgy you use the
word crystalline structure.
You can see how the top surface of the main
nodules in the material have been eroded.
What's also interesting is the vent
holes that are here in this material.
So we said well, that's 
interesting, let's go and take a
look down in between these mountains or
these guys and we found other
things like calcium and chlorine and
carbon and potassium, and these are
certified materials, so we got them 
from a certified company, certified
spectroscopy done on the materials
before we actually put it in the chamber.
So we want to make sure we're doing right
science before we start making claims
like this, especially
these kinds of claims.
We start with the periodic table
of elements and we're using the word
catalyst because we can't think of a
better term to use for the types of gas
constituent or composition and the
materials that we have that
the anode is being exposed to.
So we're just saying these 
are catalysts, we introduced those
into the chamber and when we fired it up
and that nice bright anode that you saw
that looks like a Sun, this is what it returned,
these are the new elements minus the catalyst.
The aluminum and silica we wrote 
off because well, our probe is
alumina, so we figure well, maybe this is
contamination meaning it may be making it, may
not be, we're just going to say
look, let's just dismiss it.
But you have a pile 
more that SAFIRE is making.
Now, what's cool about this is 
that we can repeat the experiment.
OK, and get the same results and we've
dialed it up, then we dialed it down, and we
can, you know, it's tuned that's what
Wal was talking about, you know,
good technology bringing to bear modern
technology that Birkeland didn't have.
Well, this is what modern technology can
bring us, it can bring us some answers or
actually many more questions.
So, optical spectroscopy; this
is Michael's thing, I'm
his Padawan, OK, when it comes to
optical spectroscopy, but he's going to talk
to you what we found in the atmosphere.
The optical spectroscopy is used to
study the atmosphere of the discharge.
What Monty was talking about is a
surface analysis of the metal.
Optical spectroscopy is used again to
study the atmosphere around the anode.
I'm gonna have to go over there, okay. This is
wavelengths of light coming out of the
chamber and optical spectroscopy is like
a really fancy prism that shows you the
rainbow colors that are
in your glowing sample.
It's a wonderful science, it's
been perfected for so many decades that
it's one of the most reliable tools that
an astronomer or a plasma physicist has to study.
When you light up the chamber
at low discharge with a simple
atmosphere, you might see that line and
maybe one more here, OK, because it's a
very simple discharge, it's
easy to know what's in there.
When you turn up the power and
you get things really rolling
in there, you get this
whole sea of lines.
A lot of elements 
produce similar lines.
When your circuits are complicated, it's
not so easy but it's a wonderful game, it's
like Sudoku on steroids, if you try
to find out what elements might be
producing the lines that you're seeing.
It's part of the art
of the science there.
And it took us a while but then we
noticed this triplet here, this a triplet
of lines that are 
very close together.
This triplet here and this triplet here,
and our intuition said,
let's focus on those because that's so
unique of a fingerprint, no group of
elements would make that,
it's got to be one.
That was the 
intuition at least.
And if you ask your optical spectroscopy
software to match the known lines of
different elements, after a lot of
hunting, we came across manganese and
manganese lies exactly on this triplet,
this triplet, and this triplet.
It's basically impossible that that could be
any other, statistically impossible, any
other element or 
group of elements.
These other ones, we don't 
know yet, we're still
hunting, it takes a 
lot of hours to hunt
this sort of a diagram.
So that means that we have
manganese, which is another
metal that is in the atmosphere but not
on the surface, right, we don't know why
but it's very clear
that that's happening.
We also saw in the atmosphere the
green ones here, the lithium is also
in the atmosphere that was not on the
surface, the manganese and then the
sodium, the Na there that appears in both,
the surface of the anode and in the atmosphere.
One of my challenges when we designed
SAFIRE was that, okay, we can do
post-experimental analysis on lots of materials,
but the real challenge is, when is it happening?
So if you do see transmutation,
do you know when or under
what conditions these
reactions are happening?
And so what we can tell you today
is, we know now when it's happening.
It's because the spectroscopy tells us, we can
dial it up and we see it come up, then we
dial it down and it disappears except
for the prominent lines of the
particular gas constituent
we have in there.
So what we can tell you is that
manganese is not one of the gas, part of
the gas compositions, we know that, and
this is laboratory quality stuff, and not
with that kind of signal.
You're gonna enjoy this.
So always when we're running these
experiments, part of my job is to
keep in mind the connection
with cosmology.
Cosmology allows you to place
everything that you might experience as
a human on this planet
into some framework, and that has
definitely been at the start of the
SAFIRE project as well.
Here is some framework to put
some of these results in.
This is his normal rate,
speed, Monty, keep up!
Planets, very dynamic electrical systems,
currents flowing in and out, and from
what we know now, it's not as simple,
it's not simply a current like flowing
through a wire into something and
out the other end, current flows in and
out of the North Pole, current flows 
in and out of the South Pole.
I just drew one of the ring currents up there, 
I think we're up to about four or five now,
that we know about, it's
very complicated stuff.
So let's take that starting point
as what we know about our local
environment, put it inside the solar
system, so stars also, they do have and we
will eventually measure currents going
in and out of their poles as well.
The numbers are a little tough to nail down
but a planet might have ten to the
seventh, so ten million amps, more or less
flowing in, a star might have a billion
amps flowing in and out of it.
You start to see the pattern when you
draw the pictures, this is a cosmic
blueprint, if you will, for how electrical
structures are formed.
Each star is also following this blueprint but
then its sub members also follow the blueprint.
The planets are receiving their energy
from their star, the star is connected to
its source of power, the planets are
connected to their source of power and
their source of
power is their Sun.
So you have to imagine if not direct
currents flowing between them, at least
some sort of resonance or induction, but the
planets only get their power from their Sun.
If you imagine one of those 
being Jupiter, say one of those
planets there, and we look at the sky,
we see Jupiter as a dot, pretty small dot,
right, but the magnetosphere of Jupiter,
the body, the real body of Jupiter is
huge, it would take up, if you did this
with your arm to the nighttime sky,
that's how big the body of Jupiter 
would look if we had eyes to see it.
OK, so composition of planets, as Wal
so well said years ago, we understand
planetary formation so little currently,
that we need a different theory of
planetary formation for every
planet in our solar system.
One of the patterns
that we see in electrical systems
throughout all of nature
is membranes, boundaries.
The plasma naturally forms
its own version of a membrane or a boundary.
So we'll start with our star,
shorthand it, right, and then we'll ask
how does the star fit in its world, the
neighborhoods that it comes from and lives in?
So that green there is an
interstellar filament which you can kind
of see in the background of the slide
here, and the stars are set up on those filaments.
Before the advent of the
Herschel and Planck Space Telescopes, we
honestly believed that the stars were
randomly distributed in the sky.
We believed that, right, and then once you see
the filaments, every star we see in the
sky is on a filament, there's
no randomness to it
if you can see the
underlying structure behind it.
There's also these other blobs that we
see now and as a scientific community
we're bounded by what we already know about and so
they have a name, they're called protostars.
Any time somebody uses the word 
proto, you know they don't know
what they're talking about, right?
So I don't think they're stars, they might be,
I don't know, the point is, they might be
something else, they don't have to be on
this track that we call be a star, right,
they could be something else that is
needed in the interstellar medium.
We have found, to date, over 200 organic
molecules in the interstellar medium.
I'm sure that number will continue to
grow exponentially as we study more and more.
One of the big questions, of course,
is where do they come from, how do they
form, how do they get there?
Now what about the inorganics
in the interstellar medium?
Again, the number keeps growing but these
have been known about for quite a while.
That group right there, of 11
elements -- inorganics, metals,
are known to be out there
in the interstellar medium.
How did they get there, why are 
they there, big questions, right?
We thought well, wait a minute, we
have a list to compare this to,
why don't we compare this known list
from stars and interstellar medium,
why don't we compare that to which 
ones we find in SAFIRE, right?
Yeah, so pretty good, right?
I think the evidence 
speaks for itself.
I think the evidence speaks for itself, 
might even demand a verdict, yes, right.
Dark mode plasma, this is something 
that, for our research, started
from Scott Mainwaring who quoted that
wonderful line from Edgar Allan Poe
about there being dark
stars in the sky.
I don't know the exact quote, but
it was in the back of our
minds all this time as to well, what's
going on in a plasma environment that's
under tension but 
it's not discharging?
That's an important question, right, and
even though it was on our docket for
exploration, when we found it 
we weren't looking for it.
Life in the lab.
Yes, so here's an image of dark mode 
plasma, yeah, this is our anode, right,
and so just to give you a picture that's
in the center of the chamber, but the
probe, our voltage probe comes in from
the outside and measures the floating
potential of the plasma as it's 
moving around in the chamber.
And at a certain point, the probe
started going crazy but
there's no discharge in the chamber, and
we spent some time studying the spatial
extent of that 
strange phenomenon.
It varies in size depending upon the
parameters in the atmosphere right, how
big that that boundary is.
What's amazing about 
this is that we have
a very sharp voltage drop just
off the surface of the anode,
a plasma double-layer and there's
no visible plasma, voltage goes to almost
zero and it goes right back
up to, almost, anode potential.
And there's no plasma.
So I want to contrast it to the glow 
mode to see, you get a reference, we
would call that a form of glow mode and
at the middle, a very clear atmosphere, very
clear boundary at the
edge of the discharge.
When you run the potential probe 
through that, you see that chart on
the left, so that's
electrical potential, that's
the voltage at that point in space, at
that point in the plasma, and you can see
when you come up, there's that sharp
boundary coming up from the left side,
that's sharp boundary, that's that outer
edge of the blue ball, glowing mode, and
as you come in, the potential rises
very steeply, you'll notice the potential
drops down basically to zero, right
before you touch the anode, and then, when
you touch the anode, it jumps up to 
the voltage we set the anode to.
This is what we saw running 
the probe in and out of the
dark mode so we had the chamber under
tension, a lot of volts, you don't see
anything going on, but then you can see
that's the chart of what the probe is
telling us is in the chamber.
There's a lot of arguments about what it is 
this is telling us, and as a contrast you can
see some stack over each other, very
different behavior, very different shapes,
very different sizes of potential in there...
I want to emphasize that we don't
know what it means, OK, there's some
previous research on this sort of thing
where the probe you're running in a
chamber discharge shows this kind of
really rapid and intense pulsations,
but no one's studied it spatially.
It brings you right up against the problem
we've known since the ‘20s which is, you
can't actually measure anything
without affecting it.
There's this idealization that 
you can somehow measure something
that's really there even if you're not looking at
it, OK, but that's not the truth of nature.
So we know it's an interaction
between our probe and the anode, but
nature is always that way.
If you think about the solar system and the
electrical distribution in the solar
system, it's not just a
Sun sitting there in isolation,
there's planets, there's comets, and all
of those, you could say, serve as the
probe in the solar system and so they're
going to be experiencing something like this.
I'll talk tomorrow about some of the
astronomical implications of that.
The SAFIRE team is now developing 
the new mandate for SAFIRE.
We're going to take what we've learned
and turn it into something useful.
For the immediate future, we are focused
primarily on clean energy generation.
We have already designed a
prototype energy generator.
But some of these things really came
together in the last, maybe three weeks, and
we're saying, what's 
the SAFIRE story?
OK, so we want to change the conversation from
zero-point energy and free energy to efficiency.
We're gonna be talking about
that a little bit more
tomorrow, because there's
no free lunch.
If you think about your cars, the oil is
out there and it's in the ground and it
gets sequestered, then it gets pulled and
it's put into tanks then it's refined
and then it's pumped into your tank
where it's actually focused and you burn
it, you harvest the energy
that has to offer.
Actually the same thing happens
with a hydroelectric dam, now you've
got this river running through it, put up
a dam, focus that potential energy
into one particular place, we do
the same thing with uranium.
We want to, on our SAFIRE team, change the
conversation from zero-point energy and
these kinds of things out there, because
we don't believe they happen like that.
We don't see it in nature.
Energy generation is all about efficiency, how
one determines efficiency is much debated,
but the Wall Street Journal factored in
the cost of the fuel itself, the cost of
production, the cost of damage that 
fuel and oil production does to the
environment; and came up
with a picture like this.
Ultimately, nature itself shows us
the most efficient way to do things.
SAFIRE will fit somewhere
in this picture.
The fact that the main fuel is hydrogen,
the most abundant element in the
universe, and that the process is clean
and produces no negative side effects or
waste products makes SAFIRE a very
attractive energy generating technology.
Elemental transmutation occurs both in nature and
in the laboratory and is not a new phenomenon.
Studies done at MIT have shown
that when radioactive waste
is exposed to hydrogen isotope nuclei,
the observed decay rate of the
radioactive material is
effectively increased.
SAFIRE produces copious amounts 
of hydrogen nuclei that interact
with other elements, creating self-organizing
spherical plasma double layer shells.
Within these shells, electrons,
ions, and molecules, are trapped by
powerful electromagnetic fields.
This is where radioactive material would
be exposed to the hydrogen nuclei
to remediate the radioactivity
of that material.
One of the confusing aspects, if you only
think that gravity and turbulence and
heat are your causal factors, none of
this is ever, you can never explain this
how there's so much structure.
We see a spatial structure there, right, one
of the benefits of the current suite of
telescopes around the Earth is that you
can also see elements and energetic
states of elements, and those
are segregated also.
So what you might be looking at
here is a center region of
hydrogen that has been collected in the
middle, and then that bright boundary
might be a layer of excited hydrogen.
Right outside of that, that
orange boundary might be cold
carbon monoxide just sitting right there,
right next to that inner shell, and then
right outside of that you might find energized calcium
sitting right next to those other layers.
How that happens?
We see that naturally in the SAFIRE
chamber, all those double layers and
different structures you see, those are
segregated and separated different
elements, molecules, and energetic states.
And we're not trying to
force it to do that.
We don't have a giant billion-dollar 
ITER machine that uses 20
mega-watts of energy to try to just
contain the plasma so it doesn't blow apart.
We're not trying to force anything
in our chamber, we are studying what
nature shows us, what it gives us
naturally of her own design.
So, summary.
So we have energy, we have transmutation
and we have the Sun and interstellar medium.
We see a cohesive picture.
The Electric Sun model gave us the 
premise with which to engineer the
SAFIRE reactor.
Once constructed, the proof
of concept bell jar version of
SAFIRE was up and running within minutes.
Likewise, once constructed, the
44,000 part SAFIRE reactor was also up
and running within minutes.
At every step of the way, the Electric
Sun model's predictions proved accurate.
What if the process used to
create the SAFIRE Sun turns out to
be similar to the process that 
creates the real Sun and stars?
The scientific community would
have a field day with door opening.
That would be
the big picture.
In all our experiments and discoveries, we have 
found no disparities with the Electric Sun model.
All the evidence to date points to
electricity as the primal force in nature.
We believe the SAFIRE
project validates and supports the
Electric Sun model.
SAFIRE's new mandate is to create
beneficial and commercially viable
transformative technologies 
for Humanity.
That's what tomorrow's talk will be
about, it'll be really the story and
where do we go from here, and what should
we do with SAFIRE, should we stop the research?
Caesar, up -- down, OK,
off with their heads.
So I guess, we'll leave that
with you, I hope you've enjoyed it.

In the Big Bang model in the early universe,
young galaxies were incredibly active
and their centers produce fast plasma jets
that stretch for incredible distances.
When the jets point towards 
Earth, these are called blazars.
Within the jets, the plasma 
travels at relativistic speed.
This, combined with the fact
that the beams point towards us,
makes the blazars appear much brighter.
They are very variable as well
and can undergo rapid changes in
brightness in short timescales of
hours to days. These should be 
very common in the early universe.
But astronomers have 
struggled to find these objects,
suggesting that they are not as
common as they thought they were.
In new research published, astronomers
have managed to find a blazar at a very
high redshift, which they think makes
it a whopping 13 billion years old.
This is a mere 800,000 years
after the supposed Big Bang event.
They were able to image the jets that
were moving away from the blazar,
using the VLBA, which is a system of 10 radio
telescopes. This radio image revealed a broken
object, emitting brightly in radio,
stretching out about 1,600 light years.
When they analyzed the data, they
discovered that the plasma was traveling
at 75 percent of the speed 
of light. In the mainstream
model, these powerful jets are
powered by supermassive black holes.
Material is drawn in towards this and forms what
they term as an accretion disk. The exact process
whereby the jets are created,
is still open to debate. But some
speculate that the intense magnetic fields
twist in around the poles, and cause material
that is falling in to be ejected along
these confined magnetic fields.
So, why are these blazars predicted
to be more common than they are?
In the Big Bang model, the early 
universe needs to become ionized.
This is achieved through star
formation and by the jets from these
active galactic nuclei. Early galaxies
would have to create stars at a rapid rate,
in order to achieve this ionization. The
center of these galaxies would also be
growing at an extraordinary rate.
The masses of the detected active
galactic nuclei, at these high
redshifts, would indeed indicate
a fast and efficient growth of these supermassive
black holes. The problem is that this challenges the
standard formation model of supermassive
black holes, and does not seem to be supported
by the lack of these high redshift blazars.
So, how do they explain this then? They
speculate that there could be a mismatch,
meaning that the more distant blazars
have different properties compared to the more
local ones, and this could mean that the jets may be
moving slower. This in turn, may be due to a lower
angular momentum of the gas in the accretion disk,
which in turn, allows the black hole to
grow at a more rapid rate,
leading to more rapid star formation. So,
is there a different way of looking at this?
Once more we must consider the question of distance
and age. We have discussed many times that the
notion that redshift is only related to
recessional velocity, and hence distance,
is wrong. Redshift can be caused by many additional
factors. Halton Arp was an astronomer who spent
many years cataloging quasars and galaxies.
He published many books on his finds and showed
clear evidence of a discrepancy between the
measured distance, using the Tully- Fisher measure,
and the associated redshift of these galaxies.
The Tully-Fisher relationship is a way
of relating luminosity of the galaxy with its
distance. The further away these galaxies were, the
greater the difference between these two
measures became. We also see this appear in the
quantization of this redshift, which has
been interpreted as a great wall of galaxies,
which seem to stretch out in a great big sphere,
away from us. He also drew a clear relationship
between quasars and the host galaxy, and 
showed that the redshift of these ejected objects
appears to reduce as they got 
further from the parent galaxy,
and their brightness increased. This
means that we should be open to the idea
that redshift might indeed tell us something
about the age of the object, but in the
opposite way. The higher the redshift,
the younger the object might be,
or the more electrically active it is.
As the redshift slowly decreases,
so the brightness will increase. The Big Bang
postulates that all matter came into existence
at a specific point and that the universe
itself has expanded from this point onwards.
The Electric Universe model, based on plasma
cosmology, instead holds that there was no Big Bang
and that the universe is not expanding.
The universe is filled with plasma that
has different types of charges and these tend
to separate themselves via double layers,
or conform into large filaments, called Birkeland
currents. These can carry vast amounts of plasma
from one area of high charge, to 
another area with a lower charge.
Along these filaments, a pinching effect
can cause the material to become compressed.
These can form highly energetic plasmoids.
This pinching will cause more material
to be drawn inwards, eventually 
forming what we see as a quasar.
These plasmoids are characteristic
in having a toroidal structure
and having two beams of material
ejected from the center along the axis.
This is confirmed by experiments carried out by Eric
Lerner, and the papers written by him on how his
laboratory experiments could be scaled up,
and may in fact be what mainstream calls
black holes or quasars. In this 
model, these beams would not be
continuous, but would be pulsed. This is 
exactly what we are seeing in these images.
The periodic ejection of blobs from the
quasar are initially in the form of neutrons,
which decay into electrons and protons.
These electrons get slowed more than the
protons in the galactic magnetic field.
This means that the strong non-thermal
emission across the whole spectrum
that they observe for this blazar,
is due to this process. This means the
young quasar is electron-deficient,
so has a low mass and high redshift and
a low brightness due to its diffuseness.
So why do we not see more high redshift blazars,
if they are young newly formed objects? There are a
number of aspects to consider. When 
we see active jets from galaxies,
these tend to be from galaxies with a
lower redshift compared to this blazar.
Halton Arp considered the majority of galaxies
we observe were part of what he termed our local
supercluster, of which the Virgo
cluster was the most distant part.
He thought that there may well be
large areas of void in between these
large clusters, and it may not be possible to
see objects from other parts of the universe.
He also speculated that the intrinsic
redshift would step with distance
and he demonstrated this with our
local group and the Virgo cluster.
So, is it possible that this blazar has a
high redshift compared to local blazars,
because it is not from our supercluster?
The reason these high redshift blazars
may be so rare, is because we can only
just see the edge of the next supercluster.
Another option to consider is that there
may well be a difference between a
quasar that was ejected from an active
galaxy, and one that formed in the pinch of an
intergalactic Birkeland current.
Could it be that one formed in the
latter, would be far more energetic,
and have a much higher redshift,
and also be much rarer? There are many
questions still to be answered and only
by keeping an open mind can we hope to 
start unraveling the mysteries of our universe.

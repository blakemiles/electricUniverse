A new scientific study attempts to
rewrite the conventional story of how
planets formed. A team of scientists,
using images from the Alma and VLA
telescopes, are proposing that planetary
formation is a process that happens
exponentially faster than astronomers
have ever thought possible. Space
scientists have been puzzled by what
appears to be an intractable shortage of
planet-forming dust in the so-called
”mature disks” of stars in the Milky Way
galaxy. As we reported in 2018,
astronomers using Alma attempted to
determine how much material is present
in the disks around stars that are
thought to be only one to three million
years old. When they compared their
estimates to the masses of star systems
that have fully formed planets, they
realized that the so-called “young star”
systems, did not have enough matter in
their discs to eventually form planets.
According to the new paper, scheduled for
publication in Astronomy and
Astrophysics, the answer to this puzzle
is that planet formation is a much more
rapid process than astronomers have ever
believed. The scientists propose that
a sufficient amount of dust to form
planets around a parent star, arises
surprisingly early in a star's life. As
the lead author of the paper stated, "..we 
need to look earlier instead of looking
for missing mass.” The team concludes that
around stars thought to be as young as
100,000 years old, planet formation has
already begun. The co-author of the paper
states, “The implication of this discovery
is profound. For decades, we've thought
that planet formation should happen
during the proto-planetary disk phase, but
by pushing the beginning stage of planet
formation back, we have to rethink what
the birthplace of planets actually
look like.” In recent years, scientific
discovery has forced a similar crisis on
the question of how stars form. Consider
these images of the stellar nursery in the
aptly named Snake nebula, where a number
of stars are forming along the filament
and the stars themselves break up along
the cylinder. This is in stark contrast to
gravitational theory which predicts that
a center of mass exists toward which all
of the surrounding material in a nebular
cloud tends to move, and to
congregate to eventually form a star.
What's more, scientists studying the
Snake nebula, found that the material
needed to be drawn in to form massive
stars, is far less than gravitational
models predict. In 2014, the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
Astrophysics issued a
press release which stated,
”Previous theories proposed that high-
mass stars form within very massive
isolated ‘cores’ weighing at least 100
times the mass of the Sun. These new
results show that that is not the case.
The data also demonstrate that massive
stars aren't born alone but in groups...”
”The team also was surprised to find that
these two nebular patches had fragmen-
ted into individual star seeds so early in
the star formation process. They detec-
ted bipolar outflows and other signs of
active, ongoing star formation.” The
Economist Milton Friedman once said, “The
only relevant test of the validity of a
hypothesis is comparison of prediction
with experience.” The prediction of the
standard solar nebular hypothesis is
that gravitational collapse and
accretion are the processes that lead to
the creation of stars and planets. And
these formative processes occur over
countless eons of time. In con-
trast, the Electric Universe and
plasma cosmology propose that the
electromagnetic phenomenon called the
Z-pinch, also known as the Bennett pinch,
is a dominant organizational phenomenon
in the cosmos. It was the father of
plasma cosmology, Hannes Alfvén, who made
the outrageous prediction that stars
would form by cosmic Z-pinches
along vast networks of filaments, with an
electromagnetic scavenging effect in
molecular clouds in each current
filament. Alfvén wrote of the Bennett or
Z-pinch in 1986, “That parallel currents
attract each other was known already at
the times of Ampere. It's easy to
understand that in a plasma, currents
should have a tendency to collect to
filaments. In 1934, it was explicitly
stated by Bennett that this should lead
to the formation of a pinch.” Alfvén
continues, “The problem which led him to
the discovery was that the magnetic storm
producing medium (the solar wind with
present terminology) was not flowing out
uniformly from the Sun. Hence, it was a
problem in cosmic physics which led to
the introduction of the pinch effect....”
”However, to most astrophysicists it is an
unknown phenomenon. Indeed, important
fields of research, for example, the
treatment of the state in interstellar
regions, including the formation of stars
are still based on a neglect of
Bennett's discovery more than half a
century ago... present-day students in
astrophysics hear nothing about it.” More
than a decade ago, Alfvén’s prediction was
confirmed when the ESA's Herschel Space
Observatory imaged an “incredible
network of filamentary structures seen
in the constellation of the Southern
Cross.” A 2009 ESA report stated, “That a
dark, cool area such as this, would be
bustling with activity was unexpected.
But the images reveal a surprising
amount of turmoil: the interstellar
material is condensing into continuous
and interconnected filaments glowing
from the light emitted by new-born stars
at various stages of development.” The
conventional explanation for these
filaments was the dissipation of some
“large-scale turbulence”, involving
exploding stars and sonic booms. However,
such explosions, which are not evident,
would be expected to impose some radial
curvature on the filaments, which we
simply do not see and the claim that the
filaments are quote
”glowing” from the light emitted by
new-born stars, cannot be
tenable because the filaments
glow steadily along their length,
demonstrating that the light is
intrinsic to the filaments, as one
expects if the light output is provided
by electric current. Moreover in 2011,
even finer images from Herschel provided
the conclusive evidence that cosmic
scale electric currents flow along the
filaments. An ESA report at the time
states, “The filaments are huge,
stretching for tens of light-years
through space and Herschel has shown
that newly born stars are often found in
the densest parts of them... Such filaments
in interstellar clouds have been
glimpsed before by other infrared
satellites, but they have never been seen
clearly enough to have their widths
measured. Now, Herschel has shown that,
regardless of the length or density of a
filament, the width is always roughly the
same.” The lead author of the paper on the
discovery stated, “This is a very big
surprise..” The ESA report concludes, “This
consistency of the widths demands an
explanation.” Any attempt to explain the
filaments constant width by explosions,
is also untenable. Explosions would cause
the filaments to vary markedly in
brightness and width, depending on the
density of the interstellar dust and the
perspective from which they are viewed.
However, physicists and Thunderbolts
chief science adviser Wal Thornhill
wrote of this discovery, “The constant
width over vast distances is due to the
current flowing along the Birkeland
filaments, each filament constituting a
part of a larger electric circuit. And in
a circuit the current must be the same
in the whole filament, although the
current density can vary in the filament
due to the electromagnetic pinch effect.”
The absence of the expected amount of
dust material to form both stars
and planets gravitationally, is not
surprising at all, if such objects are
formed by the electromagnetic Z-pinch.
As Alfvén noted, the electromagnetic force
is exponentially greater than gravity
and is scalable up to the cosmic
magnitude. Wal Thornhill has proposed
that planets also form electro-
magnetically, often along the same
current filaments on which stars
form.And the weird zoo of exo-
planetary systems discovered in recent
decades, including the astonishing
abundance of so called “hot Jupiters,” or
gas giants, orbiting impossibly closely
to their parent stars, has only affirmed
the astounding failure of gravitational
accretion theory to explain science
discovery. Another important aspect of
both star and planet formation, is the
evidence for both such objects forming
in pairs, the result of the electrical
“doubling effect” of twin current
filaments. As Thornhill explained in an
earlier Space News, Birkeland currents are
formed by two parallel current
filaments which attract each other
according to Ampere’s law. As they draw
closer, the magnetic attraction between
them is overcome by electrostatic
repulsion caused by charge separation
within those filaments. As a result,
those filaments circle about each other to
form a twisted pair, a configuration well
known to electrical engineers. And it is
this pairing that tends to concentrate
matter in toroids and closely orbiting
bodies. In this sense, plasma science
explains a mystery that remains
unresolved in standard cosmology. As
Phys.org noted in a 2018 report, “The
origin of binary stars has long been one
of the central problems of astronomy.” The
report noted that protostars and young
stars have been found to be more likely
to form in binary pairs as they are
strung at intervals along the filament
inside a molecular cloud. The report
states of this scientific discovery,
”About half of the binaries are in
elongated core structures, and they
conclude that the initial cores were
also elongated structures...One of their
most significant major conclusions is
that each dusty core of material is
likely to be the birthplace of two stars,
not the single star usually modeled.” And
we now have evidence that a similar
pairing can occur in the formation of
planets. In 2018, the Keck Observatory
published a report titled, “Planets around
other stars are like peas in a pod.” It
states, “...the team found that exoplanets
tend to be the same
sizes as their neighbors.
If one planet is small, the next planet
around that same star is very likely to
be small as well, and
if one planet is big,
the next is likely to be big. They also
found the planets orbiting the same star
tend to have a regular orbital spacing.”
We also note that in 2004, Thornhill and
Dr. C.J. Ransom conducted indepen-
dent plasma experiments on the rapid
electrical formation of stone spherules. As
seen in these remarkable images, Ransom
and Thornhill successfully reproduced
the unique forms of virtually every type
of rocky body we see today. From
the solid spheres we're familiar with
representing a typical planet, to bodies
with complex geological layering, to
spherules with equatorial bands
and equatorial bulges, to dramatic
hemispheric dichotomies. And of course, we
see the fused pair in the spherules, which
is a common bi-lobate form we
see among comets and asteroids.
So, if prediction is the only meaningful
test of the validity of a hypothesis, the
question must be asked, why are space
scientists today still not even
entertaining the concepts of the
Electric Universe and plasma cosmology?
Consider institutionalized science’s
response to the work of Hannes Alfvén
which is described by history of science
scholar Stephen G. Brush as follows.“...the
continuing resistance to Alfvén’s work
is based on a widely held opinion that
his predictions are not derived from
a plausible physical theory, that is a
theory that conforms to the dominant
paradigm. If a theory is not acceptable,
it does not gain credit by making
successful predictions. This would imply
that the role of prediction as a means
of evaluating scientific theories, has
been exaggerated.” But one of the primary
missions of this video series has been
to document for posterity the actual
predictive records of the Electric
Universe and plasma cosmology. The only
position we have taken is that the
astounding successes of these
predictions makes them worthy of sober
scientific investigation at the
level of institutionalized science.
Well into the 21st century, this 
invitation for scientific progress
remains unanswered.

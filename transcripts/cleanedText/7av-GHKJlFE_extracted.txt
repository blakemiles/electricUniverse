Human beings around the
world may be witnessing
one of the most significant dramas in the
modern history of the Space Sciences.
The European Space Agency's
Rosetta mission to the comet 67P
has shattered the theoretical
predictions of standard comet theory.
For many decades we were told
that comets are dirty snowballs
which formed billions of years ago, tracing
back to the solar system's origins.
If comets are indeed primordial
aggregates of ices and dust,
then they should have very smooth
nuclei covered with abundant water ice.
Several previously imaged comets had
already falsified this expectation.
Nevertheless, Rosetta scientists
fully expected the nucleus of 67P
to be cold, smooth and
covered with ice.
In November, the team will attempt
to use harpoons and ice screws
to secure a lander on the Comet's
dry, extremely rocky surface.
As millions of observers around the
world can see with their own eyes,
67P provides a stunning refutation
of the standard comet theory.
Not a single trace of water ice has
been observed on the Comet's surface.
Instead, it's burnt
black, as cold terrain
is tortured with numerous cliffs,
pits, craters, rocks and boulders.
It is as far from a dirty
snowball as one can imagine.
For decades, the prediction of the
Electric Universe has been that
comets, asteroids and meteors were excavated
electrically from planetary surfaces.
Consider this side-by-side
comparison of Comet 67P
and the Sawtooth
Mountains in New Mexico.
Let us ask ourselves, which of
the competing comet theories
most closely predicted
the features of 67P.
We asked Wal Thornhill for his
summary of the Rosetta mission to date,
beginning with the most fundamental
flaw in standard comet theory,
the notion that comets
are primordial.
The European Space Agency, ESA, named the
Rosetta mission after the Rosetta Stone,
a key discovery in human history
that allowed us to unlock critical
components of our own history.
ESA chose that name because they
wanted the mission to provide a bridge
to the past of our solar system.
The same way that the original Rosetta Stone
provided a bridge to an ancient culture
that had previously
not been understood.
Now, there's some irony in this because the
ancient Egyptians remain misunderstood
because we project onto them
our unquestioned belief
that their environment looked the
same as our environment does today.
As a result, many mysteries about their
astronomy still beg explanation
but are ignored.
The same is happening with comets where we
have an unquestioned belief about their origin,
which renders researchers
blind to anomalies
that should consign comet theory
to the trash bin of history.
A NASA news report in August titled:
'To Catch a Comet by the Tail'
'Rosetta's historic meet and greet
with Churyumov - Gerasimenko'
highlights the problem
in its introduction,
and I quote:
"Scientifically speaking,
comets are complex remnants
from the very earliest
times in our solar system.
They accreted, or grew, out of the same
spinning gas cloud that gave rise to the Sun."
End of quote.
This statement is
not scientific!
It's merely a, once upon a time long, long
ago and far, far away bedtime story.
No one has observed the stars or
planets forming in such a way.
In fact, the most recent evidence shows
stars forming non-gravitationally
along glowing filaments
in molecular clouds.
And thousands of exoplanetary systems make
our solar system look the odd one out.
We're also told, in this
report, and I quote,
"Because of their stealth and
seeming unpredictability,
comets have traditionally invoked terror,
suspicion and awe in human kind."
End of quote.
What research shows this?
All forensic investigations into
the earliest references to comets
identify the archetypal doomsday
comet with a highly visible planet,
Venus.
Space scientists know nothing about
history and so fail to learn from it.
Stealth and unpredictability are
no answer to our fear of comets.
The possibility that within human memory
the planetary system has been unstable
and nonetheless achieved clockwork
stability within that brief period,
challenges Newtonian dynamics and is
dismissed without a moment's thought.
But the singular defining feature
of a comet is its elliptical orbit.
Its motion toward and
away from the Sun.
It requires an electrical
model of the solar system
to explain a comet's appearance and
non-gravitational orbital changes.
Clearly, a comet nucleus
the size of Venus
would invoke terror, suspicion
and awe in human kind.
But NASA's misinformation
doesn't end there, and I quote,
"Previous comet-centered missions
have revealed just enough to allow us
to unseat prevailing theories, but
not enough to firm up new ones."
End of quote
This is pure spin doctoring.
There has been no change in the
prevailing theory of comets,
just ad-hoc adjustments
to a centuries-old story.
Tradition dies hard!
And as for new theories about
comets, what are they?
But for me, this statement
takes the cake, and I quote,
"In 2005, NASA threw a coffee-table-sized
spacecraft at comet Tempel.
The resulting Deep Impact explosion
was shallower than anticipated,
but nonetheless implied that comets may
be more porous than previously thought
and not armored with an
icy exterior or shell."
End of quote.
So the flash before the main
outburst didn't happen?!?
The ad-hoc explanation at the
time was that the impactor
must have hit a hard shell before
burying itself in softer material,
and causing an unexpectedly
dazzling outburst to follow.
I alone predicted both the initial
flash, the energetic outburst
and a shallow crater due
to hitting solid rock.
"The impact/discharge wil be into rock,
not loosely consolidated ice and dust."
Now NASA scientists tell us
that the crater is shallow
because stuff fell back and
partly filled the crater.
This assumes a
half-witted audience
that thinks of the Earth's
gravity operating on the comet.
But even on earth, how much debris
from a massive ground explosion
falls back into the crater?
If NASA's researchers were asked to give
evidence in court as expert witnesses,
they would be a laughingstock.
Their stories make
no sense whatsoever.
So what of the Rosetta
mission so far?
The Rosetta mission to comet 67P
is providing us with unprecedented
close-up images of a comet's surface,
but the most remarkable thing to see is
the selective blindness of researchers
caused by prior beliefs about
what a comet is supposed to be.
A primordial ball of
dust and ice. And I quote,
"It was so surprising to see
that this is not a smooth,
hummel-shaped body as we've
thought it would be,"
said Holger Sierks, the lead scientists behind
OSIRIS, Rosetta's 4 megapixel camera.
The scientists are still putting together
why the comet might have such an odd shape.
"One possibility is that
67P is actually two comets
that have been fused
together," he says.
"Although it's also possible
the comet was somehow carved,
through impacts or some other unknown
force, into this strange figure."
End of quote.
It seems we're about to have
another concocted explanation
that leaves the scientists
comfortable with the old story
and business as usual...
That there is no surface ice is a
big surprise to the scientists,
many of whom expected to find a
glassy clean surface of crystal ice
to screw the lander
harpoons into.
But they say, the comet still
is icy below the surface.
- We see water coming out. So there
must be a way for the water to escape.
These are statements of faith in
the old dirty snowball model,
not facts as we shall see.
The rubber-duck-shaped comet
is clearly rocky and complex.
It shows stratification,
craters with fluted walls,
areas that seem to have been
formed by a flow of some sort
and peaks aligned like part of
a broken-off mountain range.
In other words, the comet looks more like
a scarred fragment of a planet surface
than a dirty snowball.
And despite the absence of ice, there
are faint jets just over the horizon,
that show the comet seems to be
suffering a form of surface erosion
at the neck of its odd
rubber-duck-shape.
But there are no signs on the
comet neck of neat holes
forming venturis needed to
produce narrow vertical jets
from sublimating
subsurface ices.
This complex scenario follows the tradition
of astrophysicists invoking hidden activity
within stars and planets, to
explain awkward observations.
Many features on the nucleus appear to
be the result of electric spark erosion
which forms scalloped or fluted cliffs
about an edge depression or crater.
This process can be seen clearly
in action on Jupiter's moon Io
but then there's the question of
why the jets seem to be issuing
preferentially from
the neck region.
Spark erosion takes place in the
form of vertical cathode jets
which are initiated where the electric field
is strongest, on sharp points or edges,
and where the surface composition
is most readily ionized.
This suggests that the mineral
composition in the neck of the comet
may be different to that
in the attached lobes.
And such preferential erosion
may be responsible in part
for forming the neck
and rubber-duck shape.
Talking about composition
of the comet.
The Comet's density measured by its gravitational
influence on the Rosetta spacecraft
will give an entirely misleading
idea of the Comet's composition.
The reason is simple,
although inexcusable
in the 21st century.
It's the confusion by physicists
of mass with quantity of matter.
For more than a century scientists
should have known, according to E = mc²,
that the mass of subatomic
particles is an energetic variable
dependent on the local
electrical environment.
That is why the so-called
universal constant of gravitation
is so maddeningly inconstant.
The comet's environment
is quite unearthly.
As a result, I confidently predict
that the chemical and physical makeup
of the comet will
confound researchers.
The nucleus looks like solid
rock because it is solid rock!
The failure to observe a single trace of
water ice on the surface of Comet 67P
has not deterred investigators
from the assumption
that substantial water ice
must still be present,
but is hidden from view
under the comet's surface.
Proponents of the standard theory point to
evidence of water detected in cometary comas
as proof that comets
are indeed icy bodies,
slowly sublimating
from solar heating.
However, what is spectroscopic analysis
really telling us about comets?
A clue to this question may be
provided by recent scientific papers.
In a 1998 paper on the formation of
Mercury's ice deposits, the authors write:
"Oxygen-containing surface
rocks could release water
through sputtering by protons
from the solar wind."
On October 7th of this year,
phys.org featured the headline,
'Study shows most water in lunar
soil generated by solar wind'.
The article states,
"A pair of researchers... has determined
that most of the water in the soil
on the surface of the moon
was formed due to protons
in the solar wind colliding
with oxygen in lunar dust...".
Institutional science has never
explored electrochemical processes
creating the signal of
water in cometary comas.
Indeed as Wal Thornhill tells us, the
science of electro-chemistry may reveal
that spectroscopic instruments
are not detecting water at all.
So what about the measurements
that are interpreted
as several liters of water issuing
from the comet per second?
The cathode jets strip and ionize atoms
of oxygen from minerals on the comet
and accelerate the negative
ions away in a fine jet.
The oxygen ions then combine with
the protons in the solar wind
to form the hydroxyl radical OH, which
is mistakenly assumed to be evidence
of an ultraviolet breakdown product
of water molecules from the comet.
Oxygen and hydrogen have both
been found in the comet's coma
by the Rosetta ultraviolet
spectrometer.
It should be noted that the earlier
Stardust mission supported this
by finding surprising high
temperature minerals in comet dust.
This fits the picture of comets as
highly modified planetary debris
rather than being primordial.
There is no need to invent ever
more special conditions and add-ons
to the age-old solar nebula
story of solar system formation.
That story has been discredited both
theoretically and with each new discovery
about comets, asteroids and weird
extrasolar planetary systems.
One planetary scientist
admitted that he needs
a separate theory for each
planet in our own solar system.
The double-lobed
form of Comet 67P
is considered one of its most
extraordinary and baffling features.
Indeed, this basic form has
been seen on several comets,
including comets Halley, Borelli and Hartley
and additionally numerous asteroids.
As described in several
previous videos,
this form is no surprise to
proponents of the Electric Universe.
Several years ago, plasma scientist C. J. Ransom
replicated this form in the laboratory
with a high-energy electrical
discharge to a mineral surface.
Scientists have proposed that
a low-velocity collision
between two comets
occurred in the past,
then mysteriously melded together
to create 67P's double-lobed body.
But as Wal Thornhill
explains, this ad-hoc theory
stretches credulity beyond any
reasonable breaking point.
According to the old
solar nebula theory,
comets are far-flung leftovers from
the birth of the solar system.
They are supposed to have formed by
accretion in a hypothetical Oort Cloud
but this imaginary Oort Cloud is
unlike any cloud we are familiar with.
The cloud is about 1,000 times
further out than the orbit of Pluto
and the mean distance between comets
is about 1 billion kilometers,
so collision and accretion
have negligible probability.
Yet we look at Comet 67P
and its surface cratering
would appear to require
countless impacts.
What's more, its shape is entirely
unaccountable by accretion.
The impact of two largest chunks
would rather disintegrate them
instead of somehow welding them
together to form a rubber duck.
The problem for planetary scientists is that
their expert advice from astrophysicist
is based on another old and
flawed story about star formation
that has also been discredited
by recent observations.
Stars form deep inside
molecular clouds,
like beads strung along
glowing cosmic strings.
The cosmic strings are the galactic equivalent
of earthly cloud-to-cloud lightning.
The powerful
electromagnetic pinch
acts to compress and heat matter
along the lightning channel.
The result on Earth is
merely a thunderclap
but you can't hear a thunderclap in
space. Instead, we see a string of stars.
Of course, smaller bodies
will form planets
which, when the lightning has subsided,
form gravitational partnerships.
This simply explains the
weird exoplanetary systems
with hot Jupiters swinging around
their star in hours or days,
and planets with backward orbits
and orbits over the stars' poles.
As Hannes Alfvén, the father of
modern plasma physics, remarked,
"Gravitational systems are the ashes
of prior electrical systems."
The old nebula accretion theory of planet
formation is long dead and must be buried.
As for Comet 67P,
arc welders know that an
electric arc can transfer matter
against the ultra-weak
force of gravity.
So if the Philae
landing is successful,
it will be important to examine the
mineral composition of the comet
and compare it with
Martian meteorites,
since Mars bears colossal
recent electrical scars.
Even with Rosetta information,
we will not understand
the Egyptians and their pantheon
of weird celestial gods,
much less what comets are,
until we leave our comforting
bedtime stories behind.
Newton's law of gravity
does not guarantee
a peaceful clockwork solar
system lasting for eons.
Astronomers know, but can't
accept the unsettling idea,
that Newton's solar system is
chaotic on a very short timescale.
The reason is simply that gravity
alone provides no restoring force
when one planet
disturbs another.
Astronomers also know
little about history.
Clearly, they are missing
something very important.
And ironically, the answer has
been hidden in plain view
of those who study the
oldest human histories
which tell of planetary wars
involving Thunderbolts of the Gods.
That these ancient stories did
not relate to everyday lightning,
is shown by the many images
of those Thunderbolts.
The implications for the recent history
of the planets are paradigm shattering.
It seems that charge exchange plays a
significant role in stabilizing orbits.
And in close encounters, the effect is
to electrically gouge surface material
from one planet and
transfer it to the other.
In the process, a great deal
of debris is lost to space
where it becomes asteroids,
comets and meteoroids.
Our special thanks to Ignacio Cisneros for his
analysis and pointers on several Rosetta images.

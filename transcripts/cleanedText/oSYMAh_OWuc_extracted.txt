You've just entered the
theater of an alien sky.
If the words and images seem strange
to you, there's a reason for this.
Our world was once a
vastly different place.
To experience this won't hurt
you, and there is nothing to fear.
The Labyrinth and
the Gordian Knot
In our previous Discourse, we
introduced the story of the labyrinth,
a story with many links to the wide-ranging
archetypes we've previously explored;
mother goddess, warrior
hero, and chaos monster,
all with a displaced sovereign power
looming as a shadow in the background.
A fascinating counterpart to the
labyrinth is a fabled Gordian knot.
That tradition was localized in the
ancient Phrygian capital of Gordium,
in modern-day Turkey.
There it was said that a far-famed
knot had once yoked a notorious wagon
owned by Gordias, the
mythic father of King Midas.
As the story goes, the complex
knot was impossible to untie.
But in 333 BC, when the warrior king Alexander
the Great led his army into Gordium,
he encountered the old Wagon
said to be held in place quoting here
'by several knots all so tightly entangled
that it was impossible to
see how they were fastened.'
Hanging over this incident was
an ancient oracle declaring
that the man who could
untie the complex knot
was destined to rule all of Asia.
But frustrated in his
attempts, Alexander announced
it makes no difference
how they are loosed.
He then stood back and sliced the knot in
half with a single stroke of his sword.
As an echo of this story,
the phrase 'cutting the Gordian
knot' entered the popular lexicon
as a shorthand solution
to a complex problem.
Historians also cite an
alternative version of the story
in which Alexander simply
removed a linchpin to loosen the knot.
Tellingly, in this interpretation
the event was said
to have been accompanied
by thunder and lightning.
Having pleased the gods, Alexander
went on to conquer Egypt and much of Asia.
It should go without saying that in
the absence of a concrete referent,
such storytelling will appear to
have no believable interpretation.
But if we tentatively grant the presence
of a natural provocation in the ancient sky,
the story elements
will be expected,
even when a self-serving local
variant fails to convince us.
Fortress of Intestines
According to the Babylonians, amongst
the oldest storytellers in the world,
a great giant named Humbaba
was the guardian of a towering edifice
called the Fortress of Intestines.
Well, the idea that a great fortress
would be composed of intestines
couldn't be more ridiculous.
But only ridiculous, until one grants a
concrete visual form in the heavens
to prompt the mythical language.
In fact, more than one author has
proposed the mythical fortress of Humbaba
was a prototype of
the labyrinth theme.
But it seems that other crucial
associations are too easily overlooked.
A swastika at the center of
the labyrinth for example,
occurs not just in Cretan,
in Attic, and in Roman art,
but even in the Americas
amongst the Hopi Indians.
Well, that's not a small matter.
In fact, it's precisely this whirling
aspect of the equal length cross
that substantiates the
electric discharge activity
from which the
labyrinthal form arose.
One scholar who did not overlook the
connection of the swastika to the labyrinth
was the distinguished
authority A. B. Cook,
author of the massive three
volume scholarly work 'Zeus'.
From his extensive study of the
labyrinth theme, Cook concluded,
"it seemed certain that both Attic and
Cretan art presupposed the swastika
as the earliest ascertainable
form of the labyrinth."
Cook's observation is critical though he clearly
did not know that the identical linkage
appears even in North America.
Such connections
invariably bring us back
to the archetypal substructure
of mythological expression.
Our own research suggests that the
global reach of the labyrinth theme
could never be explained without
simultaneously illuminating
the cross or swastika placed
strategically at its center
in opposite regions of the world.
One theme leads
inexorably to another.
Labyrinth, intestines, goddess,
warrior, and central swastika.
As a matter of fact, the swastika is
broadly connected to the whirling dance
of the archetypal goddess
and prototypical warrior hero,
when the world
slipped into chaos.
How this broader archetypal
context arose historically
is a mystery the experts
haven't even begun to explore.
It's known that one of the more common
dance patterns in ancient times
was not just a
whirling performance,
but more specifically, a dance
along a path marked out by a labyrinth.
That's why in classical times the
word labyrinth often meant dance.
A. B. Cook for example
relates the labyrinth simultaneously to a
symbolic imitation of the Sun's movements
and the patterns of
imitative spiraling dance.
If that conclusion is correct, it's no surprise
that archaic labyrinth and dance patterns
echoed into more modern times
as the Troy dance and
similar children's games.
Not to be overlooked is the fact
that the dance of the hero Theseus
was also in conjunction
with the goddess Ariadne.
And that is why, as noted by Cook, the
labyrinth and dance was indeed archetypal.
In fact, said to be the first occasion
on which men and women danced together.
Here, as it is so often the case,
we see the tell-tale signature
of the celebrated first form
to which all imitative or sacred practices
in the ancient world direct our attention.
Over the years, in exploring
ancient Egyptian symbols,
we found innumerable counterparts
to the global archetypes
and the dancing
warrior is no exception.
One of the key Egyptian images
is that of the red Ab-Heart of Ra
called the Heart of Carnelian.
Egyptian texts identified the Ab-Heart
and such warrior heroes as Shu,
or Anhur, or Horus.
All identified as the planet
Mars in our reconstruction.
Egyptian symbolism presents this innermost
masculine heart as the Ab and Hati,
the heart of the warrior within the
enclosing feminine turquoise Hati heart
meaning the eye, heart, and soul,
of the primeval Sun God Ra.
In other words, there is no surprise in the
hieroglyphic image showing the Ab-Heart
as a male figure in a dancing posture virtually
identical to that of the Hindu Shiva
who similarly stands in conjunction
with the Hindu mother goddess.
But few, indeed, have noticed that
the swastika itself symbolized
the whirling, dancing, masculine,
reddish part of the ancient Sun God
whom the world's first astronomers of ancient
Mesopotamia named as the planet Saturn.
And until the underlying
equations are recognized,
such obvious clues
as the swastika,
the very swastika displayed as
the heart of the Greek Apollo,
will mean virtually
nothing to us.
Of course, none of the connected
themes has anything to do
with the movement of
the Sun in today's sky.
In fact, the relationship of the
swastika to the warrior hero
will virtually always go
unnoticed by the specialists.
And the closer we look, the more extraordinary
the confirmed traditions become.

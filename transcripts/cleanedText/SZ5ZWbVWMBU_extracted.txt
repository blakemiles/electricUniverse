The following presentation is an adaptation
of the Picture of the Day article
'What is light?' by
author Mel Acheson.

in the description box of this video.
When you're in a boat, you see waves
of water lap against the hull.
If you could tie a flag
to a molecule of water,
you could see that
molecule move up and down.
When you're at a concert, you hear
waves of sound press against your ear.
If you could tie a flag
to a molecule of air,
you could see that molecule
move back and forth.
When you tune your radio
to your favorite station,
you set its sensory organ-the
antenna and tuning circuit-
to respond to waves of
electromagnetic potential.
The water or air molecule moves.
You can measure its spatial
displacement as it varies with time,
and you can plot those
measurements on a graph
with displacement along one
axis and time along the other.
The result is a sinusoidal curve that
resembles the form of the water's surface
which we call a wave.
Hence we speak of water waves,
usually without distinguishing the
"real" surface feature(s) from the
metaphorical mathematical form.
And we speak of sound waves
usually without being aware that the term
is, in this instance, entirely metaphorical.
We have developed mathematical
manipulations that enable us,
on the basis of
metaphorical resemblances,
to predict and to utilize
various attributes
of periodically moving
water and air molecules.
The wave theory of water and
the wave theory of sound
have been wondrously
productive cognitive tools.
So, too, we speak of
electromagnetic waves.
And we have developed
mathematical manipulations
that have been
wondrously productive.
We measure voltages or currents;
we graph their
variation with time;
and the graphs have
the form of a wave.
But what moves?
The variation is a changing
potential, not a changing location.
I could plot the changes in my thinking
against time and produce a wave of opinion.
Would Quantum
Mechanics then apply?
Opinions do become entangled
and they frequently collapse,
but this is hardly what Dr. Schrödinger
had in mind with his wave equation.
He was thinking of something
"material" that moved.
The assumption that light is something
that moves from one place to another
goes beyond even the
analogy with water:
In water and sound waves, the particles
only move back and forth in place.
The water molecule doesn't move
from the boat to the beach;
the air molecule doesn't move
from the horn to your ear.
The apparent movement "from-to"
is a sequential periodicity in the
oscillations of the molecules.
The idea that light is something that
moves from one location to another
gives rise to the further
ideas of a "ray" of light
and, if interrupted into
segments, a "bullet of light."
The shortest segment imaginable we
imagine to be a tiny particle, a photon,
shot out of an emitting atom traveling
to another atom, and being absorbed.
The analogous image with water or
sound is not associated with waves
but with such things as fire hoses and
jet engines-"streams" of water or air.
The question of what, if anything,
moves with light is an open one.
This question goes back 300 years.
And-surprise!-it was never settled.
It was decided but not settled.
A Danish astronomer, Olaus Roemer,
measured variations in the times of
occultation of Jupiter's innermost moon, Io,
when the Earth was at
opposite points in its orbit.
He attributed the differences
to the travel time
of something that moved
from Io to the Earth,
i.e., to the speed of light.
The director of the Royal Observatory
in Paris, Gian Domenico Cassini,
the first of four generations
of Royal astronomers, disagreed.
He thought light might instead be
a cumulative response of the eye,
perhaps to variations
in some force
acting instantaneously at a
distance like Newton's gravity.
He noted that Roemer's measurements were
dependent on a great many variables-
different velocities
of Earth and Io,
different angles of view,
different intensities of light,
different observing
conditions, etc. --
any one of which, or some
combination of which,
could account for the variations
in his (Roemer's) observations.
Cassini also took
measurements, not only of Io
but of the other Galilean
satellites of Jupiter.
And the other satellites did not
show the same variations as Io.
Edmund Halley, of
Halley's Comet fame,
who had helped publish and
promote Newton's Principia,
became enamored with Roemer's idea
(that light was something that moved)
and promoted it in the
scientific press of the time.
Roemer and Cassini died.
Halley carried the torch, and
Roemer's idea caught on.
The mob of scientists rushed
down Something That Moves Street
and vacated Cumulative
Response Street.
No one even thought to look for
other streets of explanation
in the Village of
Electromagnetism.
Even Cassini's son, who succeeded
him at the Royal Observatory,
abandoned his objections.
As I said, the issue was
decided-by mob rule
but not settled.
What really is the case?
Light might be something that
moves-but what else could it be?
That light is something
that moves is plausible.
That assumption explains many
observations-though not all.
But plausibility is
not reliability:
Unless a systematic effort is made
to seek out what else light might be
and to devise tests that will distinguish
among the various possibilities,
no one will ever know if
"something moving" is the truth
or merely a plausible
artifact of selected data.
Roemer simply reversed
the older intuitive idea
that understood seeing
as analogous to touching:
something-an "ocular ray"-reaches out like
a finger and touches/sees the object seen.
Roemer assumed rays come not
from the eye but to the eye,
and that too is intuitive.
But as more observations accumulated,
things got more complicated.
Today, Quantum Mechanics has had to
abandon intuitiveness altogether
and embrace "Quantum weirdness".
Its justification is
that it gets results:
The math goes from an empirical
start to an empirical finish.
It's predictive to a very, very,
very great degree of accuracy.
However, accurate prediction is a
sign of a theory's usefulness,
not its truthfulness.
The theory could be
merely instrumental
but instrumentalism is not as
satisfying as the conviction
that one possesses The
Truth in capital letters.
Light must be something
that travels,
who could doubt that?
The mob must have gone down
the Street of Truth after all.
What else could
light be!
That exclamation point begs a question
that should be taken seriously.
It's a question that lies at
the heart of reliability.
It lies at the heart of
scientific discovery.
What else, indeed, could light be?
The math (of Quantum
Mechanics) goes from 1,
which we observe, to 4,
which we also observe:
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4
But there's no guarantee
reality goes that way:
Maybe the real
path is 1 + 3 = 4.
Quantum weirdness may only be
ambiguity in our categories
(of waves/particles that
move) rather than in light.
What if light is a
"cumulative response"?
No one has bothered to develop a
mathematical theory for that ... yet.
What if light is something else?
No one has bothered to peer
down the cognitive alleyways
for a third or
fourth possibility:
Consider that plasma
discharge phenomena
are scalable over at least
14 orders of magnitude,
from the scale of galaxies
to the scale of atoms.
Why stop with "fundamental"
subatomic particles?
What if the "zoo" of subatomic particles is
merely a spritz of tiny electrical sparks-
plasmoids-observed at different
stages of their evolution
or under different
discharge conditions?
(Imagine a subatomic-
sized Herbig-Haro star
or active Seyfert galaxy-
the "doughnut on a stick" form typical of
so many plasma discharge phenomena.)
What if reality consists of larger
sparks driving smaller sparks
all the way down the scales,
and there is no such thing as
a "particle" or a "wave"?
With electromagnetism, the electric and
magnetic fields vary in strength and polarity.
It's not immediately obvious
that anything moves-
except scientists'
opinions about it.
And they move more like a mob:
Fervency of belief so easily
obscures enlightenment.
It's been 300 years, and the
question is still open.
What moves?

Welcome to Space News from
the Electric Universe,
brought to you by The
Thunderbolts Project™
at Thunderbolts.info
In the first five
installments of this series,
we outlined some of the
most compelling evidence
that the role of electromagnetism throughout
the cosmos is vastly more significant
than modern space science
has ever entertained.
So far, we have explored this question
through an examination of the highest-
energy electromagnetic phenomena at the
vastest scales throughout the cosmos.
We now move our attention to
our own celestial neighborhood
and the dynamic interactions
between the Sun
and all of the bodies which move
within its electrical domain.
Today we'll explore why
planetary electrical discharges
are the 6th of 10 reasons why
the Universe is electric.
Charged Planets in the
Inner Solar System
At no time in history have human
beings been more dependent
on electricity for everyday
functioning and survival.
On Earth, electricity's
significance both for society
and in nature, seems
self-evident.
Yet in the Space Sciences many
strange and outdated notions
about Earth's atmospheric and
weather phenomena endure,
despite an ever growing
wealth of scientific data.
It was in the early 20th century that the
Norwegian experimentalist Kristian Birkeland
correctly hypothesized that electric currents
from the Sun power the Earth's auroras.
For many decades, the scientific
mainstream largely rejected the thesis
favoring instead the idea that Earth's
magnetosphere is an impenetrable envelope
"squeezed" by the solar wind
to induce auroral activity.
Only when satellites detected
the magnetic signatures
of electric currents
in the aurora in 1973,
was Birkeland's hypothesis
irrefutably validated
though even today many scientists still
resist the implications of the discovery.
In testing his ideas about
the Earth-Sun connection,
Birkeland built a vacuum chamber
and placed a magnetized metal ball
called a terrella inside
it, representing the Earth.
He observed how the terrella behaved in its
artificial electrically charged atmosphere.
In addition to solving the
riddle of Earth's auroras,
Birkeland's electrical experiments also
uncannily simulated planetary rings
and the energetic displays
of cometary jets.
More than a century after Birkeland's polar
expedition to investigate the Northern Lights,
mainstream scientists still express
surprise or even astonishment
when they observe the tell-tale
signs of electrical circuitry
connecting the
Earth and the Sun.
Of course, the Earth is the most
well-studied celestial object
and much has been learned about
its electrical environment.
The Space Age has brought a
much greater understanding of
the Earth's upper
atmosphere and ionosphere
as well as the inner and
outer radiation belts.
With greater technological
data, the challenges for
planetary scientists to explain
discovery have only increased.
Lightning is the most powerful
electrical phenomenon on our world.
In near the end of the 20th
century and continuing today,
terrestrial lightning has held new
surprises for atmospheric scientists.
As far back as the 1960's, some airline
pilots reported their observations
of powerful electrical discharges that
appeared to originate above thunder clouds,
reaching towards space.
It wasn't until the early
1990's that scientists
were able to verify the
phenomenon definitely exists
including blue jets, seen
exploding from thunder clouds,
and enormous red sprites, even
higher in the upper atmosphere.
Scientists today acknowledge that
the phenomenon remains mysterious
but amazingly, above-clouds-lightning was
in fact predicted nearly a century ago.
In the 1920's, the Scottish
physicist C.T.R. Wilson
predicted the existence of brief flashes
of light above large thunderstorms.
On the cause of the phenomena, an
important clue was uncovered in 2001.
A physicist named
Professor Edgar Bering
flew a high-altitude balloon
above a thunderstorm.
He made the unexpected discovery
that when lightning strikes occur
above and below the clouds, the
electrical charge was already present
and did not take time to build
up between lightning strikes.
This contradicts the
standard notion
that lightning is a generator
of the clear-air electric field
measured at about 100 V/m between
the Earth and the clear sky.
Bering wrote on his findings
that sprites and jets
"...may be an essential element of the
Earth's global electrical circuit."
However, physicist Wal Thornhill notes of the
standard scientific literature on our planet's
'Global Electrical Circuit',
"As big as the term 'global' sounds,
the circuit is too restricted.
It is a circuit that assumes
heat-driven convection in clouds
is the global
electricity generator.
This generator mysteriously separates
electric charge in storm clouds
to power world-wide currents.
However, the circuit
is 'unplugged'.
It is isolated from electrical connection
with anything else in the universe.
Such a lack of a holistic
or cosmic-scale vision
is a fundamental
constraint on theorists."
In the Electric Universe, the ultimate circuitry
driving atmospheric and weather phenomena
is the electric current system
connecting planets and the Sun.
In recent years, it has become
increasingly evident that the Sun
affects our own planet's
atmosphere and weather
in ways that standard
theorists had never imagined.
In 2014, we reported on the discovery
that charged particles from the Sun
appear linked to increased
lightning on Earth.
According to an article on the Institute
of Physics website, a team of scientists,
"...found a substantial and significant
increase in lightning rates across Europe
for up to 40 days after the arrival
of high-speed solar winds."
And indeed, the ramifications
of the confirmation
of Kristian Birkeland's
thesis on the Earth's auroras
become more and more evident
with each new discovery.
Earlier this year, the ESA Swarm mission
reported the groundbreaking discovery of
"supersonic plasma jets" high
up in Earth's atmosphere
which can push temperatures
up to 10,000ºC.
A phys.org report on
the discovery stated,
"The theory that there are huge
electric currents, powered by solar wind
and guided through the ionosphere
by Earth's magnetic field,
was postulated more than a century ago by
Norwegian scientist Kristian Birkeland...
While much is known about these
current systems, recent observations
have revealed that they are associated
with large electrical fields."
The existence of Birkeland currents in space
is now confirmed by scientific discovery.
But of course, many differences
remain between the standard
interpretation and predictions and
those of the Electric Universe.
The notion that celestial objects
cannot have an excess of charge
is a guiding principle
of astronomy.
Yet as Thunderbolts' colleague, Dr. Michael
Clarage, explained in his 2014 presentation
'Earth's Electric Environment',
"Overall charge neutrality
is not really the point.
A battery that you hold in your
hand has no overall charge on it.
But the point is that we've separated
the charge in it so it can do work."
And as we will see as we continue, charge
exchange between celestial bodies
seen most dramatically between the
Sun and the planets in its domain,
is the most promising explanation for
many spectacular atmospheric phenomena
that remain unexplained
in standard astronomy.
As we turn our attention
to our planetary neighbors,
we see the need for a new understanding of
all forms of lightning on our own world.
When the, then Soviet
Union's, Venera probes
touched down on the planet Venus
more than half a century ago,
they recorded surprising
evidence of lightning
that was much more frequent and
powerful than earthly lightning.
Yet Venus has no water
clouds which means that
the electrical discharges traversed
directly from the ionosphere to the ground.
In a scientific paper on
the Venera discoveries,
planetary scientist professor
Donald Hunten wrote:
"The indications are that
lightning is likely to occur
in any substantial
planetary atmosphere.
Theories of electrification are faced
with the need to explain its presence
under a wide variety of circumstances
and atmospheric conditions."
The so-called "strange magnetic ropes"
detected in Venus's atmosphere
are evidence of its electrical
connection to the Sun
which is more direct
than the Earth's.
The mysterious ropes' twisted
filamentary structure
reveals the electric currents required
to sustain the detected magnetism.
Incoming electrical currents
open the doorway to explain
many mysterious atmospheric and
weather phenomena on Venus.
In 2006, the ESA's Venus Express satellite
recorded the astonishing images
of a twin cyclone above
Venus's south pole.
For reasons that still
elude planetary scientists,
the cyclone structure
constantly evolves
and it appears to be a permanent
fixture at the South Pole.
However, we see not the first
instance when science discovery
has confirmed a seemingly preposterous
prediction of the Electric Universe theory.
In 2005, when scientists
using the Keck Observatory
discovered a warm vortex at
the South Pole of Saturn,
Thornhill made a prediction that
could only seem preposterous
from a conventional viewpoint.
He wrote:
"The Electric Universe
predicts, experimentum crucis,
that BOTH poles should be hot,
not one hot and the other cold."
In 2008, NASA's Cassini scientists
were astonished to discover
a mysterious hot spot
at Saturn's north pole.
This was astonishing
because the freezing pole
had been deprived of
sunlight for over 12 years.
On Venus, twin tornadoes have
been observed at both poles.
This is important, because the Electric Universe
states that the Sun's electrical input
generally occurs at
the poles of planets
which we usually see in
the form of auroras.
As we see, the constantly shifting
structure of the south polar vortex
seems strikingly reminiscent
of the spiral galaxies' forms
reproduced by plasma scientist Dr.
Anthony Peratt's simulations
of two current filaments
interacting in a plasma.
In the Electric Universe, the
incoming electrical currents
are also the driver of Venus's
mysterious superfast winds
which are difficult for conventional
meteorology to explain.
Cloud movement show a four-day rotation
period of the upper atmosphere at the equator
which declines to two
days toward the poles.
Within the framework
of standard theory,
no force is present to drive the upper
winds around the planet at such a speed
since Venus itself has a rotational
period of 243 days retrograde
and the planet's lower winds
are exceptionally sluggish.
Since the planet is the
same temperature overall,
there is no temperature gradient
to drive these winds either.
In recent years, it was reported
that the superfast winds of Venus
have actually been steadily
accelerating for a decade.
This is explained through analogy
to the simplest electrical motor
called a Faraday disk motor.
The Faraday disk motor requires only a
magnetic field and a disk conductor
or something symmetrical.
When a current is directed inward to the
poles of the object and out at the equator,
it will cause the
object to rotate.
We note that while the Venusian
winds were found to be accelerating,
scientists found that the planet's
rotation was mysteriously slowing down.
In the Electric Universe theory
as developed by Wal Thornhill,
the deposition or extraction of charge
from an object will change its mass,
and therefore its rotation rate
which has been observed on Earth in
small changes of the Earth's rotation
called glitches,
when we receive a large blast of
charged particles from the Sun.
On Venus, both the accelerating winds
and the planet's slowing rotation
could be due to a variation in the
incoming electrical current flow.
As we turn our attention to Mars,
mysterious wind and atmospheric phenomena
again point to the planet's dynamic interactions
with its electrical space environment.
Mars has an atmosphere only around
0.5% as dense as Earth's
so it has been a puzzle for
decades why powerful dust storms
sometimes encompass
the entire planet.
How is the dust removed from the soil
and accelerated into massive clouds,
sometimes up to hundreds of miles per hour in
the near vacuum of the Martian atmosphere?
Adding to the mystery, when the most dramatic
dust-storm ever seen on the planet occurred,
it involved packed
congregations of dust devils,
a completely unexpected feature
in standard meteorology.
In conventional theory,
an atmospheric vortex
requires a vastly larger
circulation of wind
than what is clearly seen in edge-on
pictures of storm fronts on Mars.
Electrically speaking, what produces
a global Martian dust storm
and other tremendous dust-raising
events on the Red Planet?
To begin to get an idea, let
us consider the dust devils
seen in association
with the global storms.
The so-called dust devils on Mars
are so enormous and energetic,
they routinely dwarf
Earthly tornadoes.
A NASA press release describes a
typical Martian dust devil as a,
"...monster column towering kilometers
high and hundreds of meters wide,
10 times larger than
any tornado on Earth."
The reason meteorologists call them
"dust devils" instead of tornadoes,
is because they are not associated
with water-laden storm clouds
which don't exist on Mars.
The powerful electric fields associated
with dust devils, both on Mars and on Earth,
are now acknowledged in
scientific literature.
But meteorologists can only
look to solar heating,
air convection and dust particle
friction as their cause.
The electrical nature of the
tornadic dust fountains on Mars
may be better understood through
an examination of their cousins,
water spouts.
A great breakthrough in
understanding water spouts
came from the work of Russian plasma
physicist V.A. Rantsev-Kartinov.
From his investigation, he
concluded that these phenomena
are the result of a
long-lasting discharge current
between the plasma networks
of a water surface
and the electrical charge
of the clouds above.
Both the rotation and the narrow coherent
and undulating funnels of water spouts
are thus explained in terms
of plasma discharge behavior.
All of this relates to the unfounded
assumption of planetary scientists
that mechanical processes must separate
charge wherever they see electrical activity.
The Electric Universe's counter
viewpoint on Martian wind and weather
is summarized in a 2005 Thunderbolts
Picture Of the Day article.
It states:
"Since Mars has no thunderstorms
to 'charge-up its ionosphere',
it should present a good case
study of the Electric Universe.
The electrical model predicts that the
Martian ionosphere is indeed charged,
and it posits no isolated
dynamo to 'separate charge'.
On Mars, electrical effects will reach
directly from the ionosphere to the surface
without the ameliorating leakage via
storm clouds that we see on Earth.
Unlike radiant
energy from the Sun,
electrical energy can accumulate in the
'planetary capacitor' for some time,
with a potential for planet-altering events
when the atmosphere finally 'breaks down'
and massive discharge
activity is initiated."
The Thunderbolts article also
offered the following prediction:
"The intensity and number of
dust devils will be affected
by solar outbursts and the
planet's elliptical orbit."
In fact, in recent years the
electrical interpretation
of dramatic Martian dust-raising
events has been stunningly confirmed.
In 2012, amateur astronomers first
spotted seemingly inexplicable plumes
rising hundreds of kilometers
above the surface of Mars.
In 2016, scientists using
the Mars Express spacecraft
discovered something completely
unexpected to planetary scientists.
A coronal mass-ejection hit Mars immediately
before the plume was first spotted.
The leader of a team of
scientists said of the discovery,
"It's very surprising
that was affecting Mars
right before the plume
was first observed."
And of course, the electrical nature
of the event seems undeniable.
The 2016 New Scientist
report states:
"One possibility is that plasma could
be interacting with ice grains or dust
lower down in the atmosphere and electrically
charging them, boosting them higher,
but it's not clear how the
effect would be big."
An analogue to the Martian
dust raising events
might be the electrostatic dust storms
that are now known to occur on the Moon
when it encounters the Earth's
magnetotail once a month.
We also note that when the largest
global dust storm on Mars began in 2001,
Mars had reached opposition
and was the closest that had
been to Earth in about 12 years.
As noted at the
beginning of this video,
planetary scientists are
only now recognizing
the pervasive electric current
systems on our own planet
which were postulated more than a
century ago by Kristian Birkeland.
Of course on Mars,
far less is known
but NASA's MAVEN mission has provided
important new data and insights.
One of many surprising findings was characterized
as follows in a 2015 NASA press release:
"NASA's... (MAVEN)
spacecraft has observed
two unexpected phenomena
in the Martian atmosphere:
an unexplained high-altitude
dust cloud and aurora
that reaches deep into the
Martian atmosphere...
The presence of the dust
at orbital altitudes
from about 93 miles to 190 miles above
the surface was not predicted."
As mission scientist
Laila Anderson stated,
"If the dust originates
from the atmosphere,
this suggests we are missing some fundamental
process in the Martian atmosphere."
Also surprising to MAVEN
scientists was the discovery
of a highly energetic
glowing aurora
that reaches shockingly deep
into the Martian atmosphere.
As one team member stated,
"What's especially surprising
about the aurora we saw
is how deep in the
atmosphere it occurs
-- much deeper than at Earth
or elsewhere on Mars.
The electrons producing
it must be energetic."
As the NASA press
release explains,
"MAVEN's Solar Energetic
Particle instrument
detected a huge surge in energetic
electrons at the onset of the aurora."
Today, within the Electric
Universe community,
experimental research such as that
which Birkeland pioneered, continues.
Through simple experiments with electric
fields, we see the routine replication
of many atmospheric, weather
and geological phenomena.
These experimental analogs place the
endless surprising space discoveries
in an entirely new light
and emphasize the desperate need for a
new perspective in planetary science.
One which recognizes charge
exchange between celestial bodies.
In our next installment of this
series, we will turn our attention
to the gas giants in
the outer solar system
whose dynamic
electrical environments
offer further testimony that
the Universe is electric.

A new investigation into the wind
patterns in Earth's upper atmosphere may
provide critical insight into our
planet's electrical environment, and its
relationship to the Sun.
In countless past episodes,
retired professor of
electrical engineering Dr. Donald Scott
has outlined his mathematical modeling
of a Birkeland current structure, and its
visual identification as counterrotating cylinders.
Recently, Dr. Scott invited
members of the Electric Universe
community to begin tracking our planet's
wind patterns, which can be viewed in
real-time through the website
seen on your screen.
In his own investigation, Dr. Scott
has made what may be an important
discovery -- an apparent periodicity to the counter
-rotational patterns seen at our planet's poles.
In this episode, Dr. Scott
explains the potential significance of
this discovery for the Electric Universe
model of the Sun, and its connection to Earth.
Back on May 10th of this year, I did a
Space News and there was a sort of
put my toe into this area of
earth.nullschool.net site, and
the major point, I think that I was
trying to make there is, that it seems to
me that if you can, as you can
with nullschool, look at various
levels, you know, in the various altitudes
in the atmosphere of Earth and
you can see very clearly that the
outer reaches of Earth's atmosphere are very
ordered, they are quite circular 
most of the time and, as
contrasted to, if you go down farther
into the atmosphere, those patterns get
all chaotic and messed up and the winds...
to me the conclusion is
obvious that the Earth masses
disrupt those beautiful circular patterns.
And so I think that's the evidence of
the fact that the structure of those
circling flows are created by the
incoming Birkeland currents that have
those nice concentric circular forms to
them and the further down you get, the
more disrupted it gets; it's kind of like
watching the crash of an airplane into a
mountain, I mean, it's
very nice before it hits.
So anyway, that was my main point
in that first Space News.
But then, when I looked at it and I
looked, as I always do, at some of the
comments that were made, there was a
commenter, his name, he put that his name is
Dr. BH, so hello to Dr. BH whoever he is!
And he asked, he said, do these patterns
change as the seasons and the dominant
hemispheres align with the Sun,
can you show a connection this way?
And I began to think, I said yeah,
hey that sounds, that's a good question!
So I got to wondering
whether there might be some periodicity,
maybe yearly periodicity in the general
form of those high-altitude wind circulations.
Of course, most people realize,
when they're asked what causes
the seasons, the answer is not that the
summer is caused by the Earth being
closer to the Sun than
it is in the winter.
Anyhow, what is the cause?
Well, we, most people realize the Earth's
rotational axis is fixed in inertial
space, that is to say, the axis of Earth
always points in one direction.
Of course, walk out at night and look up,
it's our old friend Polaris, the North
Star or the pole star, and so as the
Earth travels around in this path around
the Sun, it doesn't look at the Sun or
away from the Sun, it looks directly at
Polaris and it keeps looking at Polaris, every
minute of every day of every hour of every year.
When Earth gets to the
point in its orbit where its axis of
rotation is pointing the North Pole away
from the Sun, that's the Northern
Hemisphere's winter solstice, that's what
causes the winter and the summer.
So anyhow, with those facts in mind, I
figured a priori before I looked at
nullschool again,
that in December there might be a strong,
inward directed Birkeland current from
the Sun entering Earth's South Pole, because
the South Pole is pointed more toward the Sun.
Well anyway, to make a long story
short, that isn't what happens.
Nothing remotely even akin to that 
was observed, at least by me, when I
looked at the earth.nullschool.net site.
What I did see, during the height of the
Northern Hemisphere summer, that is
aphelion, Earth farthest from the Sun,
current enters into both the North and
the South Poles, generally.
Now you know how I discovered
that, I took my
finger, it's the old right-
hand rule, you put
your fingers in the direction of the
wind flow, the current flow, and then
your thumb is going to be pointed in the
direction of the, assuming that our
theory is right, in the direction of the
Birkeland current that causes that rotation.
And then, during the Northern
Hemisphere winter, that is perihelion, the
Earth is closest to the Sun, the North
Pole is pointed away from the Sun, the
South Pole is directed toward the Sun,
and what do you observe, you observe that
current is directed out of both the
North and the South Poles.
So it's strictly not what your intuition, at least
not what my intuition tells me what happened.
Well anyway, if you look at that
table you can see that overall, what
happens is that in those, those
four lines in that table, and if you
look at the third and fourth columns
there, the northern hemisphere current
and the southern hemisphere current, you
can see that in the summer in the
northern hemisphere, that is to say the
second row within that table, the current
is in, both at the North Pole
and at the South Pole.
And the last line in the
table, when it's winter in the north and
of course, we're closest to the Sun, the
northern hemisphere current is out and
the southern hemisphere current is out.
So you've got this really strange, sort
of, in out, in out, out, in out, in,
sort of arrangement,
and what's the punchline,
what's the bottom line?
And my conclusion is, that if
you look at the second row
and the last row, you can see that in the
summer in the north, which is the winter
in the south, the current is going in at
both poles; and in the winter in the
north and the summer being in the south,
current is going out of both poles.
So there's a seasonal year-long cycle, in
which these flows completely
reverse, and it's at those solstices.
So let me summarize, I've written it down,
let me read what I've written.
From December through February,
the southern hemisphere
summer, the North Pole is pointed away
from the Sun, Earth is nearest the Sun,
it's at perihelion, and what I'm talking
about is row four of the table, the
Birkeland current is directed
out of both hemispheres.
If you look at figure one, that is,
the Birkeland current is directed
out of both hemispheres, strong at the
North Pole, figure one, and weak at the
South Pole, figure two.
Incidentally, that figure one,
the strong currents, are
something well over 300-350 km/h,
that's moving.
The weak currents are more like
50 kilometers per hour.
Now I see it's strong at the North Pole
in Figure 1, and weak at the South Pole,
and you can see what I mean.
Anyway, both currents being out,
the Earth is losing
positive charge during that season, the
Earth is like a capacitor, if you have
current flowing out every hole
in the north and in the
south is going out, well, clearly, the
Earth is losing positive charge.
If the Earth is, at that time, closest to the
Sun, that says that according to EU
Theory, that that would be a position of
relatively higher voltage, we are closer
to the Sun, higher voltage, the Sun is
very strongly positively charged.
Therefore, we ought to be collecting some
positive charge from the surrounding
plasma, through which Earth is moving.
I'm just talking about this plasma
ocean that we float in.
Now, if you put in there the
Birkeland currents that I'm
talking about, those seem to
have the opposite effect.
If the Earth is losing
charge and the Birkeland current is
directed out of both hemispheres and
it's strong at the northern pole, that is,
look at Figure one, you can see that the
rotation is quite strong, and weaker at
the South Pole, that's
figure two, but still directed
out of both hemispheres at that point,
and that's what's important, and so the
effect of this newly observed Birkeland
current mechanism appears to provide a
means through which the Earth may dump
such added positive charge over this
part of the year.
So if it's normally collecting it
from the ocean of plasma
through which it's floating,
and that Birkeland current is connected
to the North Pole and the South Pole,
and the charge is flowing out, it's sort
of a Birkeland current is sort of
neutralizing the pick-up of the
charge that is happening.
Anyway, for the three months
of the year at the South
hemisphere winter, that is the South Pole
pointed away from the Sun, Earth is
farthest from the Sun, it's at aphelion,
I'm talking about row two of the table,
the circulation pattern indicates that
Birkeland currents simultaneously enter
down into Earth at both the North
and the South Poles.
Now, if you look at figure three,
you'll see that that
entering in is pretty weak at the North
Pole but quite strong at the South Pole.
So Earth effectively gains positive
charge during this season but it's
farthest from the Sun, and so therefore
Earth ought to be losing charge, but the
action of the Birkeland current apparently
counters any such loss of charge.
So the essence of it all is that
yes, there is a yearly periodicity during
which everything completely
reverses direction,
and it acts in a very complex way,
as we can see.
The question is, is the Earth at
aphelion, that is far away, or perihelion,
close in, and I think this fits with
Wal's idea with which I again firmly
agree, that the Sun's electric field creates
a higher voltage region near the Sun and
a lower voltage region farther out.
But, so we understand a little bit, but this
is a rich, I think, and complicated area
that's open for research that nobody
seems to have discovered, yet.

Welcome to Space News from
the Electric Universe,

The interview you are about to hear
with physicist Wal Thornhill was
recorded on Monday April 8th, 2019.
In anticipation of the scheduled release of
the so called 'first ever direct image of
a black hole' which occurred
on Wednesday, April 10th.
Now, whenever we talk about a
space science story which has crossed
over and become a major international
news headline, we seem to attract an
inordinate number of viewers who have
little or no prior familiarity with
plasma cosmology and the
Electric Universe theory.
The problem is that the
overwhelming majority of the general
public have no idea that any theoretical
alternatives to the black hole exist and
should actually be taken seriously.
So here's a brief segment from a possible
elevator speech for newcomers to plasma
cosmology and the Electric Universe.
Plasma cosmology is a model of the
universe which recognizes the now
undeniable significance of plasma and
the electromagnetic force in the cosmos.
For several decades, plasma cosmologists
have successfully reproduced, in
laboratory experiments, many
Astrophysical phenomena.
An electric plasma universe
predicts, and in fact,
requires the pervasive and shockingly
well ordered cosmic magnetic fields
which are now recognized but are not
explained and were not predicted by
gravity-centric cosmology.
And for decades, it's
been proposed that at the
center of galaxies is not a black hole
but rather a physically real object
which is produced and observed in
laboratories, called a plasmoid.
Now, you've probably never heard Neil
deGrasse Tyson or Brian Cox talking
about plasmoids, but that
doesn't make them any less real.
So what is a plasmoid?
Well, the term plasmoid was coined by the
physicist Winston H. Bostick in the 1950s.
Bostic described a
plasmoid as follows,
"The plasma is emitted not as an
amorphous blob, but in the form of a torus.
We shall take the liberty of
calling this toroidal structure a
plasmoid, a word which means
plasma-magnetic entity.
Now, Bostick is probably
most famous for having performed many
experiments in the plasma lab which
reproduced the formation and evolution
of spiral galaxies.
Now, Wal Thornhill explains in this
interview in some detail the nature and
properties of plasmoids and for viewers
who wish to gain an understanding of
what plasma cosmology and the Electric
Universe actually propose for the
phenomena that astrophysicists
attribute to "black holes."
In the comments section, we have penned a
comment which will feature a dozen or so
relevant links to previous Space News
episodes and a number of other resources.
So finally, as I begin to play my
discussion from Monday with Wal Thornhill,
bear in mind again the description of
the plasmoid as a "toroidal or
doughnut-shaped structure."
Now consider the side-by-side comparison of
the plasma cosmology prediction of what's
actually at a galaxy's core which is the
aforementioned
extremely dense magnetically confined
hot spot called a plasmoid, and to the
right we see the image that has been touted
as the first picture of a black hole,
of course, with no alternative being considered.
So here now is part 1 of my
two-part interview with Wal Thornhill,
recorded April 8, 2019.
On April 6, the Phys.org report says, scientists are
set to unveil the first picture of a black hole.
The thing is that the picture
itself is actually a virtual reality
image, like most of these deep
space images turn out to be and that's
because the imaging algorithms that
were developed to fill the gaps of data
and they say the gaps of data we are
missing in order to reconstruct a
picture of black hole.
So in other words, it's the algorithms
that they've developed based on their
understanding and their assumptions
about what it is they're looking at
that will generate this image.
They just granted that they are looking
for something at the center of the galaxy
which would appear about the size of a,
try to photograph a golf ball on the
moon, according to this article.
There is plenty of opportunity for making
the image look like what you expect to see.
And this has happened of course before.
It's just like the gravitational wave
detectors that were built to detect
gravitational waves and all of the
assumptions were built-in into that so
that they had to find something.
So they had hundreds of thousands of templates
against which to match these signals and
then of course the signals have to be
sort of pulled out of the noise, they're
looking at signals that are incredibly
tiny, which gives rise of course to the
possibility that what they're seeing is
like making faces out of clouds.
The notion that black holes exist is based
on gravitational theory.
Now gravitational theory, according to modern
scientists, is that of general relativity,
Einstein's general relativity, but the
problem with that is and it was best
described, I think, in a television
program put on by the BBC which showed
Brian Cox explaining the genius of
Einstein in looking at a falling
cannonball and a feather
in a huge vacuum chamber.
And of course, the two fall together.
And what Brian Cox said
was that Einstein's genius was that he
said, they're not actually falling.
In other words, it's all an appearance but
the only way you can get away with that
is to disregard everything else that
exists in the universe, which was a
tendency of the mathematics of general
relativity and also special relativity.
Special relativity makes all observers,
no matter how they're moving, equivalent
which is sheer nonsense.
The only way you can do that is to disregard the
rest of the universe because the most their
motion will be different for different
observers with respect to this
background of all the stars and matter
in the rest of the universe.
So it's a weird kind of perception
that's induced by Einstein's theory.
The Electric Universe has followed the guide
of the plasma cosmologists, the plasma
physicists who've done real experiments
and developed a simple theory which
explains what is at the center of our galaxy
and other galaxies and that is a plasmoid.
Now, plasmoid is a concentration
of electromagnetic energy caused by
electric currents flowing in along the
spiral arms into the center of the
galaxy and this is seen in the
laboratory, the plasma laboratory, in
terms of what's known as a plasma focus
where you have a central conductor and a
surrounding cylinder with that large
voltage difference between them; and you
produce that voltage difference by
having a huge roomful of capacitors,
stored electric charge, which
you release suddenly.
What you do then is, you create
a discharge which runs down the cylinder,
between the cylinder and the central
electrode and when it comes to the end
that it moves out beyond the end and curls
back in on itself and forms as tiny plasmoid.
Now, a description of all
of this and the physics behind it was
given by Eric Lerner in his book 'The Big
Bang Never Happened' which was published
in 1991.
It's easily understood, it makes sense,
it conforms to electromagnetic theory,
and it is all about electrodynamics that
is the movement of charged particles.
And when you think about it, the universe
is formed by moving charged particles.
So, the governing force in the
universe is what's known as
electrodynamics, not gravity.
And in particular, spiral galaxies, their
form and the way they move is easily
explained in terms of electrodynamics,
not gravity!
Now when you concentrate a huge amount
of electrical and electromagnetic energy
in a tiny plasmoid, the energy storage
means that it appears to have a lot more
mass than you would expect
in such a small space.
Also, the plasmoid has a doughnut shape.
So it's quite likely that
what we will be told is that they've
seen a glowing accretion disk.
The gravitational accretion has nothing whatever
to do with it, it is all electro-dynamic.
So yes, there can be or they
should actually see a glowing doughnut-
shaped object quite bright because
there's an awful lot of radiation and so
on from this object and in the
center there will be nothing.
No black hole, just
the plasmoid, and it's only when the
plasmoid begins to break down that the,
where the electric and electromagnetic
forces are greatest that is in this
center of the doughnut.
That is where the breakdown occurs
and you get these jets formed.
Now jets from a black hole are an
incredible nonsense when you think about
it, because black holes are supposed to
suck everything in and here they are,
forcing jets out along the rotation axis.
Maybe I should expand a bit on what
these jets are and how they're formed.
If you can imagine that the plasmoid has a
combination of both positive and
negative charges in that plasma and this
is quite normal for a plasma; where they
become forced closest together is in the
center of the doughnut, if you like.
And when the density of these particles
reaches a critical point, the protons and
electrons may actually join together to
form a neutron and the neutrons then are
not subject to the electromagnetic
forces that have held them in
place and this is why they escape in the
form of neutrons and the neutrons of
course decay in a matter of minutes but
that's enough time for them traveling at
relativistic velocities to get away to
then become positive and
negative particles once more.
The electrons tend
to be trapped longer by the powerful
magnetic fields involved, they tend to
spiral around much more tightly than the
heavier protons, and so you get an
electric current flowing along these jets.
And this is actually being measured
by the magnetic fields they create and
these currents are huge.
So the whole galactic environment and
behavior and appearance can be explained
electromagnetically and has been done so
by plasma cosmologists decades ago.
But of course, astrophysicists and this
over-specialization of science these days
creates walls between people, even within
the same discipline.
It's difficult often to get
ideas broadcast and discussed
rationally and rational decisions made
based upon rational argument even within
individual departments, let alone across
departments in a university.
So in some ways, our institutionalized education
and research system fails us, dismally,
and this is why we get away with this
huge expense on things like the
gravitational wave detectors when no one
actually knows what the
gravitational force is, and event horizon
telescopes when even the very concept of
the event horizon for a black hole is nonsense.
The answers all lie in getting
a grip on the real history of science
because we actually lost the plot at the end
of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century.
It's as if the human race
went rather berserk, both politically
and scientifically at the same time.
And of course, the history that's taught
to students is sanitized, you only hear
about the people that they want you to
hear about and those who had other ideas
are not even compared against the ideas
that are so-called, you know, 'accepted
science' or 'consensus science.'
The whole idea of consensus science is nonsense
anyway because the truth is not found by a vote.
Well, an unspoken agreement that
lurks behind this kind of media
sensation is the assumption that no
basis exists for anyone to doubt the
black holes' existence.
So here's a very simple question for you, what
is your response to the astrophysicist who says
that the existence of black holes is an
established fact?
The questions to ask an astrophysicist in return
for any dogmatic statements is to define mass
and energy because here we hear these
black holes have masses of millions or
even billions of Suns and they're
compressed into a space where the mass
resides in a singularity.
Well, a singularity involves infinity and
you're no longer talking physics when you
introduce infinity because infinity is
merely a concept, that's not a thing, it's
not a number, you can't use it in
mathematics as school boys were taught
when I went to school.
But it's a word that's often used in reference
to black holes and also the Big Bang.
This gets back to Eric Lerner's book
and why it's important to read it.
From the physics point of view is, that he deals
with these things, the plasma cosmologists
don't deal with infinities, they have no
need because the electric force is so
much more powerful than gravity that
you can ignore gravity and
they've actually tested that in their
supercomputer simulations of their
experiments and they can include gravity
quite easily and in the simulation or
they can leave it out and
it makes no difference.
Stay tuned for part 2

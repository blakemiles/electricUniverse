The groundbreaking field of Electric Universe geology
is vibrant with new possibilities. Standard geology
proposes that the primary forces that have shaped planetary
surfaces are periodic impacts: volcanism and wind and
water erosion over eons of time. But on every rocky body
in the solar system, from our planet, all the way to the
Kuiper belt, the objects we see show features that routinely
defy this reasoning. The theoretical alternatives
Electric Universe geology offers, recognizes processes
well-known to electrical engineers and plasma
physicists. In our solar system, we do observe these
type of electrical phenomena on a different scale. In
previous presentations, Thunderblog contributor, Andrew
Hall has proposed that the extraordinary winds of the gas
giant Jupiter, provide analogues for the high-energy events
that may have shaped the Earth. Today, Andrew continues his
remarkable presentation in the latest installment
of his series, The Eye of the Storm.
In previous articles, we established a link between the winds
on Jupiter and landforms on Earth. In primordial times,
Earth 's weather was like Jupiter's, with raging plasma,
whirlwinds and segregated electric jet streams that attained
supersonic speeds. Close examination of mountains and other
landforms shows clear evidence of windblown deposition
that layered the land. Supersonic shockwaves that shape
mountain flanks, massive lightning discharges that welded
rock, and plasma vortices that blow- torched
the land. Jupiter's winds are the result of
capacitance between double layers in the atmosphere and the
plasma sheath at the planet's surface. We don't know what the
surface of Jupiter is, but it doesn't matter - it still
forms a plasma sheath, a double layer at the interface
between crust and atmosphere. Electric circuits form
the winds by capacitance, inductance and magnetic
fields. Surface and atmosphere are coupled by capacitance
and ongoing release of energy from Jupiter's
interior is what stirs the winds. On Earth, dust particles,
aerosols and the water cycle - evaporation, condensation, ice
and rain - are the charge carriers, or the ”wires” of the circuit.
On Jupiter, it also includes ammonia and other species.
Regardless of the difference in chemistry between
Earth and Jupiter, charge diffusion in Nature follows
patterns. A lightning bolt on Jupiter is like a lightning bolt
on Earth. It is a discharge between plasma layers that takes
a fractal path as ionized filaments react in feedback
with the magnetic field that current produces. Fractal
forms are generated by this feedback loop in any process
of charge diffusion. They're not restricted to the
Lichtenberg pattern of a lightning bolt, but are evident in
the helical path of field-aligned Birkeland currents, the
geometry of electromagnetic fields, and the drift currents
reacting to far-field potentials. So, it should be no surprise
at all to find the same fractal patterns in Jupiter's winds
as we find on Earth 's landscape, if indeed the landscape was
formed by similar winds. One spade-shaped feature is almost
ubiquitous in Jupiter's turbulence. I call it the boot
print. On Jupiter, the boot print is the downdrafting
eye of a cyclone being pinched in the turbulent flow of
competing winds. Like a hurricane, it is fed by billowing
thunderstorms surrounding a whirlpool, which together
forms a piece of a circuit - a ring current between the
atmosphere and ground. The shape of the cloud tops is
carried to the surface and reflected there, because the
structure is a fractal, rotating filament of current reaching
the surface. When Earth's weather raged like Jupiter's, Earth was
in its formative age. The continents were being built, as layer
upon layer of dust accumulated on a foundation of volcanic
flows. Turbulent cyclones in the Earth’s atmosphere produced
boot prints, identical in form to the boot prints on Jupiter.
Boot prints on Earth are literally, the footprints of
storms. Boot prints on Earth are clear evidence of electric
formation, because they display exactly what is expected in
fine detail. The boot print is the consequence of a
down-bursting wind - a hot ionized supersonic dust-laden wind,
aimed at the ground like a blowtorch. The mountain rim
is the pattern of a standing shockwave. The repeating
triangular layers on the inner flanks are impressed there
by harmonic shock reflections which channeled the wind at
the boundary layer and trapped dust in the low-pressure zone
in the triangular wave forms. Shock waves produce triangular
patterns of expansion and compression when a supersonic wind
is deflected, like when it hits solid land. Just ahead of
where a shock wave reflects, a low-pressure region forms,
called the ”Separation Bubble”. The separation bubble
is in the shape of a tetrahedron, with the triangular face
perpendicular to the wind at the same angle as the shock wave
reflection, called the Mach angle. As dust-laden ionized
winds pass through the separation bubble, this low-pressure
region collects dust like a vacuum cleaner and piles it in triangular layers.
Therefore, the rims or mountains surrounding a boot print crater, display
these triangular layers. If a downburst wind strikes at an
angle, rotates or its mass flow is biased to one side, it will
affect the shape of the crater it forms. Boot prints are often
accompanied by a feature called a Prandtl-Meyer expansion
fan. It's a series of standing shockwaves that
form linear rays of compression and rarefaction,
where the wind strikes and reflects off an object.
This pattern implies the boot print is the result of
an obliquely striking wind that rotated. If you've ever
watched tornadoes, you probably noticed they're rarely
perfectly vertical. They contact the ground at an angle and the
rotating wind is lifted to one side and grinds against the
ground on the opposite side. That is precisely what has
happened here to produce a boot print crater with an
expansion fan. This single example is proof of my theory.
Anyone with a supersonic wind tunnel can produce a
Prandtl-Meyer expansion fan, tetrahedron- shaped separation
bubbles, and triangular harmonic reflections. It's been done
countless times. But show a way to produce all these together
in a large-scale coherent form by tectonic uplift, seismic
vibration, slip faulting, erosion or any other conventional
geophysical means: can't be done. It is uniquely the result
of supersonic shock. Nature provides rational, obvious proof,
without need for computers or numeric models. The pattern
is not vague, like Jesus on piece of toast. It is confirmed
in every detail. The correlation is not only visual
similarity, but also causation - vertical high-speed winds,
electrically charged and shaped by electromagnetic fields.
Proof of the winds of Jupiter are in NASA's data; proof of the
ground effects on Earth or under our feet, and in decades
of applied science and supersonic shock wave behavior. Proper
interpretation of data and some wind tunnel testing would
put the issue to bed. But maybe I can do that with this next
example. California's most prominent feature is the San Joaquin
Valley and its ring of mountains, including the imposing
Sierra Nevada mountain arc and coastal ranges. Inside
this bathtub, the floor of the valley is a long, flat plain, which
at one time was an ancient sea bed. It was created by a storm
like this on Jupiter. So let's look at some amazing details.
In this image, I indicate four specific areas we'll
discuss. Area 1 - the Mojave Desert. This
almost perfectly triangular plane of high
desert is demarcated by the straight line of the Tehachapi
mountains to the north, and the straight line of the San
Gabriel Mountains to the south, which also, by the way,
aligns with the San Andreas Fault. It correlates to the
region of low-level winds, tinted blue, at the cusp of the
oval storm rotation on Jupiter. These winds are sinking winds,
that is they are pressing against the ground in a
venturi-effect as they speed around the cusp of the storm. The
yellow-brown ring of this storm is a rising wind, forming
what is essentially a continuous ring of thunderstorms. The
sharp triangular demarcation between desert and mountain
is the shear zone where shock waves form between the low-
level horizontal winds and the rising winds of the
rotating storm. As these winds rounded the corner into the
Venturi, they accelerated, gouging the deep Owens, Saline,
Amargosa and Death Valleys. Separating these valleys rise
11,000 foot ridgelines of the Panamint, Darwin and Amargosa
ranges. They formed as sastrugi, parallel to the jet
streams and low-pressure interference zones between the
laminar jet streams. Lightning in this region was imposing. A
plasma intensifies in a shear zone, meaning it generates ion
content due to the shearing and extreme temperature and
pressure differentials. Shearing supersonic winds
bounce shockwaves between them, generating high-current
density in jet-streams that extend for thousands of miles.
Lightning discharge from these plasma streams focused on the
piling mountains below with the capacity of a thousand
mile-long thunderstorm, being continually fed new energy. The
current dumped in the strike zone didn't simply flash a second
here and there, but arced continuously, diffusing through the
land, welding granite from dust and sand. That is why the
Sierras in this portion of the range have the most impressive
granite structures - Yosemite, Mt Whitney; its
neighboring peaks and the Domes. The granite
of the Sierras lies atop sediment, which implies the storm(s),
either by wind or tsunami brought layers of dust long
before lightning even began to strike. Area 2 – Coalinga. Coaling
Station A was its original name. Coalinga, as it's called
today, is an oil patch town. The foothills that surround it
are oil fields - anticlines of shallow sandstone, saturated
in heavy oil. Similar anticlines flank the
western side of the San Joaquin Valley,
from Coalinga to the end of the bathtub at Bakersfield. These
anticlines compose some of the largest oil fields in North
America. What created them was like this turbulent region in
Jupiter's clouds. The colorized image from NASA shows a crab-
claw cloud structure, with high-level clouds in yellow, and
low-level clouds in blue and black. There are several tornado
rotations along the boundaries of opposing flows. There are
also deep, dark linear filaments. Now correlate the dark
filaments with the deep-cut, linear valleys near Coalinga.
The dark filaments are ground-level jet streams, which are
what formed these valleys by preventing dust from depositing.
Follow the filament in Jupiter's cloud and it ends in a
tornado. Follow the valleys near Coalinga and they end in
hills with spiral features. In other words, the filaments
are jet streams hugging the ground, cutting beneath the storm
clouds to feed a giant tornado. Fascinating, isn't it?
Blue lines in the wind pattern image represent ground level
winds, combining across the San Joaquin Valley, and rising
into thunderstorms. Yellow represents the higher-level
mesocyclone winds which rained dust and rock. The blue winds
approach the thunderstorm orthogonally, then rise in the
updraft of the storm. Dark blue lines are the tornadoes and
ground-hugging jet streams. A drive through the region shows
the mountains are windblown dunes that rise abruptly from
the flat valley floor and display exactly the wind
pattern as I describe. It seems chaotic - winds
crisscrossing in every direction, but it's not. The overall
wind structure is called a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.
It's a fractal pattern that happens all the time if there's
wind shear. Area 3 is the San Joaquin Valley. Look
inside the yellow ring of thunderstorms and see that there are
dozens of small vortices. These are tornadoes, or perhaps
water spouts, because the San Joaquin Valley was likely
a sea at the time. Among all the tiny whirlwinds is one
giant tornado, almost at the center of the storm. This
feature correlates well with a circular region in the Sierra
Foothills at the north end of the San Joaquin Valley. If
you've ever driven from Sacramento to Lake Tahoe on State
Highway 50, past the town of Folsom, where I once lived, you have
climbed the Sierra foothills that constitute this feature. A
distinct swirl is evident in the hills just above, or to the
east of Folsom Lake. The swirl is fed by ground-level winds
entering the vortex from the left, or the south, whereas the
top level winds in Jupiter's clouds flow in from below, or the
west on the Earth image. This indicates differences in
flow patterns between double layers due to the rotational
symmetry of fractals. Fractal rotational symmetry is when a
fractal shape repeats, but rotated by 90 or 180 degrees. This
indicates the wind clocks around 90 degrees in different
layers of the storm. The same thing occurs in hurricanes and
mesocyclones on Earth, even today. Area 4 - San Francisco
Bay. Here, you are literally seeing the drain in the
bathtub. Follow the dark filaments in Jupiter's clouds and
they converge in a vortex. Compare the dark filaments on
Jupiter to the long linear valleys leading to San Francisco
Bay and you see the same pattern. The dark filaments are
ground-level jet streams that scoured the land, while the
light-colored cloud tops are thunderstorm anvils, raining
charged dust to form the mountains. Look close
at Jupiter's clouds near the center of rotation
and there is a dark X-shaped feature. Then compare the
Sacramento Delta and you'll see the Delta is the top of
the X. Again, it's because the dark filaments are
ground-scouring winds, which in this case scour the land to a
depth below current sea level. I hope these images
provide unambiguous evidence of how the Earth
was formed. Any one or two matching features between
the clouds of Jupiter and Earth's landscape could be
coincidence, but overlay Jupiter's oval storm on California
and all seven features depicted here match in both
shape and position. And the wind patterns not only look like,
but explain the land features. At least they do, if you apply
electric circuitry and ignore consensus science. There is
a host of interesting things to learn by understanding
California's true formation. For instance, a whirlwind-formed
hill in Kern County is full of ancient shark's teeth fossils.
These sharks date to the middle Miocene, roughly fifteen
million years ago, by consensus chronology. Now, I don't trust
consensus chronology, but it does place a bookmark in the
fossil and geologic record. Oil sands in San Joaquin date
from the Miocene and earlier, except for one shallow Pliocene
sediment. The Miocene epoch that formed Shark Hill, was likely
the last time such a mountain building storm raged over
California. But the stratigraphy and the fossil record
suggest there were many similar fractal
storms in earlier epochs. Thank you!

The current standard cosmological model
tells us that roughly 96% of the universe
is composed of strange
invisible dark stuff.
About 73% of the total mass
and energy in the universe
is said to be composed of
so-called dark energy.
The concept of dark energy
was invented in the 1990's
when scientists studying type 1a
supernovae discovered that the supernovae
appeared to be accelerating faster, the
farther away they were from the observer.
Today, cosmologists say that the mysterious
force of dark energy is responsible for
accelerating the expansion of the universe
since the hypothetical Big Bang explosion,
although the admit they have no
understanding of what dark energy is,
nor how it really works.
But a new scientific study has only
made dark energy more mysterious.
Scientists that attempt to measure
the so called cosmic expansion rate
have discovered that the universe again
appears to be expanding much too quickly,
even taking into account the invention
of dark energy's influence.
The study leader states in a recent
Scientific American article.
The bottom line is that the universe looks
like it's expanding about 8% faster
than you would have expected based on how it looked
in its youth and how we expect it to evolve.
We have to take this
pretty darn seriously.
Charles Bennett of Johns Hopkins
University also stated;
"Basically is there something going on
in cosmology that we don't understand,
or is there something
going on with the data?
One of those is a lot more exciting, but
I think the other may be more likely.
The Scientific American article
offers the following analysis;
"One of the most exciting
possibilities is that dark energy
is even stranger than the
leading theory suggests".
However, as Wal Thornhill explains, the
standard cosmology's increasingly strange
interpretations become unnecessary
in an Electric Universe.
It's no surprise that Big Bang
theorists are having difficulties
with each new discovery
about the universe.
The most recent problem was
highlighted in Nature on April 11th;
"The most precise measurement ever made of the
current rate of expansion of the universe
has produced a value that appears
incompatible with measurements of radiation
left over from the big bang.
If the findings are confirmed
by independent techniques,
the laws of cosmology might
have to be rewritten".
The rate of expansion of the
universe is supposed to be due
to the competing action of
dark matter with dark energy.
Dark matter's gravity tends
to slow cosmic expansion
while dark energy pushes out
what makes it accelerate.
It was thought that dark energy
strength has been constant.
Now it has been found, the rate of
expansion is 8% faster than that predicted
based on the cosmic microwave
background radiation diagram.
But it is not the man-made laws of
cosmology that need to be rewritten,
it is the entire set of concepts
that underpin Big Bang cosmology.
It's no use making up laws
about things that don't exist,
like dark matter
and dark energy.
It is simply assumed because
of the belief in the Big Bang
that the cosmic microwave radiation is from
the background, rather than the foreground.
However, the evidence of asymmetry in that
radiation suggests it is locally produced.
More to the point, Plasma Cosmology and the
Electric Universe requires and simply explains
the cosmic radiation as being due to
microwave radiation from the filamentary
gallactic electric currents flowing
in the neighborhood of the Sun.
Indeed some of the
expected structures,
a Galaxy wide sample of dense
filamentary structures
correlated with spiral arms and star
formation, have been recently mapped.
See here an example of a
network of galactic filaments.
Note the roughly orthogonal
branching of tributaries
which is characteristic of
an electrical discharge
and then compare it with the experimental
discharge filaments shown here.
In October 2011 I wrote, "A
Nobel Prize for the Dark Side",
about the prize in physics being
awarded to 3 astrophysicists
for the 'accelerating universe'.
Dark energy is supposed to
make up 73% of the universe.
The evidence interpreted
in this weird way
comes from comparing the
redshift distances of galaxies
with the brightness of the supernovae
type 1a, used as a standard candle.
It was found that the supernovae in highly
redshifted galaxies are fainter than expected,
indicating that they are further
away than previously estimated.
This in turn implied a startling
accelerating expansion of the universe,
according to the Big Bang model.
It's like throwing a ball into the air
and having it accelerate upwards!
So, a mysterious dark
energy was invented
which fills the vacuum and
works against gravity.
The popular science fiction
author Douglas Adams'
infinite improbability
generator type of argument,
was called upon to produce
this vacuum energy.
The language defining
vacuum energy is revealing.
"Vacuum energy is an underlying
background energy that exists in space
even when the space is devoid
of matter, that is, free space.
The concept of vacuum energy has been deduced
from the concept of virtual particles,
which is itself derived from the
energy-time uncertainty principle".
You may notice the absurdity of the concept
given that the vacuum contains no matter,
background or otherwise.
Yet it is supposed
to contain energy.
This is impossible!
Incredibly, energy has no
definition in physics.
Merely different examples.
Douglas Adams was parodying Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics.
Quantum mechanics is merely a
probabilistic description of
what happens at the scale
of subatomic particles
with no real physical understanding
of cause and effect.
Heisenberg was uncertain because he
didn't know, in a physical sense,
what he was talking about.
He was being truthful
though when he wrote;
"We still lack some essential feature in
our image of the structure of matter".
The concept of virtual particles
winking in and out of existence
defies the first
principle of physics.
'Thou shalt not magically materialize
nor dematerialize matter.'
Calling matter virtual merely
underscores its non-reality.
Indeed, the discovery of the
acceleration of the expanding universe
is an interpretation based on total
ignorance of the real nature of stars
and the standard candle,
the supernova type 1a.
A supernova type 1a is supposed to be due to
a hypothetical series of incredible events
resulting in an exploding
white dwarf star.
But in an Electric Universe a supernova is
simply an electrical explosion of a star
that draws its energy
from a galactic circuit.
The remarkable brilliance
of a supernova,
which can exceed that of its
host galaxy for days or weeks,
is explained by kind of power
transmission line failure
that can also be seen
occasionally on Earth.
If such a circuit is suddenly opened, the
electromagnetic energy stored in the circuit
is focused at the point where
the circuit is broken,
producing catastrophic arcing.
Stars too, can suddenly have the
current, focused on them, switched off
by a plasma instability, causing
it to be magnetically pinched off.
The result is what's known
as an exploding double layer
which results in ejection of
matter from the body of the star.
This turning inside out of a supernova has
been observed, to the puzzlement of theorists.
The standard candle of the
supernova and it's light curve
are then simply due to the circuit
parameters of galactic transmission lines
which power all stars.
What of the discovery of fainter and more shortly
lived supernovae in high redshift galaxies?
The astronomer Halton Arp showed
from numerous observations
that faint, highly redshifted
objects like quasars,
are intrinsically faint because of
their youth and not their distance.
There was no big bang!
He proved that quasars are born episodically
from the nucleus of active galaxies.
Their light is initially
faint and highly redshifted
as they move rapidly along the
spin axis away from their parent.
As they mature, they grow brighter and their
redshift decreases while they slow down,
as the matter within
them increases in mass.
Finally, the quasars evolve
into companion galaxies.
The decreasing quasar redshift
occurs in discrete steps
which points to a process
whereby protons and electrons
go through a number of small
quantized, that is resonant,
increases in mass as the electrical
polarization within the quasar increases.
The charge required comes via
an electrical umbilical cord
in the form of the observed
parent galaxy's axial jet.
Based on Arp's discovery and the
electrical model of galaxies and stars,
both stars and supernovae
type 1a are naturally dimmer.
And the supernovae more short-lived in high
redshift galaxies than in low redshift galaxies
because of the lower
galactic energy density.
The Big Bang laws of cosmology need
to be discarded, not re-written.
They don't work!
All is darkness in the
Big Bang universe,
with its black holes, dark
matter and dark energy.
The Electric Universe throws
a new light on the subject
because its laws of cosmology are
simply those of electromagnetism
with, for the very first time,
definitions of mass and energy in terms
of the electrical structure of matter.
Of course, I don't expect a Nobel
Prize for the sensible explanation,
otherwise I could meet the
fate of the hapless student
who created the Infinite
Improbability Generator,
in Douglas Adams' wonderful
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
"When just after he was awarded the Galactic
Institute's Prize for Extreme Cleverness
he got lynched by a rampaging
mob of respectable physicists
who had finally realized that the one thing
they really couldn't stand was a smart-ass".

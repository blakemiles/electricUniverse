Of all our planetary neighbors,
perhaps none have proved more
surprising to space
scientists than Venus.
As late as the mid-20th
century, some renowned
astronomers including Fred Whipple, the
father of the dirty snowball model of
comets, continued to argue that Venus, the
so-called twin of planet Earth, might
have water clouds.
Instead, when the first space
probes touched down on Venus,
they found it to be the
hottest planet in the
solar system and drier
than any desert on Earth.
For many decades, Venus has
only grown more puzzling.
From its absence of
so-called impact craters, to its
retrograde rotation, to the super-
rotation of its atmosphere, to the
planet's vast comet-like
tail which has been found
to interact with the solar
wind "like a comet."
In fact, only one scholar
successfully predicted Venus's
superhot temperature and
comet-like characteristics.
In his best-selling book
Worlds in Collision,
Dr. Immanuel Velikovsky presented his
thesis that Venus was globally
remembered as an Earth-threatening comet
and will thus be extraordinarily hot due
to its recent birth.
In subsequent decades, a number
of scholars, originally
inspired by Velikovsky, began the process
of reconstructing the catastrophic
events Velikovsky suggested, applying a rigorous
cross-cultural comparison of world mythology.
The evidence overwhelmingly
demonstrates that Venus's
extraordinary role in ancient astronomy,
myth and religion, cannot be explained in
terms of anything observed today.
One of the leading comparative mythologist to
explore this question is Ev Cochrane, a
colleague for several decades of David
Talbott and the late Dwardu Cardona.
As Cochrane exhaustively outlined in his
books Martian Metamorphoses and The Many
Faces Of Venus, the
relationship between Mars and
Venus is just one extraordinary clue to the
celestial catastrophes recorded in ancient testimony.
In part 1 of this two-part
presentation, Cochrane begins by
explaining the genesis of his own
research including his and his
colleagues' conclusion that certain aspects
of Velikovsky's thesis were incorrect.
My initial interest in
Velikovsky's work centered around his
claim that certain archetypal
mythological themes, such as the dragon
combat, trace the celestial
determinants in astronomical events.
So for example, the universal
motif of the dragon, he
identified as a memory
of the Venus Comet.
And so, my earliest articles in
this area sought to investigate this
particular claim, and so I focused on
dragon imagery and the mythology
attached to Inanna and
Ishtar in ancient Mesopotamia.
I was at Iowa State pursuing
my master's program and then
I learned of Dave's research in 1981
and so I reached out to him and visited
him in Portland and slowly but surely we
agreed to collaborate on a series of
articles for Kronos
on the Venus comet.
Dave and I knew from almost day
one that the Venus and Mars cataclysms
were prehistoric in nature and thus
predate by thousands of years the
historical reconstruction advanced in
Worlds In Collision.
So that was a major flaw,
to put it mildly, and so a
fundamental flaw at Velikovsky's entire
methodology was the fact that he tended
to focus on Hebrew and Greek lore, and as
a result he often overlooked the precise
parallels to be found in the much more
ancient Egyptian and Sumerian traditions.
Yet, it stands to reason that the oldest
traditions, the ones, you know, closest in
time to the actual catastrophic events in
question, should preserve the most
complete record of the events, and so by
generally overlooking these ancient
traditions, Velikovsky's entire
enterprise was compromised.
At the same time, Velikovsky was
an amateur mythologist at best and
just did not give serious enough
consideration to methodology or to
comparative mythology and
comparative linguistics.
He identified Aphrodite with
the Moon, for example.
Had he given the matter much
consideration at all from a
comparative standpoint, he would
have understood that
Aphrodite had to be identified with
Inanna and Ishtar, and thus had to be the
planet Venus, not the Moon.
Likewise, his attempt to
identify certain mythological
characters such as Oedipus and Noah with
historical figures, is just simply
misguided.
As late as 1951, most astronomers
believed that Venus was Earth-like in
nature and likely home to lush
vegetation and various forms of life.
But, as I pointed out in the Many Faces Of
Venus, it's a historical fact that
conventional astronomers have gotten
virtually everything wrong about Venus,
so why should we believe them now when
they tell us Venus has been moving on
the same orbit for billions
and billions of years?
At the same time, it's important
to distinguish between ancient
terminology and modern
scientific definitions.
So, in describing the planet
Venus as a prototypical comet, the
ancient sky watchers were not employing
scientific language and somehow implying
that Venus moved on
a wildly erratic or
elongated orbit --
characteristic of modern comets.
Rather, in describing Venus as a
dragon star or long-haired star or comet-
like, the ancients simply meant that
Venus took on the appearance of a
dragon-like object or presented
wildly disheveled hair.
In each case, it's possible
to reconstruct the history of
the symbol in great question during
its historical evolution.
The serpent, for example, after
a period of disorganized
activity, ultimately came to
encircle the planet Mars.
Similarly, in the phase marked by
cosmic disorder, Venus's comet-
like hair was wildly disheveled and
spread out, but during the later phase
marked by the encircling of Mars and the
crowning of the warrior hero,
Venus's hair is tied up or bound or
otherwise brought under control.
And during this latter phase Venus's
hair is typically described as green or
turquoise blue in color, a clear pointer to
the remarkable nature of the events in question.
As noted, Venus's extraordinary
role in ancient myth,
religion, and the earliest astronomies, has never
been satisfactorily explained by astronomers.
We asked Ev for his thoughts
on occasional attempts by
mainstream scientists and
academics to explain the anomaly.
In numerous recent books on Venus and/or
ancient mythology, astronomers or
scholars are always trying to dream up
some explanation for why Venus is
associated with this
or that characteristic.
So for example, Patrick
Moore, the astronomer, was trying to
explain why Venus was
always regarded as a female.
So he said, "A female association
is in fact general; this is natural
enough, since to the unaided eye Venus is
the loveliest of planets."
I mean, talk about a ludicrous
idea, I mean, why would
being just lovely have anything to do
with being female, why would it be found
in cultures all around the world, they'd
all arrive at the same exact idea.
Similarly, the astronomer David Grinspoon
and Ed Krupp, they both pointed to
Venus's phase of a morning star being
roughly two hundred sixty three days, and
they claimed that because that is a
close approximation to the gestation
period for a human female, that that
explained why the planet was associated
with fertility or love.
As if these indigenous tribes
in South America were
carefully marking out the two hundred
sixty three days of Venus's orbits, you know.
So again, it's just laughable that
these guys come up with these ideas.
One of my favorites is from the top scholar
in Inanna religion from ancient
Mesopotamia, and this gal's conclusion was
that "Inanna's function as a bestower of
kingship and the protectress of the
city-state of Uruk may have given rise
to her warlike character, since kingship
followed the fortune of arms."
And yet, one page later she
gives a different explanation.
She says, "Goddesses of war and victory
predominate like Inanna and Ishtar."
And she says, "This may stem from a
battle metaphor in which women in
childbirth, men in battle were seen as struggling
with elemental forces of life and death."
Again, a very distinguished
scholar, it
never occurs to her to check and see how
Venus was represented in ancient Mexico
or ancient China, or these other cultures
in which case she'd find that they've
represented her as a
warrior there as well.
And as a raging goddess, that type of
stuff that was comet-like in nature,
her idea just falls to the ground almost
immediately, as just laughably inaccurate
to the puzzle in question. As I tried
to demonstrate in various books,
Venus's traditional femininity and
catastrophic histories are recorded around
the globe, so just a list of the
goddesses; you have Inanna and Ishtar in
Mesopotamia, you have
the Persian Anahita,
the Greek Aphrodite,
Arabic Al-Uzza...
I chronicled dozens and dozens of
goddesses in South America that are
typically lumped together
under Star Woman category
that share the exact
same characteristics.
So for example, Star Woman
is virtually indistinguishable
from Greek Aphrodite.
In other cases however, the
original identification with
Venus was not preserved, so for example,
one of the most prominent symbols in
Egyptian literature is the Eye of Horus,
and it's clearly a celestial agent, it's
clearly a catastrophic agent, but it
is nowhere explicitly identified with
the planet Venus and yet, the mythology
of the Egyptian Eye of Horus is
identical to that of Inanna and Ishtar.
Dave and I have written numerous
articles on that subject, documenting
that beyond any shadow of a doubt.
So too, the Indian goddess Kali and the
Canaanite goddess Anat are both
indistinguishable from Inanna and Ishtar
as warring goddesses, and yet they were
never identified with the planet Venus
to the best of my knowledge.
The history of scholarship, with respect to the
analysis of Venus imagery, presupposes
that the ancient sky watchers were
describing the familiar Venus, peacefully
moving on an orbit millions of years from the Earth
and that nothing could have changed in the
planet's appearance and behavior in the meantime.
Yet, such an assumption
is entirely unfounded.
Indeed, the mere fact that the
planet Venus was described in
an Inanna-like terms around the globe, should
be enough to refute this conventional position.
How else but upon the basis of
common experience of the Venus comet are
we to account for the fact that ancient
descriptions of the Venus around the
globe are so similar?
As noted previously, it's a
mystery unresolved by mainstream
science and academia, why the planet Venus
would be historically identified as
"feminine" and why the planet Mars would
be identified as a "masculine" warrior.
In fact, as Ev explains, a
remarkable number of cultures described
a mythical union between
Mars and Venus, which became
the basis for many sacred
marriage traditions.
The old saying "men are from Mars and women
are from Venus" is not of a recent origin.
I mean, this idea has been
around since the dawn of time
literally, and the identification will
hold around the globe, even though
there's nothing in the visual appearance
or behavior of the planets currently
that could ever inspire such traditions.
So, just to take a familiar example: in
ancient Greece the planet Venus is
inseparably associated with sacred
marriages -- the union of the sexes.
So, Aphrodite is specifically identified as
the bride in human marriages, while the
bridegroom is, specifically in early
Greek documents, identified with Ares.
This is exactly the situation in ancient
Mesopotamia, where Inanna is the subject
of the sacred marriage and identified as
the bride or the female participant in
the sacred marriage and Dumuzi is
the prototypical bridegroom.
Now, we know this mythology traces to celestial
determinants, because the very same
situation is found in the New World,
where the Skidi Pawnee
of North America, have a sacred marriage
involving Venus as the female bride
in a sacred marriage, and the
planet Mars as her husband.
According to the Skidi
account of creation, the union of Mars
and Venus sparks creation, and in each of
these three cases: Mesopotamia, Greece,
and North America, the marriage takes
place in a verdant garden and promotes
fertility throughout the world.
So these coincidences are just too specific
and remarkable to be coincidences alone.
We believe they trace
to common observations.

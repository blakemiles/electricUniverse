What do astronomers see 
when they gaze at the cosmos?
Thanks to incredible technological
leaps the universe is now
”visible” to a greater extent and in
finer clarity than ever before.
However, the detection and measurement of
the remotest celestial phenomena is not as
straightforward as it might seem.
Like all scientific investigations, space
exploration is a subjective human endeavor
and it stands to reason that the more
remote the phenomena, the 
more open it is to interpretation.
The evidence for the theoretical mechanisms
that are thought to cause the largest scale
cosmological phenomena, including unfathomable
emissions of electromagnetic energy, are
gleaned through inference by necessity and what
scientists infer is governed by what they believe.
The fundamental belief behind more than a century
of space science, is that the predominant force
in the cosmos is gravity. And even well into the
space age, astronomers continued to model a
universe in which plasma and both
electric and magnetic fields played no
significant role. In more recent years,
astronomers have acknowledged that
magnetic fields exist in space and
may even play an organizational role
at all scales in the cosmos. However, this
revelation of the so-called ”Magnetic Universe”
has presented both intractable problems and
paradoxically, opportunities for scientists to try to
preserve ad hoc the traditional
Big Bang gravity-centric cosmology.
A demonstration of these efforts can be
seen in the recent Quanta Magazine piece
titled, The Hidden Magnetic
Universe Begins To come Into View.
The article describes scientists’ attempt to date
cosmic magnetic fields back to the primordial
era after the hypothetical Big Bang,
an effort which they hope, might
resolve the so-called Hubble tension, or
the apparent accelerating expansion rate
of the universe. The article 
states, “Anytime astronomers
figure out a new way of looking for
magnetic fields in ever more remote
regions of the cosmos, inexplicably
they find them...The question is:
Where did these enormous
magnetic fields come from?”
Astrophysicist Franco Vazza states the 
problem, ”It clearly cannot be related to the
activity of single galaxies or
single explosions or, I don't know,
winds from supernovae. This goes 
much beyond that.” Of course, as
we've explained many times, the real
reason cosmic magnetism is considered so
”inexplicable” is because of most space
scientists ongoing, a priori dismissal
of electric currents in the cosmos.
This posture is described in
the Quanta piece as follows,
”...magnetism is the only force apart from
gravity, that can shape the large-scale
structure of the cosmos, because 
only magnetism and gravity can
reach out to you across vast 
distances. Electricity, by contrast,
is local and short-lived, since the
positive and negative charge in any
region will neutralize overall. But 
you can't cancel out magnetic fields;
they tend to add up and survive.” And
here, we see emphasized institutionalized
sciences’ refusal to explore the
well-developed concepts of plasma
cosmology. For many 
decades, astronomers have
assumed that plasma is a superconductor,
which leads to a further assumption
of so-called “frozen-in
magnetic fields” in space.
However, plasma physicists
have known for many decades
that when “clouds of plasma”
move relative to each other,
they generate electric currents in each
other, as shown experimentally in plasma
laboratories. Electric currents
in plasma take the form
of twisted filament pairs, and 
these follow the direction of the
ambient magnetic field. The 
filamentary current is electrically
insulated from its surroundings.
Experimental plasma physics has shown
that charged bodies, embedded 
in plasma, produce around
themselves a double layer, or 
what is also known as a Langmuir
plasma sheath. This 
protective cocoon of plasma
contains most of the voltage differ-
ence between a charged body
and its surrounding plasma. As Nobel
prize winner Hannes Alfvén wrote in
his 1987 paper, Cosmology 
in the Plasma Universe, “Space
is filled with a network of currents,
which transfer energy and momentum over
large or very large 
distances. The currents
often pinch to filamentary
or surface currents.
The latter are likely to give space, also
interstellar and intergalactic space,
a cellular structure.” Of course, both 
the vast networks of interstellar and
intergalactic filaments, as 
well as the lifelike cellular
structures seen in celestial objects
such as nebulae, are seen in greater
detail with each passing year. And 
as we outlined in a recent episode,
Alfvén also emphasized the extraordinary
cosmic significance of the well-known
electromagnetic mechanism, called 
the Bennett pinch, or the Z-pinch,
the process by which stars form,
rather than gravitational collapse
and accretion. Alfvén's outrageous
prediction that stars form like
”beads on a string” along vast networks of
filaments, is one of many such predictions
confirmed by space discovery.
The evidence for cosmic electric
currents on an even much vaster scale
has grown increasingly undeniable. As we
reported last year, in 2019 
a team of scientists published
their analysis of a vast radio emitting
filament of plasma which stretches across
10 million light years, connecting two
clusters of galaxies
called Abell 399 and Abell 401.
The filament which the scientists
discovered using a low frequency radio
telescope called LOFAR,
also marked the first time scientists
have found a magnetic field connecting
two galactic clusters. The radio emission from
the filament is called synchrotron radiation
which is produced by the tremendous
acceleration of electrons along the filament
at relativistic velocities. As stated 
by astronomer Matteo Murgia,
”We typically observe this emission
mechanism in action in individual
galaxies and even in galaxy clusters,
but never before has a radio emission
been observed connecting
two of these systems.”
A sciencealert.com report
on the discovery states,
”...the electrons are covering way
more distance than is expected -
which means there has to be
another element at play.”
In the aforementioned Quanta Magazine
piece the description of the radio-
emitting magnetic filament
inadvertently confirms the electrical
interpretation. The article 
states that the scientists
”... inferred the presence of a
magnetic field in the filament between
galaxy clusters Abell 399 and Abell
401 from the way the field redirects
high-speed electrons and other
charged particles passing through it.
As their paths twist in the field,
these charged particles release faint
synchrotron radiation.” However, the
scientists seem not to recognize what
this must mean. The release of
“faint synchrotron radiation”,
means the charged particles are losing energy
and thus they cannot continue to radiate
over cosmic distances, unless 
they are continually receiving
electrical energy,
which constitutes an electric current. We
note that as far back as 1992,
Dr. Anthony Peratt of Los Alamos
laboratories, himself a student of
Hannes Alfvén, discussed the evidence for
”supercluster scale” electric currents in his
textbook, Physics of the Plasma Universe.
In the chapter titled, “Currents in the
Intergalactic Medium”
Perratt writes, “One of the most
compelling pieces of evidence for the
existence of supercluster-sized
currents comes from the discovery of
faint supercluster-scale radio emissions at 326
MHz between the Coma cluster of galaxies and
the Abell 1367 cluster.” In Peratt's
view, these intergalactic currents
are spiraling Birkeland cur-
rents which will accelerate
charged particles in circles, which is to
say orthogonal to the current's direction,
which must then generate
synchrotron radiation.
Unfortunately, the scientists cited 
in the Quanta Magazine piece
are exclusively seeking answers in the
so-called “primordial universe”
after the hypothetical Big Bang. The hope
for believers in Big Bang cosmology is
that these answers could resolve the
problem of the apparent
accelerating expansion rate of the universe.
The scientists cited in the Quanta
article examined computer simulations
which attempt to demonstrate the effects
of hypothetical primordial magnetic
fields if they were present before an
epoch called Cosmic Recombination, a
hypothetical period a few hundreds of
thousands of years after the
Big Bang in which charged
electrons and protons first became bound to
form electrically neutral hydrogen atoms.
Their efforts to resolve the so-called
Hubble tension are described
as follows, “Cosmologists calculate how
fast space should be expanding today by
observing ancient light
emitted during recombination.
The light shows a young universe studded
with blobs that formed from sound waves
sloshing around in 
the primordial plasma.”
”If recombination happened earlier than
supposed due to the clumping effect of magnetic
fields, then sound waves
couldn't have propagated as
far beforehand, and the result-
ing blobs would be smaller...”
”The upshot is that smaller blobs mean a
higher inferred cosmic expansion rate -
bringing the inferred rate much closer to
measurements of how fast supernovas
and other astronomical objects
actually seem to be flying apart.” The
question we began this Space News with,
what do scientists actually see
when they gaze into the cosmos?
is especially pertinent here. Of course,
the first assumption the scientists make
is that the Big Bang actually happened.
As we've discussed since the inception
of this series, it was decades ago that 
the renowned astronomer Halton Arp
showed that faint, highly 
redshifted objects like quasars,
are intrinsically faint because of
their youth and not their distance.
Arp and others such as Jeffrey and
Margaret Burbidge categorized
numerous so-called anomalous
objects of very different redshifts
in impossibly close association with
one another. Redshift is an intrinsic
property of distinct galaxies and quasars
and is not due to some modification of
the light on its journey to Earth. In 
other words, cosmic redshift is not a
reliable indicator of an object's distance
and velocity of movement away from an
observer on Earth. This view is compatible
with the Electric Universe antidote to the
so-called “accelerating expanding universe,”
which does not rely on the invention of
dark energy. As Thunderbolt's 
chief science advisor
Wal Thornhill explains in his
analysis of type 1a supernovae,
”...the ‘discovery’ of the acceleration
of the expanding universe,
is an interpretation based on total
ignorance of the real nature of stars
and the ‘standard candle,’
the supernova type 1a.
A supernova type 1a is supposed to
be due to a hypothetical series of
incredible events involving a white
dwarf star. But as I have shown,
a supernova is simply an electrical
explosion of a star that draws its
energy from a galactic circuit....The
‘standard candle’ effect and the light curve
is simply due to the circuit parameters
of galactic transmission lines
which power all stars.” In plasma
cosmology in the Electric Universe,
the universe is of unknown extent and origin
and the electrical nature of both stars
and galaxies along networks
of Birkeland current filaments
does resolve so-called inexplicable cosmic
magnetism. It was many decades ago that
plasma scientists began
reproducing the evolution and form
of galaxies through simple
experiments with electrical discharge.
The aforementioned Anthony Peratt
recreated barred spiral galaxies in
simulations with interacting
twin current filaments
as seen on your screen. Unfortunately,
long ago the belief in the Big Bang
solidified into a quasi-religious
dogma and today institutionalized
science continues to devote
massive resources to promoting and
affirming Big Bang cosmology,
while ignoring the well-developed and
experimentally verified concepts
of plasma cosmology whose
predictive success only grows
with each year. It is ironic
that proponents of the Big Bang look
to mysterious magnetism to save the
untenable hypothesis,
since it is magnetism that is the
clearest indication of the electrical
circuitry pervading the cosmos.
Electric currents generate magnetic
fields and it is only electric currents
that can create the impossibly
well-ordered cosmic-scale
magnetic fields that
astrophysicists detect with
increasing regularity, a 
phenomenon never predicted by
proponents of gravity-centric cosmology.
However, we do see some glimmer of hope
among scientists studying the local
picture in our own solar system
who are willing to infer the electric
currents required for the magnetic
fields in the environment near Earth.
The electric current systems near
our planet are the
subject of the 2018 book,
Electric Currents in Geospace and Beyond.
The American Geophysical Union's Earth
and Space Science News
published a summary of the book
titled Electric Currents in
Outer Space Run the Show.
The summary states bluntly “It is
now understood that outer space is
fundamentally electrical in
nature.” On the challenging
task of measuring electric currents in
space, the authors write, “Since electric
currents are comprised of moving charged
particles, such as ions and electrons,
the most direct way to measure currents
is by probing and counting the
individual particles. Highly 
tuned instruments that fly on
board satellites do exactly that.”
”While particle counting is quite
challenging, as one might expect,
one can also make use of the fact that
electric currents generate a
magnetic field around them,
which in turn can be measured, more easily,
by instruments called magnetometers.
From these magnetic fields one can
then infer using Maxwell's equations
the underlying currents.” And yet
scientists cannot infer what they are
not prepared to look for. As the early 20th
century evangelist Oswald Chambers stated,
”Seeing is never believing;
we interpret what we see
in the light of what we believe.” But no
belief is required to recognize the electrical
nature of the cosmos, but 
rather only a willingness to follow
the line of discovery,
wherever it may lead.

Is General Relativity: A Case Study
in Numerology? Now, I mean that both
facetiously and literally. Because
I'm going to show you today, using
mathematics and numbers, that general
relativity and all it's associated things,
such as black holes and big bangs, are really
nothing other than some kind of numerology.
But that's exactly what the black hole event
horizon has. In fact, they tell us that the
black hole event horizon - the escape
velocity, or the escape speed, of a
black hole at the event horizon - is the
speed of light. That's why nothing can escape.
Really? If the light is traveling
at the speed of light, and that's
the escape speed of light, wouldn't
you expect light to escape? I would!
I'm social scientist and I'm here at this
conference as a sociologist of science,
and as a sociologist in general, I'm
interested in social groups,
and collectivities and communities.
As a sociologist of science,
I'm interested in scientific communities,
and so, I'm interested in you.
Now, I suggested this was a
change of subject matter for
me and that's true, but it's also
misleading because sociology, as I've said,
social groups of communities of collaboration
of collectively held knowledge, of shared
values of the way in which communities
mobilize to maintain and defend their
boundaries of the social determination
of what is acceptable, and what's
unacceptable. And so these are topics common
to pretty much any sociology, including
the sociology of science.
Something happens very similar to this
party example, to the chemical elements
on the Sun, and a certain group of
elements are much more likely to be
found outside the Sun than on the
surface of the Sun. For example, on the
Photosphere, we see about 35 magnesium
atoms for every million hydrogen atoms,
but in the solar wind leaving the Sun
there are four times that many magnesium
atoms. Another example, we see about
47 iron atoms for every million
hydrogen atoms on the photosphere,
but a solar flare might have
a hundred times that much iron.
So, you come and you take a look at a
satellite image of a hurricane on Earth.
And you guys can do this. Just pop on
Google, and type in 'hurricane'. You're
going to see the eye, just like the umbra
on the sunspot. You're going to see the
swirling clouds that we've all come to
know in a hurricane, just like you would
see in the corona on the Sun. But, if you
get to look at one of the new Rapid Scan
images that GOES is taking of the
weather, or you take a look at some of
the hurricane or typhoon images on NOAA's
Environmental Visualization Lab, you will
see that amidst those swirling clouds
you can see lines.
That's about one quarter of the story,
and it's seems strange that they stop there.
Stig Lundqvist who did this model
before me for about 50 years
before I got there, he'd stop there.
Even good old Hannes Alfvén,
where you ask him to draw a
picture of a Birkeland current,
he'd draw you something that looks
like that. That's a very incomplete picture
because you can just think of being
continuing on. Go out to the next little
distance out from the center of this
... what do you think happens, nothing?!
The lure of what we think we know, the
comfort of the accepted wisdom versus
the fear of not knowing. We have to
recognize that this love of certainty is
a very, very innate and undeniable human
attribute. It would be disingenuous, if
not foolhardy, to propose that
there's some group of humans somewhere,
somehow that are somehow immune to,
or above this level of certainty
- it's an integral component
of our collective psyche.
They have now shown that the neutrino
has mass. Now, the very idea that it
didn't have mass meant that it couldn't
have been a real particle, anyway,
because there is no such thing
as a particle with no mass.
The problem then was, that according to the
Standard Model of subatomic particles,
the neutrino doesn't interact with the
'Higgs field', as it's called.
That meant that there was something
seriously wrong with the standard model.
So, what has happened? They've said,
this gives us the opportunity to
modify the standard model,
in other words, please send more money.
It's all moving, right? Nothing ever stops
moving. A gust of wind and a cosmic jet are
manifesting a single power - that's the
world we were given. The objection to
perpetual motion machines is one of
those absurd capitalists parsimonies;
it is no free lunch. It comes from a mindset,
a metaphysics that privileges neutrality,
stability, equilibrium. But what the world
gives us as facts, are polarization,
unstable equilibria, and explosions.
This world is in perpetual motion.
But, of course, you don't always have to
stay in that position, you become
a tenured professor at some point, and you
can push out and innovative. And, if that
were not the case, there would be no new
science. So, somehow it does happen that
new science does get developed. People
that are radicals in their field are able
to do something about their radicalness
- they are able to take bold steps.
There's not just rigor in the choice of
statistic. Not just rigor in the kinds of 
designs that we use. It's not just rigor
even in the language of how we write about
interpretations and alternative explanations,
and limitations of experimental design, in
formal scientific papers that we write.
We are told to stick closely to the data
and not let our emotions, or even our humor,
get in the way. And that, I think, is the
single biggest problem in physics today
is that we worship the discipline of
mathematics as science, and it's not.
It's an important adjunct and a tool.
It's a kind of shorthand describing what
we observe, and then you can manipulate
the symbols to try and get more
information from that data. But it's rather
like handing over the control of a company
to the typing pool, the shorthand readers.
Very few people can read shorthand, and
very few people can read all of those
mathematical runes on the blackboards.
In fact, it's become a cliché for 'genius'.
So, we accept it's breakthrough
one crack in the door at a time.
It is working, if you actually follow
what's going on as our communication
with real scientists, feet
on the ground researchers.
You'll see that,
give us a hearing personally,
give us an opportunity to just
engage you on the basis of fact,
and implications of fact, the EU material
is very persuasive with people.

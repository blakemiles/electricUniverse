You've just entered the
theater of an alien sky.
If the words and images seem strange
to you, there's a reason for this.
Our world was once a
vastly different place.
To experience this won't hurt you
and there is nothing to fear.
Invitation to Jordan Peterson
Tonight's talk, this is the most popular
talk we've ever done in 15 years.
Please welcome one of the world's great
public intellectuals, Jordan Peterson!
Well, that was nice.
It's not surprising that we've been asked
to comment on the YouTube presence
of Canadian psychologist
Jordan Peterson.
It seems his star rose spectacularly
after a record-setting interview
with Britain's Channel
4 host Kathy Newman.
Posted on YouTube in January, the interview
attracted over 11 million views
in about six months
with an overwhelmingly
positive rating,
not to mention the multitude of repostings
of the same or similar material
garnering up to a
million views each.
Prior to this remarkable turn, there
was little to distinguish Peterson
from other qualified
presenters on YouTube.
But now when Peterson gives public
presentations auditoriums sell out.
Just one cautionary
note is required here.
Though Peterson is most definitely not
an evangelist for any religious view,
he does single out the dominant religion
of the Western world, Christianity,
as an indispensable
force in our culture.
And he frequently states his personal
view that civilization would collapse
were a culture to fully abandon
its broad religious heritage.
Due to the diversity of people
contributing to the Thunderbolts Project,
we've avoided contemporary
politics and religion
when discussing the
Electric Universe movement.
After many years of observing this rule, we
can now say that without this constraint
the Thunderbolts Project
could never have emerged
as the most popular internet voice
of the Electric Universe idea.
So we've asked ourselves how to
respond to our own supporters
urging us to take up
Peterson and his work.
The answer has come from looking more closely
at how he acquired his current perspective.
His academic training placed an
emphasis on the mythic archetypes,
the deepest structures of human
thought in ancient times
echoing across all
of human history
and continuing to
influence our world today.
By their cultural impact,
Peterson observes,
the archetypes have provided
guidelines to humanity
inspiring people to live productively
and responsibly in the world.
Though we don't have an answer to offer on
contemporary religious and political questions,
we've noted that Peterson's
historic subject matter
is pretty close to that
of psychologist Carl Jung
who saw in the world's great myths a
repeated presence of certain first forms
evident in the early expressions
of human consciousness.
By archetypes Jung meant deeply
embedded recurrent patterns
of sacred beliefs and
practices the world over.
Bringing the ancient mythic and
symbolic structures to light
became the first priority in Jung's
approach to human psychology.
So we see in Peterson's presentations
a clearly stated respect for Jung
and for such comparative
mythologists as Joseph Campbell.
And it's worth emphasizing that
most comparative mythology
does not require a student
of ancient history
to know how an archetype arose.
What really counts, they would say,
is the archetype's cultural function.
One discerns its role as the culture
strives to affirm its own identity
in a changing world.
But for us, there is also a deeper
level of analysis available,
one almost never expressed in popular
treatments of the archetypes.
Our claim is that the real
obstacle to deeper insight
is the one that prevents an investigator from
seeing what will ultimately become obvious.
The archetypes did not originate
in today's natural world
nor did they emerge
from a vacuum.
They arose as the
effect of a prior cause.
A prior cause within a natural order
that disappeared thousands of years ago.
If we're correct in this
fundamental conclusion,
just imagine the scale of the disconnect when
trying to comprehend the ancient archetypes
in terms of familiar
natural experience today.
All we'll have available to us are the
later projections of mythic themes
onto fragments of
the natural world
while the original provocation
remains forever elusive.
Well the remarkable truth is that by following
rational ground rules for comparative analysis,
hundreds of archetypes can
be reliably identified
and not just by their
own essential qualities
but by seeing them in terms of
origin and timeless significance.
All archetypes have a direct connection
to an extraordinary natural experience
and all are inseparably
connected to each other
with no more than two or three degrees
of separation between any of them.
With this specificity in
front of us, we can assure
anyone coming into this
discussion for the first time
that the answers given will not
allow us to simply perpetuate
modern-day interpretations
of ancient myths and symbols.
And so we've stated our conclusion
emphatically and repeatedly
that the archetypes point
back to a former time.
And the most persuasive answer requires the
clearest connection between cause and effect
as the cause itself becomes
logically inescapable.
That's it, we will then say.
But next comes the greatest challenge
arising from a vast field of evidence,
confirming that each and every
archetype arose explosively
in response to earth-shaking
and mind-altering events.
To many newcomers that proposed
cause will seem preposterous.
Yet after decades of
systematic research,
we have never found any other
plausible cause of a single archetype.
And that means no justification
for ignoring the cause
that fits the evidence precisely.
For those close to The
Thunderbolts Project,
the greatest surprise has come from the
predictive ability of the reconstruction offered.
What one would expect to find within
the framework proposed, one does find.
In this regard, it seems that Jordan
Peterson himself has delivered to us
several examples
well worth exploring.
In number 7 of his Maps of Meaning
series he takes up what some have called
The Consilience Test for assessing
the overall integrity of an idea.
That test becomes
particularly useful
when a novel idea reaches across multiple
layers or patterns of fact, he states.
Of course, we've drawn
on this very principle
when we proposed what we've called the acid
test of the historic polar configuration --
the centerpiece of
our reconstruction.
Do the mythic archetypes
become predictable
when seen from the perspective
of this evolving configuration?
Our claim has been that hundreds of
archetypes meet the acid tests unequivocally.
A level of specificity that could
not be possible by cherry-picking.
When comparing our claims to
Peterson's tests of consilience,
one difference should be noted
and this difference shows up in virtually all
comparative studies of the mythic archetypes.
The more familiar studies, such as the
highly popular work of Joseph Campbell,
invariably stop short of anything
that could be called an explanation.
While describing
undeniable patterns,
they do not penetrate to a
proposed origin or first cause.
The archetypes are simply there as a
profound influence on human conduct
and cultural evolution over time.
But this is where our challenge to today's
most pervasive scientific illusion
enters the picture.
The illusion that we've called
the uniformity principle.
Others have called
it uniformitarianism.
The uniformity principle suggests to
astronomers and planetary scientists
that they can retro-calculate the
position of any planet in the ancient sky
at any historical juncture based
on today's planetary motions.
They will not realize that in
the 19th and 20th centuries,
this disregard for
ancient testimony
was the greatest mistake
of modern science.
A mistake that continues to echo through
all of the scientific disciplines today.
Of course when living in
the shadow of this mistake,
the very idea of Earth-
altering events in the past
will appear preposterous.
But allow the ancient
witnesses to speak
and a vastly different
sky will reveal itself.
We've proposed that all
of world mythology,
all of the enchanting stories and symbols and
commemorative practices that have come down to us
are explained by an ancient
gathering of planets close to Earth.
We make that claim based
on global evidence.
Yes, in innumerable instances
evidence is remarkably explicit,
but explicit will not mean obvious
to a person looking somewhere else.
No one could explain or has
ever explained the archetypes
in the absence of an
extraordinary human experience.
And that's the historical truth we'll
continue to highlight in these Discourses.
It's also why we
invite Jordan Peterson
who's contributed so much to public
discussion of the archetypes,
to join us in a common exploration of
first causes and their implications.
Few sciences or social sciences
could possibly escape the effects
that followed from the most fundamental
theoretical error in our time.

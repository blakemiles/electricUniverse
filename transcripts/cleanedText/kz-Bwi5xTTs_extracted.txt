Welcome to Space News from
the Electric Universe,

A discussion with Wal Thornhill on the 
"accelerating expansion of the Universe."
A few weeks ago, a
new scientific study
based on data from the Hubble
Space Telescope was published
which affirms what many other
papers have reported in recent years
and that is that the so-called
expansion of the universe,
after the hypothetical Big Bang
explosion, appears to be accelerating
much too quickly to explain
through any kind of known physics.
Now, of course it was decades
ago that scientists on Earth
first noticed this
kind of discordant data,
while this problem led to the
invention of a new type of energy
― called dark energy ― which we are now
told, composes about 75% of the universe.
Well as we've reported previously
many times on Space News,
even taking into account the
invention of dark energy's influence,
the Hubble data has only
deepened the problem.
There is a discordance between the apparent
expansion rate of the so-called early universe
and the later universe.
Let me briefly read to you from a
phys.org report on these findings,
"This discrepancy has been identified in
scientific papers over the last several years,
but it's been unclear whether the differences
in measurement techniques are to blame,
or whether the difference could
result from unlucky measurements.
The latest Hubble data lower the possibility
that the discrepancy is only a fluke
to 1 in 100,000.
This is a significant gain from an
earlier estimate, less than a year ago,
of a chance of 1 in 3,000.
These most precise Hubble
measurements to date
bolster the idea that new physics may
be needed to explain the mismatch."
Now as members of the electric
universe community have always known,
Plasma Cosmology in the Electric
Universe have always proposed
that there was no Big Bang.
The overriding issue in astrophysics
is not just the raw data
gleaned by telescopes
and by spacecraft,
but rather how is
that data interpreted.
In fact, Plasma Cosmology and the Electric
Universe have challenged the underpinnings
of astrophysicists' methods of assessing
the age and distance of celestial objects.
Objects that appear very
distant and very bright
and thus very huge, could actually
be very close and very faint.
And there is an abundant body of credible
scientific evidence that this is indeed the case.
So today we're going to
discuss all of this, and more,
with the chief science advisor to The
Thunderbolts Project, Wal Thornhill.
Wal, why don't you begin by sharing
what the official NASA report
on this new Hubble data says,
and what your thoughts are.
The NASA report dated
April 26, this year, states,
"Astronomers using NASA's
Hubble Space Telescope
say they have crossed an important
threshold in revealing a discrepancy
between the two key techniques for
measuring the universe's expansion rate.
The recent study strengthens
the case that new theories
may be needed to explain the forces
that have shaped the cosmos."
They go on to say,
"...scientists have run into
an intriguing difference
between what they predict
and what they observe."
But this has been a pattern
throughout the Space Age,
and the basic
problem boils down to
the origin of the Big Bang Theory and
their notion of an expanding universe.
Now science is a cultural
activity and unfortunately,
students are not taught the
historical context to any degree,
which gives them some idea where
these original ideas came from.
But fundamentally, the Big Bang
Theory is a direct outgrowth of the
dominant cultural Western
Judeo-Christian religion myths
and as a result, it had to
have its own creation story.
This is a feature of
all cultures on Earth
that they have their
individual creation stories.
None of it has been understood
until recently by some scholars
who had not been recognized,
but the fact is that the
story that has been concocted
has no more anything
to do with science
than the books relating the
creation myths globally.
In fact, it's only by understanding the
origin of those global creation myths
that you understand
the universe,
because they are trying to tell us something
that we desperately need to understand.
Well Wal, it's interesting that
one of the most common comments
we receive in
response to Space News,
is from viewers stating that
they can no longer stand
to watch any mainstream documentaries
or TV shows on cosmology
because they're just too painfully aware
that a more promising alternative exists
with no acknowledgment from
celebrity science personalities.
When it comes to
the Big Bang Theory,
to me it does seem incredible
that we still see this posture
that it remains the best and most plausible
story of the origins of the universe,
despite its intractable problems which
only continue to grow with discovery.
So if I were to ask a cosmologist, why he or
she still believes in the Big Bang Theory,
in your opinion, what response
would I be likely to get?
I find it difficult to
watch science programs
particularly those based
around cosmology these days,
because so many so-called facts are
presented which are not facts at all
but merely conjectures.
The idea of the expanding
universe was picked up by Einstein
who thought it was a
very neat idea, it seems,
and of course it gave him room to produce his
own theory of the expansion of the universe
involving his gravitational theory
and that was picked up by Eddington.
And Eddington, who
was also a Quaker,
and had strong religious views
associated with his science
was the one who championed
Einstein's ideas.
In fact if it wasn't for Eddington,
Einstein may have withered on the vine,
because his papers, as
they are presented now,
would not pass
peer-review these days.
The expansion of the universe
is based on Hubble's work
and of course, they say that he
discovered the expansion of the universe
through his measurements of
redshifts of distance galaxies.
But that's not correct.
His view was that the expansion
idea was the least likely
answer to this discovery of the
redshift-distance relationship,
and that there would be
some new physics involved.
But no one ever tells you that, so
we now have the Hubble telescope
in honor of this
so-called discovery,
and I'm sure he'd be
spinning in his grave
if he heard the sorts of things that are
attributed to his research these days.
The very idea of the expansion
of the universe makes no sense,
because we understand
space in three dimensions,
and it is a concept of
locations in three dimensions.
There is nothing about space, physical, which
can be expanded or contracted or twisted.
It is merely a mathematical
concept by adding extra dimensions.
What has to be made clear is that the
dimensions that are used in mathematics
have nothing necessarily to do
with the three physical dimensions,
we both observe and
existing in this universe.
Those dimensions are merely
degrees of freedom
and those degrees of
freedom; the more they add,
the more dimensions they add,
the more freedom they have, the
mathematicians, to invent whatever they like.
And this is what's happened.
Well as I alluded to in my opening, one of
the things that physicists have invented
in response to unexpected
discovery is dark energy.
But as I also alluded to, the whole
idea of an expanding universe
depends on the validity of the
redshift equals distance assumption.
We've talked many times
about the importance
of the late astronomer Halton
Arp's research into that question.
So why don't you
explain the reasoning,
why an expanding universe is actually not
necessary in light of science discovery?
The NASA
report states,
"...measurements of the galaxies' light that reddens
as it passes through a stretching universe."
But of course, the idea of a
stretching universe is non-physical
and makes no physical sense.
"The reddening is used to calculate
how fast the cosmos expands with time,
a value known as the
Hubble constant."
But Halton Arp, the notable astronomer
who was dubbed the modern-day Galileo,
because those who believed in the
Big Bang refused to look at his data,
said that he had discovered
that the light from these highly redshifted
objects occurs in discrete values,
which means that there was something
going on in the matter within the quasar,
and not with space.
But of course, this is one reason
why his work was not looked at
and Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar
even scribbled across
the top of his submitted paper,
which was rejected of course,
'this exceeds my imagination' and for that
very reason should have been published.
So then we read in the report,
"The Hubble tension between
the early and late universe
may be the most exciting
development in cosmology in decades,"
said lead researcher and Nobel laureate Adam
Riess of the Space Telescope Science Institute
and Johns Hopkins University,
in Baltimore, Maryland.
He goes on to say,
"This mismatch has been growing
and has now reached a point that is
really impossible to dismiss as a fluke.
This disparity could not
plausibly occur just by chance."
In other words this is
saying, just send more money!
And then we can invent more unobservable
particles and mysterious energies.
No one at any stage in any of this has
suggested that we go back and have a look
at the origins of the notion that
Einstein's theory of gravity
actually explains what
we see in deep space.
Because the simple answer
to that is, it doesn't.
Galaxies do not behave or rotate
as if they're responding to gravity.
What's more, Einstein's theory did
away with the force of gravity.
So you've got
to ask the question,
what is it that I feel when I hit the
ground when I'm not supposed to be falling?
There are so many problems with
Einstein's view of the universe,
it's amazing that people have
actually taken it seriously.
And I would suggest that more people
have read about his theory of relativity,
and fewer people have understood
anything at the end of it
than any other
book on any shelf.
The reasons for this I can point out is,
that the idea that all of his observers are
equivalent and have inertial frames of
references that are equivalent, cannot be so.
Because, as Newton found
with his bucket experiment,
it seems that the water
in his rotating bucket was
aware of the matter in
the rest of the universe.
In other words, if the rest of the
universe was rotating around that bucket,
and the bucket was stationary, the water
would rise just as it was seen by Newton.
And he understood that,
but somewhere along the line
people have forgotten that,
and in the days of classical physics
when real physics was being done,
it was recognized that there had to be
a connection between the matter on Earth,
and the matter in the rest of the universe
which is referred to as the fixed stars.
But that's been lost, and as a result we can
no longer define mass, length, time, energy.
None of these things are defined
in any physically sensible manner.
It requires that we set
the context for physics,
otherwise you
stop doing physics.
The report continues,
"In this new study, astronomers used
Hubble to observe 70 pulsating stars
called Cepheid variables in
the Large Magellanic Cloud.
A special class of pulsating
star called a Cepheid variable,
which brightens and dims at a predictable rate
that corresponds to its intrinsic brightness.
Once astronomers determine that value,
they can measure the light from these stars
to calculate an accurate
distance to the galaxy."
Now this behavior, a Cepheid variable
relies on an extremely complex model
that has never been tested.
It is far simpler to explain both the change
in period and the brightness of a star
by an electrical
model of the star
which modulates both the apparent size and the
brightness of a star's photosphere together.
It should be pointed out that,
the standard gas model of stars
has so many special conditions
and assumptions built-in
that it could be tweaked to
reproduce almost any observations.
I should note that a Cepheid variable
is a type of star that pulsates radially
varying in both
diameter and temperature
and producing changes in brightness with a
well defined of stable period and amplitude.
A strong direct relationship between
a Cepheid variable's luminosity
and pulsation period established them as
important indicators of cosmic benchmarks
for scaling galactic and
extragalactic distances.
As for the Large Magellanic Cloud, it's
a member of our local Group of galaxies.
It's only 180,000
light-years away,
the second closest galaxy
to us in the Milky Way.
It has a low redshift interpreted as
a velocity away from us, of 278 km/s.
You put it in terms
of the redshift z,
it's about .001 which is
probably a true Doppler shift.
But you cannot simply assume the high
redshift of the more distant galaxies
is due entirely to the Doppler
effect of the velocity away from us.
There is this assumption that the
Cepheid variables will be operating
under the same conditions in
distant galaxies at high redshift.
The Electric Universe suggests that the fact
that these objects are highly redshifted
shows that the energy
contained within those objects,
and therefore the masses of the
protons and electrons in the atoms,
will be different.
They will be lighter and the frequencies,
the energy being emitted will be lower,
which gives you, in
effect, redshift.
What's more, being an atomic
phenomenon it will be quantized.
And yet this hasn't been
recognized, it's quite remarkable.
That means that you cannot use Cepheid
variables simply as a distance measurement,
because any redshift involved
must also take into account
possible quantized redshift which is
intrinsic and not Doppler shift.
When Halton Arp did that, he figured
that the universe appeared to be static,
which was a puzzle,
if you just assumed that the
universe was operating gravitationally
because the whole thing
should collapse inwards.
But he found that this meant that
gravity must also be a balanced force
that can repel as
well as attract,
and this was the puzzle that the Electric
Universe set out to solve some time ago.

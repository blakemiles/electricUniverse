Our celestial neighbour,
the planet Mars.
Astronomers once considered Mars to be a long
barren and geologically dead rock in space.
But since the arrival of our
probes beginning in the 1960s,
the planet has
come alive for us.
It does not reveal the inactive
and worn down landscape
astronomers and planetary
scientists had expected.
Nevertheless, investigators continued
to apply geologic concepts
based on their understanding
of the Earth and the Moon.
They could only see volcanism, erosion,
surface movement and surface collapse,
all punctuated by episodic impacts
from space over billions of years.
What force created the sharply cut gouges
and depressions across the surface of Mars,
looking as if a giant trowel
descended to scoop out material,
at radically different and
irreconcilable depths.
Running north to south, we see massive
interwoven scratches or grooves
extending hundreds of miles.
And how remarkable that a planet
only half the diameter of Earth
exhibits canyons on a scale dwarfing
anything seen on our own planet.
And mountains that would
tower over Mount Everest.
Today, no planet outside the Earth has
received more attention than Mars,
but the mysteries and theoretical
contradictions have grown spectacularly.
For decades now,
investigators have wondered
why the two hemispheres of Mars look as
if they were formed in different worlds.
A southern hemisphere
dominated by craters,
a northern hemisphere with only
sparsely scattered craters.
And note, the contrasting crustal
depths of the two hemispheres.
Shallow crust in the North, much
thicker crust in the South.
Why would a planet evolving in isolation
display such a profound dichotomy?
It's as if, some unknown force excavated
the northern crust miles deep.
The hemispheric removal
of crustal material
requires a force external to
Mars, acting on the planet.
But when it comes
to external events
scientific convention has
only one thing to work with:
random collisions.
Could a planetoid or huge
asteroid crashing into Mars
have removed millions of
cubic miles of crust?
A shattering impact
is all that theory would allow.
But what would Martian
history look like
were we to include
electrical events?
Events on a scale sufficient to sculpt the
surface of the Red Planet from pole to pole.
Of all the enigmatic
features in the solar system
perhaps none provokes
greater amazement
than Valles Marineris.
The largest canyon on
any planet or moon,
the deep trench complex stretches a
third of the way around the planet,
hundreds of times larger
than the Grand Canyon.
It would reach from San Francisco
to New York and beyond.
Prior theory of planet formation had never
anticipated such a chasm on a small planet.
What natural force excavated
this colossal trench?
With the arrival of
the Mariner probes,
NASA scientists thought the chasm
could have been cut by water erosion,
though nothing even close was ever achieved
by water on the known watery planet Earth.
In any erosional hypothesis, three million
cubic miles of material were removed.
3,000,000 cubic miles! And
it had to go somewhere.
Neither the means of fluid drainage, nor
the vast outflow required are in evidence.
Now, we know that Valles Marineris
reaches to a greater depth
than any outflow channel
originally envisioned.
And the tributaries
imagined by some
turned out to be cleanly cut
alcoves and stubby depressions.
They are not connected to
feeder streams at all.
One portion of the Valles Marineris system,
in particular, underscores our point here.
Planetary scientists acknowledge that Hebes
Canyon,
much larger than our Grand Canyon, is an
inseparable part of Valles Marineris.
The scientists have now acknowledged
it was certainly not created by water.
Hebes Chasma: "a fairly large canyon in the Valles Marineris
complex that has absolutely no inlet or outlet on the surface."
Nor is it plausible to suggest
that surface spreading
created the massive caisson
of Valles Marineris
with its repeated morphology
of sharply scalloped walls.
The surface
was not torn, it was carved
and the detailed images
imply a removal of material
along the entire
length of the chasm,
a process clearly illustrated by the
neatly machined so-called tributaries
all the way up to their rounded,
cleanly cut terminations.
Whatever formed the canyon complex could not
stop at the margins of the primary channel,
but added irregular craters and crater
chains, and surface grooves and gouges.
So, the question can
not be escaped.
Is there anything known
to science today
that can account for the
extraordinary profile
of Valles Marineris?
There is an explanation
well-known to science
though it's never entered
the geologist's lexicon.
Lightning!
In the plasma laboratory,
it's power is demonstrated
in electric discharge
experiments.
But the form unfamiliar to conventional
science today is the cosmic thunderbolt.
It was the brilliant engineer Ralph
Juergens, who first suggested decades ago,
that cosmic thunderbolts
carved Valles Marineris.
"..This entire region resembles nothing so much
as an area zapped by a powerful electric arc
advancing unsteadily across the surface..."
With the benefit of
more recent data,
electrical theorist Wallace Thornhill
returned to this extraordinary possibility.
"Valles Marineris was created within minutes by a giant
electric arc sweeping across the surface of Mars...
...Rock and soil were lifted into space and some fell
back to create the great, strewn fields of boulders
first seen by the Viking and Pathfinder landers."
Yes, the electric hypothesis
will unnerve many scientists
but it is the only hypothesis that
meets the test of direct observation.
Here is a scar left by an electric
arc on a piece of wet wood.
Electric discharge provides a direct and
complete explanation for the Valles Marineris.
The so-called tributaries of the valley were
cut by secondary streamers of the discharge.
That is a typical signature of an electric
arc when it cuts a surface channel.
And here is the scar from electric
discharge to an insulator.
Notice in particular the network of
secondary streamers to the left;
a perfect counterpart to the
western edge of Valles Marineris.
It was long held that this
remarkable region on Mars
was the result of uplift,
fracturing and spreading.
And from a distance, it
did look like fracturing.
But with a closer view in front of us, it is
simply irrational to cling to that interpretation.
Material has been cleanly removed, exactly
as in the discharging to the insulator.
The evidence now available
demands a new perspective,
a larger field of view.
In Thornhill's interpretation,
the discharge took the
form of a plasmoid,
not unlike the plasmoid from which
the spiral galaxy is formed.
Plasmoid simulation
On his website, Thornhill noted
how the discharge effect
spiraled upward to the East
and downward to the West,
an effect that shows up quite clearly on
the elevation map given on his website.
In fact, if we extend the
view of the elevation map,
we see an even larger effect.
It seems that the spiraling trails to the
East and West nearly completed two circles
as they swung back to
the trench itself.
But one difference between the northern
and the southern extension stands out.
The northern extension is entirely
constituted of ravines and depressions,
while the southern extension consists
of ridges and mountainous terrain.
For this unusual contrast, electrical
experiments offer a startling explanation.
It was George Christoph Lichtenberg
who in the 18th century first showed
that electric arcs create ravine networks
on more negatively charged surfaces
and elevated ridges on more
positively charged surfaces.
Could it be that simple?
...that a cosmic thunderbolt
carving Valles Marineris
acted on two regions of different charge,
negative to the north and positive to the south?
If such was the case, the only plausible
cause of the charge differential
would be an electrical exchange between
Mars and other charged bodies in the past.
And what was the relationship of these
events to the hemispheric dichotomies,
the removal of crustal material to the North
and the densely cratered southern hemisphere?
In the electrical interpretation, the violent
excavation of the surface to create Valles Marineris
would have created immense deposits of
sediment on surrounding topography.
And indeed, we see that previous craters
in the region were completely buried,
with only the largest craters appearing as
outlines penetrating through the deep deposits.
It's apparent that the released
material had a net drift to the West,
since the blanket of deposited sediment
stretches all the way to the eastern flank
of the towering Olympus Mons.
Keep in mind as well that
an electric discharge
at energies necessary to create
the chasms of Valles Marineris
would have ejected great volumes
of rocky material into space.
Much of the rocky debris would have fallen
back to litter the Martian landscape.
And indeed, shattered rock of all sizes across
the surface of Mars is a long-standing mystery.
And the mystery is resolved by electrical events
on a continental and even hemispheric scale.
Given the energies of the events
considerable volumes of material would
have surely escaped the planet altogether.
And what might this tell us
about the Mars-Earth connection
in our reconstruction
of ancient events?
Or the surprising discovery that rocks
from Mars have fallen on our own planet?
When Meteorites Fell from Mars
One of the great surprises
of the Space Age
was the discovery that certain meteorites
had arrived from the planet Mars!
Initially, most scientists
rejected the idea outright.
For rock to escape
Martian gravity,
they could only imagine
an asteroidal impact
blasting rock into space at more
than three miles per second!
That is five times the muzzle
velocity of a hunting rifle.
The energies would either
pulverize or vaporize the rock.
But the question was eventually settled by
gases trapped inside a suspect meteorite.
The gases bore the atmospheric
signature of Mars.
Martian meteorite
"The trapped gases match these that Viking
measured in the martian atmosphere."
By 2003, at least 30 meteorites
had been identified as Martian.
But how could the removal of rock from
the Martian surface have occurred?
Planetary scientists began
to offer exotic speculations
based on mathematical models.
No one seems to have wondered if
the vast debris fields of Mars
might point the
way to discovery.
Even the smaller rocks viewed here from
space would weigh tons on the Earth.
We have proposed that in a former
epoch of planetary instability
electric discharge excavated the
Martian surface miles deep,
throwing massive quantities
of rock into space.
This would mean that most of the
Martian rocks reaching Earth
would have come from
well below the surface
and would not even bear the
atmospheric signature of the planet.
So, it is not unreasonable to suspect that
the planet Mars was not a small contributor
... but the greatest contributor to meteoric
bombardment of Earth in ancient times!
On this question, ancient testimony
holds a surprising answer!
Worldwide accounts describe
apocalyptic wars of the gods
punctuated by lightning
and falling stone!
Rocks from space falling on the Earth have no
connection to lightning and thunder in our own time,
but the ancient
connection is clear.
In many different languages meteorites and
exotic rocks were called thunderstones,
or thundereggs,
said to have fallen in the
great wars of the gods.
It seems that the answer lies with
the worlds first astronomers.
They insisted the
rocks from space
were hurled by the warring
thundergod, the planet Mars.
"The ancient Babylonians specifically referred
to meteorites falling from the planet Mars."
"You hurl the towering stone...
You hurl the stone in fury."
From one land to another ancient sky
worshipers celebrated the planet Mars
as the cosmic prototype
for the warrior on Earth.
It seems that rocks
encircling Mars,
when Mars loomed
huge in the heavens,
appeared as a fiery
retinue of warriors
with ablazing countenance.
The terrifying Maruts
of Hindu literature
derived from the same Indo-European
root as the Latin Mars.
They are the sons and
companians of the Hindu Rudra,
"the Red One"
who could hardly be
other than Mars itself.
The Marutas hurled in the heavens
bringing blasts of fire,
of lightning and falling stone.
"The glittering army..."
"Armed with lightning spears..."
Babylonian astronomical
traditions
declared precisely the same thing
of Nergal, the planet Mars.
"Raging demons with awesome numbers
run at his right and at his left"
the texts say.
In the same way, the classical poet
described the dwelling of the Greek Ares,
the Roman Mars,
ringed by a thousand Furies.
Just as a horde of Berserkers,
or the furious Valkyries,
accompanied the devine warriors in archaic
traditions of Germany and Scandinavia.
Phobos
For many years, our claim has been
that catastrophic electrical exchanges
between Mars and other
planets at close range
removed immense volumes of rock, dust and
debris from the surface of the Red Planet.
But now planetary scientists
face an additional challenge.
The surface of the
Martian moon Phobos
reveals a chemistry very close
to that of Mars itself.
Scientists now say that Phobos is not the
captured asteroid that they have once thought.
Like the meteorites from Mars,
even this moon seems to
be composed of material
blasted from the
planet's surface.
"Observations from Phobos appear to match the types
of minerals identified on the surface of Mars."
"This moon might itself have originated from material
thrown into orbit from the Martian surface."
Theorists envision rocky debris orbiting
Mars after a major impact event,
then gradually accreting
into the observed moon.
But, it is surely more likely
that collisions of rocks in orbit
would progressively wear them down
not create a moon...
The idea of gravitational accretion
followed by meteoric impact
is, in fact, contradicted by the most
visible surface features of Phobos.
Imagine the secondary collision
that impact theories required in order
to create the gigantic Stickney crater
5.6 miles (9.01km) in diameter,
almost half the
diameter of Phobos
along the axis of the
supposed impact.
The trivial gravity of the moon could never
hold together a loose collection of rocks
experiencing such an event.
Parallel channels and crater
chains running in every direction.
Is it a coincidence that everything required
to fuse material in the implied way...
has already been demonstrated by
electric arcs in the laboratory?
Pinching material into
spherical shapes -
the same electric force that produces
parallel channels and crater chains.
Electric arc experiments
It should not surprise us that a body
fused electrically into a rough sphere
would continue to attract
the surrounding dust
created by the prior catastrophic
events on the Martian surface.
But no popular theory has explained how
Phobos acquired a surface layer of dust
or fine grain estimated
at a hundred meters deep.
Even moderate vibrations
created by the larger
supposed impacts
would immediately have propelled
collected dust grains back into space
due to the rock's
minuscule gravity.
Enhanced colors suggest
electrical sorting of dust
The available evidence points directly to
the very center piece of ancient fears
... the cosmic thunderbolt ...
and the ancient story of the
great warrior in the heavens
of his raging companions
and of hurled stone
does not end here.
Scarface
No surface feature on any
body in the solar system
is more recognizable than the
great scar of Valles Marineris.
And it appears, that ancient nations preserved
the story about this memorable scar.
The scarred face of
the Aztec god Xipe,
the celestial model of
the devoted warrior,
is not easily forgotten.
And many cultures recall a
legendary warrior or giant
recognized by his
distinctive scar.
But could this scared god really
have been the planet Mars?
Scarface was the name of a
legendary Blackfoot indian warrior
also called Star Boy.
His counterpart among the Pawnee was
the great warrior named Morning Star
not Venus they say,
but the planet Mars.
The Greek Ares personified
the lightning weapon
and the Greeks identified
the god as the planet Mars.
When wounded in battle he rushed to Zeus
with the shout of a thousand warriors
to display the deep gash.
In the different cultures, the warring god appears
alternately as a hero vanquishing chaos monsters
and a rogue warrior
or dark power.
We see the two aspects of the warrior
archetype in the Hindu Indra,
famed for the
cosmic thunderbolt.
And the giant Ravana,
who is said to have been permanently
scarred by the thunderbolt.
Greek poets knew the monster Typhon
as the owner of a lightning weapon
but also as the
lightning scarred god.
And the same is true of
the giant Enceladus,
alternately said to have been
scarred by the thunderbolt of Zeus
or the spear of Athena,
which meant the same thing.
We have good reason
to ask, therefore,
if the scar-faced theme derived
from remembered events
when planetary gods waged
battles in the sky
and the planet Mars acquired
it's unforgettable wound.
Olympus Mons
In it's sheer size the towering
Martian mountain Olympus Mons
dwarfs anything seen on Earth.
The great mound on the Tharsis
Rise stunned planetary scientists
as it rose through a dust cloud to
greet the Mariner 9 mission in 1972.
Almost as flat as a pancake,
Olympus Mons is three times
the height of Mount Everest
and as wide as the
entire State of Arizona!
From its discovery onward,
planetary scientists interpreted Olympus
Mons as a classic shield volcano,
comparing it to the great shield
volcanos of the Hawaiian islands.
But, Olympus Mons is as large as the
entire Hawaiian island chain of mountains,
from the sea floor
to their summits.
Numerous features distinguish it
from any shield volcano on Earth.
It's steep scarp rises up
to 4 miles (6.43km) high.
No shield volcano offers a
counterpart to this towering cliff.
(Belknap Shield Volcano) The
defining feature of a shield volcano
is the gentle extrusion of
fluid or low viscosity lava.
Shield volcanoes do
not present a scarp
and a scarp 4 miles high is
simply out of the question.
"The scarp is of unknown origin."
"This steep cliff around Olympus Mons is peculiar and
not characteristic of terrestrial shield volcanoes."
In fact, one engima after another
leaps out at the observer.
A blanket of incredibly fine,
filamentary ridges and ravines,
a surrounding aureole,
exhibiting sharply cut
ridges and channels
and stupendous carved blocks.
"The origin of the deposits has challenged planetary
scientists for an explanation for dacades."
Subsequent to its formation,
much of the aureole to the East
was apparently buried by equally
enigmatic activity in the region.
Indeed, the Tharsis Rise as a
whole is a long-standing enigma,
2,500 miles (4,023 km) across and
more than 6 miles (9.65km) high.
A vast bulge of this sort has no place in the
standard evolution of an isolated planet.
"The origin of the Tharsis
Rise is not well understood."
Planetary scientists
still debate the enigma,
but if Mars formerly engaged other
charged bodies at close range,
the great bulge is the very
deformation we would expect.
We have claimed that the surface of
Mars was sculpted by electric discharge
in an epoch of solar system
instability and planetary violence.
Yes, this is an outrageous idea,
but Olympus Mons itself has all the
characteristics of a lightning blister.
Such raised bell-shaped blisters can be
found on the caps of lightning arrestors
after a cloud to ground strike.
And we find them in other
natural settings as well,
they're elevated fulgarites, what
some have called fulgamites.
The discharge that creates
raised fulgurites
is often followed by lesser strokes
along the same ionized path
creating overlapping pits on
the top of the formation,
just like the circular craters
on the summit of Olympus Mons.
On the Martian mountain the smaller
craters center on the walls of the larger
and are cut to a greater depths,
as if with a cookie cutter.
The material that forms the raised fulgarite
is scavenged from the surrounding surface.
The result is an encircling
depression or moat.
This characteristic is so clear and obvious
as to raise an critical question...
Is there a moat around the
base of Olympus Mons?
Planetary scientists
say there is a moat,
but that its remains are only
slightly visible to the West
and the rest of the moat had been buried by later
deposits of material who's origin is still debated.
They explain the moat as being
an effect of Olympus Mons
sinking into the local terrain
over long spans of time.
But is another
explanation possible?
The features of Olympus
Mons are, in fact,
a perfect fit to an electrical
interpretation down to numerous details.
Several years ago, Wal Thornhill
conducted a laboratory experiment
to demonstrate the effect
of an electric arc
on a positively charged,
or anode clay surface.
At moderate power, the electric arc raised a
circular mound from the surrounding material
to create both, a moat and an encircling
fluid aureole extracted from the clay,
while also carving a crater
on the top of the mound
and cutting pits and
gouges in its flanks.
As the power was increased,
the arc briefly stopped moving and
burnt a smaller circular crater
within the pre-existing crater,
leaving a glowing spot.
Scaled up to an
interplanetary discharge,
that glowing spot represents
a duration and temperature
sufficient to melt the floors of
the Olympus Mons caldera craters
and to produce their
remarkably flat surfaces.
The Olympus Mons aureole also has it's
analog on the aureoles of lightning blisters
showing concentric scarring.
This distinctive pattern directs
our attention to a stunning,
highly enigmatic counterpart
on the Olympus Mons aureole.
In conventional terms, the
similarity can only be accidental.
And, here is an equally
profound mystery.
Much of the original aureole was
overwritten by subsequent scarring.
It is only necessary to
look closely at the images
to see that the overwriting was
achieved by a force acting from above
with no regard for previously
formed ridges and channels.
That's the trademark of the
electric arcs acting on a surface.
In an electrical interpretation
of Olympus Mons,
successive strokes from
a cosmic lightning bolt
lifted the peak and carved
the craters on the summit.
The Olympus Mons caldera illustrates the
effect of a sputtering, rotating arc,
superimposing flat bottom craters
on the summit of an anode blister.
It's rapid movement will
frequently cut steep terraces
into the walls of the
superimposed craters.
We see the effect most clearly on the caldera
walls of neighbouring Ascraeus Mons.
On a planetary scale a cylindrical
rotating electric discharge
can be seen as an array
of smaller cylinders.
A good example is the
cylindrical Earth auroras
formed by curtains of smaller
discharge cylinders.
When electric arcs
sputter across a surface
they will often stick
momentarily to one spot,
creating a distinctive
scalloping effect,
an effect evident on the
caldera walls of Olympus Mons
and even more evident on the caldera
walls of Hecates Tholus to the North.
Cleanly cut scalloping is not apparent
on the walls of shield volcano calderas.
The highly filamentary blanket
on the summit of Olympus Mons
is to be expected if an
'interplanetary' arc
created a focal point
of negative charge
on a positively
charged surface -
like the fine filamentary tail of a comet moving
through the weak electric field of the Sun.
Here we would look for a similar
effect on the massive cloud
of dust and sediment that
fell upon the region.
Radial filaments, perhaps even
electrically fused material
would have poured over the
flanks and scarp of Olympus Mons
to fill the surrounding moat as a permanent
record of the movement of charge.
In truth, no shield volcano on Earth
replicates the morphology of Olympus Mons.
Yet, the pattern is repeated more than
once on the Tharsis Rise of Mars,
not just superimposed
craters and terracing,
but as seen in the laboratory
experiments with electric arcs,
a spectacular array of surrounding
pits and deep surface gouges.
And most extraordinary is the fact, that
the expansive carved surface seen here
reveals not a single opening to the great voids
that are supposed to lie beneath the surface
- the voids into which scientists have
assumed these pits and gouges collapsed.
Collapsed pits are
typically quite obvious
revealing either their
connection to local fissures
or openings to
cavernous space below.
Examined critically. the supposed
shield volcanoes of Mars
do not reveal the
expected features.
This may not exclude the possibility of active
volcanoes in the planet's violent past,
but with higher
resolution images
the spectrum of engimas has
broadened spectacularly.
Electrical events are scaleable,
and it should not surprise us to find that
events similar to those producing Olympus Mons
occurred on a smaller
scale, as well.
In fact, the surface of Mars is replete
with small mounds surmounted by craters.
Abundant cratered mounds remain
mysterious to planetary scientists.
Many of these mounds are remarkably
similar to raised fulgarites.
In many instances, we see the cratered
mounds surrounded by moats or barrow pits.
An electrical explanation may be the only
explanation that can withstand scrutiny.
Most of the formations are
under half a mile in diameter.
Where we see one cratered mound
we typically see others,
sometimes by the hundreds,
even by the thousands.
We see strings of
cratered mounds
and we see parallel strings; an
unresolved geological enigma,
but an enigma that reminds us of the parallel
streamers common to electric discharge.
Many of the higher resolution
images are quite recent
and yes, it is too early to impose
any sweeping interpretation.
But, the greatest mistake would be to
ignore the converging lines of evidence,
evidence that points to planet-wide
electrical sculpting of the Martian surface
not that long ago.
Electrical Sculpting of Mars
Is it possible to identify the events that
shaped the surface of the planet Mars?
A planet of vast but
unrecognized landscapes,
vista after vista eluding every
attempt to explain them.
Scientists labour to solve the
mysteries through text book theory,
but if, as we have claimed,
the cause was electrical,
they will never get
the expected answers.
Many details of a new interpretation come from
laboratory experiments with electric discharge,
but how far can this new
interpretation take us
toward an understanding
of Martian history?
One advantage of the
electrical perspective
is that its every implication can be tested
against massive layers of evidence now available,
including wide-ranging
experiments with electric arcs.
Lab discharge
between two spheres
Anode
(Positive charge)
Cathode
(Negative charge)
If as we’ve proposed, Mars was
immersed in hemispheric discharge,
the planet can be viewed
as a laboratory in space
for testing the
electrical hypothesis.
Lichtenberg Figures
As seen in lightning displays,
electric arcs exhibit dendritic
branching called Lichtenberg patterns.
These look very much like the dendritic
erosion created by flowing water.
And electric arcs exploding across a
surface can produce sinuous channels
that also resemble
fluid erosion.
Lab discharge to wet wood
But there are differences.
In electric discharge
to a solid surface
the electron pathways frequently
create dark spotting,
or chains of craters, running along
the channel floors or close by.
The presence of crater concentrations
in relation to surface channels
offers a fundamental test of
the electrical hypothesis.
In electric experiments, we
also see coronal streamers
radiating perpendicularly from
the primary discharge channel.
Both, the cratering and
the coronal discharge
are keys to a new understanding
of the Martian surface.
Martian Channels:
scalloping; crater chains;
alcoves; pseudo-tributaries
Did electric arcs cut the
great channels on Mars?
Nirgal Vallis is some three miles and
more in width and 250 miles in length.
Yes, it did look
like a dry river bed
when first seen by the
Mariner 9 mission in 1972,
but the original confidence of planetary
scientists soon gave way to doubts,
then to contradiction.
"It is not clear how this channel formed..."
A river can take many twists
and turns along its path
but its tributaries will not look like
the blunt alcoves of Nirgall Vallis.
Martian channels exhibit the predictable
features of an electric scar.
Rotating cylindrical arcs
sputtering along the
primary discharge path
produced scalloping
of the channel walls
with sharp angular projections that
are inconsistent with fluid flow.
The same process left
overlapping craters and alcoves
that make no sense in terms of
familiar erosional patterns.
We see virtually identical craters, alcoves and
sharply cut stubby gouges along Nanedi Valles.
Nanedi Valles:
"The valley's origins remain unclear."
Numerous other Martian rilles
underscore the same enigma
and the unanswered questions
grow year by year.
Nirgal Valles "tributaries"
Electric arc to wood
"Collapsed Lava Tubes"
Planetary scientists identify depressions
such as these, as collapsed lava tubes.
Lava tubes form as flowing molten rock
cools and hardens at it's surface,
insulating the lava below so it continues
to flow in a tube that eventually empties.
When an empty lava
tubes collapses,
the result will be an
entrance to a lava tube cave.
A good example is "Barker's
cave" in Australia.
So, a cave entrance is the first
thing to look for on Mars.
The second thing to look for is a rubble
field created by a collapsing roof.
And a third thing to look
for is abundant outflow
since the emptying of a lava
tube requires an outflow region.
Lava outflow
But in reviewing innumerable instances
of claimed lava tubes collapse on Mars
we find no cave entrance,
no rubble field from
a collapsed roof
and no outflow.
The depressions stand alone
with literally nothing to support
the theoretical interpretation.
Like any fluid, lava flow
follows topographical relief,
always running downhill.
The channels seen here change directions
randomly in apparent disregard for topography.
They make 90 degree turns
unrelated to surface gradients.
And they also cross over each other
with no disturbance of either.
These depressions can not
be collapsed lava tubes,
but what are they?
What you see here is
not the planet Mars.
It is a surface affected by very
high voltage, but microamp current,
creating a complex of
gouges and craters.
Again, in electrical terms
craters and channels are
inseparable companions.
"Fractured" Terrain
In responding to the mysterious
channels and depressions on Mars,
many planetary scientists thought
they saw spreading and fracturing
and, indeed, evidence of fracturing
is present on Mars as seen here.
Here there are no associated
craters or crater chains
and the nature of the stresses acting
on the surface is an open question.
Planetary scientists think in the same terms
when considering the region of Avernus Colles.
They identify the channels
as cracks or fractures.
But why the concentrations of
craters and crater chains?
A rotating electric arc traveling across the
surface can alternately sputter forward
to produce linear
chains of craters,
or advance on a continuous path
to cut channels as if by a router
with uniform depth
and parallel sides.
As seen in laboratory experiments
with electric discharge channels,
here, the channel width will be
the width of the rotating arc
at it's contact
with the surface.
VEMASAT Laboratories, Earth
Avernus Colles, Mars
Crater Anomalies
The question of crater formation on rocky
planets and moons must be re-opened.
The impact explanation would mean it
is only necessary to count craters
in order to calculate
the age of a surface.
But electric discharge
on an hemispheric scale
could quickly create a surface
that looks a billion years old
to those counting craters.
Plasma scientist Dr. J. C.
Ransom of VEMASAT-Laboratories
conducted a series of
experiments with electric arcs.
Electric discharge produced
surface cratering patterns
closely resembling those
observed on planets and moons.
Even a surface darkening and central bumps
or mounds of so many craters on Mars
were present in the
laboratory experiment.
Electric arcs can also produce cratering
patterns that could never be produced by impact.
Complex terracing of crater
floors and crater walls
are a common effect of a
rotating electric arc
or discharge streamer.
Across the surface of Mars we observe
countless examples of exotic terracing.
Impact theory was never able
to resolve the mysteries.
So-called bull's eye craters
with a central crater
inside a larger crater
are surprisingly common on Mars.
Could this be a rare accident?
That explanation is reduced to absurdity
when two such craters are seen side by side.
In fact several bull's eye craters
appear within the same region of Mars.
But an ionized discharge path of lightning does
allow for subsequent discharge along the same path.
The bull's eye crater
is a logical extension
of the electric model.
And when it comes to
improbable events side by side
these two craters with central peaks
each terminating in another crater
will certainly never be
explained by impact.
Impacts do not create
hexagonal craters.
But look closely at
this region of Mars
and you'll see several hexagons,
an observed form taken
by rotating plasma
as seen in the planet Saturn’s
electrified polar hexagon.
In an extended discharge,
systematic cratering, pitting,
or etching can be the norm.
That's why in
industrial applications
electric discharge machining can achieve
exceptionally dependable results.
The microscopic pitting
of electric discharge
can give a consistent depth
and a remarkably smooth surface
despite the fact that the surface is
entirely constituted of craters or pits.
The same effect can be observed
on seemingly smooth surfaces
in the northern
hemisphere of Mars,
surfaces that have been
excavated miles deep.
But look more closely with the
help of recent high-res images
and smooth surfaces are revealed to
be nothing more than fields of small
densely packed craters.
The baffling crater
field seen here,
like so many others on Mars,
is a perfect counterpart to an
electrically machined surface.

And don't underestimate the scale of
this dilemma for planetary scientists.
We witness a pattern at both, the low
points and the high points on Mars.
From the bottom of Zunil crater in
the depressed northern hemisphere
to the highest point on Mars, the
summit of towering Olympus Mons.
Here no grasping for conventional
explanations such as a dune field
could possibly account for what
leaps out at the observer.

like so many others on Mars,
is a perfect counterpart to an

Lightning's Dendritic Forms
Lightning in slow motion
More than two centuries after
Benjamin Franklin flew his kite,
the origin and behaviour of lightning continues
to amaze and to puzzle the lightning specialists.
Lightning will occasionally imprint it's
distinctive form on terrestrial surfaces,
Lightning strike on a sidewalk
and even on the skin of humans.
In the laboratory, the counterpart to
lightning is the Lichtenberg figure,
perhaps the most common and fascinating
form taken by electric discharge.
Dendritic means
tree-like branching
and dendritic forms can be
easily confused with fracturing.
The dendritic patterns seen here are not
fracturing, as the term is normally understood,
but electrical break down channels
on a polycarbonate plate.
Georg Christoph Lichtenberg appears to have been
the first to demonstrate the different forms
taken by dust on positive
and negative surfaces.
A line of investigation later followed by
others but with no impact on planetary science.
Late in the 19th century, industrialist Lord William
G. Armstrong explored the power of electricity
to produce exquisite forms on
surfaces of different charge.
The feathery qualities of Lichtenberg
figures on a negative surface
could be compared to the more dendritic
patterns on a positive surface.
"Captured" Lightning
At Stoneridge Engineering, the technology of
Lichtenberg figures has produced an art form,
lightning captured in
clear acrylic blocks.
The blocks are bombarded by electrons
from a 5 megavolt particle accelerator
arriving at nearly
the speed of light
but, coming to a stop within a
fraction of an inch into the block,
a cloud of trapped
negative charge.
Here, the event producing the dendritic channels
is triggered by a simple stroke of a metallic pin.
That is all it takes for a breakdown
of the insulating material
and a nearly instantaneous release
of charge and dendritic channels.
A millisecond lightning storm
frozen into the acrylic block.
The branching of the electron channels
is a spectacular fractal pattern,
apparently occurring all the way down
to scale, to the molecular level.
From what we have
earlier presented
it is evident that planet-wide
electric discharge
created vast regions of raised
Lichtenberg figures on Mars.
Mars: dendritic ridges
Laboratory experiments show that
in regions of positive charge
dust will typically gather into
raised Lichtenberg formations
standing out from the
surrounding terrain.
In fact, sharply sculpted
dendritic ridge systems
are abundant on Mars
showing up wherever the highest
energy events are implied.
The great trench of Valles Marineris
is an extraordinary example.
Here, we find the raised Lichtenberg figures
exactly where we would expect them,
running down from sharp
cliffs and high points
in predictable patterns, stretching for
hundreds of miles along the trench.
Yet, strangely, the mystery receives
almost no mention by planetary scientists.
We also observe dendritic ridges on
the great mound of Olympus Mons,
both, on the miles high scarp
and on the caldera walls.
In fact, the mystery is global.
We see the same pattern on
the walls of major rilles.
We see it along the so-called fractured
terrain of Noctis Labyrinthis.
And everywhere on Mars we
see the dendritic patterns
reaching down from
towering cliffs and mesas.
We even see such ridge systems descending
from the rims of large craters,
opening the door to a much broader
perspective on crater formation.
Scalloping
In the hypothesis
presented here,
many craters on Mars were produced
by the same electrical events
that created chains of craters and a
great variety of channels or rilles.
As a discharge column
sputters across a surface,
it's diameter will vary
with discharge energy
and a narrowing or pinching by
the induced magnetic field.
The pinching effect will be most strongly focused
at the point of contact with the surface.
The sputtering arc will leave a unique
signature in the form of scalloped walls.
Popular explanations say that surface collapse
must have produced these crater channels.
But scalloping effects on Mars are by
no means limited to chains of craters.
Planetary scientists cannot agree on the forces
that created this bizarre channel network
north of Valles Marineris.
Other channels, that are said to
have been caused by fluid flow,
either water or lava, exhibit
the same scalloped walls.
Similar neatly cut scallops appear
on the cliffs of towering mesas.
And the so-called calderas of
the great mountains of Mars
reveal the same pattern.
Even the celebrated
Victoria crater,
supposedly formed by impact,
exhibits alcoves and scallops similar to
those of the great rilles and valleys.
And the scalloped
walls of Zunil crater
are virtually indistinguishable from the
scalloped walls of Valles Marineris.
Scallops and Ridges
Additional patterns enter
the picture, as well,
including a consistent global
connection between scallops
and dendritic ridge networks.
The explanation appears to lie in the fractal
nature of cylindrical current sheets.
Current flow can metamorphose
into secondary cylinders
and fractal-like sub-structures
to be pinched by the
induced magnetic fields
into a narrow highly
focused discharge.
We see this interplay
of different scales
in the cylindrical currents
of Earth's auroras
as charged particles enter and exit the
polar regions in an electric circuit.
Invisible current sheets,
magnetically pinched at Earth's poles
divide into visible curtains
of secondary cylinders,
all dancing in the turbulence
of Earth's upper atmosphere.
The same electromagnetic structure
arising from charged particle movement
will at times be seen in the
electrified tails of comets.
In the larger scale events
carving the surface of Mars,
we envision multiple columns
of charged particles
being pinched into a narrow
discharge at the surface.
This established principle will be crucial
to comprehending the giant Valles Marineris
with all of it's
accompanying chasms.
Smaller scallops within
larger scallops,
they are the imprint of
pinched cylindrical currents,
constituted of
smaller cylinders.
The pattern occurs repeatedly
and is surely no accident.
Consider the consistent relationship
between the scalloping effects
and Lichtenberg ridge systems.
The most prominent of
these dendritic forms
are those that separate
the larger scallops.
The smaller dendritic ridges define the
boundaries between smaller scallops.
At both scales, the ridge networks
can be seen as the final events
in catastrophic
discharge activity
as charge redistribution
gathered and fused lose material
into the familiar
Lichtenberg patterns.
In this revisioning
of Martian history
contradictions find a
unified resolution
in an electrical cause.
Enigmatic craters,
crater chains,
dendritic ridges,
scalloped craters,
calderas and rilles -
all are connected to the observed
behaviour of electric discharge.
Negative Lichtenberg Figures
Here is an image of electric arcing
to a negatively charged surface
capturing the feathery
discharge glow, or corona.
The corona is constituted of extremely fine hair-like
filaments radiating from the primary streamers.
On a surface affected
by electric arcing,
experiments show that
regions of localised charge
can attract dust or sediment into a
record of the electrical activity,
or discharge pathways,
down to many fine details.
Martian surface
Here is a ridge complex on Mars
covering thousands
of square miles.
The ridge forms have puzzled planetary
scientists for more than a decade now.
Since standard geology does
not include such forms,
this unique behaviour is a logical
test of the electrical hypothesis.
Examined closely, we see perpendicular
hair-like filaments illuminated by the Sun
confirming that electric discharge
attracted dust into raised relief.
Martian surface
This exotic formation was produced
electrically by D. Z. Parker on a CRT screen
showing a gathering of dust in a
region of previous discharge activity.
The ridge with its
fine filaments
offers a striking counterpart to
the baffling Martian formations.
Surface Etching
We have suggested that the
northern hemisphere of Mars
was eroded electrically to a
depth of 5 miles or more,
as seen on the global
elevation map.
It is only reasonable therefore
to look for transitional zones
on the margins of the more depressed
or heavily eroded regions.
If the erosion was electrical,
what should we expect to find,
particularly in the regions that separate
the low lying northern latitudes
from the elevated and densely
cratered southern hemisphere?
We should expect to
find what we do find -
vast regions from the
equator northward
showing the predictable
phases of electrical erosion.
First electric arcs
raking across the surface
created a network of channels
cutting the region
in discrete blocks.
Then the arcs acting on the
sharp edges of the blocks
continued to extend
the Valley floors
leaving separate
angular islands.
The islands standing out above
the newly excavated terrain
were then progressively eroded
into various pyramidal forms
then mounds as electric arcs
continued to erode the sharp edges.
And finally the remaining
mounds were etched away.
Just as industrial applications
of electric discharge machining
can erode high points to
produce a flat surface.
All that is left of the
earlier Martian plains
are the few scattered remnants
of sculpted mesas and bluffs
disappearing altogether in a flat
depression farther to the north.
This transitional process can be
observed across great distances on Mars
with a consistent pattern,
highly cratered elevated
plains to the south
giving way to isolated blocks,
then mounds,
then a smooth lower terrain that characterizes
so much of the northern hemisphere.
Blueberries
In early 2004, the Mars rover
"Opportunity" returned images
that alone could alter our ideas about
the recent history of the solar system.
The rover had landed in a crater
and scattered around the walls of the crater
were a multitude of BB-sized spherules.
Their blue-grey colour set them
apart form the reddish hue
of the iron-rich Martian soil.
Thus, the informal name
given them: blueberries.
As "Opportunity" rolled across the Martian landscape
it found a profusion of the little spheres
that apparently occupied the
Martian surface by the trillions.
But how were they formed?
Not long after the discovery
of the Martian blueberries,
Dr. Ransom set up an experiment to
test the effects of electric arcs
on different materials.
He obtained a quantity of hematite
roughly comparable to the Martian soil
and blasted it with
an electric arc.
The results are
quite spectacular.
Embedded in the soil were perfect
counterparts of the Martian blueberries.
From what is now known
about the Martian surface,
it's clear that if the planet was
engulfed in electric discharge,
the spherules are a
predictable effect.
Mars
VEMASAT laboratories
Ransom's experiments did not
end the investigation either.
Cameras of the rover "Opportunity" captured
a flat floored channel with parallel sides
from both walls of the channel
we observed jagged razorbacks.
One more feature with no place
in the geologists' lexicon.
But Dr. Troy Shinbrot, and his
colleagues at Rutger's University,
recently produced this very form,
razorbacks, in electro-static experiments.
And the researchers did indeed see a direct connection
to the razorbacks recorded by "Opportunity".
Shortly thereafter, D. Z.
Parker also produced razorbacks
on the charged surface
of a CRT screen.
Both, the razorbacks and the
blueberries, point to electrical events.
And electrical events
are scaleable.
Formations created on a small scale can
also appear on a much larger scale.
In fact, our orbiting cameras have found numerous
craters with domes or spheres resting within them
looking very much like the spheres and
craters of Ransom's blueberry experiments.
The pictures seen here
of domed craters on Mars
are from the "Mars
Global Surveyor".
But in contrast to the
rover's blueberry images
the domed craters range in size
from a hundred meters or less
to a mile or more in diameter.
And the pattern occurs
even on a larger scale.
In the polar region of Mars the domed
craters are up to many miles wide.
It is surely reasonable to ask if the tiny
blueberries, and the far more massive domed craters,
were produced by the
same electrical force
acting on widely different scales in an
earlier phase of global electric discharge?
One thing is certain, if it was electricity
that sculpted the Martian surface,
the events were vastly more dramatic than
planetary scientists have ever imagined.

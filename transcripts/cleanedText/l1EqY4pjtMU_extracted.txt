Between the Borrego Desert and the pine- covered peaks
of Cleveland National Forest in eastern San Diego county,
California there's a domain of solid granite 
called the In-Ko-Pah mountains. The
In-Ko-Pah’s have nary a tree, only course
manzanita chaparral that springs from
chinks in the rock like the hair of an
armadillo. It's a bare and broken land,
forsaken to brooding hoodoos, rodents,
snakes, and decomposing granite.
Place names give its mood, Valley of the Moon, Devil's
Canyon, the optimistic Boulder Park and Coyote's Flying Saucer
Retrievals and Repair Service. Most notable is the Desert
View Tower in In-Ko-Pah Canyon. The tower is made of the
native granite and stands Tolkienesque, commanding a view
of the Wizard’s Cauldron around it. As a child, I remember
the tower had a coffee shop. We never stopped because
we're almost there - there being still two hours away. I
wistfully watched its golden glow suffused with coffee
and sweet roll smells passed from the back seat of a
50’s Cadillac, 60’s Lincoln and two 70’s Ford LDT’s.
It presented a glowing warrant for the
traveler, standing high above the road in this stark,
alien landscape. As it happens, I'm living here now in a
rural mountain community called Potrero, which lies in this
cauldron or granite region where I've taken the opportunity
to look at the rocks. What I conclude from
observations is that these granite boulders are bubbles
of boiled sand - not hollow bubbles, but solid drops of
granite formed as boils at the surface of a hot fluid matrix.
’Cauldron of Granite’ is an accurate description as the
energy came from below, and by electrolysis in thermal
convection, boiled through layers of sand to the surface,
liquefying the sand in the process like one would melt metals
in a cauldron. As exemplified in these photos,
many boulders look like the kind of candy
made with drops of molten sugar, a viscous thick material
that quickly cools to form a skin that holds its drop
shape while the inside remains hot and liquid.
The shapes are like frozen beads of molten glass.
Bubbles and drops take a cellular form due to surface
tension that forms the skin around the fluid and a pressure
density differential across this membrane. The bulging 
rounded shape suggest these formed in atmospheric
pressure, rather than deep underground as consensus science
tells us. There had to be a lower pressure and density
surrounding these drops as they form to allow the
free-form shapes found only by surface tension in the skin.
We'll observe multiple other points of evidence that these
boulders are electrified boils, including evidence of
how the mountains were formed and how they became electrified
to boil boulder fields. In this, part one of a two-part series,
we'll discuss the boulders. In part two, we will discuss 
the cauldron and what caused these mountains to boil.
As we review the evidence and discuss the potential causes
and processes, bear in mind the situational context of Earth
at the time. Earth was in upheaval due to some
cosmic disturbance. The atmosphere and ground,
all through the crust, was charged. In some places, saturated
zones eroded away, electronically machined by sputtering and
arc discharge. Other areas had lower levels of saturation,
where charge diffused through the ground and caused
secondary and tertiary events at the surface that 
aren't easily identified with something purely electrical.
Thermodynamics, chemistry, fluid dynamics,
all conspire to increase the complexity
of nature's products. The Granite Cauldron is a display of
such complexity. Examination of the rocks, and the region
as a whole, leads me to conclude that the granite was boiled
as a consequence of electrolysis in an underlying aquifer,
where oxygen and hydrogen became segregated and channeled
through layers of sand and water. The oxygen channels
reacted with elements in the layers of sand, creating
blossoms of hot boiling silicon compounds that solidified in
contact with the atmosphere, suddenly cooling, recombining
and recrystallizing as granite, but still in the shape of
fluid drops. The evidence to back my theories,
is in the shape of the boulders, which precisely
conform to the shape of fast-cooling drops and clusters
of drops. In fact, the boulders conform to shapes made of
melted glass - silica dioxide - which is what these rocks are
largely composed of. They do not conform to the expectations
of conventional erosion. There is also evidence in
the topography of the coastal mountains which display
the clear patterns of a large discharge current 
from the Earth. This differs from the consensus theory
which has granite form deep in the Earth as a volcanic
flow that didn't erupt or surface, but became trapped under
extreme pressure and temperature for eons as its 
crystals grew. Then an accordion-like action in the
Earth's crust, triggered by subduction of the continent,
caused these granites to be shoved 5,000 feet above sea level,
where they have been lashed by wind, rain and freeze for
millennia, to produce the polished and rounded, but sometimes
square, granite boulders that we see. At least the consensus
and I agree - there was extreme heat from within the Earth.
My boiling drop theory suggests things pretty much happened
all at once though, due to a high voltage electrical impulse,
diffusing through a sandstone aquifer. Evidence that boulders
formations are boiled, is their shape as depicted in the
images previously shown, where singular drops formed and froze.
While some retained an ovular shape, they dehydrated
and contracted as they cooled, which often left conical
or flattened drops. Well, this is exactly what one expects
from a hot molten drop that cools, dries and solidifies
quickly. More often, however, one finds clusters of
boulders that were once co-joined, like bubbles in 
a foam. In a foam bubbles and drops conform to
each other, matching shapes across cellular membranes.
It's very obvious, the bulges shown in the next set of images,
are clusters of drops that have dried and fallen apart,
leaving matching surfaces where they were once co-joined.
Steam and other gases exited the rock as it cooled. The 
expansion of gas and steam at the surface contact with the
atmosphere likely helped cool the surface faster,
increasing the surface tension in the skin, and causing
shrinkage of the drop. As the drop shrank, it separated 
into lobes, which further shrank and broke apart.
Comparing the boulder cluster shown, to the bubble clusters
in the next group of images, one sees the same polygonal
interfaces, the same segmenting, and the
same interstitial bubbles, wedged between
larger bubbles. The only difference shape-wise is that
boulders are solidified drops, not bubbles, and they shrank as
they dried causing segmented lobes to separate and 
fall apart. When bubbles and drops cluster, those on
the interior of the cluster tend to be polygonal shapes.
Because the internal pressure between cojoined cells in a
cluster is more or less equalized, internal membrane walls
experience no pressure differential and are flat. Outer
cells in the cluster however have a differential between
interior pressure in the atmosphere and therefore they
bulge outwards. That is exactly how these boulder clusters
are structured. If one makes a symmetrical cluster of five
bubbles, the one inside the other four will be a perfect 
cube. There are several examples of polygonal
bubbles in the images shown. Singular boulders tend
to be rounded, while boulders in clusters tend to be
polygonal, especially the ones in the cluster 
center. The squared shapes and flat surfaces
between boulders is proof they formed as drops in the
atmosphere. This granite has no grain oriented in a
certain direction, or any other internal structure that
would cause them to break in a particular way, as a result of
earthquake or erosion. The only explanation presented
by physics, is if these rocks were clustered drops.
A child can make a perfect square with soap
bubbles; I challenge any PhD to do so with erosion.
Surface tension had to conform to the volume reduction.
So, one of two things happened. If the skin had cooled and
recrystallized, it became rigid and further shrinkage of
the hot interior caused the hard shell to break, leaving a
sharp crack. If the skin was still plastic and viscous when 
the drop shrank, the skin conformed around it and the
fluid interior, leaving rounded edges. Most, if not all, rock 
structures display one or both consequences of shrinkage.
Separations that occurred from shrinkage after the skin set
into a hard shell, couldn't conform and broke, leaving sharp
edge cracks, as shown in these photos. These breaks
tend to form an s-shaped curve; not orthogonal segments.
Drops in clusters with membranes still soft and pliable
however, show rounded edges and concavities where drops
separated and shrank. These cellular segments
tend to break parallel and orthogonal, at specific
angles particular to each cluster. The angles or dip of the
horizontal surfaces vary widely. It seems likely some force
was pushing some clusters over, like the wind 
or perhaps gravity, was making them topple.
The angles from one cluster to another are not consistent,
which suggests variable winds or something perhaps
expected over a boiling cauldron. Another compelling
evidence these boulders are boils, is the columnar
geometry of the largest structures. The segmenting is
cellular as already discussed, caused by cooling, shrinkage
and surface-tension-related skin effects. The 
columnar shape however, indicates convection.
Vertically elongated clustered polygonal columns are a known
effect of heat convection called, what else, convection
columns. And what is boiling? It's a process of
heat convection. Flat surfaces are left where bubble
walls were pressed in tall squarish columns and then fell
apart after cooling, shrinking, cracking and segregating.
Everywhere boulders are co-joined or conforming to each
other in shape, interfaced with puzzle-piece concavities
and bulges, because they were fluid and plastic
during formation. The granite boulders are visually
patterned, precisely as one would expect a viscous frothing
fluidized matrix to look, if it were frozen in mid-boil.
Compare these formations to viscous drops, bubbles,
foams and boils of various fluids, and you can find analog
formations with these shapes and features.
Look at the sequence of images below, and
it's apparent how these bubbles separate. It begins with a
thin crack, where a shrinking drop begins to segment into
smaller drops. Look at the top left and bottom pictures
in this grouping. Then the drops begin to separate and the
edges round off along the seam in a
fluid-manner, like a bubble. And then they
separate completely, like water balloons. These are examples
of shrinkage when the skin is still plastic and molds around
the coin drop of molten material. Another evidence for
boils are top hats - one boulder stacked directly atop
another. Consider a viscous mold and drop where the surface 
rapidly cools and crystallizes the semi-solid crust.
And then more hot fluid pressures up inside, but the bubble's
crusty skin can't expand, so fluid gushes out the thinnest
skin of the bubble at the very top, thus creating a new bubble
stacked atop the old. In the case of a cluster of bubbles,
they can stack into these columns. A similar feature is
the necklace, where interstitial drops seep out around the
base of larger drops forming, a beaded necklace.
And one evidence I consider irrefutable is the
 ‘water balloon’ effect. The next group of images is of
the same rock structure from different angles. I'll just point
out the obvious: the top segmented rocks were once fluid sacs,
like viscous water balloons that erupted out the top of an
older boil and flowed down its back before shrinking,
segmenting, and solidifying. Opposite the dripping side of the
balloon is a concave site, where drops in the cluster
pressed against other drops that have since fallen away.
Wind, I suspect, flattened and pressed these bubbles together,
forcing the concavities instead of forming the more typical
orthogonal cracks and separations seen in the majority of
older clusters. The inner folds of the concavities have
fluid ripples, the actual impression of turbulent waves
and ripples in the separating skin between bubbles.
I interpret this as an indication that wind, seismic,
or some other cause, was vibrating the bubble.
In the following gallery are several more examples,
where drops in a cluster pressed together, leaving these
concavities beneath overhanging water balloons.
There are multiple other patterns in the
rock that display fluid-drop-bubble behavior.
Large waterfalls of rock can be found
where a molten mass erupted from the flanks of a mountain
and sheep flowed down its side like a volcanic lava flow.
Close examination of sheep-flow patterns show even more
evidence, such as the appearance of standing waves. They look
just like river waves flowing over a rock. The pattern of a
viscous river shows where flows join to form standing waves.
Look at the foot of the granite flow and it
resembles the foot of a glacier or of a lava flow.
Perhaps the most compelling, singular example - this rock
formed as a boiling fluid and suddenly froze when exposed to
the atmosphere as shown in the next example. Liquid rock has
poured out the side of the pillar and froze like a faucet
of running water. And here's another example of the
same thing - a pouring outflow from a standing column.
Like injection molds, the rocks have nubs and tubular pore
spouts, where fluid passed between cellular structures.
And there's something to be said about the regularity of
how rocks section in proportion to their volume. As if there
were a frequency causing a harmonic response in the 
body of the rock. It could be a seismic vibration from the
fluidized boiling cauldron itself, or it could be from
sonic shock due to atmospheric winds. It's also possible
that the piezoelectric effect of current in the crystallizing
skin of the boils, cause vibration. However, there's harmonic
resonance that seems to play a role in how these drop segment
and separate apart. There are many questions that remain to be
answered, about how this rock formed. The atomic and
chemical reactions are complex, given the unknown amounts of
current and potential involved; the perfusion of elements
involved; and the unknown state of Earth's atmosphere.
Even Earth's orbit and what it orbited around
at the time these rocks formed, is unknown.
One thing is for sure, however. These rocks
formed in atmospheric pressure. There is
no possible way these shapes were produced while confined
deep underground. Nor is it possible they were produced by
any form of erosion. Forms were caused by a viscous
plastic fluid confined only by surface tension.
Their shape is self-evident. There is no argument that can
be made to deny it. They look like drops and bubbles because
they are. There's a reason boulders
boiled from the Earth east of San Diego.
To understand how this happened, part 2 of the Granite Cauldron
will look at the mountains in cells and how they formed.
Thank you and cheers!

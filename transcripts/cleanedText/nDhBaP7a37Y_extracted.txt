the Electric Universe,

That the planet Earth has been subject
to catastrophic events is beyond dispute,
but the nature and timing
of these events is not.
One of the clearest testimonies to
ancient upheaval is our planet's craters,
which consensus scientific theory proposes
are the result of meteoritic impacts.
But we have never directly observed
a kinetic impact from space
producing such a crater.
The Electric Universe has
proposed for many decades
that laboratory experiments with
high-energy electrical discharge
provide the clearest analog for craters seen
on rocky bodies throughout the solar system.
In this episode, Thunderbolts Picture of
the Day managing editor Stephen Smith
discusses some of the clearest evidence
for the electrical scarring of our planet,
including some of the most famous
so-called impact sites on Earth.
One of the principal tenets
of Electric Universe theory
is that sometime in the recent
past, there were catastrophic events
involving the planets of our
solar system, including the Earth.
Exactly when those events
took place is uncertain,
because we're so far
removed from them in time.
However, forensic
evidence is available,
including ancient
archaeological sites,
land-based geological formations,
ocean basins, and other structures
that often reveal anomalous data.
Information from those sources indicates that
there were multiple catastrophic occurrences.
Indeed, it seems as if pre-catastrophic
and post-catastrophic conditions
are what 99% of the human race
has experienced over its existence.
Times of peace and plenty are
rare in the historical record.
Many articles on The Thunderbolts Project website
describe various regions around the world
where manifestations of those
catastrophic events are visible.
The list of articles
is extensive,
describing places on Earth that are difficult
to explain using conventional theories.
Places like the Norwegian fjords,
the Brandberg Massif in Africa,
the Great Trango Tower,
the Grand Canyon,
Lake Victoria,
the Himalayan mountains,
along with the principal
topic of today's discussion,
the Sudbury impact structure and its
attendant anomalous elemental deposits.
Most, if not all, large
craters in North America
are thought to have been
caused by asteroid impacts.
In fact, it was an asteroid that's
thought by consensus geologists
to be the event that
wiped out the dinosaurs,
although that idea is no longer
as hard and true as it once was,
proving the asteroid
theory is not easy,
because rocks where the evidence
is found can't be accurately dated.
The fossil record is also indeterminate
when it comes to causal issues.
Was it a catastrophic event
or a gradual decline in species?
It appears that some marine
species died out millions of years
before the so-called
impact event.
According to an article in
the science journal Nature,
platinum group element anomalies are found in
sedimentary deposits all over North America.
No one is sure where the
additional heavy elements came from,
but there are several
ideas proposed.
1) a comet or meteorite storms
2) debris from
collisions in space
3) volcanoes
4) mantle plumes
The time of the mostly platinum enrichment
is thought to be the Younger Dryas period
between 12,900 and
11,700 years ago.
Some of the elements include platinum,
osmium, gold, ruthenium and copper.
It's also called the
Younger Dryas cooling event
when the Northern
Hemisphere monsoon declined.
How that period, called an ice
age, began and ended is a mystery
although it's often trucked out as an
example of massive and rapid climate change.
One of the reasons for the warming
at the end of the Younger Dryas
is thought to be the impact from a
massive comet or a huge number of meteors.
There are many large
craters in North America
and most of them look like they
come from a similar time period.
The Weaubleau-Osceola structure,
the Decaturville and Crooked
Creek Missouri formations,
the Flynn Creek and the
Wells Creek Tennessee craters,
might belong to an anomalous chain of
craters stretching across the United States,
called the 38th parallel anomaly.
Most of them exhibit unusual features
such as flat floors, steep walls
and lightning-like patterns of trenches
and gullies that extend from their centers.
Geologists speculate that tremendous
shock waves from the collisions
caused earthquakes and dense pulverized
rock fallout all over the world.
Modern theories about a
post-war nuclear winter
are relevant to the
dimming of sunlight
and significant cooling
trends from atmospheric dust.
The question no one's asking however
is, what if there was no rock?
As mentioned, Sudbury Basin in Canada is a
large crater, more than 63 kilometers long,
31 kilometers wide,
and 15 kilometers deep,
the second largest
crater on Earth.
Ejecta from Sudbury was found more than
800 kilometers away near Lake Superior.
The area around Sudbury is
shattered into multi-megaton blocks
that were pushed away and
piled up along the crater rim.
Some of the largest fragments were thrown
over a hundred kilometers in all directions.
Gneiss deposits were fused
into a glass-like compound
that covered the floor of the crater
and splashed up and over the crater rim.
The molten glass inundated several hundred
square kilometers of the surrounding terrain
with a thick layer
capping chaotic breccias.
Platinum family minerals are
found throughout the region
including sperrylite,
froodite,
michenerite and sudburyite.
Some records indicate that 1,600 million
tons of nickel, copper, platinum and lead,
have been extracted from Sudbury
over the last hundred years.
There are so many anomalous
formations in North America
that it's impossible
to count them all.
Even the Great Lakes possess characteristics
that could point to an electrical foundation.
The gigantic bowl of hardened limestone
in which they rest, for instance.
In a gradual curve north of the
Great Lakes are Lake Winnipeg,
Lake of the Woods,
Lake Athabasca,
Great Slave Lake, Great Bear Lake and
many other smaller bodies of water.
Near the largest of them are gold mines,
led mines, radium and uranium mines,
along with mines producing
platinum, silver and palladium.
Unusual concentrations
of heavy metals
could mean that transmutation of
local elements might have occurred
because of the intensity of
the electrical discharges.
That idea has been
suggested in the past
as the cause for hematite
blueberries on Mars.
Electric arcs transmuted
silicon into iron.
That same phenomenon
could have created
some of the strange conglomerations
of minerals seen on Earth.
In an Electric Universe, asteroids
are not a primary cause for anomalies.
Instead, electric arc discharges are
suggested as the sculptor of earth terrain.
As I said earlier, where those arcs came
from, can't be determined at this late date.
Were they from charged
celestial bodies
encroaching into the electric fields of
Earth and other planets like Mars and Venus?
Was it a plasma cloud from
outside the solar system?
Was it a solar flare that
charged up Earth's ionosphere?
Those questions whose answers
can only be guessed at today,
await further investigation.
The Electric Universe hypothesis offers
another perspective on observations.
Several factors come into play
that are not available to the
consensus theories of geophysics,
because the lexicon of
descriptions available to them
doesn't include electric arcs or
travelling subterranean electric discharges.
There are of course many possible
explanations for craters,
canyons, escarpments,
mountains and ocean basins,
but once the electric force is included
in the search for those explanations,
an entirely new way of seeing
the world becomes possible.
In this realm, that of deep background in the
origination of basic theoretical foundations,
those viewpoints must be
considered diametrically opposed
to the gradualism that
dominates science today.
Rather than basing opinions on the slow
steady familiar processes of erosion,
temperature changes, rain,
windblown sand, ice and snow,
the proponents of
Electric Universe theory
are attempting to reclassify
geophysical processes
as rapid, catastrophic
and world-changing.
In many cases, the almost
unimaginable must be acknowledged.
Gigantic formations like the Grand
Canyon or Manicouagan crater
were created in a time period that encompasses
the historical memory of humanity.
This new paradigm means
words like 'crater' for example
must be stripped of all previous
assumptions that are stimulated by it.
One almost immediately thinks volcano
or meteor when the word is used.
Catastrophism should be part
of a new way to see the world
and volcanoes or meteor
strikes are indeed catastrophic,
but geological theory consigns them
to the rare or infrequent category.
When was the last time a volcano blew out
a 100 kilometer-wide crater, for instance?
Considering the presumption
of an electric discharge,
a better description might be
circular formation, rather than crater.
Lake of the Woods for example,
one of the long arc of lakes
stretching northwest of the Great Lakes,
certainly displays those features that
have been described elsewhere as electrical.
Concentric rings and radial force
patterns are immediately evident,
as well as the scalloped edges
of the southwestern shoreline.
A primordial characteristic of
electric arcs is that they spin.
They are composed of multiple
independent plasma current filaments
in a collimated beam.
The independent filaments are attracted
to one another in a linear relationship
but are prevented from coalescing
because of electrostatic repulsion,
which also causes the filaments to
form twisted pairs or Birkeland currents.
Electrical engineers use
twisted pairs of wires
because it's the most efficient means
of transferring electrical energy
with the least loss.
A spinning electric arc will machine down
through the strata like an auger of fire.
In the case of Lake of the
Woods, the three lobed bays
that twist in a northerly
direction are intriguing,
as are the many islands
that follow multiple chords
like outwardly expanding
waves across a wide area.
Lake of the Woods is a 110 kilometers
long and up to 95 kilometers wide.
It has an area of approximately
4,400 square kilometers
and more than 14,000 islands.
So it's by no means small.
Due to its location,
it could be considered among one of
the lesser cousins to the Great Lakes
and could have been formed alongside
them in a single cataclysmic event.
The Great Lakes, Sudbury, along with
but not detailed in this presentation,
Manicouagan and Hudson's Bay,
reflect just a few of the ways
that an Electric Universe paradigm
can completely
change a worldview.

A newly discovered star has
astonished a team of scientists
who say that nothing at this moment
can explain what is happening.
The star is called pulsar,
which is a star that appears to pulse
with intense radio wave emissions.
However, the star in question switches
unpredictably between radio and X-ray emissions,
leaving astronomers
openly baffled.
According to lead
author Wim Hermsen,
"The people creating models will have to
rethink what we are discovering here...
When we look now to what is
so far published in papers,
nothing at this moment can
explain what is happening."
Why is this discovery so
astonishing to astronomers?
Pulsars were discovered
back in 1967,
they discovered that there was
this string of radio pulses
with a periodicity of 1.3 seconds coming
out of the constellation of Vulpecula.
So they didn't know what that was, they called
it pulsars and there was a big puzzlement
and about a year later the
famous astronomer Tommy Gold
postulated that the reason that
these pulses were being created
is that there was a
rapidly rotating star
acting very much like a
lighthouse rotating a light beam
and as it passed in the direction
of Earth, we'd see this blink,
we could see this
emission of radio waves
and then it would
go off for a while
while this star swung the rest
of the way around those 360º
and then blink, it would come
back again 1.3 seconds later.
And Gold was the one who postulated that
that star must be a rotating neutron star
because the darn thing was
spinning around so quickly,
imagine a star spinning and
making it once around in 1.3 seconds.
Now they've discovered this one, it
has two different modes of operation.
For a while it throws off pulses
of X-rays and then changes its mind
and then throws off pulses
of high-frequency radio
at very very different frequencies
in a very very different mechanism.
And so, they don't want to hear
about two different mechanisms
because there's only one mechanism,
the rotating 'whatsis' is up there.
The lighthouse analogy for the pulsars'
flashes is attractively simple
but because the flashes
themselves are so complex
there's been no way of
explaining them currently.
Now it is, when you look at it
from an electrical point of view,
the pulsar flashes have more in
common with the complex radio signals
induced in the ionosphere of the
Earth by powerful lightning
and this may be the key
to this particular pulsar
because lightning can
also generate X-rays.
Astronomers suggest that the pulsar's varying
between radio wave and X-ray emissions
may be caused by changes in
the star's magnetosphere.
This suggestion brings them closer to
the electrical theorists' interpretation.
I just looked up a copy
of Healy and Peratt's paper,
their paper on pulsars back
in 1995, it was called
'Radiation Properties of Pulsar Magnetospheres:
Observation, Theory and Experiment'.
Healy was at the VLA, the Very Large
Array of national radio astronomy
in Socorro, New Mexico
and Peratt, of course,
was at Los Alamos Lab
and they did a very in-depth study of
all of the known properties of pulsars.
If you stop and think about
Healy and Peratt's ideas,
if this is an electrical oscillation, there are
all sorts of circuits that man uses now
and (that) have been developed in electrical
engineering laboratories, that put out
different signals at different
frequencies and switch back and forth
between one mode of operation
and another mode of operation.
So it's (a) strong strong strong
suggestion that what we are observing
is an electrical oscillation that has a
couple of different modes of operation.
We see it in the lab everyday.
The Healy and Peratt model of the
pulsing signals from a star
doesn't require a rotating
object or the lighthouse effect.
What it says in effect is that there is a
discharge that occurs close to the star
which then travels along
the magnetic field lines
outwards from the star where it meets
a disk of matter surrounding the star.
Where it meets that
more dense matter disk,
there is a kind of short circuit (that)
occurs and the signal is reflected.
It's just like a transmission line
in electrical engineering theory.
And in fact, the signal does reverse phase
which is what you'd expect in that condition.
So in other words, it's a kind of
confirmation of their model, if you like.
Now this particular pulsar
is switching between radio,
strong radio signals and strong X-ray
signals, for reasons that are unknown.
It suggests to me that where the short
circuit occurs in this signal regime,
in a less dense atmosphere
you're getting radio signals,
radio pulses. In a
more dense atmosphere
it forms more like a lightning discharge
and X-rays are being generated.
So that would be my view
of this particular pulsar.
What Healy and Peratt have
done is to provide a model
which is amenable to experiment and to
verification on Earth in the laboratory;
as distinct from a model which
invokes an unknown form of matter,
a neutron star,
and an object rotating faster than
a dentist's drill in some cases.
It seems to me that until
we get the concepts right,
we will never get
a correct answer.

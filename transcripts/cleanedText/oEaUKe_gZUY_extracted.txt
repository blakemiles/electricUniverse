You've just entered the
theater of an alien sky.
If the words and images seem strange to
you there's a reason for this.
Our world was once a
vastly different place.
To experience this won't hurt you
and there is nothing to fear.
The mythic archetype of a
great ancestral warrior or hero
is surely the most popular
mythic theme of all time.
And yet, thousands of years after the
first expressions of the archetype,
can anyone rightfully claim to
have penetrated the mystery?
Even today, despite countless
volumes written on the subject,
a convincing answer seems
entirely out of reach.
What human experience could have inspired
a worldwide image of a superhero
rescuing the world, from chaos monsters?
That's just one of the globally repeated mysteries.
Why the birth of this great ancestor
from the womb of a revered mother goddess?
Why the exposure or abandonment
of the hero at birth?
Or the murder or displacement of his father?
Why was the god himself so
frequently identified as an
unerring arrow, sword, spear or hammer, a weapon
that turns out to be a cosmic thunderbolt.
Yes! A thunderbolt, but with no similarity
to lightning in our sky today.
Absolutely nothing makes sense
under any familiar references.
And yet the themes are so fully
connected that one archetypal
attribute leads seamlessly
to another, then another.
There must be an explanation, and yet
common beliefs will not permit an explanation.
That's the logical contradiction arising
from today's accepted stories of human history
and planetary history. The problem lies in an
unsupported theoretical assumption.
The assumption is: As today, so before.
Well, that's a trap;
It holds our attention on today's
uneventful solar system,
even as the human record
speaks with a thousand voices
for a violent and catastrophic
planetary history.
In popular accounts, the prominent heroes
are quasi-divine, big and strong men
who rescue humanity from chaos monsters.
One astronomical tradition after another
names this warrior figure as the planet Mars.
The farther back we go the more the
divine or celestial character
of the hero stands out. Such Egyptian
warrior figures as Shu,
or Horus, or Amon were originally 
celestial figures beyond a shadow of a doubt,
but later localized through
regional storytelling.
The same can be said of the ancient Sumerian
and Akkadian counterparts, Damuzi
or Tammuz, the Mars gods Ningirsu
or Nergal, and even Gilgamesh.
Eventually, localized cult practices
transformed such figures into legendary
ancestors of those recounting the stories.
Our answer to the dilemma
lies in a testable reconstruction of
things never imagined in our time.
The reconstruction leads us back to a
gathering of planets close to Earth,
all the events occurring prior to the
present organization of the solar system.
Planets have not always
moved on their present courses.
Our subject is the ancient
polar configuration,
where the warrior-hero finds a full and
complete explanation in the activity of
the dark, reddish, innermost sphere.
The planet Mars was the centerpiece
of the cosmic thunderbolt.
The testability of this
reconstruction lies in the contribution
a visible forms and explicit
sequences of events;
all testifying to the global
substructure of human memory.
What will happen to our
understanding of human history
if it can be seen beyond
any reasonable doubt
that the warrior-hero archetype requires
celestial events having no parallel in
natural experience today?
What does it mean when
the warrior-king on Earth
symbolically dons, as his crown, the
revered glory of heaven.
That even meant the king's conjunction
with, and marriage to the archetypal star
goddess, identifiable as the planet Venus.
Many parallel symbols are equally
important. Just one example is the
identification of the exploding radiance,
the essential quality of the star
goddess, as the warrior-king's
shield, mythically his
gift from the goddess.
That identification magically confirms
the local king as an incarnation, or
avatar of a celestial prototype, the
warrior king as mythic protector and
owner of the terrifying glory. That's
what the word hero literally means.
Name any broadly repeated theme
attached to the hero archetype,
observe it's place in the reconstruction,
and you'll find additional themes
that are just as explicit.
No room for ambiguity or for simply
making up explanations.
Ask the question. Does
any popular explanation
actually work? In the context of our
reconstruction, the required patterns
must show up. Globally.
If the events occurred.
We'll follow that logic to further conclusions
in our next segment.

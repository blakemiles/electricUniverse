Welcome the Space News from the Electric
Universe, brought to you by The
Thunderbolts Project
at Thunderbolts.info. The Electric
Universe community consists of individuals
who seem to share a common trait.
That is the tendency to question ideas
and beliefs that academia
and society at large accept as true. It's
easy to recognize the obstinacy
or close mindedness in others but do we
recognize these tendencies in ourselves?
Today, thunderbolts colleague Chris Reeve
discusses the lifelong challenge the
human beings face,
both individually and collectively, to
develop the necessary skills and means
to determine what is true. Although we
don't normally experience it,
people deal with fear and anxiety at
every moment of our
our lives. Fear that the Earth might
become uninhabitable,
fear of war, fears about our family and
fear that we might lose our jobs. However
we don't feel these
fears a lot of times because we've
created
effective, partially subconscious, anxiety
management systems.
These subconscious systems provide us much
comfort
and room for more complex thought, insofar
as they
tirelessly work towards keeping us
alive and out of harm's way.
But they can also form a hidden barrier to
the desire to adaptively change for our
surroundings.
The development of a more complex mental
framework,
a self transforming mindset, can help the
individual to recognize the filtering
effect
and limitations of his or her round frame
of reference.
The late philosopher Stephen Toulmin once
said: "A man demonstrates his rationality,
not by a commitment to fixed ideas,
stereotyped procedures or immutable
concepts,
but by the manner in which, and the
occasions on which, he changes
those ideas, procedures and concepts."
Quoting Kierkergaard he added:
"Concepts, like individuals, have their
histories,
and are just as incapable of
withstanding the ravages of
time as are individuals." I wanna talk in
this video
about the psychology of change and my
intention is to show that
changes to society's scientific worldview
reflect in some key ways the process of
change that occurs at the level of the
individual.
Both possess its inherent resistance
to change which some psychologists have
likened to an immune system.
Understanding how this immunity to new
ideas works,
at both the individual and societal
levels,
is a necessary prerequisite for any
intent to deeply understand
how people engage scientific
controversies. Most
people who follow this business of change in the
sciences will tend to point to the work
of Thomas Kuhn
whose ideas are just as relevant today
as they were when he said them in the
sixties.
I wanna talk about his work but I
wanna first diverge from the
traditional treatment of this subject by
also mixing in the more recent work
of two Harvard
psychologists, Robert Kegan and Lisa Laskow
Lahey.
Authors of the book, Immunity to Change,
how to overcome it and unlock potential
in yourself
and your organization. Although Kegan and Lahey wrote
Immunity to Change to help
individuals and businesses, the framework
is also an unintentional commentary on
the role of worldviews
in scientific discourse. There are some
important fundamental takeaways from
Kegan and Leahy
which we can put to use towards
improving scientific discourse.
I want to run through some quotes from
their book to demonstrate them.
Quote: "Many if not most, of the
change challenges you face today
and will face tomorrow require
something more than
incorporating new technical skills into
your current mindset.
These are the 'adaptive challenges'
and they can only be met by transforming
your mindset, by advancing to a more
sophisticated stage of mental development...
Heifertz said the biggest error
leaders make is when they apply
technical means to solve
adaptive challenges." The mere existence
of an immune system,
which protects us but also precludes
change,
suggests that our tendency in the face of
some challenge will be to seek out
technical solutions
which abide by our pre-existing
worldview. In certain circumstances
this system of immunity can actually
block our ability to implement changes
which we actually desperately desire.
Note that
interesting similarity in approach to
ad hoc modeling,
this increasingly common modeling
technique which seeks to
fit scientific theory to observations
through
tweaks to the prior underperforming model.
As I read these quotes about our
personal immune systems,
think about it how they might apply also
to the larger scientific community as
well.
Change does not fail to occur because of
insincerity,
the heart patient is not insincere about
his wish to keep living,
even as he reaches for another cigarette.
Change fails to occur because we mean
both things,
it fails to occur because we are a living
contradiction. When we make a new year's
resolution
we look at the behaviors we seek to
extinguish as bad,
we look at the behaviours we want to
amplify as good but until we understand
the commitments
that make the obstructive behaviors at
the same time brilliantly
effective, we haven't correctly formulated
the problem.
We have learned something that may be
very hard for successful capable
people to believe. More than we
understand,
most people deal constantly with fear.
I'm not afraid!
You know you are saying to yourself right
now, "I feel fine".
And you're right, you do not feel your fear. The
reason you do not is because
you are dealing with it. Though you're
not aware of it, you have created a very
effective
anxiety management system and that system is
what we call, "the immunity to change".
But we run these systems, even highly
successful anxiety management systems,
at a cost. Inevitably they create blind
spots,
prevent new learning and constantly
constrain action in some aspects of our
living.
These costs show up when we are unable
to deliver on some genuinely desired
change.
The realization of which will bring
us to a new higher level of functioning
in ways we truly want to attain.
Most self improvement efforts take place
in too constricted a psychological space,
blind to this bigger dynamics at play.
However hard they work,
however sincerely they seek to
extinguish their obstructive behaviors,
everything will go on within the
existing mind set.
No new learning can occur. When I read
this book I was just stunned by the
applicability of these ideas to the world
of scientific research,
science education and scientific
discourse. Kegan and Lahey are not just
describing the challenge of change
within a personal context,
which is their intended focus. Their
analysis also applies just as well to the
challenge of change in scientific theory.
If they are right that leaders will
tend to mistake
adaptive change challenges for technical
challenges
then this mistake should be written all over our
worst performing scientific theories.
In scientists' attempts to solve a
stubborn problem,
we should expect to see our most
brilliant leaders applying the most
sophisticated tools available to them
but restricted to the context of the
accepted scientific framework.
Re framing to an alternative framework
will predictably reduce
the available tool set but it should
not be surprising if it also offers far
simpler solutions.
These less technical solutions should not
be judged inferior,
simply because they are less technical.
Listen to Kegan and Lahey explaining immune
system metaphor: "We use the medical
metaphor of immunity
quite mindfully to signify that, first
of all,
this phenomenon is not in itself a bad
thing.
On the contrary, an immune system is, most
of the time, a beautiful thing, an
extraordinarily intelligent force that
elegantly acts to protect us, to save our
lives.
However, in some instances an immune
system can threaten our continued good
health.
When it rejects the material, internal or
external to the body,
that the body needs to heal itself or
to thrive, the immune system can put us in
danger.
In these instances the immune system is no
less focused on protecting us.
It is just making a mistake. It does
not understand that it must alter
its code. It does not understand that,
ironically, in working to protect us,
it is actually putting us at serious
risk." And this brings us to the
second significant implication of Kegan and
Lahey's work. Kegan and Lahey's solution to the
problem;
The way to achieve change transcends all
contexts.
It is to seek to transform our subject
object relationships.
Where we are currently subject to a
mindset,
we must learn to look at that mindset as
an
object. If that sounds confusing, you
just follow along and it will become clear.
If necessary pause the video and study the
diagram on the screen.
Kegan and Lahey state;
"The root of any way of knowing (what philosophers
call an
epistemology) is an abstract-sounding
thing called the 'subject-object
relationship'.
Any way of knowing can be described
with respect to that which it can
look at (object) and that which it looks
through (the filter or lens to which
it is subject).
Young children, for example, are still
subject to
their perceptions, so when something looks
small to them
(like cars and people viewed from the top of a tall
building),
they think it actually is small. 3- 4-
and 5-year-olds will look down say;
Look at the tiny people! Children of 8,9 and
10
can look at their perceptions. They will
say;
Look how tiny the people look! A way of
knowing becomes more complex
when it is able to look at what before
it could only look
through. In other words, our way of
knowing becomes
more complex when we create a bigger
system
that incorporates and expands on our
previous system.
This means that if we want to increase
mental complexity,
we need to move aspects of our meaning-
making from subject to object,
to alter our mindset so that a
way of knowing or making meaning
becomes a kind of 'tool' that we
have (and can control or use) rather than
something that
has us (and therefore controls and uses
us)"
Now, within that context let's talk
about
Thomas Kuhn. Kuhn was famous for
claiming that science
is characterized more by the
paradigms employed by scientists
than by their methods of inquiry. What he
seems to be arguing is that the
scientific community is subject
to certain fundamental ideas. Kuhn
characterized the history of science as
exhibiting two fundamentally distinct
scientific activities;
one whhat he calls "puzzle-solving" or
"normal science"
describes the majority of scientific
work; conducting experiments, making
observations, applying mathematical
models..
The second, much less common, scientific
activity
is that of revolutionary science. This is
the creation of new scientific paradigms.
Many people are already familiar with
Kuhn's basic claims
but perhaps fewer are aware of philosopher
Toulmin's
interesting addition. He rebutted that
paradigm change can occur during "normal
science" too,
through many minor conceptual shifts.
Quote: "In the evolution of concepts
as in biological evolution, Toulmin
argues, changes occur in populations.
Novel concepts come and go, but they
influence thinking in a given discipline
only when conditions are favorable; only
when the new concepts have 'advantages'
can they displace others." Joseph Novak
is an
education theorist and the creator of the
concept map, "approach to science
education".
He points to Toulmin's claim that new ideas
must find a niche
in order to survive. What I would add to
this is a warning to avoid constraining
this notion of paradigm change to just
conceptual bridges. I've, over the years,
witnessed this conversation about,
what a paradigm shift towards electrical
cosmology might look like.
What I've observed is that these
conversations almost
always ignore the role of our system of
communication
in facilitating such changes. Yet these
communication systems were never
intended to service this goal of
empowering and elaborating the most
deserving novel scientific ideas.
If that is what we want our online discourse
systems to do,
then that is what we must design then to
do.
In the same way that we had to build the
Internet to facilitate the nearly
instantaneous transmission of imagery
and videos across the globe,
we must like way, likewise squarely
address this issue of how to identify
the best ideas
at the fringes of mainstream science
if our goal is to facilitate
paradigm changes in scientific theory.
Academia has thus far refused to address
this problem,
probably because they are subject to it.
But maverick thinkers who can observe the
academic approach from
outside of the university system
have an advantage
in that they can witness the problems
of academic research as an
object. What I'm saying is that "outside
our matrix" can play a critical role in
the creation of discourse
systems which facilitate a more rapid
rate of innovation within the sciences.
And if such systems can be created, then
it is inevitable that they will in due
time be adopted by the academic
community.
There are several points I'd like
to conclude with. First,
the importance of qualitative research.
There's
movement in academia to question a
legitimacy of oftentimes
qualitative research in disciplines
like
Psychology and Sociology. Simultaneously,
the business community relies heavily
upon this
exact kind of research to make critical
decisions about
what products to create and sell. What I
wanna warn
against is approaching this problem of
improving the way we talk about science
in some sort of anti qualitative manner.
As any employee of any modern software
company will tell you,
psychology and sociology are absolutely
necessary to the design of
modern software systems. Second:
an importance of world view in
scientific discourse.
Modern science journalism has for
the most part attempted to mirror
academia's decision to largely ignore
many ongoing scientific
controversies. But what will
predictably happen with this approach
is this logical fallacy of assuming that all
other explanations had
been ruled out. A vital aspect of forming
expertise on scientific controversies
is running claims back and forth. We need
a scientific social network
which is designed to focus upon this
clash of worldviews in science.
Kegan and Leahy state the problem as
follows:
"If one is not to be forever captive of
one's own theory,
system, script, framework, or ideology,
one needs to develop an even more complex
way of knowing that permits one to look
at, rather than choicelessly through,
one's own framework. In such a case,
that framework becomes more preliminary
than ultimate,
more in process than magnum opus.
This breaks through to a bigger
emotional and mental space
that can seek out the framework's current
limitations
rather than merely defend the current
draft
as a finished product and regard all
suggestions to the contrary as a blow to
the self.
These three qualitatively different
levels of complexity --
the socialized mind, the self-authoring mind,
and the self-transforming mind --
thus represent three distinct
epistemologies.
Each way of knowing maintains an
equilibrium between what is subject and
what is object.
Growth in our way of knowing -- adapting --
involves disturbing this balance, and
learning to look
at what we were before looking through.
These are not just words to live by,
it's also a philosophy which we should
design the next generation of social
networks with.

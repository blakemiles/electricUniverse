Today, we continue our
examination of arguably
the most perplexing meteorite
ever discovered on planet Earth.
As science headlines have announced in
recent weeks, the so-called Hypatia stone,
a tiny rock fragment found in a
Libyan desert glass field is
"rattling" the solar system's status quo,
challenging astronomers'
fundamental ideas
about our solar system's
formation and history.
In 2015, a number of research
teams reported that the material
could not be identified based on any
known type of meteorite or comet.
As reported by phys.org
in January of 2018,
new scientific research by a team at
the University of Johannesburg has
"...provided unsettling answers that
spiral away from conventional views
of the material our solar
system was formed from."
The matrix of minerals
composing the Hypatia stone
resembles no known meteorite
or comet fragment
and consists of strange and
never-before-seen combinations of minerals.
The dust material found in the
fragments confounds the very core
of the solar nebula hypothesis.
As described by phys.org,
"Generally, science says that
our solar system's planets
ultimately formed from a huge,
ancient cloud of interstellar dust
(the solar nebula) in space.
The first part of that process
would be much like dust bunnies
coagulating in an unswept room.
Science also holds that the
solar nebula was homogeneous,
that is, the same kind
of dust everywhere.
But Hypatia's chemistry
tugs at this view."
Scientists analyzing the fragments suggest
they may be pieces of a deep space
cometary intruder which impacted
Earth around 29 million years ago.
But it's essential to remember
what we've actually observed
when comets have encountered
planets in modern times.
On two occasions in recent decades, when
astronomers have been able to anticipate
close encounters between
comets and planets,
the electromagnetic effects have been exponentially
greater than scientists had anticipated.
When Shoemaker-Levy 9 reached Jupiter
in 1994, the electromagnetic explosion
and unprecedented brightening of
the gas giant's radiation belts
"knocked" the astronomical
world off its feet.
More recently, when comet
Siding Spring approached Mars,
NASA's MAVEN team was amazed when the comet
"blew off" part of Mars's upper atmosphere
and the electrical nature
of these kinds of events
is finally becoming a part of
mainstream science literature.
In 2017, a scientific study published
in the Geophysical Research Letters
proposed that the mysterious
radiophonic sounds produced by some meteors
may ultimately be caused by giant electric
fields driving electric currents.
In this episode, our guest,
archaeologist Peter Mungo Jupp
continues his case that the Hypatia
stone's bizarre composition
may have resulted from the transmutation of
elements by high-energy electrical discharge.
Although reference is made
to the Hypatia stone's,
positioning in the
green glass fields of Libya,
it's mainly assumed that this
part of a disintegrating comet
allied with the
formation of the pebble.
Why is not the green glass
or a silicon unique as well?
Further, the vast stretches of sand
that make up the underlying component
of both of these geological curios,
are themselves relatively historic
as judged by the Egyptian sources and
petroglyphs strongly related to modern man.
Now also, we've got to take into
account the existence nearby
of Oasis crater
and Kibera crater.
They may be well involved in producing
these tektite-like formations.
These could well be
plasma discharge craters
with electrical machining able to
produce effects over a wide area.
The newly discovered role
of electrical discharge
in producing not only
shocked quartz,
but in all probability shock
diamonds, is not taken into account.
A new study from the University of
Pennsylvania reinforces this alternate,
but I suspect, prime method
of shocked rock creation. And I quote,
"To bolster the notion that rocks were
beat up in an extra-terrestrial impact,
geologists search for a
distinctive signature:
that is microscopic bands
in the mineral quartz,
created when powerful pressure
waves ripple through the rock.
This study suggests that a different sort of
shock can create the same banding patterns:
that is a lightning bolt."
The result of the study could cast further
doubt on claims of asteroid impacts
that relied on observations
of shocked quartz."
Now let's pause for a moment.
This could even more apply
to Anthony Peratt's historic
plasma discharge events
which are theorized to be millions of times
more powerful than ordinary lightning.
Mythology often talks of
the cosmic thunderbolt.
Could the Oasis crater be the
result of such a strike?
Does mythology provide us with
examples from this area?
In Greek mythology, such as Ovid's
Metamorphoses, Phaethon set out
but was entirely unable to
control the Sun chariot's horses.
They wandered too close to the
Earth and began to scorch it.
To prevent further damage,
Zeus, or as we name, Jupiter,
hurled a cosmic
thunderbolt at Phaethon
who fell to the earth at the mouth
of the river Eridanus in the Red Sea.
Such an archetypal
scenario may often reveal
historical clues to a
geological disaster.
Moreover, the role of electrical discharge
in creating new elements and compounds,
as per Matsumoto's studies of cold
electrofusion, does not rate a mention.
A cosmic electro-discharge
or magnetic reversal,
with its massive attendant current
flow, has shattering power,
particularly in the case of a major z-pinch
effect occurring above or below the Earth.
This could be a decisive factor
in explaining the curious, so-called,
cosmic mixture of compounds and
elements found in the Hypatia stone.
Finally, the noting of the rarer C-13 isotope
of carbon as distinct from carbon-12,
which is mainly found in
crustal carbon deposits,
assumes a cosmic origin for the
carbon components of the pebble.
However, deep earth layers of methane, kerogens,
petroleum and concretized crack filling,
as mentioned by Thomas Gold, are well
sourced with much higher levels of C-13.
So this may well be a simpler explanation
for the source of this phenomenon.
And I just note in passing the possibility of
scenarios of cosmic naphtha or petroleum
pervading the atmosphere mentioned in ancient
historical sources such as the Talmud.
It's also a clear possibility if
we can rely on historical fact.
Just remember, so often in science we
reject the clear witnesses to events
in ancient history
not seen today.
Can you imagine, an atmospheric
invasion of volatile hydrocarbons
well may be a source of diamonds
when a plasma discharge enters it.
So let's discuss some of the counters
to the extra-terrestrial theory.
The Hypatia stone differs from
the normal chondritic meteorites
due to dominance of carbon
as distinct from silicon.
It also contains compounds not
normally found in Earth's source rocks.
But could it, nevertheless, be an ejection
from a faraway impact source
similar to silicon
based tektites?
Tektites too are claimed
to be produced by impacts
that created tiny
classically shaped rocks.
These then travel long distances to be found
in a few strewn fields around the world.
But, remember, they're essentially made
of material from the impact source.
Could not the extraordinary conditions
needed for tektite production
be of a similar methodology?
Remember, there are several
different types of tektites,
even if they are
essentially silicon based.
This presumption of a cosmic
source for tektites, however,
rests purely on the pebbles'
relative uniqueness.
However, I would advocate that
a massive plasma discharge,
rather than a conventional
meteor impact,
presents a more likely scenario
for the eccentric creation
of the Hypatia stone's rare
combination of compounds.

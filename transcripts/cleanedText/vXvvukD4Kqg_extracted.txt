Recent episodes of Space News from
the Electric Universe have provided
a ground-breaking foundation for a
new beginning in Earth geology.
Thunderbolts contributor, Andrew Hall, has
introduced his hypothesis for the formation
of familiar geological features, not from
incremental processes over eons of time
but rather due to high energy electrical
discharges in Earth's unique atmosphere.
In this episode, Hall concludes his
video series with a closer examination
of evidence for dramatic electrical
scarring of our planet's surface.
In part 1 "A New Beginning" we introduced
the evidence of electro-hydrodynamic forces
that built mountains
in an instant.
The evidence is frozen into the shape
of land exactly as it occurred.
Let's review: An arcing current creates
a shock wave, that ablates the land,
raising a rooster tail of molten materials
to form the core of a mountain.
The expanding gas and
reflected shock wave
create an exploding
mushroom cloud in its wake.
And the updraft it forms provides
sustaining energy to the shock envelope
by drawing supersonic ground winds
through the standing waveform.
The supersonic ground
winds are channeled
by the shock waves to form
triangular buttresses.
A mountain displays
triangular buttresses
in a near perfect mold of the
waveform that created it,
even displaying complex pressure
variations within the waveform.
We've seen waveforms that displayed
expansion and contraction,
characteristics of super-imposed
transverse and longitudional waves.
We've seen waveforms that
display harmonic repetition
caused by shock wave reflection.
We've seen how the
elasticity of the substrate
and the shock wave interacting
in critical ways,
producing effects that we can
analyze, measure and quantify
from the known behavior
of shock waves.
Now let's look at some
electromagnetic effects.
The stratified layers of
triangular buttresses
are often segregated by
mineral composition,
this is evidence of
electromagnetism.
An electric field will ionize particles;
the magnetic field will sort them.
The results can be dramatic.
Stratification is evident at all
scales from large scale landforms
to the morphology of the rock itself,
right down to the microscopic scale.
The shock waves are
energized with current.
The shock wave is a
highly stressed region,
a dramatic shear zone of pressure,
temperature and current density.
Current coarsing through thin shock
waves molds the electromagnetic fields
in the coherent form
of the reflected shock
and sorts the material according
to its dielectric properties.
Arc flash necessarily has a
magnetic field surrounding it.
Magnetically generated horizontal
rotation seems to modify the winds,
adding momentum to one side and taking it
away on the other, creating asymmetry.
Polarization is seen here in this colorized
Schlieren photo of a supersonic shock wave.
It can produce a mild rotation
effect as seen on this mountain,
that displays triangular
buttresses on both sides,
indicating inflowing wind
that meet in the upground.
Or it can form shear winds
in opposite directions
leaving buttresses on one
side of a narrow ridge
or it can even scoop a
valley within a mountain.
One feature that appears often
is where an arc contacts ground.
The result is a blowout, a crater
blasted into the mountain.
These features are typically
asymmetrical craters
with the spill-out on one or
both sides of the mountain.
This mountain has
been split in two.
It appears in these instances the arc is
finding a conductive path beneath the ground,
perhaps a mineral
deposit or aquifer
and sends a forking tendril
to connect with it.
More evidence of the electrical
arcing that creates the mountains
is displayed in an unusual
way on Mt.Kavushku in Iran.
Here is the result of two arcs
interfering with each other.
The footprint of Mt. Kavushku
is seen in this overhead view
as the large symmetric
oval to the lower right.
The second astrobleme is the smaller kidney-shaped
hill connecting with it at the center.
Both are ringed by blast zones.
Here is a closer view.
Triangular buttresses can be seen
on both sides of the mountain
surrounded by the concentric
pressure ridges of the blast zone.
This view's been rotated,
so the small ridge along the bottom of
the frame is the second astrobleme.
What's unusual is that the second astrobleme
has cut the end off of Mt. Kavushku.
The second shockwave sliced
the tip of the mountain away.
Do you see how the sections have
fallen forward like slices of bread?
And the second arc deposited
entirely different material
between Mt. Kavushku
and its head.
The head still displays triangular
buttresses from inflowing supersonic winds.
The tip of the mountain has been
displaced forwards and sideways.
But if you piece it back
together, it fits nicely.
The shock events happened
almost simultaneously,
which is evident in the
pressure wave patterns
caused by shear winds between
the two blast zones.
The stratified layers show the opposing
directions of winds meeting at a shear zone,
which attests to the fact that it was
created in a single arc blast event.
The land didn't split apart
to separate the mountain.
Two forks of an arc reclosed and one
shock wave sliced the other apart.
Large mountains are also
built the same way.
Now that you recognize triangular
buttresses as shock wave forms,
let's look at what the
rooster tail can do.
You will recall the rooster tail is
like what you see behind a speed boat,
something like this.
This is the Mt. Fitzroy
group in Patagonia,
the southern end of the Andes on
the Argentinian-Chilean border.
The clean granite faces are a famous
challenge to big-wall mountain climbers.
You can see why.
You can also see how the rock
is layered almost vertically
at one orientation in the core and
another orientation on the flanks.
Its height is a little
over 11,000 feet.
The core of the mountain has been sucked
up into a series of narrow shards
by the rooster tail of an
extremely powerful shockwave
created by an atmospheric
arcing current.
Its flanking ridges are
layered onto the core,
welded in parallel,
stratified layers,
perpendicular to the
wind that made them,
oriented radially
towards the core.
And triangular buttresses show their
consistent angles of reflection
on the western flanks.
Here the Sun catches the large
triangular features well in this view.
Of course, other big mountains
were made this way too.
I can't think of the
name of any right now
but we will find some
new case studies soon.
There is a great deal more to be
said about the electric earth.
You are watching the results of
a new research as it unfolds.
Arcs in the atmosphere, blistering
mountains with arc blasts,
is not all there is to
the form of the Earth.
However, there had been ten
visually evident similarities
presented between mountain
forms and shock waves.
Skeptics like to say extraordinary
claims require extraordinary proof.
For mountains to display the
exact features of shock waves,
including repeating reflected
standing waveforms,
superpositioned transverse and longitudional
wave expansion and compression,
harmonic reflection, wind- and shock-oriented
stratification, pressure ridges,
normal shocks, waveform compression and
cancellation, waveform instability,
expansion fans and
boundary effects,
all of which collectively point to a single
coherent shock event of their origin,
begs for a coherent explanation.
No uniformitarian
theory provides that.
The arc blast model does.
Others with perspectives and skills
that complement mine are involved.
As we gather and prepare new evidence
for presentation, please stay tuned.

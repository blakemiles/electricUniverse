You've just entered the
theater of an alien sky.
If the words and images seem strange
to you there's a reason for this,
our world was once a
vastly different place.
To experience this
won't hurt you
and there is nothing to fear.
Before the Counting of Time
In previous episodes
of this series,
we've claimed that the
first civilizations arose
under the influence of
extraordinary natural events.
But these events including phases
of overwhelming catastrophe
remain largely
unrecognized today.
In supporting this extraordinary
claim, we've offered global evidence
suggesting an ancient gathering
of planets close to Earth.
We've called this planetary
assembly The Polar Configuration
due to its alignment with the
rotational axis of the Earth.
Documentation supporting a
reconstruction of the configuration
comes down to us from
cultures the world over,
we see the events reflected
in the rise of kingship,
the emergence of the
first writing systems,
of monumental construction,
and the great national
wars of expansion,
all explicitly linked to
intensely remembered events
when planets appeared
to battle in the sky
as clouds of celestial
debris shrouded the Earth
and great volumes of dust and
rock fell upon our planet.
We've called this human memory "The
One Story Told Around The World."
The universal tradition takes us back to an
age of planetary gods and celestial wonders,
the universal source of the world's
archetypal myths and symbols.
And so we've claimed that
there could be no archetypes
without the implied
global experience.
It's the common experience that gives
the archetypes both their context
and their concrete
detail the world over.
We now know that since the dawn
of the great civilizations,
memories of fear-inspiring catastrophe
pervaded all of human activity,
an outpouring of imagination
and pervasive fear,
doomsday anxiety
showed its face in every
culture that followed.
And above all else, this body of
magical and ritual practices
sought to deflect or to forestall the
return of remembered catastrophe.
Our historical argument is drawn upon
evidence left by the great civilizations
starting with the appearance
of formal writing systems.
But there is also a layer
of prehistoric evidence
and this archaeological layer can
help us to visualize celestial events
before the appearance
of any written records.
This prehistoric evidence directs
our attention to the human response
in the very midst
of a deadly threat,
in other words, contemporaneous with
Earth-threatening catastrophe.
Here we're not dealing just with a
compulsion to reenact celestial dramas
but something more
immediate and more urgent,
refuge.
Human beings either seeking shelter
from anticipated catastrophe
or desperate to find refuge from
catastrophe already under way.
Seen from this more
radical perspective,
today's common picture
of a prehistoric world
takes on nuances that archeologists
appear to have missed.
Critical lines of evidence converge to
suggest a human retreat into caves.
Or alternately to find refuge in
crudely constructed stone enclosures
or earthen mounds
as defenses against rock and celestial
debris falling from the sky.
To appreciate the
perspective offered here,
we need only allow for
the implied urgency,
and that's a consideration virtually never
included in standard treatments of prehistory.
What was on the minds of
those who entered caves
or raised giant stone dolmens
or great mounds of earth,
seemingly with no clear
motive to account for them.
How much of this activity might be
explained in terms of perilous events
once occurring in the sky
but not occurring today.
Such events could only mean that the
present cannot be the key to the past,
and a fundamental premise of
modern science must be corrected.
From this vantage point,
certain features stand out.
The urgency is endlessly reflected in
the crude architecture of the dolmens
that punctuate ancient landscapes
across the British Isles
and Northern Europe, all the
way to Russia and Korea
and even with counterparts
in North America.
Such structures are
readily distinguished
from the more ambitious and more
obviously skillful architecture
that followed with the emergence
of the great civilisations
of Egypt and Mesopotamia.
How significant for example
are the repeated indications of
interruption and incompletion?
In numerous instances as if a
massive undertaking was begun
but ended in tragedy and
was never finished.
That should not surprise us if these
undertakings occurred in the presence
of the very catastrophe that all
ancient communities most feared.
In many instances, a partial seemingly
irrational raised roof draws our attention,
entirely out of proportion
to its support.
Indeed the massive stone roofs are
commonly the most imposing structure.
Has any historian or
archeologist ever explained
this human investment
across the vast region?
When you see the undertaking as
a defense against falling rock,
the mystery of human
motivation instantly vanishes.
Other considerations also
enter this picture.
The apparent role of celestial
catastrophe will not permit us
to ignore the implied context of
extended deprivation and nostalgia
as we can see in the conditions
portrayed on the walls of caves.
In the catastrophic
environment suggested here,
what might the paintings of human
hunting and abundant game be telling us?
A familiar phrase from American
Indian tradition comes to mind,
the happy hunting ground.
Not an illogical phrase if the actual
condition was one of profound nostalgia.
Were the artist painting on
walls of caves and rocky cliffs
nostalgically remembering
something lost?
Psychologists know well that
in a state of deep deprivation
the mind will become increasingly
obsessed with what is missing
or what has been taken away.
That point was made explicit in
an army experiment years ago.
When placed on a narrow diet
of nothing but potatoes,
those participating in the experiment
began to dream nostalgically
of the missing diet.
Perhaps of steak dinner, their
favorite beer or her apple pie.
In this case we have
two different themes,
humans retreating to caves
and their nostalgic
remembrances,
both pointing in precisely
the same direction.
Look again at the prehistoric paintings on
the cave walls across Europe and beyond,
the hunting scenes and
the abundant game.
Could we entertain the possibility
that these scenes actually celebrate
a community life no longer
available but actively remembered?
Why such pervasive nostalgia if nothing
had been taken away by natural events?
With that concrete question in front
of us, additional questions arise.
Is it possible to identify such an
experience in the thematic links
of the cave dwellers to the emerging
civilizations that followed?
Or is there a connection to the
explosion of monumental construction
launched almost simultaneously
in Egypt and Mesopotamia?
Since Napoleon first stood in awe
of the wonder of the Great Pyramid,
scientific commentary was taken over by
questions of technology and architecture
but have we missed something?
In the conditions of the time, what was
the role of human urgency or protection,
in particular, the protection
of kings and royal families.
And how might our picture
of the ancient world,
the rise of kingship itself,
or the explosion of
military conquests
be changed when seen in the light
of an Earth-threatening sky?
Answering such questions will require us to
see the ancient monuments in a new light.
And the Great Pyramid becomes something
more than an enchanting monument
standing out on the
ancient landscape,
more than just a dark chamber
for practicing magical rites,
or recording hieroglyphic
prayers to the gods,
or charting a sky map to guide the
mythic ascent of deceased kings.
Of course, such motives
are well documented
but could there be
more to the story?
What was on the minds of those who invested
vast resources in urgent construction?
In the following episodes, we'll
consider a new perspective,
one in which all of the
ancient motives converge
as a testament to
remembered catastrophe.
In particular, a desperation
for protection
against unpredictable rains
of rocky debris from the sky
to which we shall add a noteworthy
emphasis on the planet
repeatedly named as the
source of falling stone,
the planet Mars.

You've all heard all sorts of mention in
the last couple of days and you will
continue to hear mention of this thing called the
Birkeland Current. And all of you, to a lesser or
greater degree, have some idea about
what is meant by that term. What I'd like
to do is to give you some results that I've
developed over the last year to try to nail down
some of the properties of Birkeland
Currents. There are some well-known
properties of Birkeland Currents
that I think most of you will know.
In no particular order, the definition of it,
it's the flow of electrical charge in space.
So, that means there is an electrical
current. The flow of charge - how many
Coulombs pass up an observation point - in one
second, constitutes the amperage of that current.
Currents create magnetic fields. In other
words, if you have a Birkeland Current , if you
have a current, you will have a magnetic
field. And if you have a magnetic field,
you better remember that there's a current there
that made it. Some astronomers lack that insight,
I guess. One example of a Birkeland Current
is the one that connects the Sun to the Earth,
that powers up the Aurora Borealis and the Aurora
Australis. And the man who discovered that fact,
was Christian Birkeland, after whom those
flows are named. He was dogged for years
by a man whose name was Sydney Chapman,
an astronomer who claimed that Birkeland was crazy.
Obviously there could be no flow of current - of
charge - through space. It would all dissipate.
At first they said, well, space is an insulator,
you can't get current through an insulator.
Then they changed their mind and said, oh
no, no, no, space is a perfect conductor.
Well you can't have it both ways. Actually, the latter
is closer to the truth. Space contains plasma and
plasma is a very good, not perfect, but very good
conductor. And so, when charge flows in a plasma, it has
certain properties. There's a picture of what those
Birkeland Currents look like. They come from the Sun
and they drop down into that cone at the north
pole and the south pole of the magnetosphere.
Typical properties of Birkeland currents:
They twist; they often come in pairs; they
produce helical magnetic fields - we'll
talk some about that. In fact, we'll talk
a lot about that in the next half hour. Sometimes
they're called ‘vortices’; they form filaments in sunspot
penumbras. You've probably seen those. There's a picture
of what they look like. On the right is a single Birkeland
Current - you can see the twist. In the left-hand picture,
when it's magnified, you can see they do very often
come in pairs. They're very straight, typically. They
can curve and twist too, but they are straight and
that's a mystery. If you have a fire hose and
you spray a fire hose, if I had one in my hand, I
don't think I could hit somebody sitting in the back row
of the room. The thing would dissipate. These things,
contrary to Sydney Chapman, do not dissipate.
And the question is why, and I hope to answer
that this morning. They connect stars in strings.
A number of years ago, you've probably
heard somebody say, “Gee, it looks like those stars
form in strings.” Astronomers say, “No, no that's an
optical illusion, they don't form in strings.”
Yes, they do form in strings and those
strings are Birkeland Currents. The
Birkeland Currents also connect galaxies.
Just a couple of weeks ago, I think Wal
mentioned this the other day, there was
an announcement in Science Digest that
astronomers - Australian astronomers,
coupled with some [astronomers] here -
have discovered that galaxies do indeed
form on strings, which is a big reversal.
Anyway, I developed over the last year a method
for taking a close look at what the magnetic
field is - what it looks like, the structure of
it, around the Birkeland Current. Let's just assume,
in your mind's eye for a second, in space you've got this
bunch of charges that are flowing
along. What will happen? I've just
said they'll make a magnetic field. Sure,
but what will the shape of that field be,
and what will the properties of that that whole
operation look like? I've discovered, because of the
results of this work, that the magnetic
force fields that surround Birkeland Currents
reach out vastly - and I can't overemphasize that
word too much - vastly farther into space than
previously thought. The magnetic fields that
the Birkeland Currents create, wrap around them,
similar to the bindings of Roman fasces.
You know the fascist business? You
can take a bunch of sticks and wrap
it up and it's much stronger with the
wrapping than the individual sticks
would be. I searched the internet for a
picture of a Roman fasces and that's the best one I can
come up with. Clearly, that winding goes around in one
direction, but in reality - maybe not on that picture -
it also wraps around, going back from left to right and
right to left. I'll talk more about that
in a second. What is a minimum energy
field? Somebody mentioned that the other day.
In nature, stuff tends to seek a minimum energy.
Water runs downhill. Perfume spreads out - will
diffuse - right up uncorking the perfume bottle. In
a few minutes the people in the back of
the room would smell the perfume. People
in the front row would smell it first, and after a while,
if I left it open long enough, there would be a level
concentration of perfume throughout the room.
And so, stuff just tends to shrink away. If you
push on it, it'll move away to avoid the
push. And it's a natural thing. Lightning
follows whatever path seems to lead downward
to a lower voltage. Planets. One of the primary
claims of the Electric Universe is that the
separation of the planets is due to a push-pull, back
and forth, a jockeying. Many people don't
realize that the planet Venus has a long tail.
That tail carries electric charge and
it just flicks the outer regions of our
magnetosphere as Venus passes
between us and the Sun. And if
we get too close, our theory is that it is a push.
On Earth electricity goes wherever you lead it.
The wire goes like that, that's the way the current
is going to go. Provided, of course, you put a
voltage at one end and a lower voltage
at the other end, so that the charge can
flow downhill to a minimum energy. In space
however, it goes wherever it wants to, because
there are no wires. So that lightning,
that charge moving through space, (in this
case through our atmosphere) is following
a path that it wants to, to get from a
higher voltage to a lower voltage, why doesn't it go
in a straight line? Well, because it meets up with all
sorts of stuff in the atmosphere. Little
regions, clouds of charge, changes in
humidity, maybe a cloud or something here
or there. It is going as it senses downhill, just
the way water would ripple down
over the surface of a mountainside.
And of course, if you really get out in
space, it does go where it wants to,
as long as you leave it alone, as long
as you don't put any rocks in its path.
As long as you don't put a magnetic field there
that will disturb the direction of that flow.
That's the jet from the M87 [galaxy].
And that jet is several hundred light years
long. See how well it's collimated. It's a
heck of a lot better than your garden hose.
So the question is why is it collimated?
Why does it stick together like that?
Well, there's one thing that even that jet
from M87 senses and that is the Lorentz force.
There's a current there, right? And if there's
a current, you know there's a magnetic field.
Well, if a current crosses over a magnetic
field, you get what's called the Lorentz force.
This is as complicated as the talk
gets. So, don't sweat. If you point
your red arrow in the direction of
the current flow and it crosses a
magnetic field, that's the direction of
the blue arrow. And you point your
fingers in the direction of the red arrow,
and then move your fingers toward the
direction of the blue arrow. So, we
start with the current and then move
toward the magnetic field. Your thumb
is going to be in the direction of the
force that those charges are going to
experience. In other words, in this
situation, the charge which is flowing from left to
right will start to curl up. That's how cyclotrons
work. You know the things go around in a circle
and the radius is called the Larmor radius.
Well, anyway that's the only force that charge
moving in free space - if you leave it alone - will
suffer. It'll feel that Lorentz force.
I realized that - and I didn't invent that
idea, I just realized it - and then I
found in Tony Peratt's book an equation
that says if you want to have a cosmic Birkeland
Current at a minimum energy, suffering no forces,
the way to get the Lorentz force to zero,
is to have that Birkeland Current look
like this. And out comes this big equation. Now
if you're a mathematician - and I am surely not -
then you can visualize what that
structure has to be. Well, I looked at
that equation for a long time and as I say
this talk is a non-mathematical talk, but...
[Quoted link is invalid] ... you can see
the paper and you can wallow around in
the mathematics as much as you want to.
What I did was when I got that equation,
I plugged it into a computer and did an
iterative solution, almost exactly the
same as Dr. Wolf was talking about,
in the generation of fractals. You get the
equation, pick a number, stick it in and
see what you get. And take that number
and stick it back in the equation and see what
that produces. And eventually you get this trail.
Well, I didn't generate anything as
wild as a fractal, but I did come up
with a solution. I will show you the
solution in a second. But the purpose was
to get an equation which would result in a
Birkeland curve, that is free. Left alone.
Leave it on its own devices, what will it look like?
To understand this, we have to talk a
little bit about cylindrical coordinates.
Is there anybody who doesn't have any
idea what a cylindrical coordinate is?
Cartesian coordinates are the x, y and z
 in there. You see the x, y and z?
z is the vertical axis. x is coming out
at you, and y is going from left to right.
We want to specify the position of a
point like this guy up here. You can
specify: it's this far in the x-axis,
this far in the y-axis and this far in the z-axis.
That's the point. Cylindrical coordinates is the same
thing, except instead of the x- and y- 
axes (you still use the same Z-axis),
but instead of x and y, you replace x and
y by, at what angle are you from the
center of this cylinder, from this pipe?
And how far out are you? So,
think about a Birkeland Current.
Think about an oil pipeline or a water
pipeline. It doesn't make any difference
where z is particularly, because it's all
the same. Things don't change in a
cylinder. It doesn't even depend on where
you are in theta, because it's 
symmetrical. It doesn't make any
difference where you're at the three
o'clock position, the six o'clock position,
where you are. The radius, oh yes, that
makes a big difference. How far you are
out from the center of the thing. That is critical.
So, I'm trying to plot the magnitude and
the direction of the magnetic field, and that's 
this B vector. The B Vector has two components,
one in the direction of the flow - z, and 
one in the wrap-around direction, the
theta direction. So, if you can come up
with a solution that will enable you to tell
what B(z) is and what B(theta) is,
how strong they are for any given
radius you are out from the center of
this thing, then you can predict and plot
what the magnetic field is going to look like.
OK, now hold on to your seats because
there's the answer. It may not make much
sense looking at it, but let me see if I can
explain what I'm talking about. The black line
is the strength - it starts off there at 1 - of
the axial magnetic field, B(z). That's how
strong the field is along the axis of the flow.
The red component is the strength
of the wraparound field [B(theta)].
The horizontal axis here is not time.
Please, it's not time. It's the radius, the
radial distance you are out from the center of this flow.
So, can you begin to see what's going to happen?
Right at zero, or as close to the vertical
axis as we can get, the wraparound - the red -
there is no wraparound field. It's 
all parallel; the magnetic field is
exactly in the same direction as the current.
And then, as you begin to come away from -
that is increase the radius - that axial field 
component.... Of course you know the sum
of the two vectors B(z) and B (theta) is the B that
we're looking for. So, what's the sum of two component
vectors? Well, it's the square root of the sum of 
the squares, right? Well, that's the light blue curve.
So, the light blue curve, the cyan curve,
is the total strength of the magnetic field
as a function of how far you come out
from the center of a Birkeland Current.
And other than maybe a couple 
of little ripples at the close-in,
small values of r, it comes down pretty well,
decaying like any decaying exponential right?
Well, no not like any decaying exponential.
The purple curve is one over the square root of r.
Most people will say OK. If you know
what we are so proud of in the Electrical
Universe and that is we're always saying to the
astronomers that gravity goes down as one over r squared,
and the magnetic field from a wire carrying a current
goes down as only 1/r. That's a much less rapid decay.
1/r is much less rapid than one over r squared.
This goes down as one over the square root of r.
So, this stuff reaches out into space
much farther than we had heretofore
thought, because there are no wires up
there. We don't get any 1/r decay. We
get a one over the square root of r decay,
which means this stuff has a much
wider effect than we had ever sensed
before. Also, if you think about it, try to
visualize in your mind's eye what's going to happen
as you go out to higher values of r. First, the
axial strength is getting weaker and the
red curve is building up to a maximum.
That maximum occurs almost (not
during the first cycle but the other
cycles) - it's almost exact - the maximum 
of the curlicue kind of the curling around
field occurs when the axial field component 
is zero. So, what that means is, just look at these
11 plots. Just look at step number 1.
Think of yourself as you’re above this
Birkeland Current that’s in the cylinder.
The cyan-colored arrows are the
direction of the field. The whole field,
because there is no wrap-around.
And then, as you come to step number 2,
that's a little farther away from the
axis of the flow, and you can see that the
curl-around field begins to contribute. The
axial field gets weaker and the
whole thing begins to tilt. And so,
this magnetic field begins to wrap
like a fasce around the current.
In step number 3 you see that the
wrap-around field is stronger yet.
The white arrows in each of these successive
diagrams [are a repeat of the previous one]
and so each successive diagram is
one layer higher, away from the
center of this flow. The white field shows
what is happening just below the blue field.
Eventually, when you get to somewhere out here
between 4 and 5, you can see that the white
arrows are really zero. Notice there is no
axial magnetic field. It's all wrap- around.
It's just as though you took tape and
just wrapped it around that pipe.
And then, as you go farther and farther
away, the axial field actually reverses
direction, begins to come back at you and so
the curl is down. And then... when you get to
number 6, the axial field has reversed and is just
against you. Again, what's going on between 6 and 7?
Well,... at 6 the wraparound field is zero
and at 7 it's beginning to wrap the other way.
So, first of all it wraps this way. Then it goes back
down that way. Perhaps some of you have seen that
diagram that was published by one of
our EU heroes, Hannes Alfven. You can
see that the red arrow is right near the center of the
flow, and (what should I say) the pitch of it is not
very high at all. Then the farther out
you get, like you go to the blue arrow
then the pitch is less. It's a finer thread, if you will.
And then finally out to the green arrow,
well that's out there somewhere between my diagram 3 and 4.
The axial field is zero and the thing just goes
around. That's fine as it goes.
As far as it goes, Alfven was right.
He just didn't go far enough, because 
the next radius out, bigger than the green
circles there, would produce something like the blue,
except with a wider radius. And instead of going up, it
would come down. Let me give you
an analogy. The perfume bottle when I
opened it, would go to all corners of the room.
It would spread out in all dimensions.
This is also a minimum-energy field and that
means that this magnetic field is going to wrap
around the current, every possible way it can.
And so it isn't just going to go clockwise and then stop.
It's going to go clockwise and then
counterclockwise, and come back down again. So,
the question is, well so what?
Well, here's the comparison of the field
strengths. The yellow curve is one
over the square root of r. The purple
curve is the wire's magnetic field
which is 1/r, and if you look at a
couple of different radial distances,
there my observation number 2 says
that the Birkeland Current magnetic field
is 32 times stronger than gravity at r=10.
And it's even 3.2 times stronger than the previous EU
estimate which [was based on] the magnetic field in a wire.
But there aren’t any wires out there,
So, therefore it spreads out even farther.
The Lorentz force compresses matter at
various radial fields, I don't know how
much longer I got here, but let me just try to
give you what I think is the most important thing.
Here's a picture that looks like a bullseye,
as you're looking down a Birkeland Current.
[Pay attention to the thin little
black circles with numbers. The numbers
at the various radius distances correlate with the
numbers that you see in the field strength figure below].
For example at about 31. That's a 
place where the axial strength is zero.
So what you've got is simply the
wraparound magnetic field, the red is at a
maximum, and so there's what I've tried to draw
there at 31, you can see that's a strong wraparound
current. If you come out to radius 73,
you can see that again, you're at a
point where the wraparound field is very 
strong. The axial field is zero and so what you
got is the thing goes around the other way.
Okay, so what? Well, consider yourself
as a positive charge and you're
heading down the highway here.
You are going to either intercept,
depending on how far your path is,
whether you're right at the center or
whether you're a little bit farther out
from the center of this flow, are you in
the right hand lane or the high-speed
lane, you're going to encounter either this
(at that point) downward magnetic field,
or, if you're out here, you'll encounter an upward
magnetic field. You see it? Well, now think about
the Lorentz force. If you're at radius 31,
you're going that way, the magnetic field is down,
and so you've got a force pushing you in
toward the center. Remember the Lorentz force:
you put your fingers in the direction
of the flow of a current charge,
then change them into the direction of
the magnetic field and your thumb tells
you what the push is going to be. So you've got current
going in at radius 31. You've got a magnetic field
downward. So, in, down, the force is in. So any charge
around the radius 31 is going to be squeezed into
the middle. Is that good? Yes, it's good 
because in the middle you've got a very strong
axial [magnetic field]. The black line is at a maximum.
You got a strong field going that way.
Then you have nothing in any other 
direction. And when the current
wants to go in the same direction 
as the field, it's a super highway.
So, that's why these Birkeland 
Currents work so well, right in that first
little area. What about the rest of it? Well, you can 
spend some time doing this kind of stuff, but for
example at radius 75, look at 75.
The z- field is zero and you got a counter-
rotating magnetic field and so what happens?
You're heading into the board. You're a plus charge.
and you put your fingers in the direction of your
flow, and then you look at the magnetic field: it's up.
Okay, your fingers are there, go up, out. So, any 
charge that's flowing around radius 73, is going to be
expelled outward from the flow. And so, 
every time you come to one of these reversals,
you're going to be pushed either in or out.
And that's what I've done. I've tried to
mark in the pink as where the charges 
end up. Okay. I hope it's clear. If you look
at this long enough, it becomes clear, 
I guess... Pick anything, like pick 136.
What's going on here? Well, at 136 you
look along over here someplace that's right
there, that says that the wraparound field is zero 
and the axial field is negative. So, at 136 there is no
wraparound field. It's zero, and this magnetic
field is coming at you. Doesn't that defeat the
purpose? You don't want any current flowing
back, you want current going that way.
Well, you notice there's no charge carriers 
there. Because at 136, they're either pushed
that way into this, sort of first shell,
or they're pushed outward to that shell.
So, regions like 51 and 136 radius, out here is
another one at 220, it's sort of like a super highway.
But there's no cars on the highway.
There's no charge carriers there.
I hope I've shown that at certain places,
at certain radii, it's easy for current
to flow, and other places it's hard for
current to flow and certainly because of
the counter-rotating wraparound field,
charges will tend to form in these
layers. So, these layers are concentric
cylinders. This is the same sort of
result that Marklund came up with, with Marklund
convection. If any of you are familiar with that.
Marklund, a Swedish scientist/engineer I think,
developed almost the same thing except his
mechanism is predicated on the idea that you've got
a variety, a spectrum of different types of elements,
and he found that what goes to the center are the
easily ionizable elements. To me it's very counter-
intuitive. Iron and stuff like that are
easy to ionize, so you'll find iron and
the heavy elements in the middle.
And one of the hardest elements
of all (which seems absolutely nuts to me, but 
it is true) to ionize is hydrogen. And hydrogen
is on the outside. So, that's Marklund convection.
He's got the same result as this. That is there are
concentric cylinders and there's a
selectivity as to what kind of elements
you're going to find in which layer. And
that's great. My result is independent of
what you've got there. In other words,
this will happen no matter what the stuff is that's
flowing. It could be just protons, it could be 
electrons. If all you have is electrons,
everything I said, just reverse it.
It goes the other way, it's no problem.
But the same kind of selectivity the same kind of
forming these concentric layers will occur. Well,
is this true? Well there's a famous picture
of Saturn's north pole. It's also the famous
hexagon in the middle. You see the little
one right in the middle and my results
here do not predict that hexagon. I wish they did,
but they don't. But they do predict those circles.
Here's a Birkeland Current coming down into
Jupiter's north pole. Same sort of thing.
there are concentric circles. That's where the charge 
hits. That's where the charge is concentrated.
And the wrapping around, by the way, I don't have
any slide to show it but the the way this crazy
’going this way and then back that way’ it's wrapped
like a Roman soldier. In World War I the soldiers
wore patisse, wrapped around their leg.
I think they only wrapped them in one direction.
But if you wrap them all the way down
and then come wrapping them about the
other way and then back down the other
way, you got a real wrap. And that's a real
reason, in my mind, that the whole thing
hangs together, and doesn't dissipate.
Here's a picture from Tony Peratt's lab.
That's a dense plasma focus device
and you can see the circularity of it. You can
almost see this circle going one way and then going
the other way. Here's a picture that
C.J. Ransom and Mel Acheson can be
proud of. They made that one in CJ's lab. And 
again that's the result of a high amperage current.
Probably, CJ if he's here, can tell you 
what the surface, the substrate is.
But you can see, it forms a bullseye.
And the strongest one is of course
that one right in the middle. So, that's
because of the properties, I think we've
identified here as the properties of a Birkeland 
Current. We, Wal, me, a few other of us
nuts, are convinced that what you're
looking at there is a Birkeland Current.
A Birkeland Current that's undergoing a z-pinch,
and you can see, I think very obviously,
that the Birkeland Current consists of
concentric cylinders. You can see the
outside too certainly. And the center one I
think that that, and that, are double layers
in a central stream of current. Whether
the current's going all one way or all
the other, we've talked for hours on 
this and we still can't figure it out. But I
would say if that is indeed a Birkeland
Current, all the currents going one way
on the outer sheath, whether it goes
in the opposite direction in the center,
I don't know. But certainly, it can go
whichever way it wants to because in the center,
the magnetic field is lined up with the flow of
charge, no matter which way it's going.
And so it goes for free. It's a super highway.
Anyway, that Planetary Nebula M2-9 that's not Messier.
Somebody else quoted Walt Whitman,
so I didn't want to be left in the lurch.
And after all this lecture of numbers and all this
he says he looked up in perfect silence at the stars.
You have to look. And I submit that's one of the
primary rules of the Electric Universe. That is,
let your eyes tell you and that is a
concentrically-made sheet of current.
Again, just looking downstream, that's 
what you see in a Birkeland Current.
And there's that picture of Saturn. I submit that's 
pretty darn good evidence. Anyway, thanks.

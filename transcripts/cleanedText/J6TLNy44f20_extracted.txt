Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought

The following presentation is an
adaptation of the Mel Acheson Picture-Of-
the-Day article, “What Science Says.” The
link to the article may be found in the
description box of this video. It's
common to hear people refer to
”what science says.” The usual assumption
is that what science says is said indefeasibly.
But the term “science” has two
conflicting senses: science as Currently
Accepted Theory and science as method.
To conclude that method inevitably leads to
Currently Accepted Theory and
furthermore, that Currently Accepted
theory is the end of science, is to
wallow in hubris. Both the history of
science and the nature of cognition
contradict such arrogance. The universe
is large, and data both accumulate and
can be arranged and valued in different
ways. The discernment of orderly patterns
in these mutable fields of data, can
result not only in refinements of a
theory, but in the wholesale replacement
of a theory. In pursuing the questions
raised by Currently Accepted Theory,
method is likely to overturn Currently
Accepted Theory. In the competition
between a Currently Accepted Theory and
its potential replacement, the two senses
of science apply opposite standards
of evaluation. From the viewpoint of
science as Currently Accepted Theory,
the standard is conformity with the
fundamental principles of the discipline.
Any fundamentally different theory will
be seen as a “crackpot” idea. Half a
century ago, fitting continents together
like a jigsaw puzzle, was ridiculous. From
the viewpoint of science as method, the
standard is systematic exercise of
cognitive skill: the discernment of
orderly patterns in
domains of experience.
The distinction between fundamental
and superficial differences is irrelevant.
That continents can be fit together like
a jigsaw puzzle, was a clue to a new
theory and recognition of a new
phenomenon. In the sense of method,
particular theories are just tools,
something with which to build a
technology, to be replaced when
experience and curiosity move on. All
theories are “working hypotheses”,
not Ultimate Truths. I'll use the Electric
Universe Theory for an example. In the
standards of Currently Accepted Theory,
it's ridiculous: four or five planets
stacked one above the other on a common
axis, is if not impossible, so far from
the familiar and the expected, that it's
laughable. Gravitational theory has come
up with the orbit of SOHO, revolving
around an empty spot in space. And Comet
Shoemaker-Levy 9 stretched out in a line
that might have mimicked the Saturnian
polar configuration from one of its
components. But if gravitational theory
alone can't quite say it's impossible,
the many interlocking connections with
other disciplines, makes it extremely
unlikely. In the standards of method
however, this is all merely argument from
authority. Method is concerned more with
process than with the product. In the
following, I'll compare the Electric
Universe theory with a list of standards
developed by B. J. F. Lonergan in his book,
Insight. The Canon of Selection requires
a theory to involve sensible, observable
consequences. In accord with this, the
data of the Electric Universe theory are
the words, written and spoken, of the
myths of all cultures, their ritual
and cultural contexts, linguistic
associations and etymologies, and the
associated artistic expressions such as
pictographs, ceramics and architecture.
The Canon of Operations involves an
accumulation of insights from
observations, applications and
experiments. The Electric Universe Theory
verifies the existence of expected
themes from one myth
and culture to the next.
It modifies the generalization of those
themes by the comparative removal of
local embellishments and addition of
common elements. The Canon of Relevance
is concerned with the intelligibility
imminent in the data. The Electric
Universe Theory derives its model from
the structure of the common themes. The
Canon of Parsimony - called Occam's Razor
in its simplistic form - requires that
nothing be added to the data, except the
laws verified in the data. The Electric
Universe Theory is limited to only the
structure of common themes in the data.
Note here that modifying the theory to
make it compatible with theories of
other disciplines, would be a violation
of this Canon. Contrary to one’s first
impulse that Occam's Razor requires
cutting off those parts of the theory
that are “added assumptions” to
Currently Accepted Theory and instead
requires strict independence from
Currently Accepted Theory. The Canon of
Completeness requires a theory to
account for all the data. It's precisely
the Electric Universe Theory’s method of
comparing all the myths of all cultures,
that reveals the common themes and
their interdependent structure. The
conclusion is that science says two
things: as Currently Accepted Theory it
says the Electric Universe Theory is
next to impossible. But as method, it says
the Electric Universe Theory is a viable
and valuable insight that presents the
opportunity of enlarging the
insights of other disciplines.

of the Mel Acheson Picture Of the Day article,
Blindness, Stupidity and Speculation.

Ignorance is not bliss. In discussing the
question of progress in scientific revolutions,
Kuhn noted “There are losses as well as gains,
and scientists tend to be
peculiarly blind to the former.”
In a footnote, he
elaborates, “Because science
students ’know the 
right answers’, it is
particularly difficult to make them
analyze an older science in its own terms.”
Noting that in his broadest use of paradigm,
Kuhn included instrumentation with theory.
I would apply his footnote to data. Because
scientists know the right procedures,
it is particularly difficult to make
them attend to evidence outside the
sensitivities of their instruments.
Chapman refused to look at, or even to
discuss Alphén’s experiments that contradicted
the ”perfect insulator” theory of space.
Modern astronomers refused to look at
Arp's display of connections among
objects of different redshifts. Now
Thomas Gold presents a most
clear-cut example of scientific
blindness and loss of data
in his book The Deep Hot Biosphere.
He writes “The invention of the
seismograph meant that it was no longer
necessary to experience an earthquake directly,
or to interview someone who had, in 
order to assemble data on the event.
Eyewitness reports were no longer believed 
to hold any value for the scientific venture.”
Gold then proceeds to describe many eyewitness
reports from ancient times to modern.
A constellation of recurring
phenomena becomes apparent:
”Eruptions, flames, noises, odors
asphyxiation, fountains of water, and mud”
often occur before the quake.
Gold concludes on page 147:
”The accumulated observations maintained
in folklore and contemplated by the
intelligentsia of the time, meant 
that the ancients recognized a
variety of phenomena that seemed to serve
well as warnings of an impending quake.
In some ways, folklore is 
of more practical value to
residents of earthquake-prone regions
than is our modern science.” He describes
several incidents where people were able
to evacuate their villages and towns a
few hours before an earthquake
because they were alerted by odors, fogs,
or unusual animal behavior.
Folklore has saved many lives;
seismographs and stress meters have
yet to achieve one correct prediction-
probably because they're
measuring only effects, not
causes. Gold adduces this evidence, and
several chapters more, to support his
theory of upwelling primordial gas from
deep within the earth. He also mentions
the near impossibility of attracting
any attention to the theory,
or even to the observations
that call into question
the prevailing assumptions. He writes, ”Thus
many scientists seem to have fallen into the rut
of the nearest convenient theory. They
explore the terrain of this rut very
effectively, down to the
minutest features within the
walls, yet they will not
climb out for another look.
This fear of “another look” is more
than mere scientific blindness.
It's a deliberate squeezing shut 
of one's intellectual eyes,
a rejection of insight, a refusal to learn.
It's directly connected to belief, to the
assumption that one possesses
the only possible right answer,
which therefore obviates
one’s considering further
questions or “other looks.” Ignorance can
be overcome with persistence and study.
Ignorance, indeed, is the beginning of 
learning. But the refusal to learn is stupidity,
and for it there is no remedy. Scientists
have limited time, as do we all.
It's understandable that they
should ignore many things not
immediately pertinent to their current work. 
Sometimes even the pertinent must be
ignored. But that's merely “ignore-ance.”
The mark of stupidity, and of the belief
behind it, is the use of the term “impossible”
and the accompanying rejection of
speculation. Let us consider
Thomas Gold again. He writes,
”The history of science offers example
after example of apparently inexplicable
features for which perfectly rational
explanations were finally found.
In nearly all such cases, assumptions
that were universally believed obscured
the truth so effectively that no progress
toward a solution seemed possible.”
”Yet it is to just such apparently inexplicable
features that we must hope to find clues
that will show us how to un-
burden ourselves of false beliefs.
”Speculation is a vital step in this process.
It was once speculated that the earth
revolved around the sun. Without 
this speculation, I do not think
that any systematic avenue of research
would have produced the evidence that
clinched this theory. At a time 
when proposed solutions are
still speculative, they are 
the driving force for the
researches that will prove 
them right or wrong
and will thereby put our thinking 
on a new and better track.”

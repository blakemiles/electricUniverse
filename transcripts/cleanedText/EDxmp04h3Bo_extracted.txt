The atomic model has remained
unchanged for a long time and yet there
are many mysteries that this
model has not been able to unlock.
Some nuclear reactions are very well
known and have been thoroughly studied.
One would therefore expect that we know
all there is to know about such reactions
and that we understand how
the products are created.
One problem is predicting
how the larger atoms split.
Why does uranium split asymmetrically,
if the nucleus is simply a collection
of neutrons and protons jumbled randomly in
the center. If we examine the simple case of an
alpha particle emission, this also 
throws up many problems. One of
these relates to the size of the nucleus itself.
We know that protons and neutrons have size.
This means that the nucleus must have
a size which relates to these sizes.
If we add into this the fact
that in the Standard Model,
the position of the protons and
neutrons are thought to be random,
then it would imply that to emit an alpha
particle, the internal protons and neutrons must
rearrange themselves to form this prior
to being ejected. This becomes more
complex as we examine larger and larger
atoms that always seem to produce the same
products. The nucleus would need to 
undergo significant rearrangement in order to
accomplish this. And this 
requires space within the
nucleus to allow the particles to move
to their correct location. If we examine
the width of the nucleus and compare this to the
width of the individual particles that make up
the nucleus, we find that there is
simply no room to allow this to happen.
It would appear as if the atoms 
are in a very dense packing state
at all times, which would not allow for
any rearrangement of the particles.
And this implies that the nucleus must have
structure. And this is something that Edo Kaal
has spent the last 12 years working on and
now has a team of people working on it.
Unhappy with the many problems with 
the current model, he set himself the
challenge of redefining the structure of the atom.
The basic premise of the Structured Atom
Model or SAM for short,
is beautifully simple. The neutron is not
considered a fundamental particle. Instead 
it is redefined as a proton- electron pair.
The nucleus therefore only contains protons
and what are called inner electrons.
These inner electrons are used to bind the
protons together, acting as a kind of glue.
In order to bind two protons
together, we require one
inner electron. One proton and inner
electron are therefore equivalent to what was
called the neutron. Overall, 
the charge of the nucleus does
not change. But the important point is that
the force which holds the protons together
inside the nucleus, is the electrostatic
force, not the strong nuclear force. This also
explains why a neutron will 
decay to an electron and a proton
and an antineutrino within 15 minutes of leaving
the nucleus, and why the charge of the neutron is
zero and its mass is slightly more than that of
a proton. The force holding the proton in the
nucleus will attract inwards
towards the center of the structure,
causing the formation of specific geometric
shapes which form platonic solids that have
triangular faces, like the tetrahedron and the
icosahedron. These form the building blocks from
which the larger nuclear structures are built.
The SAM team have produced a new
periodic table that shows a plausible
structural configuration for each element.
The structural pattern, combined with 
the principle of densest packing,
drive the various observable
nuclear physics phenomena,
including which nuclear reactions are
possible, the tendency to fission and probable
isotopic variations that may exist.
It is well known that transmutation can
occur under laboratory conditions.
However current models are not capable
of providing an explanation for how this might
occur. The SAM model contains the components for a
theoretical basis for the transmutation of 
metals. This in turn will clear the way for
finally resolving the mystery of cold
fusion or low energy nuclear reactions.
We also think transmutations play a key role
in biology and again here SAM can help to
understand these vital processes in more detail.
One of the main insights obtained from
the SAM model is that the inner nuclear
structure dictates the chemical properties of the
element. Being able to visualize the nucleus
can potentially provide structural clues
about the outer electron configuration.
SAM has also been able to identify
several cases of potentially missing
elements, solely from the vacancies in the new
periodic table. They identified structural shapes 
that can be used to make predictions about
the chemical properties of these
missing elements. In cosmology
it is thought that the elements are
created through a variety of processes
in stars. The lighter elements from carbon
to sulfur are created by fusion reactions,
while elements in the iron group
originate mostly in supernova explosions,
and elements beyond iron are made in high-mass
stars by slow neutron capture, and by rapid
neutron capture in violent interactions of
rare supernova variants or compact stellar
collisions. The narrative of the origin of the
elements is being challenged by the SAM 
model. The realization that element
transmutation does occur in
relatively benign environments,
suggests that this depiction of
nuclear synthesis may be flawed. An
alternative possibility put forward by the SAM
team is that the heavy elements beyond iron
are created in situ on the planets. This would
occur in intense electrical discharges. Related
to this, electrical discharges are the 
prime suspect for the occurrence
of transmutation in Earth geology.
One consequence of this, is that the
dating of geological layers
becomes questionable since the
transmutation alters the decay rate of elements.
SAM provides insights that no other
model is capable of doing. They 
explain how each element is
structured; why the isotopes of
an element differ from each other;
where the cycle of 8 comes from; and why it breaks
down. It not only explains why elements become
unstable after lead, but also why alpha decay
happens in some elements and yet not others,
and why uranium-235 splits asymmetrically,
and the origin of the neutron drip line. SAM
is a radically different way of looking at the 
atom that brings with it a simple approach
that is easily understood. Simple rules
create the structure of the elements and these
in turn determine, not only their
properties, but also determine
how they will interact or break
down to form other elements
on a predictable basis. The key underlying
assumption is simply that the particles are held in
the nucleus by one force: the electrostatic force.
It removes the need for the strong force
and also questions the existence
of the many exotic particles that
physicists have dreamt up. This is just 
a brief overview of the SAM model.
If you are interested in a
deeper understanding of SAM,
and how it can explain things like, for 
example why certain elements are unstable;
how nuclear reactions would work;
how it could explain transmutations;
then please see the SAM playlist on my channel,
or head over to the SAM website where
you can also pre-order their new book.

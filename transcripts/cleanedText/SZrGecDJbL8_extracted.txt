On August 12, 2018, NASA's Parker
Solar Probe was launched from Cape
Canaveral, Florida, beginning its historic
journey that would take it closer to the
Sun than any man-made object to date.
In early December, the
first scientific papers
were published on the
mission's earliest findings.
The first four papers
have suggested a number of
"surprising discoveries" including the
speed of the solar wind rotating around
the Sun, and the behaviors of dust
particles that the probe has
encountered at its perihelion.
From the perspective
of the electric Sun model, perhaps the
most intriguing discovery to date is the
"unexpected changes" in the Sun's
magnetic field, which the probe encountered
as it moved through the plasma environment.
As one news report describes,
"Unexpectedly, the probe also
detected a series of flips in the Sun's
magnetic fields--dubbed 'switchbacks' -- as
streaming winds of plasma flowed past
the spacecraft. During these periods, the
magnetic field suddenly
reversed itself by 180 degrees
and then, seconds to hours
later, flipped back."
In part one of this two-
part presentation, retired
professor of electrical
engineering, Dr. Donald
Scott begins his analysis
of the Parker Probe data.
Well, about a week or so ago,
at a NASA press conference, the
investigators that are in charge of the
Parker Solar Probe described their new
findings from the first
flybys of that probe.
Now, as far as I have been
able to find out, the probe has made
about three closer and
closer passages to
the Sun and it will
continue to do that for
several years and hopefully, if it
doesn't burn up, it'll continue to do that.
But in any event, the NASA press
conference included the statement, which
is sort of typical of them, "This is
the first time we've been able to fly a
spacecraft into the
atmosphere of a star."
They said that last time too, and I
commented on that kind of statement.
It all depends on what you call the
atmosphere of a star.
What is the Sun's atmosphere?
Well, the Sun's local plasma
extends out to the
extent of the heliosphere which is,
ends in what we call the heliopause and
that's several times the distance out of
Pluto, so by definition, any probe or
satellite that gets out of Earth's
atmosphere is in the Sun's atmosphere,
if you familiarize the Sun's 
atmosphere goes out that far.
But actually, the proper
question is: how close to the
Sun's photospheric surface
will the Parker Probe get?
Will it get into
the Sun's Corona?
Will it get below the Corona-
-no, certainly not
below the Corona, and nothing's going to, in
the foreseeable future, will ever get
through that kind of temperature, but
NASA says that the probe will, in 2025,
get within a distance of
four million miles.
OK, I think as I said last time, that four
million miles is about nine solar radii.
That is, if you take a
picture of the Sun during the full solar
eclipse and see the Corona there, if
you look and scale the distance, let's
say from the center of the Sun to the
edge of the black dot, the shadow of
the Moon in front of the Sun, that's of
course the solar radius.
And so, if you measure out
ten times that distance,
that's where closest approach of the
Parker Probe will get.
It used to be said that
the farthest out that
the Corona extends is
about five solar radii.
So I said last time
and I still think,
that the Parker probe
was not going to
get even close to the outermost
regions of the Corona.
But recently NASA says no, the Corona
extends out to something like five
million miles, twelve solar radii, and so
it could make, get in, depending on
what they guess the feeling of the Sun
at the moment is, what it's, how far it
extends its Corona, it may touch
the outer reaches of the Corona.
But there is something
that it's going to.
The press release goes on to say that the
present data that they're getting back
"...hints at the likely birthplace of
dynamic solar winds, which bathe our
entire solar system in energy." Well,
that's certainly true. They continue to
say, "It describes startling reversals
(that is to say switchbacks) in the Sun's
magnetic fields. And it detects dust in
the solar wind and it shows that solar
winds spin," and they say of course in
their airy frivolous language, "it spins
like children riding on
a playground carousel."
Anyway, if you can get through
that, whenever you hear about things
spinning, just quietly think about the
fact that force-free currents are
collections of counter-rotating spinning
magnetic field and current pathways.
I submit and I have submitted for a
long while, that they're about the only
natural phenomenon that do consist of
concentric counter-rotating cylinders
that do indeed spin
or at least twist.
In one of our last Space News segments, we
discussed reports that the Voyager
probes have observed
unexpected rotation of the
magnetic fields through
which it is traveling.
That is the Voyagers,
they're out at the end, the other end
of the thing, they're out of the
heliopause and my comment at that time
says wow, that's fantastic because that
would fit like a hand into a glove with
our Juergens' Electric Sun model, and that
would say that yes, they have left the
heliopause or heliosphere, out through
the heliopause, but it still hasn't left
the giant Birkeland current that feeds
this whole solar system and feeds our Sun,
still seeing them, rotating magnetic
fields, within that Birkeland current.
Getting back to the present though, the
present report, I feel it's very likely
that the pointed tops of the
so-called coronal caps,
regions were the arrays of plasma that
are leaving up through the corona,
instead of diverging from a central
point, i.e. the Sun, after they leave
they seem to, certain places at least,
come back together again and form a
triangular or at least a
conical kind of a cap.
But anyway, a long time
EU member, good friend of ours, Chris
Reeve apparently asked the question:
isn't it possible that these switchbacks
are simply the probe moving
through the counter-
flowing Birkeland current
cylinders of each filament?
And when I saw that I said,
hurrah, thank you Chris!
Yes, absolutely,
yes, of course, yes,
it's quite likely that
the coronal caps, those
pointed-hat-shapes we observe in the
outer regions of the Corona, are exactly
where Birkeland currents form, and those
Birkeland currents extend out to places
like the north poles of the planets, so
Birkeland currents would explain the
spinning and the reversal of direction
of magnetic fields that the Parker Solar
Probe observes and
that the investigators
have found so
typically surprising.
Scientific reports describe
the Parker Probe being bombarded with
dust particles during its
closest approaches to the Sun.
A phys.org report states,
"Another surprise was a dust that
peppered the spacecraft
repeatedly during
each fly-by at perihelion...
The dust
particles are likely debris from
asteroids or comets that melted near the
Sun and left behind
their trapped dust."
But this begs the question: how large an
amount of rocky comet and asteroid
material would have to be spread through
such an unimaginably vast volume of space?
We asked Dr. Scott how the
Electric Sun model of the solar plasma
environment might better explain
the presence of such dust?
I think that that
explanation is, it's akin to the
typical explanation
that they give for why
are there all sorts of
different elements?
You know; manganese, calcium, iron,
sulfur, oxygen, you name it, all the other
elements in addition to the hydrogen and
helium that their model says has to be
there, but their model of nuclear fusion
does not produce manganese, calcium,
oxygen, and sulfur and all
the raft of other elements.
And so, where does
it come from?
In deeper outer cosmic space there are
novae explosions, Suns explode and
they pepper the universe with, and Scott
adds parenthetically, (fairy dust) that
sprinkles throughout the galaxies and
intergalactic space, and that's how all
these other kinds of elements that the
Sun doesn't generate, that's how they get
on the Sun, it's like a snowstorm
and they come in from deeper outer space.
Now, if you believe that, I've got a
bridge that connects Manhattan and
Brooklyn that I would be very
willing to sell you.
Alfven and all of the
earlier plasma physicists were well
aware that most plasmas are what are
called dusty plasmas and that means that
they contain neutrals; a fully ionized
plasma is very rare, they say that the
outer regions of the Coronas, of the Corona
of our Sun and probably other stars, are
fully ionized plasma, but 99% of most
plasmas are not fully ionized.
In fact, Hannes Alfven
was quoted as saying,
if the plasma was
more than ten percent
ionized, it could be considered a fully
ionized plasma because, the forces
between the ions and electrons that were
there are so much stronger than the
gravitation between the
neutrals that the neutrals,
the gravitational effects
just don't count.
So that's a long-winded way
of saying sure, plasmas are dusty,
that's where the dust comes from, it
comes from within the Sun, as the
ions and the electrons come blasting out
of the Sun they bring neutrals with them
and that's where it came from.
I don't think you have to depend
on asteroids melting near
the Sun to explain that.

Welcome to Space News from
the Electric Universe,

On this series we are shining a light on an
unresolvable problem for astrophysicists,
the challenge of explaining unimaginably
powerful electromagnetic emissions and energies
in a universe in which
electricity causes nothing.
In our first three episodes, we explored
this question through our discussion
of the stupendous magnetic
and filamentary structures
seen all throughout
the visible universe.
The features are neither predicted nor
explained in gravity-centric cosmology
but they are the expected
features of an electric universe.
Fantastic electromagnetic phenomena are
increasingly recognized with each passing year.
From the powerful
electric fields
and supersonic plasma jets
detected on our own Earth
to the mysterious electron
acceleration in Jupiter's aurora
and even tremendous electric
currents measured in galactic jets.
Yet standard astronomy still holds to theories
in which mechanical and kinetic processes,
collisions, explosions, gravitational
collapse, heating and shock waves,
produce the measured
electrical effects.
But it cannot be a coincidence
that ever finer technological data
only increases astrophysicists'
expressions of amazement and perplexity.
In this episode, we will explain why the
discovery of "giant light bulbs in space"
is the 4th of 10 reasons why
the universe is electric.
The Fermi Bubbles
It is one of a growing list
of astounding mysteries
that demand entirely new
theoretical pathways.
For over seven years
astronomers have struggled to explain the
presence of the so called Fermi Bubbles,
giant structures emitting
powerful gamma-rays that stretch
for tens of thousands of light-years above
and below the Milky Way's spiral disk.
Both the structures' mind-boggling
size and energetic emissions
appear to pose intractable
problems for astrophysicists.
Astronomers using the Fermi
Gamma-Ray Space Telescope
discovered the so-called
bubbles in 2010.
The energetic lobes emanating
from the Milky Way's center
have been a source of extreme
puzzlement ever since.
The 2014 phys.org article 'Despite extensive
analysis, Fermi bubbles defy explanation'
outlines the mystery as follows,
"The outlines of the
bubbles are quite sharp,
and the bubbles themselves glow in nearly uniform
gamma-rays over their colossal surfaces,
like two 30,000 light years tall incandescent
bulbs screwed into the center of the galaxy...
Their size is another puzzle.
The farthest reaches of the Fermi bubbles
boast some of the highest energy gamma rays,
but there's no discernible cause for
them that far from the galaxy."
As we outlined in a
recent Space News episode,
Does Gravity Cause
Lightning in Space,
it seems almost beyond belief
that astrophysicists can only visualize
mechanical and kinetic processes
even when observing the unmistakable
signatures of electrical discharge phenomena.
The aforementioned phys.org
report poses the question,
what blew the bubbles?
As if air is being expelled
from the galactic center
and filling a balloon-like
fabric in the vacuum of space.
One theoretical possibility
investigators have proposed
is that a tremendous
population of giant stars
all exploded at roughly the
same time for some reason,
somehow forming the
gamma-ray bubbles.
As noted in the phys.org report,
another ad hoc theory for
the "bubbles" is that they
"...could have been created by huge jets
of accelerated matter blasting out
from the supermassive black hole
at the center of our galaxy."
More recently, in 2017, astronomers
claimed that a so-called giant snack,
several million years ago, by the hypothetical
black hole believed to be at Sagittarius A,
produced the energy that
created the bubbles.
These scientists may
have forgotten
that the supposed black hole had the
opportunity for another "snack"
when the gas cloud G2 made its
long-anticipated closest approach in 2014.
Apparently, the imagined gravitational
monster was not hungry
leaving the gas cloud intact to the
amazement of astronomers around the world.
We again note the irony of scientists
looking to colossal gravity
to explain stupendous
electromagnetic phenomena,
in this case, no less than "incandescent
bulbs" screwed into the center of our galaxy.
As we've reported
several times recently,
the stupendous electric
current in a galactic jet,
estimated at 10¹⁸ amps or the
equivalent to a trillion bolts of lightning,
has been measured by
radio astronomers
and the seemingly unfathomable discovery
of radio jets in numerous galaxies
in a distant region of space, all
spinning in the same direction,
will never be explained
by black hole proponents.
As we've also discussed
several times recently,
in the Electric Universe, an ultra-high
density energy storage phenomenon
called a plasmoid is at
the core of the Milky Way,
a kind of load in the
Galactic electrical circuit,
rather like a
rechargeable battery.
In a galactic circuit, electrical power
flows inward along the spiral arms
lighting the stars as it goes and is
concentrated and stored in the central plasmoid.
When the plasmoid reaches a
threshold density, it discharges
usually along the
galaxy's spin axis.
This process has been replicated in the
laboratory with the Plasma Focus device.
The most seemingly puzzling
feature of the bubbles,
the presence of the most intense gamma-
rays at the outer edges of the bubbles
at the farthest distance
from the galactic center,
is explicable and indeed predictable
in the electrical interpretation.
The father of plasma
cosmology, Hannes Alfven,
proposed that a plasma formation
called the double layer
should be classified as a
discrete celestial object
and that explosions of double layers
could be the source of gamma-ray bursts
and mysterious X-ray emissions.
A double layer, or what is known
as a Langmuir sheath,
forms between plasma regions
of different properties.
It's a complete mystery
to astrophysicists
why the most intense gamma-rays should
be at the outer edges of the bubbles.
Yet in the electrical
interpretation
the edges of the bubbles delineate the
boundary of the Galactic plasma environment
and that of deep space.
A double layer only exists
where there is an electric current
flowing through space plasma.
In this case, the double
layer at the bubbles' edge
would be like a giant
spherical plate capacitor
with positive charge on one plate
and negative charge on the other.
Charged particles are accelerated
across the double layer
generating electromagnetic radiation
which can include X-rays and gamma-rays.
The double layer acts
as a boundary effect,
dissipating electrical
energy in a thin layer.
Plasma scientist Dr. Anthony Peratt wrote
in his book, Physics of the Plasma Universe,
"...x-ray and gamma-ray
sources are likely
to have their radiative energies
supplied by electrical currents."
While astronomers continue
to ascribe the bubbles
to a mysterious blast or eruption
event, millions of years ago,
another important feature of the
bubbles completely defies this notion
while affirming the
electrical interpretation.
In 2013, in the journal Nature,
scientists reported the observation of
"...two giant, linearly polarized radio lobes,
containing three ridge-like substructures,
emanating from the
Galactic Center.
The lobes each extend about 60
degrees in the Galactic bulge,
closely corresponding
to the Fermi bubbles,
and are permeated by strong magnetic
fields of up to 15 microgauss."
These extremely powerful
magnetic fields follow closely
the directions of the ridges which
wind around the flow of energy
as we must find if the ridges in
fact represent electrical currents.
Critically, the width of the ridges is
remarkably constant at about 300 parsecs.
Like the consistent width
of star-forming filaments,
the constant width of the bubbles' ridges
is the unmistakable hallmark of lightning.
Collisions, explosions, eruptions,
geysers, shockwaves, heating;
like countless others stupendous
electromagnetic phenomena in the cosmos,
these kinetic and
mechanical mechanisms
will never explain the
spectacular Fermi bubbles.
But why should it be surprising
that electricity is actually the source
of so-called giant light bulbs in space.
The celestial surprises
will surely continue
until the light bulb
of new understanding
begins to flicker in the
minds of astronomers,
illuminating for them
our electric universe.

New observations are again
challenging astronomers' ideas
about the so-called volcanoes
on Jupiter's moon Io.
For nearly 40 years
astronomers have told us
that Io is the most volcanically
active body in the solar system.
In 1979 NASA's Voyager spacecraft offered
scientists on Earth their first glimpse
of mysterious structures jetting hundreds
of kilometers above the moon's surface.
A phenomenon astronomers
interpreted as volcanic plumes.
But that same year the world-renowned
astrophysicist Thomas Gold
proposed that the locations
of the so-called volcanoes
were instead the sites of
powerful electrical discharges.
Eight years later in 1987,
plasma scientist Anthony Peratt
and co-author Alex Dessler
published the paper,
"Filamentation of Volcanic Plumes
on the Jovian Satellite Io".
Peratt and Dessler argue that the filamentation
and cross-sectional shape of the plumes
are "consistent with theories developed
from laboratory observation".
Nevertheless, despite the contributions
of Gold, Peratt and Dessler,
planetary scientists have held to the
theory that Io's mysterious plumes
are the product of volcanism
which is caused by Jupiter
gravitationally squeezing the moon.
But the problems with this theory
have only continue to grow
with better images and data
from the Jovian system.
NASA scientists have
acknowledged their struggle
to explain the plume structure
as volcanic in nature.
Concerning the so-called volcano
Tvashtar, they state that
"the knots and filaments that allow us to track
the plume's motions are still mysterious."
In recent years, the tidal heating
model applied to Io's "volcanoes"
has been directly falsified
by additional discoveries.
In 2013, a geologic survey found
that the locations of the plumes
were incompatible with the predictions
of the tidal heating model.
And now, scientists observing
the so-called plume
of the volcano Loki have
encountered a new mystery.
A New Scientist's report
on the observation states,
"over decades of study, observers
have noticed a pattern.
About every 540 days, a wave of brightness
starts at one end of the lake of lava
and pivots anti-clockwise
like a windshield wiper.
That front of warmer lava moves
about one kilometer per day
until the whole lake glows hot.
Then the surface of Loki cools
until the process starts again.
But in 2002, right when we thought we
had Loki pegged, those phases stopped.
Then in 2009, according to recent
work by Katherine de Kleer
at the University of
California Berkeley,
they started again but are
now moving clockwise.
Appropriate behavior for a feature
named after the Norse trickster god.
However, anomalous movements of
Io's so-called volcanic plumes
is not a new problem
for astronomers.
When the Galileo probe arrived
in the Jovian system in 1996,
it revealed that the plume of the
so-called volcano Prometheus
had moved more than 80 kilometers since
it was first imaged by the Voyager probe.
This fulfilled one of several predictions
that physicist and Electric Universe
proponent Wal Thornhill had made
prior to the Galileo mission.
Thornhill also predicted that the
so-called vents of the volcanic plumes
would be much hotter than lava
and that the plumes are in fact
the jets of moving cathode arcs eroding
the periphery of the dark areas
that planetary geologists
have been calling lava lakes.
According to Thornhill,
these so-called lava lakes
are the solid dark surface
of Io beneath the
"snow that has been deposited by
continuous discharge activity".
Therefore the "lava lakes" would not reveal
the expected heat of a recent lava flow.
"snow that has been deposited by
continuous discharge activity".
Therefore the "lava lakes" would not reveal
the expected heat of a recent lava flow.
Each of these predictions
received stunning confirmation.
Io's volcanic hot spots were not
only hotter than any lava on earth.
They were too hot to be measured
by Galileo's instruments.
Also as predicted by Thornhill, the
discharging is found to be focused
on the edges of the
so-called lava lakes
though the rest of these dark
fields are comparatively cool.
In fact, the expected volcanic
vents could not be found.
Inspiring further astonishment
among mission scientists,
the "volcanic plumes"
emit ultraviolet light.
Something inconceivable under normal
conditions of volcanic venting.
But ultraviolet light is of course
characteristic of an electric arc.
Space scientists have come
to depend on Io's volcanoes
to account for the extraordinary electrical
activity witnessed in Jupiter's atmosphere.
Many claim that charged particles from Io's
volcanoes are responsible for the Jovian Aurorans
which are 1,000 times more intense
than anything seen on Earth.
In this scenario, the profuse
electrical activity at Jupiter's poles,
approximately 10 million Volts, is generated
mechanically by the planet's spin.
Ions from the "volcanoes" on Io are
thought to travel to the planet's poles,
then interact with the magnetic
spin generated electricity,
creating an extraordinary charge
exchange, producing the auroras.
The following NASA statement which quotes
investigator Randy Gladstone reads,
"the polar electric fields grab any
charged particles they can find
and slam them into
the atmosphere.
Particles for slamming
can come from the sun
but Jupiter has another more abundant
source nearby: the volcanic moon Io
which spews oxygen and sulfur ions into
Jupiter's spinning magnetic field.
Somehow these ions make their
way to Jupiter's poles
where electric fields send them
hurtling toward the planet below.
Upon entering the atmosphere, their electrons are
first stripped away by molecules they run into
but as they slow down they
start grabbing electrons back.
The charge exchange reaction
produces intense X-ray auroras."
This rationale arises from the assumption
that Jupiter itself has no net charge.
But since it is behaving
like a charged body
the scientists looked to localized
mechanically induced charge separation
as if an island in space,
for some internal process,
can acquire and dissipate
electric charge.
From the Electric Universe perspective,
what is actually occurring
is an electrical connection between
the Sun, Jupiter and its moons.
In recent years, discoveries
have only supported this view.
When scientists discovered the
most prominent auroral trail
or footprint of Io in
the Jovian atmosphere,
they assumed it must be an effect of charge
separation generated by Io's volcanoes.
However, this theory
was undermined in 2005
when Hubble images of the Jovian aurora
revealed a similar electrical footprint
imprinted by the moon Europa with
its own swirling plasma tail.
A research team wrote
of this discovery,
"Europa is not thought to be volcanic, so
what could produce the electrical current
that zips along and eventually gives
rise to Europa's auroral footprint?
NASA investigators also found
that the electrical exchange
does not stop with Europa and
also includes the moon Ganymede.
As reported on this series, in recent years
space scientists have slowly edged closer
to recognizing significant electrical
discharge activity on planets and moons.
It's now known that once a month when the
Earth's magnetotail passes over the Moon,
the result is electrostatic dust
storms and electrical discharges.
And in the past year, scientists
reported that a coronal mass ejection
struck the planet Mars immediately
before mysterious plumes
were seen jetting hundreds of kilometers
into the planet's upper atmosphere.
A complete surprise to
planetary scientists.
The purely gravitational processes
that astronomers still prefer
have failed to explain
Io's so called volcanoes.
But today, the basis is clear for scientists
to consider an alternative explanation
in our electric universe.

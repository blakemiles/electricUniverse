You have just entered the
theater of an alien sky.
If the words and images seem strange
to you, there's a reason for this.
Our world was once a
vastly different place.
To experience this
won't hurt you
and there is nothing to fear.
The City of Heaven
When exploring ancient
myths and symbols
the first rule is to follow recurrent
themes back to their earliest occurrence.
That means as close as possible to the
original provocation in the natural world.
At the dawn of the
great civilizations,
what natural events occurred
with such impact on humanity
as to produce an explosion
of storytelling,
obsessive reenactments and
monumental construction?
Uncovering that catalyst
becomes essential
and there's no other way to make sense of
the vast human response in ancient times.
The greatest challenge the researcher will
face is the confusion of surface detail.
There were far too many cultural
interpretations and elaborations,
too many self-promoting
cultural claims,
all leading to fragmentation
of the archetypes.
By localizing the stories
the ancient chroniclers could only introduce
a flood of regional contradictions
as every culture asserted its own
special place in the stories told.
A good example of this
fragmentation occurs
with the historical emergence and
evolution of the archetypal Primeval City,
the mythical homeland affirmed by
so many cultures the world over.
We introduced that theme in our
previous segment on the Atlantis myth,
a story with a hundred claimed origins
in different parts of the world.
Though no one disputes the
primeval city archetype,
the critical question is
too frequently missed.
Why the persistent connection
of the sacred city
to the story of creation and its
subsequent catastrophic destruction?
In fact, it's this very connection
that confirms a global archetype
beneath the surface confusion
of localized variations.
We see the paradox in the creation
myths of ancient Egypt for example,
where certain foundational concepts
persisted for thousands of years.
Every sacred city in Egypt identified
itself with the celestial world
created in the beginning.
But what did that mean?
Despite their diversity, the regional
myths converge on a special place,
a land
said to have emerged from an undifferentiated
prior condition in the creation.
That primordial environment meant
no visible stars, no Sun or Moon,
just a diffuse glow most often reported
as all-encompassing waters of chaos.
Always remember that the condition
so often translated as chaos
did not convey any modern sense of
agitation or something out of control.
The literal meaning was the absence
of any discernable activity
and any discernible form.
Egyptian priests repeatedly
declared that in the Zep Tepi,
the first occasion or first time,
the island of beginnings arose
from the celestial waters
and all Egyptian traditions agree
that it was this remembered creation
that gave to humanity a model for
sacred construction on Earth.
In fact, every temple and every city
identified itself with a prototype.
It was in the Zep Tepi that
the wandering creator Atum
found his resting place
and from that place the
drama of creation began
with the triangular or pyramidal
form of the Benben stone
at the center and
summit of the sky.
From the first appearance of Atum
as the Benben, the work of creation
progressively unfolded with the
emergence of the island of creation.
It was through this collective
memory that ancient kingship rites
could name the Creator himself
as the exemplary ancestor,
the first in the line of Kings,
"I came into being of myself in the
midst of the primeval waters."
The god states in the
Book of the Dead
or the God declares: "I was
alone in the primeval waters"
or again: "I had no companion when
my name came into existence."
By following this theme to its roots
we can see the critical distinction
between the ancient symbol and the
celestial reference symbolized.
The original act or
object was cosmic
while the symbol was its
commemorative expression locally.
The irony is that by virtue
of the inherited symbolism,
every sacred land or sacred place proclaimed
itself to be the original location.
By this identification
the Creator could be said to have stood on
the very spot of the local temple or City.
You can see this in the titles
of cult centers from Heliopolis
to Memphis,
from Hermopolis
to Edfu
or Thebes.
Each celebrated its own special
identity with creation
leading to multiple variants
of a single underlying memory
as in this declaration
of The Coffin Texts,
"The Great God lives, fixed
in the middle of the sky
...dweller in the city."
The cosmic city is the primeval place
symbolically duplicated throughout Egypt,
"I have come to this city, the
region of the first time,
to be a dweller in the land,"
The Texts say.
Thus the Egyptians invoke
a celestial Memphis,
"the divine emerging
primeval island"
a celestial Thebes,
"The island emerging in Nun,"
the cosmic waters
"which first came into being."
A celestial Hermonthes,
"The high ground which
grew out of Nun"
a celestial Elephantine called
"The city in the midst
of the waters"
and a celestial Abydos,
"The Ta Ur, the primeval 'Great Land'
rising from the same cosmic waters."
So too, Chinese tradition
declared the local Kingdom
to be a copy of the
celestial Empire
and each capital city
imitated the same plan.
The integrated symbolism
even when growing complex
never departs from the underlying
idea of a visible place or land,
the first form of the created world
emerging from a primeval ocean.
Of course, as we've seen so many times,
the localization of an archetype
invariably introduced
regional contradictions
even as the archetypal substructure
persisted across the millennia.
The ancient memory of a lost
island preserved around the world
consistently harked
back to a prior age,
an age of innocence and wonder.
For the Greeks this was the age
of the first sovereign Kronos
whom the Romans knew as their
own ancient ruler Saturn.
Here are the words of the Latin
poet Dionysius of Halicarnassus,
"Haste to the realms of
Saturn shape your course,
where Cotyle's famed
island wandering floats."
The cross-cultural
accord is remarkable.
Japanese legends recall the ancient
cradle of life as a floating island
called "the drifting land"
congealing out of
the primeval waters.
Its original location was
said to be the North Pole
later localized to become Japan.
That's the localization
of the cosmic archetype.
So too, the legendary
floating island of Delos
which Poseidon stabilized
by his cosmic trident.
Pointing to the same archetype would be
the floating islands of the Argonautica,
called the Strophades,
or "Islands of Turning."
In the voyages of the Celtic
divine hero Maeldhuin
the adventurer encounters a fabulous
Isle in the midst of the sea
"Around the island
was a fiery rampart"
"And it was ever wont to
turn around and about it."
Examples are plentiful,
all reinforcing our
most fundamental claim
that every archetype stands as a
contradiction of our natural world.
The primeval revolving
islands of Rhodes
or Corcyra, spun on
the cosmic spindle.
The primeval Isle
of the Cyclos, the wheel,
which gave its
name to the Cyclades.
The white island of Zeus
in the midst of the sea.
The floating Hindu white
island Shwetadvipa
located at the axial
center of the sky.
The lost Toltec white
island of Tula,
also called the
center of the world.
That is the fundamental
quality of the Sumerian Ekur,
the "pure land" or "great land"
always venerated as the
model or prototype
and we see the same exemplary
role in the Assyrian Esara,
the "supreme place"
founded by the gods,
remarkably similar to the
pure land of the buddhist.
Rather than familiar geography,
the terminology always takes us
back to the place of mythic origins
subsequently localized through
commemorative practices.
The greatest mistake a
researcher could make
is to confuse the original
inspiration or first form
with its local symbol.
No mythic archetype has ever been
explained by a local experience
but with that reminder
it's also worth noting
that the historical localization
of universal traditions
by bringing the
gods down to Earth
was the primary means by which
humanity consecrated
and passed on the archetypes
across the millennia.
And that is why in our comparative
study we are invariably led
to the universal substructure
of storytelling the world over.
In the process, we observe how through
localization of an inherited story
every tribe and every nation
asserted its own identity
as the children of
the creator himself.
What then is this
connection telling us?
As we've repeatedly observed,
it was intensely remembered events that gave
each culture its sense of divine origin,
its mythic connection
to the gods
and it's this connection that requires
us to follow localized mythology
back to the archetype
of creation itself.
The truth is that a
single archaic idea
could never confirm a cause
in human experience
but the existence of
just one archetype
does pose the question of cause
and how will we address that question
as we encounter hundreds of archetypes
all connected to each other in an underlying
agreement of the ancient cultures.

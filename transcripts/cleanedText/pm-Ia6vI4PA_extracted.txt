I want to thank the organizers of this
conference for inviting me.
It's a little bit unusual,
I think, to have an eye
surgeon speaking to physicists but
nevertheless I'm honored that you would
allow me to come and share some thoughts with
you about the role of voltage in the body.
Now, I always start my lectures
by announcing that I'm not speaking with
my Texas MD license.
The Medical Board in the state
of Texas does not allow its
physicians to talk about anything that's
not standard of care medicine and of
course standard of care medicine is
pharmaceutical medicine, surgery, and
physical therapy and obviously what I'm
talking about today involves other thngs.
So I'm speaking today with my
Arizona homeopathic and integrative
medicine license.
I want to acknowledge certain
people that have contributed
greatly to much of the information I'm
going to share today.
This is the Tennant Institute staff
and we have dr. Marr and
dr. Hyde in the audience with us and if
there are those of you who become
intrigued by some of the things we're
talking about, they'll be happy to help
demonstrate to you how all of this works.
In addition, I want to acknowledge Eileen
McKusick whom you heard speak this morning
and her major contributions to this area
as well, so thank you Eileen.
So what are emotions?
Well, people talk about having them
but most people don't have a real,
good definition of what they really are
and how they work.
In addition, as in the over 50 years I've
been in medicine, people have talked, sort
of in passing, about the mind-body
connection but I found it was difficult
to get anybody explain to me what that meant.
How does that really work?
Well, they say well, you know, if you have
emotions it makes you get sick okay?
How's that work?
And I found it difficult to find any
solution or answer to that question.
So the reality is that none of
us can get through life without having
emotional events.
We have losses; loved ones die or
disappoint us, our dreams go
unfulfilled, we go bankrupt, we have car
wrecks, we suffer injuries, all sorts of
things happen and then of course we now
have this big epidemic in our country of
soldiers returning from war and
committing suicide.
So this business about post-traumatic
stress syndrome is
of course, become a major issue for us
and nobody really knows very well how to
handle it and here's a list of all of
the various things that can happen with
that but we find that more and more
people that aren't soldiers are having
post-traumatic stress syndrome as well.
So we need to get a handle on how to
deal with that.
Now, when this Time magazine
cover came out, we were only
losing one soldier a day, now it's up to
20 a day so 20 of our veterans a day are
committing suicide.
So we obviously need to figure out
a way to deal with that.
Now, the reality is that deployment and
suicide are not necessarily related,
in the studies that have been done.
But the important point,
I think, of the military
suicides is that pharmaceuticals
are not very effective.
Most people know that and
the studies have been done to show that
there's really not a pharmaceutical that
does very much in helping deal with
suicides and the emotions that go with it.
And then I'm just passing through to
the studies that have been
published about that.
Now in my observation, if you
have treatment failures it usually means
you're using a wrong paradigm and so
I'm going to suggest to you a different
paradigm as we go through the day.
But I'd first like to tell you how I
ended up sitting in this chair.
I'm trained as an ophthalmologist and an
ophthalmic plastic surgeon and I
did the majority of the research for the
laser that's used in lasik surgery by
the company called Visx and I had a lot
of fun doing that research but
unfortunately we didn't know at the time
that the laser wouldn't kill viruses so
as I would be treating eyes and
particularly I treated this one fellow
from India that had scars on his corneas
and I used the laser to remove those
scars but he had leukemia.
Well, we didn't know that the laser
wouldn't kill viruses and so the viruses
came up, off his eye through my mask into my
nose and into my brain and
I developed encephalitis.
And so I, the result of that
was that I could see a patient and know
what was wrong with them but I couldn't
remember how to write a prescription.
And I'd, in addition to that, I developed
spastic movements so I'd be sitting
there and do something like that which
doesn't work really well if you're
operating inside somebody's eyeball.
And so, for all of those reasons I had to
quit working at the end of November 1995.
So I spent about 16 hours a day in bed
sleeping and I had two or three hours a
day in which I could think clearly
enough to understand a newspaper and
there like a light switch would go off
and I couldn't understand it anymore.
So during that 2 or 3 hours a day I could
think, I had to figure out how to get
myself well because the best doctors I
could find at NIH in Boston and New York
and wherever just said well you got
three viruses in your brain, we don't
know what to do
about it, go home and don't
call us, we'll call you.
So during that two or three
hours a day that I could think, I began
to try to figure out how to get myself
well and I began to think about the fact
that all the cells in the body work very
much the same even though they look
different but that if I could figure out
how to make one cell work, I could make
them all work.
And so I went out and bought
10 or 15 books on cellular
biology and started to reading them
which I hadn't done for about 30 years.
And one of the things that resonated to me
with those various books was
that each one talked about the fact that
cells are designed to run at a pH of
7.35 to 7.45.
And so I didn't really know
too much about pH, I remembered there was
something about, have to do with
acid-base balance but I didn't really
know a great deal more about it.
So as I began to look at pH,
I began to realize
that pH describes voltage in a liquid.
So if you think about the wires that are
bringing the voltage into these lights
and to your computers etc, that's
conductive electricity of course with
electrons flowing through a copper wire.
But if you talk about a solution,
a solution has the opportunity to be
either an electron donor
or an electron stealer.
So in order to figure out which
it is, use a sophisticated voltmeter, or
so to speak, called pH meter.
And when you measure a liquid
with a pH meter, it will
give you either the pH or you can
flip a switch and it will give, read it
out in millivolts.
So the reality then is, voltage in
a liquid we call pH and by
convention, if you find that the solution
is an electron stealer, you put a plus
sign in front of the voltage and if it's
an electron donor, you put a minus sign
in front of it and then you convert the
voltage that you measure with a
logarithmic scale going from 0 to 14 and
call that pH.
So plus 400 millivolts of electrons
stealer is the same as a pH of zero
whereas minus 400 millivolts of electron
donor is the same thing as a pH of 14.
And if it's neutral, if it's neither
electron down or electron stealer, then
that's a pH of seven.
So when we say that cells must
run at a pH of 7.35 to 7.45,
we are saying, cells must run between minus
twenty and minus 25 millivolts.
Well, that was a wowser for me, guess what-
-cells need energy to work, that makes sense.
Now by the way, people sometimes get confused
with these numbers because if you take a
cell in a petri dish and you put an
electrode inside the cell and one
outside the cell and you measure across
the cell membrane, you'll get about -90 mV
but hopefully not very many of you
have your cells in Petri dishes.
But in the environment of this
body, they're designed to run at minus 25
minus 20 to minus 25 millivolts.
So one of the things that you will find is the
characteristic of essentially all chronic
disease is that you have low voltage
going to that organ.
So we are constantly wearing ourselves
out and needing to make new cells.
So what I'm seeing here is,
one slide behind that one apparently.
OK, so we are constantly
wearing ourselves out and having to make
new cells so the macula in your eye
today is only 48 hours old, in other
words, you get new cells in the macula
every 48 hours.
The lining of your gut is three weeks old,
the skin you're sitting
in today is six weeks old, your liver is
eight weeks old, and your
nervous system is eight months old.
So we are constantly wearing ourselves
out and having to make new cells.
So it turns out then, the
chronic disease only occurs
when you lose the ability to make new
cells that work.
Let me say that one more time, chronic
disease only occurs when you lose the
ability to make new cells that work.
Well, if that's the case then, we need to ask
the question, what does it take to make a
new cell that works?
Well, as I mentioned, it takes
minus 25 millivolts for a cell
to run but to make a new one, takes
double that, it takes minus 50 millivolts.
And then, in addition to having the
voltage to make new cells, we have to
have all of the nutrients to
make a new cell.
So if your house gets blown down
with a tornado and you have
to build a new one, guess what?
You have to have everything
you need to 'bake' it.
You can't build a new house with door
knobs and bathroom tiles, you have to
have shingles and rafters and doors and
windows, it's that you have to have
everything it takes and this is a big
mistake people make when they're trying
to get well as they try one substance at
a time saying that well,
I want to see what works.
Well it's not going to work
because you have to have everything, all
at one time, to build a new cell.
So we have to have minus 50 millivolts of
energy, we have to have everything it
takes to make a cell and then we have to
deal with any of the toxins that are
hanging around that damage cells as
fast as we make them.
And the most common toxins we
have to deal with are heavy
metals like mercury, toxins coming out of
our teeth and GMO foods with the
pesticide called RoundUp or glyphosate.
Now, the body actually has four different
battery packs because the human body is
a portable electronic device like all
electronic devices it has to have a
battery pack or multiple battery packs.
And so, the reality is that we have these
four different packs.
Now the largest one of
all is our muscles.
Now our muscles are piezoelectric
and for those of you
who aren't physicists that word, funny
word piezoelectricity means that if you
stress a substance and it emits
electrons, that's called piezoelectricity.
So when I move my muscles, I'm generating
electrons which is by the way why
exercise is so important because
exercise is the way the human body is
designed to recharge your own personal
battery pack.
But the reality is also that
our muscles are rechargeable
batteries and so we have then these
large muscles which are our main
batteries and then these muscles battery
packs are all hooked to our cell
membranes.
Now, cell membranes are capacitors so
what is a capacitor, well, capacitor is a
small battery and the way our cell
membranes are designed is with a couple
of opposing layers of funny fats called
phospholipids and these fats have a ball
and then two legs.
Well, the balls are electron conductors
and the legs are insulators so when you
put them like this, you have two
conductors separated by insulator which
by definition is a capacitor which means
it stores electrons.
And then inside the cell, we have
mitochondria and inside the
mitochondria we have another
rechargeable battery system.
When that battery system is charged up,
we call it ATP and then as it gives away
its electrons and discharges, we call it ADP.
Well, because we have a rechargeable
battery system inside our mitochondria,
guess what else we need in there,
a battery charger and the battery charger
inside the cell is called the citric
acid cycle or the Krebs cycle.
So the Krebs cycle runs on primarily fatty
acids and so as you put fatty acids
through the Krebs cycle, it creates
electrons and for every unit of fatty
acids that you put through the Krebs
cycle, if oxygen is present, you get
enough electrons to charge up 38 of
these ATP batteries.
Now in addition we have the DNA.
Now DNA inside of ourselves, we
generally tend to look at it from the
side and we see, looks like we took
a couple of steps,
stepladders and twisted them but if you look
at it from the top, it looks like this.
And every circle of DNA is golden mean
and what that means is that it's 1.618
times, the diameter is 1.618 times the
the height and so forth.
And any place in the universe
where there is something
that's golden mean or in the shape of
platonic solid, it will cause implosion
of scalar energy.
So because our DNA is golden mean
then scalar implodes into it and gives
it its charge so it has the
energy to do its job.
So then we have, our muscles then
are stacked one on top of each other in
a very specific order like stacking
batteries in a flashlight.
And so, surrounding these, the stack of muscle
batteries, we have a substance called fascia
which is very much like a stacking and
of course, fascia is that shiny stuff
you see when you carve the Christmas turkey.
Now the interesting thing about
fascia is that fascia is a semiconductor.
So what in the world is a semiconductor?
Semiconductor is a
collection of molecules arranged in such
a way that electrons move through it at the
speed of light but only in one direction.
So we have then this
continuous stack of fasciae going from
our toes up to our brain, from our
fingers up to our brain and surrounded
by this stacking which serves basically
as the wiring system for the body.
So we have then the stack of muscle batteries
surrounded by the fascia, so that every
organ in the body has its own battery pack.
Because every organ in the body has
its own battery pack, then we have the
ability to isolate, measure that voltage and
figure out why that organ is malfunctioning.
Now, a stack of muscle
batteries it's what's been called an
acupuncture meridian.
So an acupuncture meridian is simply a
stack of muscle batteries.
Now, so this is an example of
an acupuncture meridian called the
spleen meridian and the spleen meridian...
(oops, go back the other way,
there you go).
So the Spleen Meridian starts down in the
big toe, goes up the inside of the leg
and then it goes, there's a special
branch, as you can see, goes over to the
female genitalia, then it goes around the
back where it gets the adrenal glands,
the spleen and the pancreas, then it goes
on, up into the neck and makes a loop and
hooks into what's called the stomach
circuit, and then the stomach circuit
gets the macula of the eye so by the way
if anybody has macular degeneration, it's
because you have low voltage in your
stomach circuit.
It powers the frontal lobes which
is the thinking part
of your brain, then it gets the thyroid,
the breast, the stomach, the male
genitalia and then back down to the big
toe so it makes a loop.
So we have six of these loops
of muscle batteries that
provide the 25 millivolts you need for
the organs to work and the 50 millivolts
to repair them.
So chronic disease occurs when one
of these muscle battery
packs won't hold a charge.
So then that leads us to the
question well, why won't
that battery pack hold a charge?
Well, there is a checklist that you can go
through to try to figure out why it
won't hold, why it won't hold a charge
but basically you have to look at thyroid
hormone because that the thyroid
hormone T3 controls the voltage of
every cell membrane in the body and T2
controls the voltage in the
mitochondria so you have to be sure that
the thyroid hormone level is correct.
Then, if you were to put a scar across
one of these circuits, so if you put a
scar across one of these muscle battery
packs here, it's going to short it out
and it'll drain off some of the voltage.
So scars are, can be a significant
problem but the only scars that really
take you completely down are those on
the main line on your main cable.
A scar across your knee or something will
generally just lower it a few millivolts
but enough to cause some problems.
In addition, emotions are stored in
the body as magnetic fields so if you
have a magnetic field that's stuck in
one of these muscle battery packs here,
it's going to block the voltage so it
won't go through.
And then finally, dental infections are a
significant problem because each of
these circuits go through very specific teeth.
So here you see that we have this main
cable that goes up the back and down the
front, and then from that main cable you
get the voltage coming from our arms and
our legs and they come up to these
lateral terminals and then from those
lateral terminals they go to this central
one and then it starts looping around
the body and as it loops around
the back, it has the option then of going
out and attaching to the ganglia that
are up and down the spinal cord which we
call the autonomic ganglia and then from
the autonomic ganglia it goes to every
organ in the body.
So that's the human body's wiring
system and battery pack
system and so, whenever you have chronic
disease you will have failure of one of
these electronic systems. So you simply
have to start out whenever you have some
sort of illness asking the question, so
what's the battery pack to that illness?
So if you have heart disease you would say
what's the battery pack for the heart?
Well it's obviously the heart muscle battery pack.
There are others that are
not as as obvious, for example there's
the example I gave you, a spleen stomach.
The spleen stomach circuit is the power
supply for the entire endocrine system,
the entire reproductive system in both
males and females, the macula of the eye,
and the thinking part of the brain.
And of course, when that system goes out
which is that one of the more common
ones to go out, then you start having
failure of those organ systems.
So how do we know if the voltage
is low in a circuit?
Well, we have the ability to
measure it with certain acupuncture
points, using what amounts to a
specially-designed ohmmeter.
Now, as we began to then identify the Power
Packs that is not working correctly, we have
two things in front of us, one is to
figure out why that battery pack won't
hold a charge and then the second is to
try to recharge the battery pack while
we're figuring out how to fix the reason
that we got into trouble in the first place.
So we have developed this device called
a bio transducer that puts out both
electromagnetic and scalar energy and if
you simply aim it at the failing organ
you can begin to recharge the cells in
that organ itself and then you want to
come behind it and you want to charge
the muscle battery packs and these
diagrams that we have here, where you see
the red and the black dots, show you
where to put the polarity because every
battery pack, like every other battery
you're aware of, has its as terminals and
polarity so you take patches and you
stick the patches on to where the other
terminals of the battery pack that
doesn't have enough charge, hook it on to
the bio modulator which is a little
portable device that looks a bit like a
computer mouse and it puts out waveforms
that are designed to implode energy and
transfer energy to the cells and
recharge your muscle battery packs.
So you're recharging the organ and the
muscle battery packs while you're
working on figuring out well why won't
that battery pack hold a
charge in the first place.
Now, one of the interesting
things is that our bodies are wired up
like many circuit boards.
As you know, many electronic circuit
boards use Tesla resonating circuits.
A Tesla resonant
circuit is a combination of a capacitor
and a coil wired in parallel.
And when you do that, it has the ability
to communicate with other systems that are a
combination of Tesla resonating circuits.
So in the body, the lung is
always wired to the large intestine,
the heart is always wired to the small
intestine, the spleen and pancreas are
always wired to the stomach, the kidney
is always wired to the bladder and the
liver is always wired at the gallbladder.
Each of these are screeds in a Tesla
resonating circuit and because they are
Tesla circuits, they are able to
communicate with each other.
So one part of our body knows
what's going on in the
other part of the body because we're
wired up with Tesla resonating circuits.
Now, all of these various circuits in the
body go through very specific teeth and
so the teeth act like circuit breakers.
So if you begin to have an infection in
one of your teeth, it will at first begin
to reduce the voltage that's in that
circuit and later actually switch it off.
So the circuit we've been talking about,
the spleen stomach circuit is the one
that you see in yellow here, it's the
upper molars and lower premolars.
And so if you have an infection in an upper
molar, then it's going to begin to affect
your spleen stomach circuit which means
it's going to affect as I mentioned your
entire reproductive system, your entire
endocrine system, the thinking part of
your brain, and the macula of your eye.
So most people with macular degeneration
have an infection in an upper molar.
On the same side is their macular degeneration.
Now, one of the issues then is how do
teeth enter into this whole system?
Well, it turns out that the teeth
appear to function similar to the way
that a lymph node does in the lymphatic system.
If you have infection in your
lymphatic system and it goes up the
lymphatics, it gets caught and trapped in
a lymph node.
Well, emotions are trapped in the
body as magnetic fields and those
magnetic fields tend to end
being trapped in teeth as well.
And so, what you'll find is that the majority
of chronic illnesses actually begins with
an emotional event.
Let me say it one more time,
the majority of chronic diseases actually
begins as an emotional event and that
emotion is a magnetic field that starts
blocking the circuit by getting caught
in one of the teeth and as it does so it
begins to lower the voltage in the tooth.
Now, Dr. Steinman showed that
every tooth has within it a pump that
pumps fluid from inside the tooth to
inside the mouth and that's what keeps
you from getting cavities.
Your kids will be happy to know
that it's not snicker
bars that are causing their cavities,
it's the failure of this pump.
So when their pump begins to fail,
then infection
comes from the mouth into the tooth and
begins to cause decay.
So, the emotion begins to lower
the voltage enough in
the tooth that the pump begins to fail
and then you begin to get a cavity and
then you begin to get a crown and then
you can begin to eventually keep going
until you get a root canal and then that
leads eventually to having a malignancy.
So again, most of the chronic diseases
occurs, begins as emotions.
Now obviously there's some circumstances
where that's not the case.
If you were living in Tokyo
when Fukushima blew up
and you were radiated, obviously that's
not necessarily emotional event in
the sense that you may not have known
you just got radiated, but it's
going to make you sick.
But generally speaking,
(most of the emotions) most of the
chronic disease we have we can trace
back to the emotion that has blocked a
particular muscle battery pack by
blocking the tooth that's involved with it.
Now, when you look at this particular
slide you might ask the question, didn't
anybody ever teach you not to put so
many numbers on one slide?
Well, I did it on purpose because
I wanted you to get
the gestalt of it.
So what you will see is that the
relationship, you'll see that here, that a
pH of seven point three five is the same
as minus twenty millivolts; seven point
four four is the same as minus twenty five.
So that's where our organ, our cells
normally run but as voltage begins to
drop then things begin to get worse and
worse for us until we finally get down
to plus 30 millivolts.
All cancers occur at plus 30 millivolts
so what you see is
that normal tissue is running at
electron donor which is minus 25
millivolts and as you go past zero you
have flipped the polarity, that is that
every battery as you know has a
plus on one end, a minus on the other and
as you drain a battery all the way to
zero, it flips its polarity upside down.
And so, when the polarity reverses is
when, and it gets all the way down to
plus 30 millivolts, it's when malignancies occur.
Now we don't have time to really
go into that in much detail today but
the amount of oxygen that will dissolve
in water is dictated by the voltage of
the water so as the water inside of
ourselves has lower and lower voltage
then the oxygen in the cell comes out of
the cell and disappears and when you
finally flip the polarity, there is so
little oxygen capability in the cell
that the stem cells recognize that
signal that hey, we just ran out of
oxygen here, please help!
And so stem cells go over and invade the
local blood supply and create a massive
blood vessels that we call a cancer
which is indistinguishable from a
placenta in a pregnant female.
So basically all solid tumors are
placentas, that is the body's way of
responding to lack of voltage and oxygen.
So if we begin then to think about the
the way that this
works, think about my thumb.
My thumb is a perfectly good thumb by the way.
It's running at what voltage? -25 millivolts.
Now I hit it with a hammer and I destroy
some cells in my thumb.
What's going to happen is that
the thumb's immediately
going to go to minus 50 millivolts and
minus 50 millivolts causes the
arterioles to dilate and the reason that
happens of course is we need the raw
materials dumped at the curb there so to
speak so that we can rebuild the cells
we destroyed with a hammer.
Well when those capillaries dilate,
we get all the
signs we normally call inflammation,
we have redness, we have swelling, we have
heat, we have a pulsing pain, and it makes
you say bad words.
So my thumb gets busy and it makes
new cells, it replaces those
that I smashed with a hammer, goes back to
minus 25 millivolts and I'm a happy camper.
But on the other hand if,
when I smash my thumb, if the power
supply going to the thumb is inadequate
to provide the -50 millivolts I need to
make new cells, then my thumb won't heal and
I'm stuck in chronic disease, you see that?
So I can take all the pills I want,
I can do all the surgery I want on the
thumb, but it'll never get well until I
do what--insert enough electrons to get
me up to minus 50 millivolts.
And so if you understand what I just told you
about the thumb, you understand basically
my whole lecture so I can go home now.
Oh no, wait a minute, it's still a little
bit more but the point is that chronic
disease occurs when you don't have
enough voltage to make new cells and so
as voltage begins to drop, then oxygen
begins to drop and when oxygen drops
there are several bad things that begin to happen.
The one of the things that, as
I mentioned earlier, is that you
began to have less ATP which is the
voltage inside the cell that cell needs
to do its business.
Now I also mentioned to you that as,
because of the Krebs cycle
being able to make, to recharge 38 of these
ATP batteries for every unit of fatty
acid you put through the krebs cycle,
that's only true if oxygen is available.
If oxygen is unavailable, then for every
unit of fatty acid you put through
the battery charger, you only get enough
electrons to charge up two batteries.
So it's a bit like having a car that goes from
38 miles to gallon to 2 miles the gallon.
Your cells become very inefficient.
Now in addition to having inefficiency of
the intracellular voltage, we have
problems with bugs.
Now the body contains perhaps trillion
bugs of various kinds and the majority
of them are suppressed by oxygen
but as oxygen levels begin to drop
because voltage drops, then these bugs
wake up and the first thing the bugs
want to do is have lunch and they want
to have you for lunch.
Now bugs don't have teeth so that they can
take a bite out of you so instead they put
out digestive enzymes to dissolve your
cells so they can get the nutrients.
So think about having a sore throat.
The strep bacteria on your tonsils having a
picnic and they're having a good old time,
but you have the world's worst sore
throat, you have a headache, you have a
fever, you have been vomiting, you have
diarrhea, your joints hurt, you have a
miserable day and it's because the bugs
are having their way by putting out
these digestive enzymes to get their
nutrients out of the cells.
Now one of the things is that as voltage
and oxygen drop more and more, these
microorganisms lose their cell membranes
so they become what have been called
cell wall deficient organisms or stealth patogens.
One of the problems with that
is, first of all you can't culture them.
Secondly, you don't see them with a
standard microscope, you need one of
these fancy microscopes called phase
contrast or dark field microscope.
And these bugs then put out various
toxins and begin to damage the local
tissue and often what we call an
autoimmune disease is simply these bugs
having their way with your local tissue.
So as they put out their toxins, you get
the signs of inflammation and swelling
and so forth but if you try to culture
anything or look at a biopsy of that
area, you don't see anything because
normal hospitals and physicians' offices
don't use one of these microscopes so
where you can actually see them.
In these images that you see on the screen,
you see these various cell wall deficient
bugs inside red blood cells consuming them,
in the lower right you see where I
took red blood cells, put it under a
coverslip on a microscope slide and let
it sit there for a few hours and as it
consumed all of the oxygen, you see the
Lyme spirochetes coming crawling
out of the red cells.
So everybody in this room has
Lyme disease, it's just
whether or not your immune system has
the ability to deal with it, whether you
have symptoms from it.
So then as the voltage gets down toward plus
30 millivolts, then the cell wall deficient
fungus shows up and you began to have
these kinds of cells, this is a blood
from a fellow who had leukemia and you
can see the fungal forms in his blood
that the fungus is always associated
with these kinds of things.
So I'm going to skip past, this is just a
better microscopic view and I want to go to
talk to you a minute more about teeth
because that's terribly important in the
understanding how to get people well.
Now, if you look at the lower left image,
you see a car battery that has corrosion
around it which means that the
alternator in that car is going to have
trouble keeping that battery charged up.
Well, the tooth just above it is attached
to a muscle battery but it also has
corrosion and thus it also has trouble
keeping that battery charged up and then
as corrosion in either your car battery
or your tooth gets worse over time, then
it gets harder and harder and harder
and harder to keep your battery packs
charged up and eventually in the car
battery the corrosion will come outside
the battery itself and start corroding
through your battery cable which now
means you have a total short-circuit and
your car won't start.
Well, this process occurs in the
body when the infection in
the tooth moves out into the bone so
when you have infection in a bone around
a tooth it actually works just like a
circuit breaker and shake takes down
that circuit and then the two
circumstances in which that occurs is
either a root canal tooth, which is of
course a dead tooth,
most of you may know the way you do a
root canals, you drill a little hole in
the top of the tooth and you put an
auger down and then you rip out the
artery and rip out the nerve and kill
the tooth and then you fill it with putty.
You know, the problem is that now
the tooth is dead and all dead
tissue gets infected.
The dentists are the only
physicians that believe you can get away
with leaving dead tissue in the body.
No other doctor believes that.
So, one root canal tooth shuts down
sixty-three percent of your immune system.
So and then what makes it worse is that it
then gets out into the bone and when it gets
into the bone it shuts off that
circuit and so now the voltage drops
significantly in that circuit and that's
why you find in the, we looked at all the
cancer patients we've seen in our clinic
and ninety five percent of them are
associated with a root canal or an
infected bone where a tooth had been
pulled, ninety five percent!
So a leading contributor to cancer is having an
infection in the bone around one of the teeth.
Now, in addition to root canals,
there's a problem when teeth get pulled
because teeth are held into the bone by
a ligament called a periodontal ligament.
What dentists are trained to do is
wiggle the tooth, make it loose, take it
out, put a stitch, and quit leaving the
ligament behind.
When you do that, it's very hard
for the bone to heal because
of the ligaments in the way.
And even if the dentist happens
to be one who takes the
to scrape out that ligament, because the
mouth is such a dirty place, often times
people get infection in the bone during
the first few days of healing once the
tooths been pulled.
So once you, and that's called
a cavitation by the way, so
whether you have infection from a root
canal or from a cavitation, it tends to
shut down the circuit and one of the
problems is that infection in the bone
then tends to move over and
take out the next circuit.
So a huge problem is that
our kids are in high school and they go
to the dentist and they say oh, you got
to get your wisdom teeth out.
It's that old thing of whether if you go
to Midas you get a muffler.
So a study came out last year showing that 65
percent of root canal extractions were unnecessary.
Well, nevertheless they get
their wisdom teeth pulled
and now they start getting infection in
that area and the wisdom teeth circuit
is heart-small intestine but listen, it's
the autonomic nervous system.
Autonomic nervous system is
the body's on-off switches.
So all of a sudden, within days
after getting their wisdom teeth
extracted, the kids have lost their
on/off switch which means they, their
bodies doesn't allow to control itself.
Then, over time, it begins to move next door
and takes out the spleen-stomach circuit.
Now remember that the spleen
circuit is the power supply to the
adrenal glands so now, soon, they've lost
their control panel, their on/off
system and then they lose their adrenals
so they can't deal with stress and so
they began to become what many people
say oh, he's just a teenager.
Well no, he's not just a teenager,
he's lost his 
ability, the whole but way the
body deals with stress.
And so many of our kids hide
themselves within electronics because
within the electronics they have an
on/off switch, in their body they don't
so they can't deal with the real world
anymore and so they hide within their
cell phone and their game boys or
whatever you call them.
Nevertheless, this is a huge problem.
Now when you lose,
I only got five minutes left, so when you
lose your ability to make adrenalin, you
go down the following slippery slope, you
have trouble going to sleep, you have
trouble dealing with stress, you have
trouble with your memory and
then you can't multitask.
So you're sitting,
reading a book or watching TV and
somebody says hey, do you
want mustard or mayonnaise?
You become very annoyed
because they have interrupted you but you
don't have the mental horsepower to stay
attached to whatever you're doing so you
detach, you pick mustard, you go back to
your book and now you can't remember
your place and you're even more annoyed.
And then it gets to where you don't like
any stimulus so you don't like loud
noises, loud music, rowdy crowds can't be
around people who are arguing and
eventually it gets to where you don't
even want to be touched you just want to
sit in the corner and have people
leave you the heck alone.
And then your sexual
equipment quits working and then you
can't go to sleep before 11:00 and when
you wake up you're still tired, all of
that's due to the lack - loss of the
spleen power supplying the adrenals.
Well, what I've just described
of course is very destructive.
If you can't deal with
the life or the world, you can't be a
good spouse and particularly if your
sexual equipment doesn't work anymore
then that's a big problem in a marriage.
You can't be a good parent because kids
make noise and want something from you
and you have nothing to give, you can't
be a good worker, you can't be a good
friend you can't be good at much of
anything so your life's in the toilet
simply because you've lost the spleen
circuit that goes to the adrenal glands
and that's a huge problem in our society.
Well now, Eileen McKusick spoke earlier
about mapping the field of emotions
and this is the traditional Chinese
one so that the various circuits have
these various sorts of emotions get
stuck in these various particular places
or in the teeth that are associated
with these, Dr. Banis published these
and of course Eileen has published
hers which is this group of where
things get stuck.
And as far as the erasing emotions
are concerned, because
emotions are magnetic field, you can
erase them with a stronger magnetic field.
One of the laws of physics is, if
you take any magnet and you put a
stronger magnet over it, then the weaker
magnet assumes the characteristics of
the stronger one and so when you have
these emotions that are stuck, you can
begin to erase them in a
variety of different ways.
Now there are various
groups over the years that have looked
at this subject and tried to figure out
how to do it, EFT, Psych-K, Emotion Codes,
Psychosomatic Energetics, etc, etc, but
certainly we have developed one where
you can, if you can think about emotion
while holding onto these hand grips with
your bio modulator you could erase the
emotion but when we did that we were
doing one emotion at the time and of
course, Eileen talked to you this morning
about using her tuning fork to do it
which is very effective.
What I have recently found is that,
if you treat the
wisdom teeth, which treats your autonomic
nervous system, then you can begin to
knock out, you can not only change the
polarity in all of your various circuits
at one time but also knock out many of
emotions automatically.
Now a pendulum is actually a, like a single
string on a guitar and the weight on the pendulum
makes the string taut so when you move,
when it's moved it's actually resonating
with whatever frequency the string is.
So what you do is you hold this pendulum
over the small intestine, heart-small
intestine autonomic system and you take
the bio transducer and simply put it
over the wisdom teeth and you watch the
pendulum and it'll always be spinning
backwards if the voltage is low, counter-
clockwise, and you keep holding it there
and pretty soon it'll slow down and then
it'll start spinning clockwise, and then
you do the same on the other side again
holding the pendulum
over the heart-small intestine
circuit, put the bio transducer over the
autonomic system at where you can access
it at the tooth, watch it spin backwards
and in the correct way and now when you
go back and check all of the circuits
you've corrected the polarity in every
circuit and many of the emotions that
you had found out in the bio field are
already gone as well.
So, unfortunately I don't have the
time to talk to you about
how we're wired up with polarity
and how our bodies are golden
mean and how implosion occurs. If you're
interested in those subjects, then we
have some videos that will help you in
that area, plus we will be giving some
demonstration if there are any of you in
the audience who happen to have any
emotion, anybody here?
We'll be doing some demonstrations
in the breakout room.
So what I've hoped to accomplish in these
few minutes I had to talk with you is to
help you understand that the body is
an electronic device which has a
multiple battery packs and the chronic
disease occurs when those battery packs
won't hold a charge and that getting
well involves you identifying which
battery packs are failing, you
identifying the reason that they're
failing you and fixing that so that it's
basically, what we're doing is like you
coming home from work and opening the
fridge and it's hot in there and the
lamp in the living room won't turn on,
the TV in the bedroom won't turn on, and
you go out in the garage and flip the
circuit breaker--now everything works.
Well that's the way we do medicine now.
As we figure out which circuit breaker is
out, go fix it, turn you back on and let
your body heal itself which it does very
well if it has the voltage, the nutrients
and deal with the toxins.
Thank you for allowing me to be here!

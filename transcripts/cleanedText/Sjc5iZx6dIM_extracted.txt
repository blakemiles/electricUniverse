In June of 2022, I offered an explanation of why dark
matter doesn't exist. That line of reasoning came directly
from an application of the properties of the Electric Sun 
model. The mainstream, accepted model has no way
to describe or explain dark matter. I 
presented that discussion in my latest
book “The Interconnected Cosmos”, and also in
there are explanations of several other phenomena
that can only be understood by referencing
the properties of the Electric Sun model.
One of these is the so-called solar wind.
Now, a gigantic flow of electrically
charged particles is more accurately called an electric
current. But astronomers had already completely
convinced themselves that there was no
possibility of separated charges moving
through interplanetary space, when in 1962 the Mariner-2
space probe that was on its way to Venus, detected it.
Astronomers didn't know what to make of this.
Ignoring the earlier 1908 prediction by
Kristian Birkeland that electric corpuscles
such as this would indeed be discovered,
Eugene Parker named the flow the solar
wind, effectively robbing from Birkeland the
recognition he so richly deserved for his now validated
prediction. Also naming it a wind, successfully
camouflaged its true electrical nature. Anyway, later the Ulysses Solar Probe
discovered that this wind came in two
varieties, an irregular, relatively slow type of
flow with speeds of up to 400 kilometers
per second - that's not slow - but there's
also a fast one with speeds up to twice
that, 800 kilometers per second. So there
are two different types, two different
speeds of these two different solar winds.
The slow one typically comes from the Sun's
equatorially-located so-called ’streamer belt’.
The fast type comes from the relatively
peaceful surface that we see when we
look down through coronal holes at the
normal surface of the smooth photosphere.
In my book, I point out “...that some
skeptics have made much of the idea that
electrons are found in both the fast and
slow solar winds along with positive ions.
Yes. That's true. But that doesn't mean
that the net flow of charge is zero. In a
plasma, electrons and ions are separated.
If they weren't, we wouldn't have a
plasma, we would have a simple neutral gas
flow.” But in interplanetary space they are
separated; negative electrons are generally
attracted toward the positively charged Sun,
and positive ions are repelled by that Sun.
These forces are generally relatively weak.
An interplanetary electric field of only a
few volts or even microvolts per kilometer
is sufficient - given that it extends 
over millions of kilometers to accelerate
those solar wind ions to speeds of 400 kilometers
per second and 800 kilometers per second.
But consider what occurs when an
electron, moving in toward the Sun
approaches an ion that is moving outward away 
from the Sun. As the ion and the electron get closer
to each other, the attractive force between them
increases. The strength of the attractive force
applied to the positive ion is exactly
equal to the force applied to the electron.
These are purely attractive electrical forces and
they're equal because both particles have exactly the
same amount of electric charge
and they are of opposite sign.
But the ion has about 1800 times the mass of the 
electron. It's sort of like a tug-of-war between a
mouse running in one direction and an
elephant going in the other direction.
They're both pulling with the same amount of force on
the stretched spring between them. But the elephant
- the plus ion - continues merely on his trajectory 
carrying the poor mouse - the electron -
roughly in his direction. The ion does not capture the
electron, because recombination would quench the plasma.
So the electron often ends up being dragged along by
the ion but wildly oscillating around the ion at what is
called the “plasma frequency.” So how does the Electric
Sun model explain the two different solar winds?
The essence of the Electric Sun is shown in this image.
In this diagram the horizontal axis of each plot
is the radial distance outward from a point
just below the Sun's photospheric surface.
That surface is opaque; we can't see down through it.
That's why some people think that is a surface.
The top plot shows how the voltage
changes as we go out from the surface.
It isn't really a surface, it's a layer. But 
it's analogous to what we would get if
we plotted a cross section of the dam at
the end of a reservoir that holds back
water. The middle plot shows three different 
charge layers that create that voltage distribution.
They are three very thin concentric
spherical shells that surround the Sun.
The height of those triangular regions that 
you see, shows the force per unit charge
that a positive ion would experience at those
various radial distances. A positive value of that
is an outward force. So, any 
ion that can get to a point in the
chromosphere (this would be between points b 
and d), will fall down the voltage hill just like
a ball rolls down a hill. Dropping down the
voltage hill makes the ion go faster and faster.
In other words, it accelerates.
Its velocity is plotted in the bottom curve.
This next image shows what happens
normally, when the level of the most
energetic ions within the body of the Sun have just
enough energy to leak over the top of the voltage dam.
The purple is the water and you can 
see it just being a little higher than the
photospheric tuft and it's leaking over the top 
there. If the effective height of the dam can
be varied, the volume - that's called the density
flow; how much stuff is flowing there - can be varied.
This flow, as it passes out of the image
toward the lower right, experiences turbulence.
This is measured as the temperature of
the ion flow; this creates the anomalous
extremely high temperature of the lower corona
that begins here something like two million Kelvin.
Clearly our dam on the Sun is electrical; not
made of steel and cement that holds back a fluid.
It's made from what astronomers call photospheric
granules. But plasma scientists call them anode tufts.
The flow, as it moves off to the right is called the
fast solar wind. Its velocity is due solely to the height
of the dam - the height of the voltage
drop through which the ions fall.
Its density, that is how many amperes it contains
or how many gallons per minute are flowing,
is controlled by the height of the
floodgate, the little floodgate at the
top and a very minor movement of that floodgate
can really change the amount of the flow.
The solar wind actually stopped for
a day or two a few years ago. Why?
Did somebody raise the floodgate and cut the water flow?
Needless to say the Standard Model has
no explanation for this phenomenon, but the Electric
Sun does. The higher the face of the dam, the
greater the velocity of the water when it
gets to the bottom. It's just that simple.
But what happens if in some region the dam is 
taken away? You visualize somebody blows a hole in
the dam, or the dike breaks. Then water,
or ions in our case, would flood out from the reservoir.
The density of the flood would be greater,
more gallons per second, more amperes. But
the velocity would be lower because the
stuff would be falling from a lower height.
Not over the top of the dam wall which
is way up high. The lower voltage, in the
real case a lower height from the water analogy.
The real explanation is obvious from this diagram.
This is the same cross section we saw earlier, but a
sunspot is a place where there is no photospheric tuft to
create a dam. So, if you remove the black
line, all you're left with is the interior of
the Sun. There is at voltage V1 on the vertical axis
and the the ions - you can see the red curve - just
flood outward from that out toward the
lower corona. They're not restrained in
any way as the path of the ions coming
through the granules, the ones on
the top, they have to get up over that higher voltage V2.
And then they fall higher - it's steeper - drop down
to where they created some turbulence.
But anyway a Sunspot is a place where
there are no photospheric tufts to
create the dam and the Sun's internal
energy, being that voltage V1 and the
energy level of the dam itself is V2, so
in a Sunspot the internal ions are
unrestrained and are able to get out of
the Sun by just falling from level V1.
So they aren't going as fast as those
that fall all the way down from level V2.
And this is how the slow solar wind is
created from sunspots. The 
voluminous but relatively slow
moving ions of the slow solar wind
flow easily up and out of a sunspot.
So we see here the same region of the Sun in all
three images. The top picture is the photosphere which
is the innermost layer that is closest
to the center of the Sun, the one that's
at lowest solar altitude, if you want to
think of it that way, and it obviously
includes a beautiful big sunspot group. The middle
picture is taken at a slightly higher level than
the one at the top, and it's of the chromo-
sphere. In reality that's of course above
the photosphere. And the bottom picture is 
higher still in altitude, and it's a picture of the
lower part of the corona which extends
outward from that point out to those
several radiuses of the values of the 
Sun. So the layer that's at the lowest
altitude on the Sun, the photosphere
at the top in this image, and the layer
that's located at the highest solar altitude, the 
lower corona, appears in the bottom of the image.
You can see the effect of ions that pour
up from the sunspots. They create a high
level of turbulence when they enter the
chromosphere and even more when they hit
the lower corona, so you can see they're white.
The photosphere is covered by granulation.
It consists of closely packed plasma tufts.
The chromosphere is a layer that begins
about 250 miles above the photosphere
and it's about a thousand miles thick.
The lower corona begins just above the
chromosphere and it extends outward a
distance of several solar radii. The 
dark region at the bottom left of
this image is a coronal hole. It's simply
an area in the Sun's corona that's
located above a nice normal quiescent
photospheric region that is devoid of
any sunspots or other irregularities.
These holes are associated with quiet Sun.
It may seem to an inexperienced person
and to some scaremongers on the internet
that coronal holes are something to be
feared or worried about. They aren't.
They're just not disturbed regions
from which coronal mass ejections
or any other violent ejections of matter
usually emanate. They're peaceful regions
more than any other area such as
the streamer belt. It's a normal
region on the Sun where the photosphere
has a smooth appearance and tufting is
relatively uniform and undisturbed. And 
that's where the fast solar wind comes from.
Please summarize the important
properties of the so-called solar wind.
First, there's a factor of two difference
between the maximum velocities of the two winds.
Secondly, the density of the slow wind is
well over that of the fast wind. The amount of
matter, the amount of stuff, in the slow
wind is 85 percent greater than in the
more controlled fast wind. Slow 
wind just pours out of an open hole,
so that's why there's more material in it. Thirdly, 
temperature is a measure of the random
excitement motion of the particles in a 
plasma. In the fast wind this level is six
times greater than in the slow wind.
In the fast wind ions collide forcefully
with the bottom of their great fall.
Slow wind ions easily escape without
falling through a great voltage drop, so they're
not as turbulent as the as the fast solar wind.
Fourth, the random motions of electrons in the
two winds are relatively in the same order of
magnitude, the slow wind electrons being only about
30 percent more excited than those in the fast wind.
But this observation was made at roughly Earth's distance
from the Sun. If you realize that the electrons in
both winds at that point are coming in toward the
Sun from the outer regions of the solar system.
And so they have not yet been through the mixing effects,
the scrambling effects of the tuft voltage drops just
above the photosphere. That lies in
their future when they get closer in.
Fifth, in the Electric Sun model the
turbulence of the fast wind ions is
caused by their falling through this high 
voltage drop. And that explains the extreme
temperature of the lower corona which has
baffled astronomers for decades. Sixth and final,
the Electric Sun model explains the
fluctuations in the volume, that is to
say the quantity of material, in the fast solar wind
and how it once was cut off for more than a day.
Now, none of these six observed facts are
explained by the Standard Model of cosmology.
They all result from electrical forces that the ions
experience. They're prime pieces of evidence of the
validity of the Electric Sun model which
is a major component of the overall
Electric Universe hypothesis or the
Electric Universe model of cosmology.
In the Standard Model their eyes are wide shut to
the obvious presence of electricity in the cosmos.
But those that use common sense 
and think for themselves can see the
magnificence of our truly Electric Universe.
How long do you think it'll be before
astronomers open their eyes to what
is actually going on in the cosmos?
Is conventional science presently living
in a reincarnation of the middle ages,
where there was a privileged class,
consisting of the king, the nobles and the clergy
who held all the power and the general
population believed whatever nobility told them?
And the ascendance of real empirical science
would not emerge for many centuries to come,
until enough people caught on
that the emperor had no clothes.

Welcome to Space News from
the Electric Universe,

Planet Earth is home to an
extraordinary diversity of species.
Their current total numbers are
estimated at around 10 million
including between 1 and 2
million animal species.
However, scientists estimate that
documenting all terrestrial species,
if it could ever be achieved, could take
as long as another thousand years.
The consensus theory of the origins
and evolution of life on Earth
states that it all began 3.8 billion
years ago, with single-celled organisms.
Through an exhaustive study
of the geological record,
scientists have constructed a
story of our planet's history
and the life that inhabits it.
But how reliable is this story?
We have proposed a radically different
origin and history of planet Earth
and indeed of our
entire solar system.
Planets do not form from accretion in
gravitationally collapsing nebular clouds.
Rather, the Electric Universe has proposed
two forms of planetary formation.
The ejection of rocky planets
from the cores of gas giants
and planets forming from the
electromagnetic z-pinch effect
along the same networks of filaments
where stars are now known to form.
The discovery of countless so-called
'baffling exoplanetary systems'
have further demonstrated
the emphatic failure
of the two and a half centuries
old nebular hypothesis.
In our Electric Universe, the
actual age of the Earth,
our parent star and
our solar system,
cannot be quantified based
on our current understanding.
Further complicating any attempts
to assess our own planet's age
is the overwhelming evidence for
relatively recent global catastrophes,
events that were recorded
in the myths, folklore
and countless ancient and
religious texts around the world.
We have proposed that in an epoch of planetary
instability in the inner solar system,
powerful interplanetary lightning
carved planetary surfaces.
A hypothesis with an increasing
body of scientific support.
As our growing community of
experimentalists have demonstrated,
countless familiar
geological features
are easily reproduced by electrical
discharge to a solid surface.
Of course if these
events did occur,
both the geological and anthropological
timelines of popular scientific theory
must be reassessed.
Indeed, in our Electric Universe the entire
question of evolutionary time-tables
must be reopened for further
scientific investigation.
And today, recent scientific reports
have delivered a shocking blow
to the standard theory of the
evolution of life on Earth.
Earlier this year, scientists from New
York and Sweden published the results
of a sweeping study of
5 million DNA barcodes
from about 100 thousand
animal species.
As reported by phys.org on
May 28, 2008, the results are,
"...sure to jostle, if not overturn, more than
one settled idea about how evolution unfolds.
It is textbook biology, for example, that
species with large, far-flung populations
― think ants, rats, humans ―
will become more genetically
diverse over time.
But is that true?
'The answer is no,' said Mark
Stoeckle, lead author of the study,
published in the journal
Human Evolution."
In addition to this surprising
absence of genetic diversity,
the authors were stunned to conclude that
about nine out of every ten species on Earth
appear to have come into
being at about the same time,
apparently sometime between
100,000 and 200,000 years ago.
Study co-author David
Thaler said of the findings,
"...this conclusion is very surprising, and
I fought against it as hard as I could."
One unavoidable possibility
that these results raise
is articulated in the
phys.org report which asks,
"Was there some catastrophic event 200,000
years ago that nearly wiped the slate clean?"
In part one of this two-part presentation,
Thunderbolts colleague Peter Mungo Jupp
begins a comprehensive and radical
reassessment of the questions.
How old is the Earth and how
has life unfolded upon it?
How old is the Earth
and all its species?
In 1650 AD, Bishop Ussher
proposed that the world's age,
gleaned from the biblical
Genesis, was 6,000 years old.
This relied on stated timelines
from the book of Jasher.
It was not until more recent times that
new paradigms started to take hold.
William Buckland, in the early 1800's,
noted the part that catastrophic events
had formed the
geological landscape.
However, Buckland's student Lyell broke
away to form a radical new scenario.
Drawing on the work
of Hutton, he argued
that the Earth was transformed
not by unimaginable catastrophes
but by imperceptibly
slow changes,
many of which we can
see around us today.
For instance, rain erodes mountains
while molten rock slowly pushes up
to create new ones.
The eroded sediments
form into layers of rock
which can later be
lifted above sea level
tilted by the forces of the
uprising rock and eroded away again.
These changes are tiny
but he reasoned, with enough time
they could produce vast changes.
Both Hutton and Lyell therefore argued
that the Earth was millions of years old.
Time in the form of millions of years was the
key to explaining the geological landscape.
Uniformitarianism as a
theory was thus born.
The use of millions of years as an explanation
of gradual change was seized on by Darwin
who envisaged evolution as a sort
of biological uniformitarianism.
Evolution took place from
one generation to the next
before our very eyes, he argued.
But it worked too slowly
for us to perceive.
So out of this was born
Darwin's prime theory,
evolution by natural selection.
Or as we know it,
survival of the fittest.
Evolution arose from happy slow mutational
changes that were either rejected
or finally adopted and passed on to
future generations of that species.
However, the lack of
intermittent adaptive species
was and is a fundamental flaw
to this time-driven theory.
Nevertheless, this paradigm
still seems to infect
every area of modern
geology and biology.
It was only later that Alfred
Wallace reformatted this theory
and expounded a
totally new concept.
He formed the theory of
evolution by intelligent design.
Parts of the brain, for
instance, were so complex
that it seemed impossible to subscribe
their formation to accidental development.
There had to be a guiding force
that designed and managed
purposeful change.
Both forms of evolution
described change through time
but only Wallace's intelligent evolution
limits the power of natural selection
to effect biological change.
It suggested, in those areas
of the biological world
beyond the scope of natural
selection's operations,
some purposeful intelligence must be
called upon to explain their existence.
In contrast, Darwinian evolution
claims that all biological life
can be explained through a directionless
process of survival of the fittest
and random mutation.
This fact has powerful implications
for the age of life on Earth
as it doesn't necessarily rely on
time as the arbiter of species change.
Wallace's theory complements the late Stephen
Gould's most significant contribution
to evolutionary biology.
This was the theory of punctuated
equilibrium which he developed in 1972.
The theory proposes that most
evolution is characterized by periods
of evolutionary stability
which is infrequently punctuated by
swift periods of branching speciation.
This theory was contrasted
against phyletic gradualism,
the popular idea that
evolutionary change is marked
by pattern of smooth and continuous
change in the fossil record.
Gould's theory lays the groundwork for the
penetration of cataclysmic intervention
into genetic
reformulation of species
and ceases the demands
for long periods of time
to explain the age of the
Earth and its inhabitants.
Now how can we date the
Earth's biology and geology?
Proof of theories is very dicey as too often
they work towards a predefined finale.
These outcomes can strongly
bias scientific evidence,
often this is the case when one
unproven dating methodology
is used as evidence for the
veracity of some new process.
This is particularly true in the case
of the mitochondrial-DNA-atomic-clock-
-follow genetic studies where we'll
be aiming our main critique.
But first I would like to summarize
the more classic methods of dating
in our clarification of Earth age.
Now firstly you have
classic mythology,
historical facts and biblical sources which
themselves are quite often historic.
They often are underestimated
but these can be very important
sources of both relative,
as for parallel
civilizational studies,
and absolute dating events.
But as the historical Egyptian king-lists
show, they can be grossly incorrect
depending on the basis from
which they are sourced.
Velikovsky versus the world is but
one controversial academic argument.
Nevertheless, they do provide in many cases
a broad brush to place historical events.
For instance, whether it's the Trojan War
which circuits around a thousand BC
or Maya civilizations,
we can glean some rough idea within
at least 500 years' timescale.
But this is recent history.
Beyond 6,000 years ago, we are
beyond the scope of written history
and have to essentially turn to modern
scientific dating tools to support our work.
Now let's first examine
carbon dating.
It's important to be aware of carbon dating
fundamentals and their serious limitations
beyond 6,000 years
beyond the present time.
Standardization procedures involving
tree-ring sequences has this limitation.
Two of the basic assumptions on
which radiometric dating are based
are that the Earth is an
isolated body in space,
unaffected by interactions
with other bodies
and that the decay
constant is not variable.
Again, the decay constant
is not variable.
No matter what, no matter where,
the half-life of a particular
radioactive isotope remains the same.
Carbon dating not only varies with
the amount of water to absorb it
and thus decrease the amount
available to the living organism,
but would be susceptible with
extraneous ratios from cosmic rays.
Now at times for instance, CME's, or
coronal mass ejections from the Sun,
does dramatically vary carbon-12
to carbon-14 isotope ratio
and for that matter
carbon-13 isotope ratios.
Furthermore, even when
absorbed by living organisms
as to start the clock
for carbon dating,
there is no guarantee these
ratios stay the same.
For instance, bacteria can
selectively differentiate carbon-13
from carbon-12 and perhaps
take them out of the system.
They can alter the isotope
balance after death.
This anomaly is aside from the
fact that carbon-14 dates
taken in isotopically chaotic times
are necessarily heavily distorted.
W.F. Libby, the inventor of carbon dating,
clearly saw the limitations of the method
and the conditions under which his
theoretical figures would be valid.
Libby understood the three
reservoirs of radiocarbon on Earth;
the atmosphere, the biosphere,
and the hydrosphere.
The hydrosphere or oceans
and seas is the richest-
the correctness of the method
depends greatly on the condition
that in the last 40
or 50 thousand years
the quantity of water in the hydrosphere
and carbon thus diluted in it
has not substantially changed.
The author Flood quotes from
Chappell that the sea levels
were low, for instance
around the Wallace Line,
around Indonesia abutting the Pacific
Ring of Fire, around 20,000 years ago.
This lower amount of water must
then generally falsify results.
Even the assumed 20,000 year-
-old-figure is unreliable
if based on erroneous paradigm.
The method depends
also on the condition
that during the same period of
time, the influx of cosmic rays
or energy particles coming
from the stars and the
Sun has not suffered
substantial variations.
There are a number
of possible reasons
for the variation in radio
carbon content of the atmosphere.
Changes in the cosmic ray concentration
due to the activity of the Sun
and galactic influences and changes
in the Earth's magnetic field
which modulates
proton concentration
which in turn affects the rate
of production of carbon-14.
And as Libby, the inventor
of carbon dating, states,
"These conclusions (this is on
the basis of carbon dating)
could be false if errors in
the very different quantities
― the intensity of the cosmic rays and the
mixing rate and depths of the oceans ―
should happen just to
cancel one another."
It should also be noted, most of these
specimens were heavily fossilized
and the effects of this process
may have important connotations
regarding contamination.
They also reflect a dramatic
environment at the time of death.
Fossilization could also
heavily influence the validity
of the assumptions beyond,
for instance, carbon dating.
Now let's take an example.
When characterizing hominid WHL 50
from the Willandra lakes in Australia,
the archaeologist
Flood describes silica
replacing the phosphate
in that specimen's bones.
Opalized is the term she
uses and this to her
is proof of great
antiquity, but is it?
Similarly, Kow Swamps assemblage in Australia
has been preserved by calcification,
that's fossilization
in other words.
This fossilization of human remains
has occurred without exception
in all of the huge
Australian limits.
Now remember, De Grazia notes;
fossil is typically an accident,
a disaster, an anomaly.
The problem with fossilization
is to stop the decay
and that means killing everything in the
organism at once, including the bacteria.
What dies is thus quickly
recycled biotically
unless some geological
intervention occurs.
It's quite possible the fossils found
in these Australian lunettes
were killed instantly
and then petrified.
Intervention that fossilizes is almost
always connected to the cause of death.
I suspect, an enormous electrical shock
from the Lake Mungo magnetic reversal
might do just that.
In fact, as Wallace
Thornhill points out,
"A huge current flow must necessarily
accompany a magnetic reversal."
If that's the case,
which it must be,
then the Lake Mungo and Lake
Victoria deposits in Australia
might be the result of past
catastrophic electrical interactions
between the Earth and
a cosmological event.
Could this fact also signal
a possible mutation driver?
However, paramount is the fact that all of
these remains are not necessarily ancient
because they're fossilized.
Secondly, as Gillespie, who dated much
of the Willandra hominids, points out;
The very nature of fossilizing can
skew the results of carbon dating.
If the carbon is replaced or transmuted
to silicon, ratios can easily be altered.
From this contamination or selective
bleaching of the carbon-14 isotope
to heightened age.
His doubts are voiced
in this quoted article,
"Have direct dating measurements on
skeletal remains helped to resolve
the Lake Mungo, Willandra
Lakes, chronology?
Should we believe
the older dates,
which always seem curiously
more desirable to archaeologists,
measured on base-soluble
humic acids fractions,
or the younger dates
on insoluble residues?
The unpalatable choice for both
black sediment and burnt bone dates
seems to be between soluble or
insoluble organic humic substances,
both of which are of unknown
composition and dubious origin.
Now the architect Webb argued for the older
soluble humic acids dates on these burnt bones,
on my advice at the time.
I subsequently changed my view and
supported the younger insoluble dates,
on the grounds that humic acids of
whatever age are not likely to represent
the burnt carbon we seek
in charcoal or burnt bone.
Not much of a choice and
neither may be the real age."
The problem of the doubtful integrity
of fossil carbon dates has also risen
with Tom Loy's work at
Australian National University.
Using a technique of
minute samples of blood
from the bone carbon residues of
human remains, ancient human remains,
he was able to accurately
date those samples.
The reasoning is; the blood,
unlike other protein remains,
is extremely robust and gives
a distinct clean reading
compared to other
protein samples.
These are classically destroyed by many
environmental actions, for instance bacteria.
With these minute samples,
he was able to date not only megafauna
from Lake Eyre, South Australia,
but samples of the de WHL 50
hominid from the Willandra Lakes.
The mass spectrometer reading was
5580 years before the present.
This directly clashed with the expected
chronology of forty to fifty thousand years
that Alan Thorne, the chief
archaeologist, expected.
Thorne claimed
contamination but was it?
More likely, the fossilized samples as
distinct from the relatively pristine blood,
had been incorrectly
assumed to be accurate.
This is so often the case.
Contamination is often cited
when great discrepancies occur between
expected dates and incongruent results.

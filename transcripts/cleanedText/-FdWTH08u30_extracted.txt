What lies at the
center of our galaxy?
For many decades, astrophysicists have
told us that at the core of the Milky Way
and 98% of all galaxies is
a supermassive black hole,
a hypothetical "region of space-time" whose
gravitational effects are so colossal
that nothing, not even
light can escape.
Scientists believe that supermassive
black holes explain the stupendous
energies and mass measured
at galactic cores
and many fantastic
electromagnetic phenomena
including powerful galactic
jets and X-ray emissions
are attributed to black
holes' influences.
In fact, for many years scientific
and educational literature
have presented the existence of black
holes as a matter of settled science
and science media routinely
report truly amazing claims
about black holes
with no skepticism.
Of course, a recent example in
2016, was the media firestorm
resulting from the pronounced
detection of gravitational waves
which was supposedly produced by two
colliding black holes a billion years ago.
Subsequent, such claims have been met
with an equal absence of media scrutiny.
However, we note that a recent
scientific paper entitled
"On the Signal Processing
Operations in LIGO signals"
should raise serious questions about the
validity of the gravitational waves claims.
The abstract of the paper authored
by UC Berkeley's Akhila Raman
states that the first five reported
gravitational waves events are,
"...very weak signals whose amplitude
does not rise significantly
during the gravitational
waves event,
and they are indistinguishable from
non-stationary detector noise."
A link to the article may be found in
the description box of this video.
Unfortunately, this paper has not received
a fraction of the media attention
that the claimed gravitational
waves discoveries have garnered.
Paradoxically, these same media
also routinely report discoveries
that would challenge the very
existence of black holes,
if astronomers and astrophysicists were
willing to entertain such a possibility.
But rather than forcing any
reassessment of foundational theory,
the discoveries are simply presented as
exciting puzzles for working scientists.
A good example is found in a recent paper on
scientists' observation of star formation
that is occurring impossibly close to the
Milky Way's hypothetical black hole.
A phys.org report introduces
the conundrum as follows,
"At the center of our galaxy, in the immediate
vicinity of its supermassive black hole,
is a region wracked by
powerful tidal forces
and bathed in intense ultraviolet
light and X-ray radiation.
These harsh conditions, astronomers
surmise, do not favor star formation,
especially low-mass
stars like our Sun.
Surprisingly, new observations...
suggest otherwise."
Scientists using the ALMA telescope discovered
evidence of a total of 11 low-mass stars
forming within just three light years
to the hypothetical black hole.
As the phys.org report notes,
"At this distance, tidal forces driven
by the supermassive black hole should be
energetic enough to rip apart clouds of
dust and gas before they can form stars."
The lead author of
the new paper says,
"Despite all odds, we see the best evidence
yet that low-mass stars are forming
startlingly close to the supermassive black
hole at the center of the Milky Way.
This is a genuinely surprising result and
one that demonstrates just how robust
star formation can be, even in
the most unlikely of places."
But of course, this is not the first time
that our galaxy's hypothetical black hole
has mystified astronomers
with its behavior.
For several years, scientists
around the world eagerly awaited
the approach of the gas cloud
G2 to the supposed black hole.
The standard expectation was that
the cloud would undoubtedly be,
"devoured" as it entered
the black hole's domain.
Apparently, the black hole
was not feeling hungry
as the gas cloud was left intact to the
amazement of astronomers around the world.
Hopelessly problematic
black hole behavior
has been observed at all
scales throughout the cosmos.
In 2012, we reported on scientists'
observations of two bright radio spots
in the globular cluster M22, which they
interpret as two small black holes.
But Standard Theory dictates that
only one black hole at most,
can exist in the cluster
of tightly packed stars.
The National Radio Astronomy
Observatory reported of the findings,
"Simulations have indicated
that these black holes
would fall toward the
center of the cluster,
then begin a violent gravitational
dance with each other,
in which all of them or
perhaps all but a single one
would be thrown completely
out of the cluster."
The author of a paper
on the findings stated,
"We didn't find what we were looking for,
but instead found something very surprising
-- two smaller black holes.
That's surprising
because most theorists said there should
be at most one black hole in the cluster."
At a much vaster scale at the farthest
reaches of the observable universe,
we see in ever greater detail,
stupendous electromagnetic phenomena
that are not predicted nor
explained by black hole theory.
As we've reported
several times, in 2016
a Royal Astronomical Society press
release reported the discovery that,
"...supermassive black holes in a
region of the distant universe
are all spinning out radio
jets in the same direction..."
A lead investigator, professor
Romeel Dave said of the findings,
"This is not obviously expected based on
our current understanding of cosmology.
It's a bizarre finding."
As noted by Professor
Andrew Russ Taylor,
"...these black holes don't know about
each other, or have any way of exchanging
information or influencing each other
directly over such vast scales..."
In the Electric Universe,
such cosmic alignments,
completely unexpected by standard
cosmology, are both predicted and required
if the dominant organizational
force is electromagnetism.
The Electric Universe theory proposes
that space across cosmic distances
has a substructure of
twisted-pair current filaments
with stars and galaxies forming
along them like pearls on a string,
and having their spin axes
aligned along their filaments.
Space discovery continues
to confirm this prediction
including the Herschel Space
Observatory's imaging
of vast networks of
star-forming filaments.
In fact, the phenomenon of
spectacular cosmic jets,
sometimes hundreds of thousands
of light years long,
dramatically reveals the tunnel
vision of gravito-centric cosmology.
Radio astronomers who have measured the
electric current in an extra galactic jet,
have proposed that the black hole
creates a powerful magnetic field
which then produces the
jet's electric current.
But mysterious magnetism will never explain
the tremendous electromagnetic emissions
that are now routinely detected
throughout the cosmos.
As we've outlined in dozens of episodes,
the concepts of Plasma Cosmology
and the Electric Universe offer very
different predictions and explanations
for the phenomena astronomers
attribute to black holes.
At the center of galaxies
is not a black hole
but an ultra-high density energy
storage phenomenon called a plasmoid,
a kind of load in the
galactic electrical circuit.
In a galactic circuit, electrical power
flows inward along the spiral arms
lighting the stars as it goes and is
concentrated and stored in the central plasmoid.
When the plasmoid reaches
a threshold density
it discharges, usually along
the galaxy's spin axis.
The Electric Universe proposes this is in fact
the source of the stupendous cosmic jets.
Indeed, a recent scientific paper
reveals that nature is confounding
all of cosmologists' predictions about
black holes' magnetic properties.
A phys.org report on
the finding states,
"Black holes are famous
for their muscle:
an intense gravitational pull
known to gobble up entire stars
and launch streams of matter into
space at almost the speed of light.
It turns out the reality may
not live up to the hype...
University of Florida scientists have discovered
these tears in the fabric of the universe
have significantly weaker magnetic
fields than previously thought."
The unsolved mystery that
the report acknowledges is,
"...how 'jets' of particles traveling
at nearly the speed of light
shoot out of black
holes' magnetic field."
The study co-author states,
"The question is,
how do you do that?
Our surprisingly low measurements will force
new constraints on theoretical models
that previously focused
on strong magnetic fields
accelerating and
directing the jet flows.
We weren't expecting this, so it changes
much of what we thought we knew."
As noted in a public comment by
Thunderbolts colleague Chris Reeve,
"The picture which is emerging is of
the black hole as non-falsifiable.
It really does not seem to matter
how many null results accumulate;
since theorists need
them to be there,
they will continue to insist
that they ARE there."
In fact, we have noted a fundamental
challenge to the very question
of whether Einstein's mathematics
predict black holes.
As explained by
physicist Wal Thornhill
in his Space News interview
on gravitational waves,
"It's a self-serving myth that Einstein's
mathematics predicts black holes.
The originators of black hole
theory in 1965, including Thorne,
chose not to mention that Einstein's
October 1939 paper which they refer to,
concludes with,
"The 'Schwarzschild singularity'",
the term black hole had
not been introduced then,
"does not appear for the reason that
matter cannot be concentrated arbitrarily
and this is due to the
fact that otherwise
the constituting particles would
reach the velocity of light."
Einstein showed mathematically that
black holes cannot form gravitationally
for the same reason that
stars and planets cannot.
Because the infalling matter begins
to circle the center of mass
until the centrifugal force
balances the gravitational force.
The observational evidence now
shows that stars and planets
are formed by the powerful
electromagnetic force
produced in electromagnetic pinches
along cosmic lightning filaments
in molecular clouds.
Gravitational collapse theory is now
discredited by direct observation.

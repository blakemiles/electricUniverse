The connection of the mind to the body
is an arena of constantly growing
scientific investigation.
To an unprecedented degree,
mainstream medicine
today acknowledges that
the mind has a
profound effect on one's
physical well-being.
The mind affects matter,
whether it's the so-called placebo
effect where the mere belief that a
person has taken a particular drug
causes a physical benefit, to the
increasingly evident impact of emotional
stress on physical organisms and
individual cells.
However, as mainstream
science acknowledges, the very nature
and source of the mind
itself remains a mystery.
A remarkable scientist who has explored
the mind-body connection is Dawson
Church, the author of dozens of
scientific papers as well as the recent
book 'Mind to Matter'
which suggests vast untapped abilities
of the mind to affect healing.
In part one of this two-part
interview, we asked
Dawson to begin with
an introduction to
his earlier book entitled
'The Genie in Your Genes'
which presents voluminous
scientific evidence that thoughts and
intentions can trigger one's genes with
potentially great consequence
to one's health.
Well, I became interested in
energy healing at an early age and when
I was 15 I joined a spiritual community
and began to learn tools like meditation,
like energy medicine and in that
community I saw some really remarkable
rapid healings occur.
But I always thought about energy
medicine, energy healing,
as being a very fringe endeavor.
And so, in the 1990s, 1980s it was
regarded as being part of complementary
and alternative medicine or CAM, C.A.M.
and there was no real thought that CAM
could ever become part
of the medical mainstream.
We knew the medical
mainstream involved things like drugs
and surgery, interventions by skilled
medical professionals and there was no
real place for CAM in
conventional medicine.
But what we had happen in
the late 1990s is, scientists turned
their attention to using some other
tools developed for diagnosis to looking
at altered states of consciousness.
And so we, for example, for the
first time found
at altered states of consciousness.
And so we, for example, for the
first time found
people meditating, getting put inside
MRIs or having EEGs attached to their heads
and actually I was actually reading
things like brain waves
that were the result of consciousness and awareness,
consciousness should
send in energy.
And what we found as we used
these modern methods, was that a
lot was happening that enhanced
the bodies of those kinds of people.
So at a certain point, I moved from
psychological research looking at
anxiety, depression, PTSD,
to biological research.
And around 2008, 2009, I began to
look deep into what was happening inside
the body when people shift their state.
And so I wrote this book The Genie in
Your Genes about the epigenetics of
personal change, how when you change your
consciousness, you're literally shifting
gene expression inside your cells and
this is easy to prove.
When I wrote the book, there was
no direct proof of this but
there was lots of indirect proof of this
because for example when you get scared
or startled or frightened your
adrenaline level rises and there is a gene
that codes for adrenaline, a gene that
codes for cortisol, but when you then go
and tell your best friend or your wife
or your husband about being scared or
startled or frightened, say you had a
bad experience at work and you had a
high level of cortisol, high level of
adrenaline in response to a threat at work.
Now you're telling your spouse
about this after you get back from
work, and your adrenaline
is now rising again.
So there's no direct threat to you
at this point, only a shifted awareness,
only emotion, only a sense of changing
your consciousness, changing your energy
to relive that threat, but your body is
now taking that imaginary situation as
though it was real
threat and producing
those same stress hormones
like cortisol and adrenaline.
So I did the first large-scale
randomized controlled trials
actually a triple blind
randomized controlled trial published
in the oldest medical journal in the U.S.
and it showed that when you use an
acupressure based technique, EFT, that in
one hour you're literally
bringing the levels of those stress
hormones down far more than talk therapy
or simply resting.
And so that was really a
landmark study showing that
indirectly I was showing that we're
changing the gene expression because we're
changing the byproducts of gene
expression like cortisol and adrenaline.
I then went to study a
step deeper than that and actually
looked at gene expression and with the
conclusion of the human genome project,
we now have tools that allow us to much
less expensively sequence genetic
sequences and actually see what's
happening, which genes are being turned and which
genes are being turned off.
So I worked with a group of
veterans, people mostly
Vietnam veterans, some Iraq veterans,
Afghanistan veterans, and we looked at
their levels of gene expression before
and after ten sessions of this
acupressure based technique EFT.
And we found that their
levels of anxiety dropped,
depression dropped hugely, their
levels of PTSD, their levels of
symptoms like flashbacks and nightmares,
intrusive thoughts and so on,
all of these things
dropped dramatically, over
50% over those 10 sessions.
We hit pay dirt, we found
that their genes actually were
shifting dramatically, several of their
genes to do with stress, to do with
inflammation, to do with the byproducts
of the metabolic signatures of stress
were being shifted by this psychological
intervention, so now as you change your
mind, as you change your awareness, as you
change your emotional response, as you
use an effective therapy like EFT to
get rid of those emotions so you're
telling the story of the terrible
experiences in Afghanistan or Iraq or
civilian ones like a car crash or a
divorce, so now you're telling all those
same stories to people but they're no
longer laden with emotion and so now
your body is no longer getting
that epigenetic signal to make
those stress hormones.
So those veterans then,
after those 10 sessions were
telling those stories, remembering those
events and they were no longer
triggering those stress genes and so
that has led to a several other
studies like that.
The big take-home message of
this was that,
as you shift your awareness, as you lower
your stress level, you're literally
turning genes on and off in your body.
And in the gene, in your genes, I map that
whole process from start to finish, how
both actual threats cause changes in
gene expression and imaginary
experiences like meditation.
Meditate for a while and
you shift your gene expression.
Do EFT, you shift gene
expression, do Yoga, do Qigong, take a walk
in nature, any of these things are
literally turning genes on and off and
as we've used these elaborate tools like
MRIs and EEGs to look at how much, we're
finding that the answer is, a huge amount,
that we're not seeing trivial or minor
shifts in gene expression, we're not seeing
trivial or minor shifts
in brainwave activity.
We're seeing major shifts,
radical shifts in the way the brain
processes information based purely on
these energy and consciousness techniques.
So, that work in the 'Gene in
your Genes' made an argument really early
in 2004, but the newer editions now have
many studies showing directly that our
awareness, our consciousness, our energy
level, our way of seeing the world, our
worldview, our mental
picture of reality,
all of these things are
turning genes on and off.
I will leave you with one of the final
studies, an amazing study, and it shows
the cumulative effect of this which
you see in longevity.
So people make a lot of little choices
in their lives; should I drink
tea or coffee this morning, should I
get up on the left or the right side of
the bed, and you know, those choices are
minor but when those choices are about
emotion, when those choices are about
spirituality, when those choices are
about stress,
they may seem minor.
Just that five minutes you spent
obsessing about the bad thing, some of
the things last week might seem like a
trivial thing, but cumulatively over a
year and then five and ten and twenty
years, they make an enormous difference
to your gene expression which shows up
in the form of longevity and so this one
really stunning study I talked
about, shows that
optimists, people who think positively,
people who have a positive worldview, people
who see others in a positive light,
optimists live on average eight years
longer than pessimists, that's the
cumulative effect of
all that negative thinking.
Think negatively for a moment,
you don't see any big change, think
negatively for a lifetime and you get
eight years less on it, so these are
the profound shifts that these
kinds of emotional states are producing
epigenetically in ourselves.
The scientific evidence that thoughts and
emotions affect one's genes carries
another extraordinary ramification that
genetic changes caused by emotional
trauma might be passed on
to future generations.
That study, showing that
emotional trauma is intergenerational
is stunning, because we always thought
that if a bad thing happened to me well,
it was going to affect me, it might produce
PTSD, it might produce trauma in me, but
how could that really be passed along to
my kids or my grandkids because they're
 going to have a fresh set
of genes, going to be
born with these genes that
are unaffected by that.
But in the study of Holocaust
survivors, this is the first big study
done in the late 1990s, they found that
the gene expression patterns of the
children of Holocaust survivors looked
similar to those, mirrored those of actual
Holocaust survivors.
We've now shown in animal studies
with rats and mice that
those kinds of epigenetic tags we passed
along for seven generations so we're now
realizing that stress and trauma is not
something that affects just one
generation of people, that affects people
in a limited way locally.
We're realizing that it affects
them over time and they
then literally pass these epigenetic
molecular markers onto their children
and their grandchildren.
A parallel field of investigation
to the mind-body
connection is the study
of consciousness itself.
We asked Dawson for his thoughts
on the perspective that consciousness
is not generated by nor
confined to the brain.
The old view, the materialist
worldview was
that mind is what's called an
epiphenomenon of complex brains.
And the idea is that originally there were
single-cell organisms, then multi-celled
organisms, then complex organisms as
they got more and more complicated,
they got bigger and bigger brains, more
complex brains and eventually went
throughout this phenomenon called mind.
That's a result of brain activity.
But there's no actual proof for that point
of view and in my book Mind to Matter,
I quote many, many neuroscientists, many
many authorities who say, point this out,
who say that there's really no proof,
no empirical proof that mind is the
epiphenomenon of a complex brain.
And what the brain seems to do more accurately is,
it seems to be receiving and transducing
information and then manifesting it on
a physical level so the brain is much
more like a receiver of information than
it is like a producer of information.
Just the way someone is listening to
this podcast right now and they're
listening to it on a device so the words
I'm speaking and the words you're
speaking and this interaction isn't
happening inside of their smartphone and
that's the conceit of the
materialist worldview, we think that
because there's this broadcast coming
out of the smartphone well, then the
smartphone has to be the
source of a broadcast.
We don't realize that the
broadcast was coming from a distant
location and so there are lots of
examples, there's lots of science now
behind distant mental effects and the
distant phenomenon of consciousness.
And so, what the research does show is that
there's far more evidence for the idea
of consciousness being something that
permeates the universe, there's something
which I talk about in the very
beginning of Mind to Matter, I talk
about non-local mind and our local minds
are anchored in our local brains.
So if for example I, talk about me, Dawson, I'm
talking about an individual and an
entity that's anchored in a local sense
of self which I associate with my body
and my circumstances
so that's the local me.
But there's far more to me
than the local me.
There's far more me than the
local sense of self and so when
meditators for example enter a deep meditation,
a part of the brain called the parietal
lobe which locates your body in space,
that part of the brain shuts down, the
prefrontal cortex that that constructs
the self, shuts down, there's a massive
drop in the consumption of
oxygen and nutrients by those two parts
of the brain and so people literally
begin to have a non-local sense of self.
They describe a feeling of oneness, they
feel a sense of peace, they feel a sense
of connection with the rest of the universe.
In these states of
consciousness, all kinds of non-local
phenomena occur so people who are in
this non-local space report experiences
of precognition, knowing the future
what's happening in the future before it
happens and there's really, really good
evidence for precognition, telepathy.
The EEG is one of the most pervasive
instruments used by modern science, the
electroencephalograph, and there are
thousands of things now that plot our
brain waves using EEG.
But when I was writing
Mind to Matter, I became
interested in the guy who invented the
EEG, whose name is Hans Berger and he was
a German doctor in the late 1800s, early
nineteen hundreds and he had, he got his
big insight about inventing a device to
measure brain waves when he had an
experience of non-local reality.
He was actually a German military
officer and one day he was on his horse
and he was part of a horse team
towing a huge big field gun in the late
1800s and his horse reared up and threw
him right in the path of this rolling
gun and just as a gun was about to crush
him, his friends managed to stop the
gun and he wasn't crushed.
That night he got a telegram of
his father saying, I've
been concerned about you,
how are you?
And he never got a telegram
from his father before.
It turned that his sister
that day, at the very moment he is, he was
about to be crushed by the gun, she had this
premonition of a terrible thing about to
happen to him and
told the father to send the telegram.
So there are always examples of people, even
in science, Einstein said that all great
scientific discoveries come from these
states in which you're letting go
of the local self and connecting
with a non-local self.
That's where inspiration
comes from, that's what
creativity comes from
and so the brain
is the anchor of that
non-local mind in
local experience and
that's really where
the evidence is pointing.
When I began to write my book
Mind to Matter, I thought I
would find a chain of evidence linking
our thoughts to manifestation in things
but I didn't think I'd find a complete
chain, I think, I thought I would find
that science would reveal a number
of links in that chain and there'd be
some big gaps in the chain as well.
And I was amazed when I got to the end of the
book, that there are no missing links to the chain.
They're all there, they're all
there scientifically and so that was one
big surprise to me in
writing Mind to Matter.
The other was the scale and the
size of some of these phenomena
and in the first chapter I tell the story of
astrophysicist turned TV reporter called
Graham Phillips and he has a show in
Australia called Catalyst and he'd heard
about meditation and the meditational
health benefits so he thought well, I
should give it a try.
He wasn't a believer, he was
a bit of a skeptic but
he went into Monash University, a very
distinguished university in Australia
and he had a complete workup of his
physical function and his brain.
So they measured the volume of every single
point of his brain and also tested his
neurological function.
He then began to practice
mindfulness and up in just two
weeks he found that his whole way of
reacting to stress had changed.
He could feel and see the
difference in his behavior.
When he went back to the University after
eight weeks, now again this is only two
months of practicing meditation and
mindfulness, they did this complete
battery of tests on him again and they
found that things like his reaction
speed, his memory and learning capacity
had increased exponentially and a part
of the brain that regulates emotions and
its job is to regulate emotion across
different brain regions, it's called the
Dentate gyrus, it's right in the very
center of the brain, the center of the hippocampus,
the memory learning center of the brain.
The Dentate gyrus spreads
out through it, it actually helps
different parts of the brain regions
coordinate their regulation of emotion.
So in eight weeks, the volume
of neural tissue
in Graham Phillips's brain in the
Dentate gyrus had increased by 22.8%.
Now, that's an enormous difference, that's
more than a fifth growth in that one
brain region in less than two months so
just a remarkable shift and not just
in brain software activity but
in brain hardware as well.
And so, what I'm arguing
in Mind to Matter, what I'm
showing in these studies,
they reveal that our brains
are changing substantially, remarkably,
and quickly in response to consciousness,
when our awareness changes, when we
destress ourselves, when we tap, when we
meditate, when we do all these things
that help us feel better,
those subjective feelings of
well-being translate into objective
changes in measures like the volume of
neural tissue in different
parts of the brain.
So if you've been for
example a kind of a
person who's been angry and stressed and
upset and resentful for a long time,
you've been growing those neural
circuits for a long time and they
get worse and worse and worse.
PTSD, people with PTSD they get worse
over time generally speaking, but if you
fill your mind and heart with love, with
compassion, with kindness, you can make
that choice over and over and over again
as Graham Phillips did, you are then
building up those circuits that have to
do with all of those phenomena and you
are a resilient human being, you have
this core of resilience that can really
help you when times are tough or
when you have life setbacks.
So I was intrigued by his case history of how
we're literally turning the software of
consciousness, of mind, into
the hardware of brain.

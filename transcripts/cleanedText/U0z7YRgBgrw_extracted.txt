Welcome to Space News from
the Electric Universe,

In recent years, an incredible development
has transpired in the space sciences.
Mainstream astronomical literature
now rather routinely acknowledges
the existence of electric
currents in space.
But the question is, how significant
a role do these electric currents play
in the dynamics of the universe?
In our most recent Space News,
we reported on the discovery of a
radio-emitting plasma filament
which connects two
galaxy clusters.
If electric currents connect celestial
objects at such vast cosmic distances,
as plasma cosmologists have
proposed for decades,
then how might we also detect electric
currrents in our own celestial neighborhood?
Today, physicist Eugene
Bagashov and several colleagues
are attempting to
answer this question
through a detailed analysis of the
conditions near our solar system.
In part 3 of this four-
part presentation,
Eugene continues his discussion
on the evidence for plasma currents
connecting our solar system with
the nearby interstellar environment.
Let's examine some other evidence that
the local interstellar chimney structure,
where our solar system is situated,
represents a large scale plasma filament.
One of the interesting pieces of evidence is
the existence of the so-called Gould Belt,
the belt of bright stars, molecular
clouds and star-forming regions
encircling the Sun at an average
distance of about 1,000 light years
and having a thickness of
about 2,000 light-years.
Perhaps the most fascinating
feature of that belt,
if we look at it in
galactic coordinates,
is that it doesn't quite coincide
with the galactic equator,
that is the galactic disk,
but is tilted with respect to it to
an angle of 18 degrees or about so.
In galactic coordinates, it makes
it look like a sine wave
with an amplitude of 18 degrees.
This structure seems to be the
largest of such sort in our vicinity,
so it's not quite clear how it came
to be and why is it tilted that way.
But, as we've previously seen,
the local chimney is also not strictly
perpendicular to the galactic plane
but slightly tilted.
And if we compare the relative positions
of the Gould Belt and the local chimney,
it would become clear that the Belt,
sort of, wraps around the chimney
and is most likely related to it, rather than
the larger structure of the galaxy itself.
Moreover, the whole structure of the
Chimney, plus the Gould Belt around it
would immediately start to resemble
the famous Squatterman Figure,
a typical shape produced
by the plasma discharge.
We see a current
column in the center
that widens at the bigger distances
up and down from the center
and we see the torus around it
represented by the Gould Belt.
Take another look at this picture
and you'll see what I mean.
The characteristic circles are there
on both sides of the chimney.
In my opinion, it is highly unlikely
that such a configuration
was produced by some chaotic
gravitational interactions.
Moreover, another prominent structure
of the so-called Lockman Hole
coincides with the axis
of the local chimney.
Lockman Hole is defined as a region of a
much lower density of neutral hydrogen,
so it looks much more transparent in
extreme ultraviolet and soft X-ray range
and it doesn't glow as much
itself in the infrared.
But it might just be the case that the very fact
that there's not much neutral material there,
is only the consequence
of a higher ionization.
There's a stronger current shooting
near the center of the local chimney
so we don't see many
neutral atoms along its way.
One might also look at the parameter
called the Interstellar Extinction.
and has nothing to do with mass
die-offs of species or something.
It means the extinction of light
that is its absorption or scattering
by the interestellar dust or atoms.
So if we look at both galactic
hemispheres, north and south
and measure this
parameter across the sky,
we'd see that right near the
galactic north and south,
perpendicular to the galactic plane,
there are quite prominent clearings
represented by the black
plumes on this picture.
The northern one, which you can see on
the left, is exactly a Lockman Hole.
It's evident that both of them more or
less coincide with galactic north and south
but not quite, they are slightly
tilted, just like the chimney axis is.
So they represent exactly that, the openings
of the tube-like local chimney structure
into the space below and
above the galactic disk.
The existence of these clearings has been
quite an asset for extragalactic astronomy
as they represent the more or less transparent
windows into the outer universe.
Perhaps another piece of
evidence for plasma processes
might be various anomalous readings
of chemical compositions of stars,
both in our vicinity and
in the farther cosmos.
Again, Pleiades cluster
may be a great example,
but as some of the
papers indicate,
the problem seems to persist
for stellar clusters in general.
The spectral characteristics
of even the most typical stars
somehow often violate
the expectations,
and perhaps it may all be
tied to their positions
with respect to the surrounding
filamentary structures.
Some works have actually directly stated
that the anomalous stellar chemistry
might be linked to the larger scale magnetic
fields in the corresponding regions.
One of the mechanisms of production
of these chemical anomalies,
as Don Scott himself indicates
in one of his papers,
might be in the so-called
Marklund Convection,
the sorting of the chemical elements
in a Birkeland current column,
according to their
ionization potential.
In fact, that might be one of the
reasons why there's less hydrogen
in the center of the
local chimney column,
just because, according to
Marklund, Alfven and Scott,
hydrogen would prefer to gather at
the outermost shells of the chimney,
sorted out by the
convection in plasma.
That way or another, this mechanism
definitely deserves a lot of attention
with regards to
stellar chemistry,
and plasma filaments might just be the right
tool that the astrophysics was missing so far
to explain many of these
observed peculiarities.
Another evidence for the actual existence
of the plasma currents in the local chimney
might be represented by the
scattering of the radio waves.
It has been previously
shown that this process,
which depends on the properties
of interstellar medium,
does not occur homogenously in
the area of the local chimney.
Which would mean that there are areas
of higher and lower plasma density
and perhaps, current strength.
Speaking of current strength, one of
the hypotheses in the Electric Universe
is the possible relation of the
brightness and temperature of the stars
to the current density of the plasma
filaments that interact with them.
In that regard, I wish to
bring up an interesting paper
that discusses the changes in measured
temperature of the star Arcturus,
the brightest star in the
northern celestial hemisphere,
over the span of
several decades.
The graph given in this
paper is quite astonishing.
It almost seems like the temperature
of the star was steadily rising
over a very short time span,
at least in astrophysical terms.
I haven't seen any explanations for that
according to the current astrophysical models,
but in the framework that
we are dealing with here,
perhaps we might assume that Arcturus
was just pretty quickly moving
into the area with a
higher current density,
and therefore its
brightness increased.
It's not very hard to believe in
as, although it's pretty close to
us, only some 37 light years or so,
its velocity relative to the Sun
is very high, some 122 km/second.
That's about half of our own
speed around the galactic center.
Most of the other
objects in our vicinity
typically have speeds of maybe
tens of km/s, relative to us.
That is not the only
example of such sort.
Perhaps another one might be represented
by another very bright star,
in this case the brightest
star in the whole sky, Sirius.
It has been a mystery for quite a long
time, why the ancient civilizations,
including Egyptians, Greeks and
Romans, called Sirius a red star.
It is clearly bright
blue right now,
and couldn't possibly have been
red, even 2,000 year ago
according to the
current stellar models.
But perhaps the change in color of
Sirius was caused by the same reason
as brightening of Arcturus--the shift with
respect to the surrounding plasma streams.
We might see that on the scales
of the local interstellar cloud,
Sirius seems to currently occupy a
somewhat clearer filamentary area.
That may indicate a stronger
current in the surroundings
and therefore higher
temperature of the star,
whereas in ancient times
it might have been connected to the
local current filaments more poorly
and demonstrate a
somewhat dimmer red color.
Another, perhaps more general consideration
that we might take into account,
concerns the frequency shifts of electromagnetic
waves that travel within space plasmas.
There has been some debate about
the possible intrinsic redshifts
of astrophysical objects as
promoted by Halton Arp, etc,
but there is a possibility that
even the regular wave of light
may change its frequency when
it propagates through plasma.
One of the known examples of that effect
is the frequency blueshift of laser beams.
It is known that under
certain conditions,
when the electromagnetic wave
encounters an area of strong ionization,
its frequency might rise
quite significantly.
Then there is a hypothesis that
an inverse process, a redshift,
might also occur in
certain conditions,
say if the plasma is very hot
but has a very low density.
So it could be seen that a lot of effects
that might usually be attributed to,
for example,
Doppler frequency shift,
might theoretically be related to the
distribution of various cosmic plasma structures
that the light that we observe
was travelling through.
Jim Weninger proposed an idea that, for
example, the so called Flyby Anomalies
might be explained through that.
A Flyby Anomaly is an unexpected
instantaneous change in speed of a spacecraft
that performs a gravitational
maneuver near Earth or other planet,
at least one other
example would be Jupiter.
So, since the velocity of a spacecraft
is measured through Doppler effect,
it is quite possible that some similar
plasma processes in the vicinity of Earth
cause this frequency change,
and not the actual change in velocity.
If all that is correct, this is yet another
indication that we need to pay more attention
to the distrinbution of plasmas in
the neighborhood of the solar system,
the local interstellar
cloud and the local chimney.

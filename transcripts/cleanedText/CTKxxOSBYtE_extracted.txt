Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought

In part 1 of this presentation,
Electric Geology, investigator Robert
Hawthorne explored the stupendous
geological feature in the American
Southwest known as Upheaval Dome. As
Robert explained, while standard geology
favors the interpretation that Upheaval
Dome was created by a kinetic impact, the
hypothesis that the feature was created
by interplanetary lightning finds great
support in the geological evidence. This
includes recent experimental research
which shows that chemical changes in
rock, normally attributed to impact, such
as “shocked quartz” are also
produced by powerful lightning. Robert
introduced an unusual rock associated
with the Upheaval Dome site, called the
Obsession Stone, whose discoverers were
able to submit the rock for professional
chemical analysis. In this conclusion,
Robert explains why such analysis only
strengthens the electric discharge
hypothesis. I would like to talk about
analcime now and this is a picture of
analcime from Wikipedia and you can see
that it kind of resembles a golf ball-
shaped, white, milky white kind of spheres
with trapezohedronal faces on them,
according to their crystal structure.
However, when we got to show you the
picture of the Obsession Stone, you'll
see that it's quite different. But analcime
is classified as a zeolite. That means,
”zeo” meaning to boil and “lighting” or “lite”
mean rock, and the Cassidy and Zolensky
letters mentioned previously, suggest a
secondary processing of the mineral
where all the strata layers in the stone
were processed in this manner. That was
something that I wanted to try and find
out. Because like I said, we have multiple
rocks at different colors and luster,
and then in these graphs here, I just
show that, these are the X-ray
diffraction of the purple sample, the
rock that was in the previous slide.
This is the result of that sample.
If you were to look at the bottom X-axis
line, that is your angle, your two-
theta angle and that's what they measure
and if you can imagine, like a substrate
or just like basically any flat
surface, and you aim an X-ray at it, the
beam should actually reflect
off like an angle on - angle off- kind of
principle. But if you were to imagine the
ray actually penetrating the substrate
and continuing on through in a
straight line, and reference that to the
actual reflected angle, that is actually
your two-theta angle. And that's what
they actually measure in X-ray
diffraction. And the intensity of
that beam that's absorbed, that's how
they understand your charts here. So,
on the results chart, you have
listed in numerical order, from first to
last, all the peaks that are listed.
And then you have in the
column below that, you have your
intensities that are ranked which
one is the tallest, all the way down to
the lowest. And from there they actually
do their calculations and that's what
they came up with, is the analcime
calcite. I though wanted to go a little
bit further and try to prove that the
multiple layers had this electrical
discharge machining performed on
multiple layers, simply because of the
different colors of the rocks that we
have. So, I was given the opportunity,
while I was attending the Salt Lake
Community College enrolled in their
electronics engineering program, one of
my classes offered a microscopy lab. So, I
was given the opportunity to take these
samples, and again, I took two samples,
one purple and one brown and put it
under the scanning electron microscope.
And here are the results. This first one
is from the brown sample and I found
this one rather peculiar because it had
like this brush stroke, or a paint
swath that's made almost entirely of
molybdenum. And I to this day, I have not
been able to research if they have any
kind of traces of molybdenum in that
area of southern Utah. That's kind of
when people always asked me about
if a possible transmutation has occurred.
I'd like to say that, according to
the NASA paper, that they can't really
tell what the original mineralogy was.
But did an actual transmutation occur?
I really can't say, because I don't have
that kind of technology to perform
such a test. But I could say that
molybdenum in these traces and in
the next couple slides you're going to
see, trace amounts of elements that are
in there, aren't really dominant in the
area of southern Utah. And this graph is
just the Energy Dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy, or EDS. And this is the
chart, just similar to the X-ray
diffraction, but this uses the spectral
line of the element itself, and that's
what it reads. So, your bottom X-axis
here is your energy readout from
the spectral line, and each number is
a signal to the actual element that
it belongs to. So, you can see here
the results that you got. You have
your sodium, aluminum, silicon are
rather dominant, and your oxygen.
But then you also have your calcium and
your carbon and your oxygen which is
your calcite. It's just that one part of
molybdenum that’s just sitting there,
which I wanted to use this for. In this
picture is just the distribution of all
these elements and their concentrations
in our area. Now move on to the purple
sample that I used. Actually, I did take a
lot of samples, but like you can see
in these images, there's just a lot
of gray dots and stuff. It's when you
come across something white and
reflective, that you kind of want to focus
on because it's something interesting.
So, as in here, you can see that this is a
purple sample and there's a lot more
elements in this sample than in the
previous one, but it still has the
dominant analcime features with calcite.
However, this also has some iron,
some potassium, looks like ruthenium and
tantalum in it. And again, here's your EDS
chart. Distribution of the elements,
there is quite a lot of them in this
one. That's one of the reasons why I use
this. Oh, I also took a third image. This
one had some tantalum and some indium
in it as well. This was the other side of
the purple, because the purple sample had
a fused outer crust, from I guess being
scorched. And of the interior I took
another sample as well, and this is
the interior. Now on the outer fused
crust, there was no indium at all in all
the places that I looked.
But on the interior, there is
copious amounts of it, of indium inside.
That's why I found it interesting and
put it into this report. Again, your
EDS chart for the sample, and the
distribution of the elements. Tantalum
looks like it's just been peppered on. It
doesn't look like it's been agglomerated
to any other atoms in there. Just dot
after dot; there's no really
clustering in it at all. Almost with the
indium, but it does look like it's a bit
concentrated on the left-hand side of
the image. So, in conclusion this
presentation, I hope, that I made the
argument that electrical discharge can
form craters and eject material. I hope it
has provided evidence that the
electrical discharges can generate the
temperatures and pressures required to
shock quartz crystals, and shown you
that fulgurites and a sample from
the mineral analcime from Upheaval
Dome is presented evidence of
electrical discharge do to its
properties. And I feel that this
presentation has presented the argument
which suggests another mechanism for
planetary crater formation. Now I'd like
to take this time to thank the many
people that have helped me with this
project. And I would first like to thank
again the Thunderbolts staff,
Susan Schirott, for giving me this
opportunity, especially for being at the
Electric Universe conference in 2017.
I'd also like to thank the International
Multi Conference for Complexity,
Informatics and Cybernetics and their
staff. I would also like to thank Bruce
Leybourne and Andy Hall for their
helping me understand electrical
discharge theory and how it applies to
geological formations. And I'd also like
to thank, last but not least, the Salt
Lake's Community College's many
departments and staff. First, Salt Lake's
microscopy lab coordinator, Glen Johnson
and my instructor, Wesley Sanders for
allowing me to use their labs for this
presentation. I would also like to thank
Jason Roberts in the writing department
for helping me with the editing of this
paper and lastly I'd like to thank the
Salt Lake print shop for recovering the
faded X-ray diffraction papers, because
by no means was that an easy task.
Thank you.

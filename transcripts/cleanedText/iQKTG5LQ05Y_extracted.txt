First off, I think I'd better apologize that I'm
going to talk more about gravity than Electric
Universe, but I think you can see a few connections
as we go along. I didn't know how to organize this.
Clearly I'm going to present it in a way
that it wasn't derived, and what I'm
trying to do here is simply to show some
agreement with facts and ask questions.
What does theory say, what does the evidence
say? And what's next, I'm going to talk
a little bit about the Electric Universe,
if I can get through it. I've got too
many slides, I'll admit. Okay, we'll go
ahead. First of all, I think there's some
guiding principles we need to follow. A reliable
experiment trumps any theoretical claim, and
rational explanation trumps any magical
mechanism. There's quite a bit of magic
in special relativity and that's partly
why I say that one. I like this verse
from Proverbs by Solomon. He was probably
the leading scientist of his day and I think it's
insightful. Here's a few nice quotes that
I just couldn't help from putting in.
The tendency of a group of human beings
to quickly come to believe something
that its individual members will later
see is obviously false, is truly amazing.
It is controversy that keeps science alive and keeps
it moving. And, science is the organized skepticism
in the reliability of expert opinion. I tend
to agree strongly with those statements.
Just a little background. I've written a bunch of papers;
I figured I'd put them here, so if you have questions you
can probably find them. The last one
there hasn't been accepted yet, but I'm
fairly confident it will be in the near future now. It's
been in process for two years, fighting with some of the
reviewers. Okay, now into some of the questions
and answers. I've tended to put in red things
that I disagree with (I haven't followed that
carefully) and green are things that are true.
And here's some things about GPS that I
think they have pictured properly. And
one of those is, what effects does
gravitational potential have on atomic
clocks? Clocks higher in the gravity field run
faster. And, also, in motion, what does kinetic
energy, not just velocity but kinetic energy,
speed of movement, have on atomic
clock rates? And it slows them down.
And there's clear evidence for this. GPS
in an elliptic orbit (it's not highly
elliptic, but elliptic enough),
when it's near perigee,, it's going faster,
and it's slower in the gravity field. The
two effects are identically equal and
add together, and in fact the equations
in different uses sometimes will compute
the velocity and use that and double it.
And sometimes they'll compute the potential and
double that. Similarly on the surface of the earth,
because we're spinning, a clock at the equator for
example, is farther away from the center of the
earth, it's got a [higher] gravitational potential,
and that [higher] gravitational potential
caused it to run faster. However,
it's spinning which causes it to run
slower. [These two effects] exactly cancel
each other. So, if you had a mean sea
level all the way around the earth, all the clocks
would run at the same rate. Kind of interesting.
Next is the theory of the Equivalence Principle.
Gravity acts on electromagnetic radiation and here's
what the recognized authorities say.
And here is where we run into some real
problems. The claims [that] the frequency/energy
of electromagnetic radiation when rising in a
gravitational field has a redshift. I.e., it
decreases. When falling, it has a blueshift or
increases. I show four people here, Einstein, Feynman,
Clifford Will, and Neil Ashby. Will and Ashby are
current theorists that are well recognized,
and they all claim that this is the case.
Well, they use an energy argument from
Feynman and Einstein. One of them
talks about frequency, one about energy.
[This is the] same thing. The argument is made by
the conservation of energy. It takes
energy to move an atom up in a gravity
field, and then you let it emit some
radiation. You lower the atom back down
and let it absorb the electromagnetic
radiation. Well, the energy of the atom is
different, they claim, and therefore the energy of
the radiation that's gone between them has to change,
or you wouldn't get back your original energy.
Well, what's the problem with that? The
critical assumption in the Einstein and
Feynman energy argument is that the same
amount of energy is required to emit radiation from
an atom, independent of the gravitational potential.
Well, this is not obviously true, and I will
show that in fact it is obviously not true.
First of all, the Transit system and GPS,
both show that in fact, the frequency as
it falls from satellite to ground, does
not change. In fact, I find it highly
interesting that Clifford Will admits on
page 50 of his “Was Einstein Right?” that
clocks are affected when you move them
up and down in the gravity field. But he
says, we can't really know if it's a clock
rate because it's not measured in real time.
Yeah, just some real beautiful logic here. So I claim
that it is the frequency emitted which changes and not the
frequency in transit. For example, the
famous experiment at Stanford where they
let radiation fall in a tower, it was the fact that the
clocks that they measure the frequency with, is different,
not the fact that the radiation changed.
There's direct proof available from GPS
to show that this frequency does not change in transit.
I think this is the best case that I can make. GPS sends a
modulated signal from satellite to ground that's
binary encoded, and encoded in it is the time at
which the signal left the clock, left the
satellite, and the time at which it
reaches the ground then can be measured.
The difference in time sent and the
time received is multiplied by the speed of light to get
the distance. If the frequency or energy increased in
transit during that time, the phase
reversals would be wrong and the major
distance would be short. Well, maybe it is
short. But the integrated carrier frequency
would get shorter and shorter because
it's all continuously decreasing. And in
fact, my old Hatch filter where I
smoothed the code measurements with the
carrier, to get higher accuracy, would
diverge. It doesn't diverge, therefore the
frequency cannot be changing as it falls.
And here's that ‘outstanding logic’ again
from world famous relativists. Clifford Will, I already
mentioned he says you don't know whether it happens
in real time or not. Neil Ashby, I call this
‘double or nothing’ quote, “Second, the
strong equivalence principle implies that light traveling
downward in a gravitational field is shifted to a
higher frequency; i.e., it is blue-shifted
and gains energy. As a consequence,
atomic clocks at a higher elevation of
the gravitational field run faster.” I say
what kind of logic are these people trained in?
I think, quoting from Peter, just a phrase in the New
Testament, “they are willingly ignorant.” I happen
to know, for example, Clifford Will a graduate
student of his called me once after he read one of my
letters and said, I talked to Will about this and he
says, “you're wrong and when he gets back
from vacation he'll let you know.” Well,
that was two years ago. I presume he's
back from vacation by now. And Ashby
recently submitted an article to that same magazine that
I had my first paper in, on that list, and it essentially
addressed the same issue that I addressed seven years
earlier. Well, he came up with a weird explanation
for the same thing that I explained, I
think, logically. I criticized it back to
the editor; turns out the editor is a friend of mine,
or I would never have got the original paper published,
so I sent the criticism back and that's been four or five
months ago and the paper still hasn't appeared. So, I'm
beginning to think that they are, as I
said, ‘willingly ignorant’. They don't want
to look at the facts. Okay, there are a lot of related
questions though if you follow this logic to its
natural conclusions. Incidentally, this
Sheldon Harris again I saw one earlier
of this same picture I think. “He hasn't made any
progress with his theory, so he's beginning to work on his
resemblance to Einstein.” Okay, where does
gravitational potential energy come from? How does the
gravitational force arise? Do inertial and structural mass
diverge? How is the total energy split between structural
energy and kinetic energy? Is the matter
wave frequency or energy, defined by
twice the classical kinetic energy? And
can black holes exist? So let's look at
some of the implications of that fact that
the frequency doesn't change as it falls.
It has some huge implications. First of
all we can reverse Einstein and Feynman
to say, obviously if the frequency hasn't
changed going up and down, then the
energy hasn't changed of the particle itself.
Well, that means that this energy of
falling must have come from the structure itself.
In other words, the rest mass energy
(maybe I'll show later, I prefer to
call it structural), the structural mass
energy is what has changed and
provided us our gravitational energy.
Since radiant energy doesn't change,
the kinetic energy of fall must come from
the decrease of the rest-mass energy. And that's
a big implication. There's some gravitational force
implications. If gravitational energy
comes from the rest-mass, the spatial
gradient/derivative of the energy should
give us the gravitational force. And it
does very closely. If I use a gravitational scale factor
for length and energy, etc., which we will go into a
little more, Einstein has the square root
one there. I have instead an isotropic
one, (it's called that in some of the
literature), but it's the one I get when I
say that matter is made up of resonant,
spinning ether blobs if you will, and because
it takes reaction time of the ether at
sea, that's where we get m c squared.
In any case, if I use the exponential form, you'll
see it differs only out there in the second order.
But when I take that potential energy
and take the gradient of it, a big
difference. In the isotropic form I get the
scale factor in the numerator here, right there,
and if I use Einstein’s it goes in the
denominator. In other words, the force
would increase as I fall, even though I know I'm
losing energy, structural energy, which I think is the
gravitational potential energy. So, the isotropic
form has to be the correct form for me to gain energy
from the particle itself. Well, this has
other interesting implications. In fact,
if you pursue it to its logical, the G
itself has a scale factor. I almost
neutralize that by putting c-fourth in
the denominator, and saying the force is
generated by the energy of the rest
mass energy, or structural energy of the
source, and acting on the structural energy of the
particle which now is decreasing in energy as it falls,
and in fact this explains the Halton Arp low energy, I
think. Because as you add more and more mass, it has less
and less effect. Incidentally that rules out a black hole,
among other things. But it also explains quite a bit of
Halton Arp’s observations, I believe. Since they
measure how much mass there is in a star by the
orbiting stars around it, or whatever,
this decreased force (because of this
decreased F) also says that they're
measuring the mass too low, which
explains why some of the blue stars have a redshift
that Halton Arp explained and fits together with it
being a gravitational shift, and works out very nicely.
Gravitational Scaling and No Black Holes.
Shapiro experiment did radar time delay
from Mars as it passes behind the Sun
and showed that in fact the speed
of light slows as the square of the
gravitational scale factor. Local time intervals get
longer by the inverse of s, clock frequency slowing,
which implies that lengths shorten by s,
and that means the structural energy
decreases by s. The mass itself increases as the cube,
but the energy decreases because of the speed of light
changing. And black holes, the
gravitational force is self-limiting, the
structure and gravitational energy decrease
proportional to s. Gravitational force does not act on
electromagnetic radiation which means that any emissions
from a black black hole if it were there, if it were
straight up, it would have no effect. What
you're seeing is just simply the lower
frequency at which it was emitted. Now it is true that
there's some refraction effects, so if it came out at
an angle it would dim that result. But the major
effect is there obviously could not be a black hole.
Okay, Weak Equivalence Principle.
Gravitational and inertial mass are equal, is
the claim, and the energy implications of
that. The velocity scale factor I give over
here, and there's the total energy - the
potential energy plus the kinetic. The
components of the total energy, I say
the structural and the kinetic are given
here, and you'll notice that I've doubled the
kinetic energy. And that's because I claim that
there's a hidden component which is
evidenced by the fact that a moving
particle emits lower radiation. So, it has
converted part of its structural mass,
when it moves, into kinetic mass and that
works out for a number of reasons, and it
looks like it's great. The identification
of the structural/gravitational and
inertial mass then becomes like this.
Inertial mass times the speed of light
times s gives the total energy. And then
the gravitational energy and the kinetic
energy. Okay, problem is [that] the decreased
potential energy causes the frequency
radiated to decrease, and therefore
decrease structural energy. Increased
kinetic energy also causes it to
decrease and the solution is the same.
The structural and inertial mass diverge
with velocity. There's actually been
some evidence of that in some other papers that
I don't cite here. The theory says rest mass is
invariant with frame and energy
conservation. The invariance of the rest
mass - it's really interesting here. In special relativity
they claim that the rest mass doesn't change. Well, if
we work through the equations and we
expect energy to be conserved, what we'd
expect would be that the energy of the
moving planet or whatever, would be
decreased by the kinetic energy. And sure enough,
when you plug that into this equation, you get that the
structural mass has apparently decreased
by the gravity’s motion factor. And
that in fact resets them, so that if I'm
going to measure them on the earth,
they'll look like they're the same. We'll go into a
little more of that. Note that it's numerical invariance
and not physical invariance, for both
speed of light, inertial mass and
a number of other things. Confirmation of
structural mass decrease and inertial mass
increase with velocity, which is contrary
to theory. The frequency of emission (and
absorption) increases with potential
energy, but decreases with kinetic energy
(e.g. Pound-Rebka experiment) that I mentioned
earlier. The frequency (energy) of matter
waves is twice the classical kinetic
energy. I've never seen anybody try
to explain why. Direct tests of inertial
and gravitational mass divergence (with
fall) have always been performed at the
same velocities. So, they're not even really
looking for it. In a given frame the
structural (gravitational) mass and the
inertial mass are equal when stationary,
because the kinetic energy is reset to
zero in your moving frame. In a given
frame, the structural (gravitational) mass
and inertial mass may vary by the same
amount as the gravitational potential
energy is changed, if you're not moving up and down
in that potential. Okay, on to the next. GPS and the
Strong Equivalence Principle Theory.
Here's what the experts say. The effects
of acceleration and gravity are completely equivalent.
Einstein said it. Feynman said it. Ashby
says it in chapter 14 of the Global
Positioning Bible, if you will, and let's
just go on: What experiment says.
Gravitational potential causes clock
rate changes, but acceleration causes Doppler frequency
changes. Well, there's a significant difference there.
I can integrate my clock frequency
changes and get time. I can't integrate
Doppler frequency and get time. But by the
previous argument from GPS, the frequency
does not change when falling and
the radiated frequency (clock rate)
changed as a function of the
gravitational potential. In GPS, the
Doppler frequency can be distinguished
from the clock rate by sending the clock
reading via the same electromagnetic
signal, i.e. it is modulated on the signal.
Tracking millisecond pulsars can
distinguish between clock rate and
Doppler rate and [this] clearly shows that
they aren't equal. Clock rate integrates
into clock time but Doppler does not. The
effects are not equivalent. I do admit
there is one minute [tiny] effect that
cancels and that is with the earth falling
towards the Sun as it orbits, and the
GPS also falling, it turns out, over that
70 milliseconds, there's just enough tiny acceleration
of the earth that it essentially cancels out that clock
effect instantaneously. But, as we shall see,
the integration of it still has good effects.
On to theory again. Infinitesimal Lorentz Boosts
(or transformations). The theory claims that
there are valid means of adjusting SRT to accelerated
frames. And I give a bunch of references for that.
Experiment instead, agrees with Goy's hypothesis.
He's a Prof. in Italy and he says that you can't do
Lorentz transformations instantaneously, but
you can set your clock rate instantaneously to
whatever the velocity is at that point.
And that's proven by the fact [that] in
a muon storage ring the acceleration has no effect,
but the velocity does directly affect it. And
here I want to do a couple of experiments to
illustrate a little bit of this. If you use GPS and
free running clocks to measure the time
and the speed of light in orbit around
the earth, and I'm going to measure
the speed of light across this bar, or
even perhaps across this bar, if I gravity gradient
stabilize it for example, so that this always points
towards the earth, then these two clocks on the two edges
run at exactly the same rate, because they're traveling
at exactly the same rate and exactly the same
potential. Meanwhile these two are traveling at
slightly different speeds, and that speed is just exactly
enough to cancel the difference in the potential.
And so, all these clocks will run at the same rate
if I'm not rotating this. The horizontal leg is just
like GRACE and the GRACE satellites use GPS for
time and they clearly show that, yes the clocks
run at the same rate. They agree with
the GPS time and GRACE is just two
satellites in the same orbit, separated
by a couple of hundred kilometers.
But there are some interesting things
that we can also learn here. For light
traveling between those two satellites,
it turns out it will be measured as
c minus v, the velocity of the satellites.
Because of the transit time, how far the
satellites have moved in that transit time,
we can reduce that to a distance
traveled. We can compute a change in
clock that would compensate for it and
it turns out that it's exactly that v x over
c squared negative. And for carrying
a clock, if you look at the gamma factor
and look at the center part term, which
is caused by the orbit, you get that
same correction. The first term can be
made arbitrarily small by moving slowly.
And this one is common to anything on
the earth, so you can get exactly the same
effect by carrying a clock from one to the other.
Slow clock transport induces a clock bias,
and Einstein two-way synchronization
produces that same clock bias. So
they will measure the speed of light as
c, if in fact you try to synchronize them.
But if you don't synchronize them and
it's not rotating, you won't. Next: spin.
What if we rotate it, or what if we stop
the rotation (we were rotating the last
one pointing towards the earth)? This one
we’re not. And one way of doing that
would be to spin this thing around its
vertical axis, and now it won't rotate as it goes
around the earth. The spin we could use to see that it
would create the clock bias between the two that
make it look like the speed of light is c between the two.
These two clocks run at different rates,
because of their gravitational potential.
But lo and behold, if you integrate those two
rates as this goes around the earth, this one
will wind up being behind it, once you've
gone a quarter of the way around, and it
creates just exactly the right amount of
clock bias to measure the speed of light
of c again. Well, this is exactly what
happens on the earth: the spin of the
earth keeps the earth oriented the same
way in space, and the spin and the
gravitational potential of the sun, wind
up causing it to make it look like the
speed of light is c on the earth, even though
it's not. Okay I think that's good enough.
Next, theoretical claims for Lorentz
transformation or boosts. If you make two
non-collinear Lorentz transformations,
they claim it'll create a torque. Nobody
knows where the torque comes from, but
Thomas gave an original derivation for
that on the electron. Lorentz boosts of
the earth causes the cancellation of the
Sun's gravitational field, according to
Ashby. Muller attempts to explain the
torque and he actually gives a physical
explanation which I think makes sense.
The trouble is, if he were right, and if
the Thomas procession explanation
were right, you'd get twice as much. I do believe that
the divergence of structural mass and inertial mass can
cause the precession effect. The experiment: gravitational
potential of the Sun does not affect the clocks.
This does affect the clocks, whereas
they claim that it didn't. The frequency
effects integrate into the clock biases.
And that's exactly by the process I just
explained on that spinning ‘thing’. The earth is
spinning; as a result you get some clock biases,
that wind up making the speed of light look like it
is the same in all directions. And when the orbit
direction changes, the gravitational potential of the
Sun is just enough to keep that bias the same amount. So,
Ashby's claims are wrong. The fall of the
earth does not cancel out any effect on
the clocks caused by the gravitational field of
the Sun. There's another fundamental question we
can get back to. What about length contraction?
Is it real? If so, what's the mechanism?
I claim that the conservation of momentum requires
length contraction of an orbit in a moving frame. How do
I get this? Well, when you're moving,
the inertial mass increases as the
experiments have shown. It turns out
that, if I'm in orbit around the earth for
example, up here, my orbital speed adds
to the earth speed. I'm going enough
faster, then my mass is a little higher.
Conservation of momentum says I have to
move a little bit slower, therefore I'm
going to wind up closer to the earth in
front. Down here just the opposite effect.
It cancels some of it. I get lower mass,
therefore my speed has increased and I get a little
closer to the earth on the tail end. I believe that exact
same thing happens in the atoms and so forth. So,
we get length contraction caused by conservation of
momentum. Well, there's another amazing
fact about it and that is it's exactly
the same clock bias that will counteract that slow tiny
velocity change and make it look like we have uniform
momentum in an orbit around the earth,
even when the momentum is not uniform.
And the clock times. I could use this as a clock
and see that there's clock slowing etc. Okay,
theory says the speed of light is
physically invariant. Wikipedia questions
it and I say the real question is, is the
speed of light physically invariant, or
simply numerically invariant in a local
inertial or local gravitational frame?
Shapiro radar time delay shows the speed of light
varies in a gravitational potential, and I say:
lengths shorten, frequency decreases, speed
of light decreases as the square, but it's
locally invariant numerically. In other
words, it's physically changed, but
it has not mathematically changed in
terms of a number I would measure
locally. Now back to transformations.
We get the Selleri transformation.
Again, a Prof. in Italy, has developed a transformation
where he says there's clock slowing and there's
length contraction, which is why I've
argued for those two. And he gives a
simple set of equations for that
Selleri transformation. It's the same
as the Lorentz transformation except there's a
time difference equation. If you manipulate the
mathematics of that time difference and
simplify it, it turns out that it's that same
clock bias that you get from Einstein synchronization.
So, yes, the Lorentz transformation works, but it's
because you've changed the clock. And it
turns out you've changed the scale. Over
here we're looking at that clock slowing and it winds
up when you look at everything, the speed of light is
physically decreased by gamma squared,
if you're going one way. If you're going
back the other way, for example the earth.
I call the earth a child frame of the Sun and
the Sun a parent frame of the
earth because the speed of light is
physically different in the two frames,
from what we've just looked at. And
of course, there would be a galactic
frame that's parent of the Sun, etc.
So, numerically c is invariant, but physically
it's not. Okay. One-way Sagnac effect
on the earth. The measurement is the
result of earth's rotation around its
axis. I claim that that's absolutely false.
Wang has done some experiments
with conveyor belts and shown that
their circular equation, right there,
is really equivalent to the length, it 
can be put in terms of the length. Well,
on a one-way path, you'd expect it to 
be half as big as the GPS experts claim.
There's this triangle that it follows and they put it 
in the same form for a one-way because of earth's
rotation. But again, if you work it out,
it turns out it's just v l over c squared.
And when you put it in terms of where
the satellite and the receiver are, it works
out to be exactly the same as that v x
distance along the equator. And so
there's clock biases that have to be
accounted for in GPS, to remove the
Sagnac effect. Everybody asks why 
there isn't one for orbits. Well, there isn't
one for orbits because they're all
affected by the same amount. So,
you just adjust your clocks. The clocks have
been adjusted and are automatically kept that
way from the argument we've already
given. A little bit more proof of that is
GPS has to include all receiver motion in the
effect, whether it's just rotational or not.
And that's the ICD document that claims
that that's the case. So again, it's not a
rotation, it's the fact that the receiver and source 
are moving. Okay. I then come up with what I
call the Apparent Lorentz transformation. And I say
it's the result of the Selleri transformation along this
axis, added with a clock bias, or removed
from a clock bias. There is a scale change
across this, one way when you're going one way,
and the other when you're going back the other way.
Okay. And that has some implications later on. I say 
why call the transformation an Alternate Lorentz
transformation? Why not call it the
Lorentz transformation? And I say, that's
because the interpretation is dramatically different.
Yes, the mathematics is the same, but the physical
speed is different and there is a length contraction,
even of the earth on the order of a few centimeters.
Which incidentally, I came across the paper a long time
ago. I haven't checked on it recently. When they tried to
compute precise orbits with radar, of the planets,
they did not get the right values. They tried it with and
without Einstein's theories, and it didn't work either way
very well. I claim that they're not taking into account
this flattening effect and the speed of light
changes as a function of direction here.
The length contraction is different in
different directions and incidentally
that'll cause a very tiny change in
your VLBI measurement of the milliarc
seconds. So, there's some fun things that they don't
account for, that I believe we're beginning to see the
residual effects of that. The speed difference,
the need to distinguish between parent frame and
child frame, to know whether the scale 
is changing up or down. It clarifies the
need for a specific bias mechanism 
to account for the clock bias. Special
relativity in general, seems to think
and is evidenced by the infinitesimal
Lorentz transformation claims, that 
the clocks will automatically be biased
under acceleration, to still measure
the speed of light to c. And that's
clearly not the case. They have to be 
in a gravitational field that's adjusting
the clocks properly, or that will not
happen. And as just seen by the great
satellites they are not synchronized to
measure the speed of light to c, because
they have not been biased by that proper amount.
Okay. So, I say it clarifies the need for
Einstein re-synchronization if the acceleration
is linear and not in a gravitational field.
Okay. What's next? This is from Sheldon
Harris's same ‘Einstein Simplified’ book.
He says, “As I mentioned next week in my
talk on reversible time!” So, I'm going
to look a little bit here at what's next
Next week (or later): To be explained.
The anomalous Earth Gravity Assist. It's my 
hypothesis that [it is] that same flattening of
the earth’s gravitational potential upon 
a solar orbit. It works fine for any orbit
around the earth, because they have the
same phenomena effects. But once I use
the earth to send somebody else, I
believe and in fact the largest earth
gravity assist observed, came in directly
orthogonal to what that flattening would
be. So, I think (I haven't worked out 
the details), but I believe that that will
explain the extra acceleration seen on earth
gravity assists. The apparent relativity of
gravitational and electromagnetic forces.
My last paper, that I still haven't had
published, I show how a gravito-magnetic effect
looks like a gravity effect in a moving system.
I intend to try to do the same thing
electromagnetically and I have that
outlined and I believe it'll work. It's a
little more complicated than the gravity
one. Another interesting thing is that
there's a speed kick of millisecond
pulsars whenever they collapse down 
more. I believe that's just a conservation
of momentum effect and the direction of that momentum.
They speed up and I believe it gives them a kinetic
kick along the axis. Incidentally, 
in that gravity one I found that if I
have a spinning orbit and I speed it up,
I also get the part of that spin energy
goes into kinetic energy. So again, it indicates
it's just like that hidden kinetic energy elsewhere.
Spin energy can create hidden kinetic energy when you
start moving. I haven't really done any work on this
last point in 20 years, but 20 years ago
I did do some work on the relationship
between gravitational and electric forces.
Now, this is hypothetical and you may
have big objections to it. But never-
theless, my conjecture is that there's a
relationship between gravitational and kinetic.
Gravitational potential, I believe, arises
from compression of the ether and that's
why it exponentially decays with distance
from the planet. Gravitational forces
arise from the compressive ether gradient.
Gravitational force is locally generated
by the local gradient (no travel time).
Kinetic force is due to the shear gradient
induced by the motion in the ether.
Electric and magnetic, I believe, are simply
oscillations of the other two. A lot of people think,
and properly so, because there's 40 orders of magnitude
difference between them, that gravity is residual
electric. I believe it's just the opposite and when you 
look at how concentrated the mass is in an atom for
example, I think this might help explain
the effect. The electrical potential
arises from an oscillation in the ether density,
I believe. And the electric force is due to the
interaction gradient and direction of flow
of that ether oscillation. I believe an
electron, for example, is anti-rotating a phasing
structure and makes it look like it’s coming in phase
motion because of the rotation, while a positron would
rotate in the opposite direction and it would look like it
would be going out. Magnetic force is due to the
oscillation of the shear induced by the motion, I believe.
What is a little bit of supporting
evidence for that? Well, for example in
gravity there's no travel time. In the
electromagnetic to the best of my knowledge
and from what I've seen, it travels at
the speed of light, and it looks like
that next paper I'm working on. And that
explains one of the differences between
the electric and magnetic as well. There's only one
sign to the charge, no repulsion, but if I have an
oscillation, I can get plus and minus inward and
outward phase motion. Apparent morphing of gravitational
and kinetic into gravity-only. Same way, apparent 
motion of electromagnetic forces with motion into
electric only. Earthquakes induce electro-
magnetic phenomena. With the one in
Japan recently, they saw the ionosphere
bump up right above it. So, I believe that
motion of mass, oscillation of mass in
particular, can create an electric field,
a strong electric field. Io was mentioned
in the talk before mine. I looked at it
again, 20 years ago, and the decameter radiation
occurred as Io was in front and behind [Jupiter]
and had opposite patterns. So, I believe that's when you'd
get the most oscillation of apparent gravity, because
one's following the other in either case.
And I believe it's what creates that
strong electric field. And of course spiral galaxies.
You saw that electric radiation between the stars, well
those stars are following one another and create
an oscillation. So, I believe that it's the gravity
or the mass oscillation, which causes
these huge electric forces. This is a big
quote. I'll skip it since we're probably 
low on time and I'd like for a little bit of
time to ask questions. But one of the famous professors
that looked at biochemical processes said at the tail end
of explaining it to people, “There's no possibility
whatever that this system could have arisen by chance.”
I tend to think the same thing of
physics. There's some remarkable
mathematics and remarkable design as evidence.
So, I say, “Be a King, like Solomon. Search out matter.”

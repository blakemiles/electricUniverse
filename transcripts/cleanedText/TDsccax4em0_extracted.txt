In the early 1960s, radio astronomy 
was still in its infancy. Still, it revealed
the marvels of the universe in
ways no one could have imagined.
When they observed images of the 
whole sky in radio, two giant mysterious
structures stuck out like a sore thumb.
These structures seemed to be polarized,
meaning that light that passed through
it from a distant source was being
rotated, and this meant that there
had to be a magnetic field present.
In 1965 Tom Landecker wrote a paper
and speculated that the polarized radio
signals could arise from our view of the
local arm of the Galaxy from inside it.
When we look up at the sky, if we could
see in radio, we would see a tunnel-like
structure in just about every direction we look.
The North Polar Spur and the Fan Region
are by far the two brightest and most
dramatic extended features in the
large-scale radio-synchrotron sky.
Since their original discovery and up
until the present day, astronomers have
questioned the origin of these two regions.
Some argue that they are local features,
and some argue that they are large-scale
distant galactic scale features.
Both of these features have high
fractional polarization and coherent
magnetic fields, revealing the
synchrotron origins of this emission, and
confirming the presence of relativistic
cosmic ray electrons. Both are clearly seen
in dust polarization and have a similar scale.
Despite the similarities, very few
studies have considered that they might
have a common origin. In addition 
to the North Polar Spur and the
Fan Region, there are several other
polarized loops and spurs in the
large-scale galactic emissions.
One idea is that all of these have a
common origin in the wall of what
they describe as a nearby bubble.
The structures of these regions are also
important in understanding what they are.
They are long and narrow, and reminiscent
of other long and narrow filamentary
structures that seem to be 
abundant throughout our Galaxy.
These seem to form the bones or skeleton
of the Galaxy many of these filaments
seem to be strongly aligned with
the galactic magnetic field and some
filaments are shown to be aligned with
the polarization features. Increasing
evidence is suggesting that there is a
strong connection between these two
observations. In a new paper the author 
makes the suggestion that both the North Polar
Spur and the Fan Region  are actually
connected together and form a giant
structure which is part of the local arm
of the Milky Way. Their suggestion to the
origin remains firmly fixed in the old rhetoric:
a large old supernova remnant, a portion
of the local arm, or an expanding 
shell, are examples of the origins.
Although they outline a large amount 
of evidence that the North Polar Spur is
local, there is disagreement as to the
exact distance, and several studies have
pointed out what seems to be
contradictory evidence that suggests a
portion is local, at about 100 parsecs away,
while other portions are more distant at
250 parsecs away. All these studies come 
to a similar conclusion, that the high latitude
portions are local, while the lower
latitude portions are more distant.
And this is hard to reconcile with the
idea of the origin of the North Polar
Spur that they have suggested.
The Fan Regions refer to a variety of
features in diffuse polarized radio
emissions, extending several degrees
North and somewhat South of the galactic 
plane. It was originally called the Fan Region
because its electric field vectors, as
seen from the polarized radio emissions,
appear to fan out and away from the galactic 
plane. Similar to the North Polar Spur, it is
highly polarized and extremely bright,
but unlike the North Polar Spur, it is
not nearly as obvious in radio, and is
mostly unremarkable at other wavelengths.
The idea that the author of this paper
has, is that if you are an observer
embedded in a uniform magnetic field
aligned with a local arm, you would
observe two bright patches of
synchrotron emissions, filling a large
fraction of the sky at approximately the
positions of the North Polar Spur and
the Fan Region. The idea is that there
would be a series of filaments that run
across the sky, which then create the shapes 
we see. In their analysis, they calculate that
one possible interpretation of this
would be a series of arc filaments that
lie behind, above, and below our solar system.
Now, it may come as no surprise that we
are finding these types of structures,
but there are a number of points that
are worth considering from this analysis.
Firstly, where there is a magnetic field,
there are inevitably moving charges.
Could these structures that they
identify, be the filaments that
connect and power the stars?
Both Don Scott and Wal Thornhill have
proposed that filaments run along the
arms of the Milky Way, back towards the center of
the Galaxy. Are these confirmation of these ideas?
One thing that is important to consider
is that of scale. We know that filaments
exist in many structures that have been
observed, from molecular clouds, to the
edges of what they call bubbles. The 
most remarkable of these is probably
the Local Chimney. At the center of this,
is the Pleiades, and we sit on the edge
of this vast structure. So, are these 
filaments in any way connected to this?
The author of the paper sees the
structure as arcs that have an origin
that would actually be in the next arm
closest to the center of the Galaxy. This
is actually in the opposite direction to
the Local Chimney. The author does not
really go into any details about what
might have created this structure, but
postulates it might be similar to the
Local Chimney. The problem is that the
mainstream origin story for the Local
Chimney is a rather unbelievable affair
that involves dark matter. Of course, 
if this was part of a filament that
runs along the arm of the Galaxy, then 
we would not expect it to flow in a
straight line, but we would expect
it to undulate, forming arcs.
Still, I question if what we see is all at 
the same scale. From an EU perspective,
it is a very appealing idea that we sit next
to these giant filaments on either side of us.
Does our knowledge of the local stars in
any way help us to place some markers on
what these structures might be? For 
those who have seen my precession
series, you will be familiar with Jim
Weninger's concept that we are on a
filament that is twisting around Arcturus,
which in turn orbits around the Pleiades.
If we examine Arcturus, we know that
it is part of a group of stars that are
moving together. Our speculation is 
that they are all part of a filament that
runs through these stars: a stellar
filament. Our star is on a different
filament which wraps around this one. If
we jump back to the North Polar Spur,
there is an image that may show
you a different perspective.
In the image, we can see on the right
the North Polar Spur coming down the
center of the image. Towards the top of
this, we can see what is marked as Boötes.
This is a constellation and the
brightest star, that is Arcturus.
So, could this line actually be the
filament that Arcturus sits on? Jumping
to a wider-view image of the stars I have 
drawn on the three Spurs. The longer
line is the North Polar Spur from the
previous image. The red dots that are
marked, are other known stars that 
form part of the Arcturus star stream.
So, is it possible that part, or maybe
all of it, is part of this star stream?
This could be the closest large filament
to us, based on Jim’s concept. Closer to
us, is the Sirius filament which we would
be wrapped around. The distortions in the
line may be caused by the interference
from this closer filament, but at this
stage this is just a guess. Further 
analysis of the distances of the
stars may help to identify if any of the
parts of the structure, can be linked to
the Arcturus star stream. It may 
also be possible that we are
seeing a distortion of the magnetic
fields at many different levels,
superimposed on top of each other.
We are unlikely to see the effects of
the filaments we reside on. The 
most obvious would be those
filaments closer. We must consider that
there are many, many filaments, so the
further away from us we get, the more 
these would end up looking like random noise.
If we consider that larger filaments are
constructed of many smaller filaments,
then from a large enough distance, these
may appear as a single filament, when in
fact they are composed of many smaller ones.
Understanding what these structures in
the sky are, is therefore not an easy task.
In any case, the identification of these
magnetic filaments once more confirms
the idea that the arms of the Galaxy are
filled with filaments that carry electric charges.

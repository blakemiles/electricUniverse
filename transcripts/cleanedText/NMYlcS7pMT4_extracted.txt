What Can Matter Be?
Peter Modell
Good morning to all!
This is really a special
opportunity and a privilege
to be able to learn and share learnings
here at EU 2017, and I'm coming in deep
gratitude to all those at Thunderbolts
who made this possible.
My lifelong passion
for astronomy found its
reward a few years ago when I
discovered the Electric Universe and
The Thunderbolts Project and I
count myself very very lucky.
This talk's aim is to answer
the question 'what can matter be'
but not too quickly.
In the speeded up times of ours,
we are quick to give
solutions, questions, trigger responses,
usually from what we know already.
And quite often our blogs turn into pillow
fights where we're tossing opinions back and forth.
In contrast to this, resting
with unknowns without immediately
reaching for solutions has a
completely different effect.
It tends to bring out
hidden lines of reasoning that have
their source in intuition.
Contradictory facts can be resting
places where we take our bearings
before moving forward, and
that's important in what follows.
A familiar example to us, of contradictions
of course, is the dinosaurs.
On one hand, it's obvious that
they existed on the Earth.
On the other hand, biology and physics shows
that it couldn't have been like we imagined.
The, for instance, their frail bone structure
couldn't have held such a massive body.
And do we take the empiricist's
stand and say well, they
existed, and go on and
make dinosaur movies?
Or do we hold to the
contradiction and allow for a solution
to emerge in its time, as it has in
the case of the Electric Universe.
You know the story well.
With reduced gravity on the Earth, life forms
grew to different proportions than today.
Reduced gravity means reduced
mass and mass is a variable that depends
on (the) electric environment.
So it was possible that the mass
of the Earth was much lower,
while the matter remained the same.
Now, the hard problem is
understanding what is mass, and we have
an elegant response to that, as
described by Wal Thornhill.
The easy problem, what is matter,
is left for us to ponder on.
But is it easy?
What are the characteristics of matter?
It seems so evident it shouldn't be a problem.
By matter, we refer to objects we
encounter with our physical bodies
that is, our physical senses.
On the scale of the macro world,
matter is what we bump into.
And why the bump -- because material objects occupy
certain space at a certain time and this
implies that matter subsumes space and time.
Another fact we associate with
matter is unequivocal, present.
It's either there or it's not
there, there's no in-between.
If you want the piano to
go in the corner, well, the pot
with the ficus tree
has to go elsewhere.
This model of reality works well in our
macro world and it works too
for cells under the microscope.
But shift down to the scale of the atom
within the subatomic, and the model doesn't apply.
For one on this scale, objects
apparently don't touch.
They, or the particles, have an electric field and
this is equivalent to having a distended
body which is less present at the
distance from the center.
It's not necessary for me to describe this world,
you know it well, but to accommodate the
subatomic world, do we need to construct
a separate different model of reality?
Probably not, and why not?
The incongruence between the two worlds
results from not taking into
account the description of perception.
Our first step should be to grasp how
perception gives rise to the world we know.
To make my point, here's an anecdote.
Once a group of specialists came before
God and said, you're not needed anymore,
we know how to make matter,
how to create life now.
And God, ever accommodating said,
certainly, you just show me that you
can make life and I'll graciously leave.
Well, the experts bent down, took up a
handful of dirt and started, and
proceeded to make life.
Wait a minute, said God, that's mine!
You take your own dirt!
Our search for matter begins not with a
description of the already present
objective world, but prior to this,
at the pre-conceptual state.
And to go there seems all but impossible,
but we can give it a try.
Here's an experience for you to
test right now in your mind.
Imagine you get a whiff of a
magnificent, strange, beautiful
scent and this fragrance, you don't
know what it is and where it's from, just
stay with the experience.
Fully absorbed by the experience,
it's possible to lose
the sense of self and other and just be the
mysterious feeling that arises with the fragrance.
That suspended state then
gets broken, the moment the conscious
mind enters and forms concepts.
At that moment, Nirvana's lost and
you say hmm, I smell something special.
The encounter between our
body senses and whatever is, does not
create the world.
There's no perceived object and no
perceiving subject until the mind steps
in and formulates the
experience in this way.
So we can define the
process of perception in three stages.
One stage is the precognitive of which
we can say nothing, then comes the
out-of-conscious moment, where
there's an integration of multiple
elements which lead to the third stage, the
object of perception and awakening of consciousness.
To understand the middle set,
the moment of integration, is
crucial and was the subject of The
Thundebolts video that introduced this talk.
I give two further
examples now.
Looking at a mountainside, diverse
features catch our attention.
Rocks, cliffs, glaciers, streams...
However, all these individual items exit from a
conscious mind for the split-second that
the global understanding â€˜mountain' arises.
A hidden act of integration brings
together features that fuse to produce
the recognition -- mountain.
And in addition to this, there
are personal features,
attitudes, experiences, knowledges and
feelings, that also enter that moment of
integration and influence the impact and
meaning that the sense 'Mountain' has to us.
And there's more than this in that,
in the moment of integration.
For example, light intensity is variable.
The brightness we observe
of any one area in the field
depends on the surrounding areas.
In order for the image we see to form,
a scale of intensities of luminosity has
to be established for the whole scene.
Various processes such as this take place
in that split-second before the image forms.
It's amazing, isn't it?
The second example, I'd like to take a set of
depth vision, something that's commonly
explained as a, when you take the
parallax difference between the views of
the two eyes, you can calculate the
distance of an object.
But this is not at all the
experience of depth vision,
which is a way of being in the
world and a way of connecting with
our surroundings.
You know well, when an image passes from
two dimensions to three dimensional, it
can give a kind of a jolt and quite
often there's a kind, it is an experience
of elation that comes with that change.
Calculation with an algorithm
is a sequenced process
and will not explain the
simultaneity of presence.
By holding steadfast to the
contradiction that arises
between the two views when they are
superimposed, each element in the field
vies for its place in a coherent single
unified view, and resolution comes with
the third dimension or with depth vision.
And without this, would we imagine
a three-dimensional world and without
the sense of volume, could we imagine
physical objects? We couldn't.
Now we've got a conundrum.
On one hand, we personally enact the
process of integration that generates
the objects we perceive.
On the other hand, if we're
not there, then what?
Shouldn't things disappear?
Here's the response of a
baffled philosophy student.
There once was a man who said, God must
think it exceedingly odd if he finds
that the tree continues to be when
there's no one about in the quad.
Dear sir, your astonishment's odd.
I'm always about in the quad and that's why
the tree will continue to be observed by,
yours faithfully, God.
Yes yes, we're caught in a contradiction!
Do we take the empiricist's position and
say well, the world obviously exists,
ignore the contradiction and go on,
or do we ignore the physical side of the
contradiction and come up with
a glibly claim that all is
non-material spirit?
An answer will come in its time,
we just need the steadfast
determination to hold the contradiction
without jumping to conclusions as this
limerick rhyme did.
Let's linger a little bit with that
moment of integration.
I choose to emphasize just three points.
Firstly, an empty center.
Objects we perceive have no central
something that makes them what they are.
They are not built lego-like
from component parts.
Instead, they arise out of
the communion between multiple
features that, in a
timeless moment, integrate.
That's the empty center.
Second point, timelessness.
The integration is achieved through
a simultaneous interchange
between all that gives meaning and
form to the perceived object.
It is the simultaneous interrelationship
of many, that forms unity.
The third point, non-conscious.
The integration happens in an
out-of-consciousness moment.
It's achieved through the activity of the non-
conscious mind, what I call the expanded mind.
Alright, here we can arrive at the
first conclusion about materiality.
This integration forms
everything we perceive.
It requires an act of
mind to form an object.
Realizing this fact bursts
the mind-matter duality and signifies
the counterintuitive conclusion that matter,
as we know it, is a product of mind.
How strange this may seem at first.
Matter is born in the mind, can it be so?
If physical objects are merely concepts
formed in the mind, this raises a very
serious question.
Would you trust the chair you're
sitting on to all your weight, huh?
Despite the fact that you are sitting
on the chair, it is a mind object.
Contradiction? No, not if
we unravel it carefully.
Physical experience, as we noted,
is the unthinkable exchange between
body and all that is.
We had the example of fragrance
and now the example of
material objects, there's no difference.
The pre-conceptual ongoing experience
that's neither subjective nor objective,
is inaccessible to the conscious mind.
Then in steps the mind, breaks the
hallowed state and codifies it into
chair, body, sitting.
The conscious mind knows only that
which becomes codified in two objects.
Sitting on a chair is the mind's
formulation of a physical encounter.
We have absolutely no knowledge of
what that encounter consisted of.
We only know what it is
after applying the codification system
we habitually use, that matches our
present understanding.
Now let's go to the question
'what can matter be'.
Is the question 'what is matter made of' or is it
'how do we recognize matter, what is it'?
We'll look at these two
questions separately.
Firstly, 'what is it made of'.
The moment we ask of some object 'what is it made of',
we've abandoned that object and we're looking
for the matter that fills it
and not what it is itself.
The matter of a mountain is being a mountain.
To look for matter on the
inside, regresses to the
ever more minute till soon we're asking
what's the matter of subatomic particles.
Here, below the threshold of
the periodic table of elements, what kind
of matter do we expect? Some cosmic dust?
And then we finally realize we've gone astray.
Because we're actually looking for
something to fill the object that's
a concept we created in the mind.
The question we meant to ask then is,
what makes matter what it is?
Or simply, how do we recognize matter?
But this detour through the
wrong question bears its fruit,
if I'm not mistaken there's a
restatement here of Goedel's
incompleteness theorem, though
in a different form.
Can we really build an integral whole
from within by assembling component parts?
It's impossible.
The complement of this, of course, is how through
integration we build a whole from without.
So back to the question how do
we recognize matter, whether matter in
general or the subset of matter
we know as physical matter.
Let's keep in mind
what was already shown.
Matter is what the mind creates when it
breaks off a piece of the continuing
experience, the continuing flux of
experience, and allows it to form a
self-contained unit.
It then has otherness or what
we know as objectivity.
To be called matter, an
item has to have an identity.
It's recognized as some thing.
For example, oh dear what
can the matter be, Johnny's
so long at the fair.
The matter is the whole problem that the distressed
young Irish lass has formed in her mind.
And she's surely right,
Dublin's Donnybrook Fair was infamous.
But for us, 'matter' is the fact that
something takes form as a separate
entity and becomes an object of attention.
Physical matter is when the
object related to our experience,
the experience of our physical senses,
is recognized as present in the
three-dimensional world.
Physical matter can be auditory,
visual, tactile or strange fragrance.
Matter is not a particular substance.
It's a particular, yes,
a particular anything.
A particular particle, for
example, or a mountain.
Now, this came rather subtlety
and among you
there may be those who want to say,
but nothing has been answered!
Not so, there is an answer.
Matter is anything that
has an identity.
Thoughts and concepts are mind matter
attributed to the mind only.
Material objects are attributed to the
physical world we experience through our bodies.
So far it's in
perfect accord with our intuitive
understanding, the only difference and
this makes all the difference,
is that the material object we recognize
is empty inside because it's formed from
without through a process of integration.
Here we could come back to the idea of a,
the model of reality on the macro scale
and on the subatomic scale
using the same model.
I just touched very quickly
on a couple, on three points.
One is the empty center of
all objects, as we noted.
Maybe the same is true of on the
subatomic scale and an electric field
generates the impression
of a central object.
The Boscovic atom was an
early proposition in this direction.
Second point, the timeless moment of
integration, in which everything
interrelates simultaneously.
Could the same immediate connection be true in
phenomena we observe in the universe on all scales?
Gravity's connection tends to
be immediate and is probably just one
example of such immediate connection.
The third point goes a little further.
It's the tendency of the mind to
produce independent units, concepts,
objects, and this is something that is
not just the mind but we observe
throughout nature, both animate and
inanimate, in the formation of cells,
crystals and more,
and of course the plasma.
Is the mind responding to a universal
tendency that is present in nature?
This thought then gives answers
to diverse questions.
For instance, if the subatomic
particles are substanceless,
then what holds charge
to a position in space?
Well, fields on their own tend to
form separate units.
Or another question, how does the
tree continue to be in
the quad when there's no
intelligent observer?
The answer -- both mind matter and physical
matter participate in the same proactive
movement that creates
independent intelligent units.
And with this realization,
dualism vanishes.
In less than a minute, I'll give a
recapitulation of the main theme.
So what is matter -- it's anything
that's gone through the process
of integration to become
a particular thing.
Sense organs don't know an object
is present, for that we need the
intervention of mind.
A good example is warmth.
You feel warm but you have no concept
of any thing and no sense of it being other.
Warmth can just be an
experience until, in our mind, we
form the concept, warmth, then we can talk
about it and then it becomes the matter
of our discussion.
There's no more substance to matter,
or should I say,
there's no more substance to the matter
of a mountain than to warmth.
All objects are equally real:
matter, love, warmth, beauty...
Of course, we differentiate what
we encounter with our body senses
as physical matter but 'the matter'
part is not substance,
but the fact that it formed
a self-contained unit.
It could be our cultural
heritage, with its emphasis on
objectivity, makes telling
this tale more difficult.
And finally, all these
observations come to broaden the
dialogue between scientist and
philosopher, the one in search of facts,
the other in search of meaning.
Do they contradict?
Probably, the two aspirations
arrive mostly in
the same person, the philosophical
scientist or the scientific philosopher.
In holding with steadfast determination
to the contrasting views, we allow for a
deeper understanding to emerge.
Maybe we did that a little here, I hope so.
Thank you for your participation!

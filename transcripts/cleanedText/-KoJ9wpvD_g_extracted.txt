Hi, this is Andy Hall with Space News.
I am presenting Part 9 of my series
Eye of the Storm, where we look at
electrical scarring on the Colorado Plateau.
The Caribbean sea floor displays deep
trenches aligned with island arcs, which
run parallel to each other - even around 
bends. Volcanic island chains and
oceanic trenches are magnetic
expressions of a subsurface current.
Volcanic islands appear to one side of the
current, and deep trenches appear on the other.
The subsurface current does not
produce trench and volcano chains
directly. They are formed by eddy
currents in the solenoid-like, coaxial
magnetic fields surrounding the current.
Think of a subsurface Birkeland current,
with the added effect of iron in the ground
magnifying the magnetic field and its eddy currents.
The effect is described by Lenz' Law, which is
a special case of Faraday's Law of Induction.
To induce eddy currents, according to Lenz’ Law
the conductor itself had to be in motion across
Earth's magnetic field, generating helical
eddy currents in the coaxial magnetic
field around the moving conductor.
Eddy currents generate
heat due to resistance in the material where the
currents form. Eddy currents form around the moving
conductor, melting the surrounding
rock and creating magma chambers.
Lorentz Force, or the drag effect of a
moving conductor through a magnetic field,
which is a magnetic reaction in the opposing
direction, pushes volcanoes up on one side and
depresses the crust into the molten chamber on
the other, creating a trench at the trailing edge
of the moving conductor. There is no 
actual conductor, like a copper wire,
but it's the movement of a filament current, which
is moving in reaction to electromagnetic forces,
that burns and melts its way through the 
crust. Given that islands are to the inside of
the trench, the right hand rule indicates 
the Caribbean loop current ran
counterclockwise during formation of the Caribbean
plate. The movement of the current also dredges
seafloor, piling into non-volcanic
islands along its path, aided by
incomprehensible tsunamis. The violence of this
event cannot be overstated. Similar current
loops can be found at the horn of South
America and the Indonesian archipelago.
Evidence the current moved is also displayed in
the sinuous curves of the trench and island chains.
Note the image, where the filament dragged south, its
momentum amplified the eddy currents, heating the
crust to build the Cuban island chain along
an ”S”-shaped curve, before locking its
position in a straight line at Jamaica.
One of the likely reasons current loops
make these lateral moves is because the 
sides of the loop flow in opposite directions,
and the magnetic polarity of the
coaxial eddy currents are opposite
and attract, narrowing the loop like a hangman's
noose. The magnetic field attraction eventually
meets electric field repulsion from the opposing
current vectors, which snaps the current into
balance in parallel lines. The 
tip of the loop accumulates the
highest charge density, so even though
it's the region that moves the least,
its high potential burns neat little arcs of
volcanoes. The sinuous pattern shows how charge
density spread in longitudinal waves through
the moving filament as it met resistance.
It's similar to how tension and compression
travels in waves through a sealed spring.
It forms a sine curve, with the greatest
demand of volcanism, trenching
and dredging at the inflections, where momentum
changed greatest, amplifying the magnetic
induction of eddy currents. The 
deepest trenches show where the
current came to rest, and 
momentum suddenly decelerated to
zero, as an electromagnetic balance
was achieved across the loop structure.
Lateral current movements of this
type can be found all over the world.
The momentum change in the current produces
distinctive arcs of deep depressions and
volcanic island chains in the oceans.
On land, telltale lakes, mountain chains,
rivers, volcanoes and maar craters align themselves
in the same patterns. Where the Caribbean
Loop joins the Ring of Fire, the juncture is
called a “triple junction.” Triple junctions occur
at the plate boundaries. For instance, the Rivera
Triple Junction is where the Rivera Plate meets the
Eastern Pacific Rise. Triple junctions
are known hot spots for volcanic
and seismic activity and magnetic anomalies.
Since there are triple junctions along
the North American plate, it begs the question: are
there current loops connected to these junctions
beneath the continental plate? Let's examine North
America. The Ring of Fire is the obvious path of
a subsurface current because it forms a lineament
of volcanoes from Alaska to Central America.
There are three other major 
lineaments in North America's interior.
Yellowstone super-volcano is one end of a
curving lineament of volcanoes in a trend that
forms a part of the Snake River valley across
southern Idaho. To the south is a string
of volcanic fields called the Jemez lineament.
The Jemez lineament extends diagonally
from the Pinacate Volcanic field in Sonora,
Mexico, northeast across Arizona, to the border
between Colorado and New Mexico. It's bisected by
a northwest-to- southwest lineament of volcanoes
that include the San Francisco peaks and the
Uinkaret volcanoes on the North Rim of Grand Canyon.
With all of these plotted together on
one map, a pattern begins to emerge
that implies there's a current
loop beneath North America.
Plotted, the Jemez and San Francisco peak
volcanic lineaments produce an almost
perpendicular cross pattern,
juxtaposed symmetrically across the
Colorado Plateau from the volcanoes
of the Yellowstone complex
and aligned with the Ring of Fire. The Jemez 
lineament aims directly to the Guadalupe
Micro-plate to the southwest and to the
arc of the Great Lakes to the Northeast.
The loop appears to circle the Great
Lakes and points back to the Black Hills
in South Dakota, which appears to be an inflection
point. From there it points to the Juan de Fuca
plate in a direct line through Yellowstone.
It has a similar shape and size to the
Caribbean current loop, with the 
base of the loop wider than the
tip. Similar to the Caribbean Loop, there
is a significant depression at the tip.
In this case it's the Great Lakes, but they 
reside on the inside of the loop, whereas
ocean trenches are outside of the Caribbean 
Loop. And where the Caribbean Loop has
volcanic islands inside the curve of the loop,
the North American Loop has maar craters,
which is a type of volcanic action
forming a series of circular lakes
outside the arc of the Great Lakes.
Maars are volcanoes created by steam and
other gases exploding instead
of spewing ash and lava. Smaller
such expressions are known as
karsts and breccia pipes. They are all
forms of diatremes and are often mined
for uranium and precious metals,
which the eruption leaves behind in the throat of
the tube. The surface result is a crater instead
of a cinder cone and is typically filled with 
water. The implication is that the loop
current lies below aquifers that erupted in
steam, creating the maars. And that the volcanic
expression is to the outside of the loop,
depressions to the inside, so current circulates
north to south in this loop, opposite to the
Caribbean Loop. The shape of the Great Lakes,
especially Lake Superior, shows the
sinuous shape of ground current movement.
It appears the loop narrowed or swung to the
south until the southern leg aligned to the
Jemez Lineament. The Yellowstone
volcano lineament is a half-circle
and also appears to be from ground current 
movement. In this case, the movement appears to be
north from the Monterey Micro-plate
to the Juan de Fuca triple junction.
If so, this widened the base of the loop,
with the pivot point of the shift at the
Black Hills of South Dakota. Now, if I'm 
not telling you anything new here, try this!
The electrical structure of these small
loop currents and the junctions with large
polar loops like the Ring of Fire,
forms a circuit called an Operational
Amplifier, commonly called an Op-Amp. An 
Op-Amp is a type of current loop. But there is one
key ingredient to an Op-Amp that makes it
special: and that's a direct current or DC
connection to the loop, which 
amplifies the gain of output to input
current by as much as one hundred 
thousand. It can then be manipulated with
additional circuitry - resistance, inductance
and capacitance in various configurations -
to perform all kinds of tricks.
They can be made to oscillate,
amplify, or invert. Op-Amps are at
the heart of circuitry such as the old
Hewlett Packard calculator I used in college to
perform complex math. Op-Amps did the adding,
subtracting, multiplying, and dividing of my
inputs to give me outputs I needed to get a grade.
So, how does Nature insert this DC current
into the loop? With lightning. Lightning
strikes DC pulses into the ground, and 
in the environment we're exploring
lightning struck continuously. Long 
enough and powerful enough to draw
supersonic winds and matter to build
mountains, like the Black Hills of South Dakota
which is an inflection point in this 
loop. From that inflection point, the
Yellowstone volcano aligns with
lightning-generated mountains as Sacajawea Peak
and the Black Hills along this sub-surface
current path. If the Op-Amp needs a shot
of DC current, Nature organizes itself to provide
by stirring a storm that spits lightning in
the appropriate place, thereby fulfilling
its fractal pattern requirements.
It's Escher's hands. I won't go into detail
about how Op-Amps work. There are plenty of
books about them. But one attribute
certain Op-Amps have I want to point out.
Properly configured, the bridge between
triple junctions experiences a low,
almost zero current relative to the current
outside the junctions and in the loop.
This corresponds to the “bridge” region of the Ring
of Fire between the Mendocino Triple Junction and
the Guadalupe Micro-plate, where there 
is but a few sparsely spread volcanoes.
Compared to the Cascades and Olympics,
or the profusion of large volcanoes in Mexico,
only Mt. Shasta, Lassen, Mammoth and a few 
anemic lava flows fill out this bridge section. The
relatively low density and
magnitude of volcanoes is evidence
that current was restricted along this
bridge, just like in an Op-Amp. But the bigger
take on all this is that the Earth is a damn
computer. There's no other conclusion to draw when
there are Op-Amps all over the circuit,
clicking and switching currents around.
The Earth works as a coherent circuit.
It is a circuit within a bigger circuit
centered on the Sun. And it has circuits within
it, shaping the continents and weather. There is no
”butterfly effect”. A butterfly does
not stir 300 mph tornadoes. It is one of
the fallacies of modern science that leads
to accepting abstract and frivolous ideas.
There are fluctuations in signal strength
Earth receives from the solar system.
Earth is a ball of energy and matter and
when it gets extra energy, it stores some
in the matter. As Earth's balance with the solar
system oscillates, as it must, skin effects take
place as Earth's matter
absorbs and releases energy.
Those skin effects are geology and weather,
and they are driven by capacitance as
energy flows between Earth's
layers of matter. Ionization and
induced currents are the natural result.
We've been looking at the physical
evidence. There is nothing described in
these chapters that is implausible or
unscientific. In fact, it is what's
expected to see on a planet.
It's what physics predicts if the inquiry 
begins with the proper framework.
The next chapter will be the final one
for the Eye of the Storm project.
We'll summarize then and
draw some final conclusions.
Thank you.

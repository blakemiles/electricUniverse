All right good afternoon
and thank you too
for Dave Talbott and the rest of the
team for making this conference happen,
and for inviting me
to speak here today.
It's certainly an honor
to be here has a
long-standing supporter of the
Thunderbolts project,
and plasma universe
generally, and I'm hoping that what I
will say today will be able to make a
contribution to the ongoing development
of the electric universe
model which Wal
Thornhill and Monte Childs referred to
this morning. So here
we go as we've seen,
the electrical nature of the Sun is not
in doubt. But I would suggest that some
of the recent evidence doesn't seem to
fit our current model.
I want to look at
this anomalous evidence,
and speculate on
possible changes to the
model to account for it.
The basis of the EU model is the
work of Hannes Alfven and Ralf Juergens
who both argued that electric currents
are important in the solar system, but
they both had differing views on where
those currents flow.
Alfvén  suggested that the
Heliospheric current sheet
is part of a circuit
in the heliosphere.
Near the Sun the current splits into
north and south components, which then
flow along the meridians towards the
poles of the Sun.
Birkeland currents then
flow from each pole, and the Alfvén
circuit closes at some unspecified
distance from the Sun. The important
thing is that Alfvén's current does not
enter or leave the photosphere and the
direction of the current changes in
alternate solar cycles.
In contrast, Juergens
argued that the photosphere
is a region of anode
tufting and therefore
current must always be flowing through
the photosphere into
the body of the Sun,
which he identified as the anode. By
ecquating the sun's radiant output to
the electrical power,
and assuming a driving
potential of ten billion volts.
Juergens calculated that the inflowing
current is around four times ten to the
16 amps and according
to this model, the
anode sun receives charge which will
tend to neutralize it. A potential of
10 billion volts, if it was on the
surface of the Sun,
equates to a minimum
charge of about three-quarters of a
billion coulombs on
the Sun itself, which
is a very large charge to have
accumulated, but it's tiny compared to
the inflowing current.
And that means the
Sun would be discharged
in a very short time.
Now Juergens recognize this, and
originally postulated that the galaxy's
potential kept changing to maintain the
voltage differential between the anode
Sun and the galaxy.
But by 1979 Juergens
and Earle Milton between them had
developed a different model in which
electrons are simultaneously flowing in
through the tufts in
the photosphere and
out again between them. But they still
recognized that you had to deal with
this question of how the Sun doesn't
get discharged.
The current EU model modifies
that again, and we now
assume that the inflowing electron
current is balanced by positive
discharges from the coronal torus to
the photosphere. And as Wal Thornhill
said this morning,
these discharges appear as sunspots
in the photosphere.
In the heliosphere,
the inflowing electron
current powering the
Sun is assumed to drift slowly towards
the Sun under the influence of a very
low electric field,
like the current in a
Crookes tube. (And a Crooks tube is a
device for studying electricity and
plasma in the lab.) In
the revised Juergens
model the heliopause is assumed to be a
virtual cathode where most of the
voltage drop occurs.
Now there seemed to me to be two
questions relating to this model.
The first question is how we
reconcile of Juergens'
and Alfvén's circuits.
One involves a current flowing
in through the photosphere,
and the other does not.
So, Don Scott's diagram, which we saw
earlier, combines the
two ideas, and shows
the Alfven current entering the
photosphere at the
poles, and leaving at
the equator. Therefore, given that the
photosphere is presumed to be a region
of anode tufting, one
region should show
anode tufting, where the electron
current enters, but the other region
should not. But what I find puzzling is
that the photosphere completely
encircles the Sun. There doesn't appear
to be any difference between the polar
regions and the equatorial regions,
suggesting that the current doesn't
enter the photosphere and leave the
photosphere in quite
the way the diagram
suggests. So that's one puzzle.
The second
question is, whether the evidence
supports the model and
as I said, some of it
seems to contradict
Juergens' anode sun.
And I want to focus on that first.
We've seen that the balancing positive
charge is apparently delivered from the
coronal torus, and
creates sunspots as it
punches through the photosphere. But
there's a puzzle here too.
The torus forms
at solar minimum, when there are no
sunspots, and disappears
at solar maximum
as we see on the right, where sunspots
are the most numerous.
Now these two diagrams I'm
showing you, here are both
looking in the equatorial plane,
so they're not the same views as we saw
this morning, where the the encircling
photosphere /coronal torus diagram was
a view from the poles. These are both
photographs taken from the earth, so
they're in the equatorial plane.
The one
on the left is at sunspot minimum and
the one on the right is at sunspot
maximum. So the torus
comes and goes with
the cycle. And the model that suggests
that the sunspots are caused by
discharges from the torus is out of
step with when the torus
is actually there.
Now another problem is that the
source of the balancing positive charge
isn't explained.
Presumably protons must
come in from intergalactic space along
with the electrons, otherwise the
heliosphere would become negatively
charged.
But protons entering the heliosphere
seem to contradict the anode model.
If we now turn to the evidence for the
Juergens drift currents,
to get a current at all,
there needs to be an
electron drift relative
to the positive ions,
and we can estimate the relative
velocity of the electrons from their
known density and the
current we need to
generate. Now if all of the electrons
present at 1 AU radius
- that's the radius
of the Earth's orbit - if all of the
electrons are drifting
slowly towards the Sun,
they've got to have an average
drift velocity of 350 kilometers a
second to generate the current.
And that's almost the speed of the slow
solar wind away from the Sun.
Now I would have thought
that velocity should be
obvious in the spacecraft data but it's
very difficult to find it in the
published papers. The measured data
seem to indicate that
both the protons and
the electrons in the solar wind receive
additional energy as they get further
from the Sun. They're always getting
faster. So the protons are behaving as
expected, but not the electrons.
And we'll
look at one or two examples from the
literature to show this.
Here's the data
for electron temperatures
from Philips at all(1995).
The bottom black line shows the
expected adiabatic
expansion temperature
in the mainstream model. The other
colored lines show the electron
temperatures as actually measured by
various different missions
relative to a nominal
value of 1 at 1 AU
(just to show you the
shape of the curve).
And all the other lines show that the
electron temperature is decreasing more
slowly with distance than expected.
So something appears to be heating the
electrons as they get
further from the Sun.
And that's the wrong way around for
an anode Sun model. This plot from
Cranmer (2009) shows
proton and electron
temperatures in the fast solar wind
plotted against radial distance in the
data taken from the Helios and Ulysses
missions. The red dots show the protons
and the blue dots show the electrons.
Strangely, the electron temperature
branches beyond about
two AU radius. The
lower values clustered near the black
curve occurred at solar minimum but the
uptick of blue points you can see there
occurs at solar maximum. And that
shouldn't occur if the electrons are
being accelerated by an anode Sun, and
nor should the effect be dependent on
the solar cycle.
So let's look at the
electrons in more detail.
Štverák et al. (2009) tells
us that the electron
velocity distribution
functions observed
in the solar wind typically exhibit
three different components:
a core, a halo,
and a strahl population. The strahl
appears as a beam-like
population moving
away from the Sun along
the magnetic field.
Now in the figure the strahl
population is the white zone under the
starred curve to the right here.
And the
thermal core is a normal Maxwell
distribution. The non-thermal halo
populations are symmetrically
distributed non
maxwellian distributions.
The important point is that there is no
corresponding strahl population on the
left of the diagram, which is the part
moving towards the Sun, as you can see
from the velocity at the bottom is zero
in the middle. So these
are moving away.
There are no strahl electrons
moving towards the Sun over there. And
that seems to be clear evidence that
there are more electrons moving away
from the Sun faster than the protons,
because the baseline for these
measurements is the protons. So taken
together these various strands of
evidence seem to argue
against an anode Sun.
So when I got this far looking for
this evidence which I was expecting to
find and couldn't find, I then thought,
well, what evidence the
Juergens have. So I
went back to his 1972
paper - the original
one in which he
postulated the anode sun
model - and he started
off by saying,"The
dipole component of the solar magnetic
field can only be attributed to the
rotation of the charged Sun as a whole,
as Dr. Velikovsky pointed out more than
two decades ago".
The problem here is that the
dipole field of the Sun reverses every
cycle, but the rotation doesn't.
So that was a puzzle.
Juergens then refers to a
paper by Ogilvie et al.(1974)
apparently suggesting that electrons in
the solar wind are traveling away from
the Sun too slowly. And I've looked at
the original Ogilvie paper and this is
what it says. Ogilvie did find that
the electron heat flux values are
sufficiently low to require
modifications to the Spitzer-Harm
conductivity formula used in the Parker
disk model. But he also concluded a
detector measures a net electron flux
away from the solar direction.
Juergens then quoted a paper
by Lemaire et al. (1971) who
Juergens says have a
solar wind model that
claims better than average success in
squaring predictions with observations.
So what did they say?
Their conclusion was
that a voltage drop
of only 400 volts at around 6 solar
radii was all that was
needed to explain
the observations. And
that doesn't sound
like a 10 billion volt anode.
Juergens then quoted a paper by Gosling et al.
(1971) which he
claimed showed the constancy of the
solar wind during the solar cycle,
arguing that this demonstrated that the
energy could not come from inside the sun,
otherwise sunspot activity would
alter the output. Now Gosling's
paper did say that the
average speed was
remarkably constant. But he also stated
high speeds in excess of 550 km/s
were more commonly observed
near solar minimum than solar maximum.
And Gosling also demonstrated a very
good correlation between sunspot
activity, the electron corona radiance
and the ratio flux. So the sun's output
does vary with the
solar cycle after all,
Which means I find it hard to
understand how Juergens interpreted the
evidence that he quoted as support for
a 10 billion volt anode Sun.
Now I must re-emphasize
that the EU model
now says that the
voltage drop occurs at the heliopause,
not at the Sun itself. Now it is an
important change, but it doesn't get
around the fact that the 350 km/s
electron drift towards an anode Sun
is needed to power the radiant
output in the Juergens model.
Neither does
it solve the problem of fast strahl
electrons coming away from the Sun or
the electron heating further out. And
nor does it solved the problem of where
the supposed balancing charges supposed
to come from. So
altogether, I wonder, are
we trying to modify a theory, that was
flawed from the start?
So let's look at what the
evidence does actually tell us.
The solar wind seems to be evidence of
electrical activity. That's clear. But
we need to clear exactly what it is,
and where it's occurring.
The solar wind
itself consists mainly of protons and
electrons streaming away from the Sun.
The slow solar wind comes from the
equatorial regions, where the magnetic
field lines of the Sun are often looped
back into the Sun - so we see that
coronal mass ejections and similar
formations which loop back in. The fast
solar wind comes from the higher solar
latitudes, and especially
at solar minima
where coronal holes appear as dark
regions in the x-ray spectrum you can
see on the right here.
After leaving the
Sun, the fast solar
wind curves along the
magnetic field lines
towards the equator
from both poles,
eventually linking up to
form the heliosphere current sheet. And
this diagram from Coles
(1998) paper shows
the effect close in to the Sun.
A little
bit further out you'd
have also seen the
lines from the poles
dropping down to the equator.
Now this geometry is similar to the
geometry of the Alfvén current except
that it's not clear there's a
concentration of current
along the polar
axis. The situation seems to me to me
more like the proton emission in the
cigar galaxy shown in
the picture on the
right, where the protons are the red
explosion along - vaguely
along - the axes,
but not concentrated
along the axes. So the
question is, "What
accelerates the solar
wind?" Is it a small
electric field through the heliosphere,
or is it more local to the Sun? There's
evidence that the acceleration
takes place very close to
the Sun in astronomical terms, and I'll
just give you two examples from many in
the literature. Shapiro
in 2012 states that
the solar wind acceleration region is a
a dozen solar radii. And Frazin et al.
in 2003 states we know
that the O 5 plus
ions need to accelerate
somewhere before
3 AU. These and many similar
references appear to suggest that the
acceleration zone is close to the Sun,
and not spread throughout the
heliosphere. So let's look at the field
that the EU model predicts.
Now Wal Thornhill has made
the point that simple
electrostatics can't be applied to the
Crookes tube discharge model of the
heliosphere. The pith ball model on the
lower picture is the wrong model.
I agree.
The Crookes tube analogy suggests that
there's no space charge in the
heliosphere, but there is a shell of
positive charge at the
inner boundary of
the heliopause which
maintains the sun's
potential up to the heliopause and
outside this positive layer there's a
negative layer which is the virtual
cathode where most of
the potential drop
occurs. And in the model the electric
field from the anode Sun itself will
fall off with the inverse square of the
distance from the Sun giving a low
electric field within the heliopause as
required, but a high electric field
immediately adjacent to the Sun. If
you've got a charge on the Sun there
must be an electric field coming from
the body of the Sun itself, and then
outside that you have the heliopause
double-layer where the
main drop occurs,
but we can't get away
from the fact that
you need a potential drop near the Sun.
And this makes the
anode sun behave like
a double-layer, exactly
as we've seen in
the acceleration data.
So so far that's so good, but
it's more complicated than
that, because in the EU model there are
actually four separate
charged regions. The body of the sun is
an anode and in this
diagram the body of
the Sun is off to the
left here, and its
anode voltage is this intersection with
that axis on the left. The inner and
outer photo spheres are two layers a
positive charge, which you can see as
blue regions here,
causing the height of
this potential hill here, and then the
lower corona is a negative layer here,
which causes this steep potential drop
down here. As we've just seen from the
data, the data appears to indicate that
the acceleration is coming from this
steep potential drop here, as the model
suggests. But the
acceleration data which
is what we measure way out here
somewhere, can be
explained by this part
here. How do we know from the data that
you've got this extra layer here, and
you've got an anode Sun here? I find it
hard to see how we can interpret from
measurements out here what's going on
behind this double-layer here. So we've
got no direct evidence of the anode Sun
inside that steep double-layer.
Apart from causing the
charged layers out of
the heliopause, there appear to be two
main reasons why the anode Sun body is
necessary. The first is to drive the
in flowing current from galactic space,
and power the Sun. In
a Crookes tube, the
current is driven by the external
circuit. And that also
removes any charge
arriving at the anode, so you
don't have a charge balancing problem.
The second reason for having an anode
Sun relates to the control of the solar
wind by Don Scott's PNP transistor
analogy. And that model
assumes that the
ions in the anode Sun are trying to
escape, and so they
need to be restrained
by this potential hill here in the
photosphere. An
alteration of the height
of this hill here regulates the amount
of ions that are allowed to pass across
and reach this steep part here - the
double-layer - and that controls the
output of the double-layer, which we
measure out here as the solar wind.
Now without an anode Sun, an outwardly
directing double-layer,
consisting of the
outer photospere and
lower corona, would
accelerate the positive ions in exactly
the way we measure. But then how could
the control work if you don't have this
hill part between the anode and the
inner photosphere?
Well in the first place,
without an anode, there is no
excess of positive
ions trying to escape.
Any positive ions that are drifting
around here will be accelerated if they
get to the edge of this
hill, and they will
be accelerated down the potential hill,
if they approach the double-layer, but
they won't be being forced outwards
from an anode Sun if it isn't an anode.
And secondly, control
of the acceleration
is basically the control of the height
of this part of the hill here. And that
could be achieved equally well
either by the adjustment of the
voltage of the photosphere
here, that is,
the amount of charge
in these layers, or
slightly more subtly,
you could keep the
charge in the two layers the same, and
simply separate them -
physically separate
them - slightly further. And both
mechanisms would
increase the voltage, or
therefore the height of the hill, and
therefore the acceleration.
So just this
part - the double-layer
part here alone -
can provide the control mechanism.
Now I
wonder, is an anode Sun
necessary after all?
So, if there's a double-layer, without
an anode Sun inside it, what happens at
sunspots? The transistor
analogy suggests
that sunspots are holes
in the double-layer,
through which the positive ions can
leak out. But a problem with this model
is that the observed
motions of sunspots
appears to show that
matter is falling in.
For example, Newton in 1958 refers to
an always present slight downdraft of
hydrogen and calcium gas from the
chromosphere above the sunspot, falling
in. Also, sunspots are known to emit
electrons. We've already
seen Birkeland's
work presented a couple of times this
morning. Here's the
diagram you'll recognize.
Now in relation to this
diagram Birkeland
refers to the emission
of cathode rays from sunspots and
compares them to what he found
when his terrella was
the cathode, not the
anode. With slight magnetization on his
cathode glob, the rays came from the
equatorial regions,
which is the sunspot
belt, and they formed
groups, exactly like
sunspots do, as we see here in the
picture. And these rays - these cathode
rays in Birkeland terella - seem to be
analogous to the strahl electron beams
we've already seen.
In his recent interview
with Michael Goodspeed, Don
Scott pointed out the correlation
between sun spots in
the photosphere and
the bright x-ray
emission regions in the
chromosphere and corona above.
The x-ray emission stops
at higher latitudes,
where there are no sunspots. Now x-rays
are due to high-speed electrons
impacting neutral atoms.
So it seems that
the high temperature electrons causing
the X rays are coming
from the sunspots.
These factors all seem to point to a
source of high-energy electrons inside
the Sun, which need to be contained by
the double-layer, in contrast to the
containment of positive
ions in an anode
Sun. The double-layer would be the same
way around we've seen already, but it's
just containing electrons, not protons.
So why should there
be a double-layer at
all, if there's no anode body there to
cause it? It's well-known
the plasma also
forms a double-layer to separate areas
of plasma with different
properties, such
as temperature, or
degree of ionization.
And these types of double-layer are
current-free double-layers in contrast
to the current-carrying double-layers
formed in a Crookes tube.
And in essence,
that's the difference
I'm suggesting. The
anode Sun model requires a CCDL around
it, but plasma could generate a CFDL
cell boundary, without a charged anode.
And the particle acceleration in the
double-layer is similar in both cases.
But one type of double-layer is caused
by an externally driven current and the
other is not. So perhaps we should look
at what sort of plasma the Sun might
contain, which would
prompt the formation
of a current free douple-layer.
The recent interest in
fusion has led to the study of
plasmoids. This is an example here.
I'll show you after I
have a small drink.
Most fusion devices aim to create a
high temperature plasma which is
contained by external magnetic fields,
such as seen here in
the tokamak machine
near Oxford. However
there's a perfectly
good example of naturally occurring
self-contained plasmoids in nature and
that is ball lightning. And the recent
fusion research has looked at ball
lightning in an attempt to explain
what's going on in these lab machines.
I found two very good papers by Tsui
published in 2001 and 3 respectively
who demonstrated that there's a stable
force-free arrangement of currents in a
plasmoid when there
is the right balance
of toroidal and poloidal fields.
So that
means that a stable plasmoid is like a
Birkeland current wrapped around into a
closed loop. Now this force free form
occurs at all scales.
It's been suggested elsewhere that the
electron itself is a toroid and as we
heard this morning Wal Thornhill has
argued that there's a plasmoid at the
heart of the Milky Way and other
galaxies. So if we
accept that, it seems
possible that a plasmoid may be
contained inside the
Sun and other stars
as well. Now, this idea isn't new.
Alfvén argued that the
Sun was a pair of
toroidal rings. And this double ring
model explains the loops of
prominences on the Sun as escapes from
the toroids. Now,
perhaps that's why the
Paris Observatory
recently published the
similar image seen on the right,
something of an artist's
impression, but
at least they're adopting the model.
Now, Bostick's experiments in 1956
demonstrated that the Rings are formed
when a plasma gun discharges into a
magnetic field across
the field lines as
you see on the left.
Initially the plasmoids of tubular and
aligned along the field lines and then
develop into knots and eventually
into rings,
In contrast shown on the right.
Charles Bruce was convinced that ball
lightning is a result of ejection of
plasma from bends in
lightning discharge
channels, where the stretched magnetic
field allows highly energetic plasma to
escape from the main
lightning discharge
channel. Observations of naturally
occurring ball lightnings
seem to support
this view that is associated
with conventional lightning discharges.
Birkeland currents can also develop
bends due to what is known as the
kink instability. So
a plasmoid could be
formed at a kink instability in a
galactic Birkeland current without the
need for an artificial plasma gun.
Now if a star forms as
a plasmoid, it will
inevitably contain high temperature
electrons similar to
the tokamak devices,
and so we should expect
to see a CFDL form
around it to separate the two
plasma States. So I'd like to suggest
that there may be a plasmoid in the
center of the Sun and a CFDL around it.
Ionization would then occur in the
interaction region with the surrounding
plasma. The tufting in the
photosphere would be due to ions being
accelerated away because they got too
close to the double-layer.
And the electrons
would be drawn in against the electron
temperature gradient. Sunspots in
that case would be leaks of high
temperature electrons
like in the Birkeland
experiments, and the leak of
high-temperature electrons would
maintain the overall neutrality
of the plasmoid. The energy would come
from the energy contained in the
plasmoid which is
slowly leaking out, by
interaction with its environment, which
is similar to what we see in ball
lightning behavior. And the CFDL would
accelerate the solar wind away from the
Sun just like the CCDL in the anode
Sun model.
But the plasmoid CFDL model
avoids the problems
of the electrons not
behaving further out and it also avoids
the need for a balancing proton inflow
into an anode Sun. So
it solves a couple
of problems.
But if we replace the anode
Sun with a plasmoid Sun,
where does this leave
the Alfven current?
Well, I suggest that we leave
it exactly where it was,
with the one exception
that we touched on
earlier. The concentration
of the current
along the polar axis is not obvious in
the ulysses mission data.
It seems to be
more distributed and
therefore more like
the arrangement shown
here from Alfven's
1941 paper. In that
paper he argued that
the field aligned currents from the Sun
caused orbital rotation of the
heliospheric current sheet by the
Faraday motor mechanism. It seems as
though the Alfven current around a
plasmoid which is not energetically
producing axial Jets is primarily
concerned with rotation and transfer of
angular momentum not with
the processes going on
in the photosphere itself.
But if that's so, which
way is the momentum being
transferred? Recent evidence suggests ##############
that the corona is not
rotating the same
way as the photosphere, or in the same
way. It rotates in same
direction, but not
in the same manner. This graph from
Giordano 2008 shows the measurements of
the rotation period plotted against
latitude. And the parabolic curve shows
the differential rotation of the
photosphere for comparison. And the
puzzling aspect is that the corona does
not show differential rotation.
Also the
corona has a faster rotation. That is a
smaller period, than the photosphere at
higher latitudes. So
that says to me that
photosphere can't be
driving the corona.
It seems that it's the corona that's
linked to the Alfven Faraday motor.
But Alfven's mechanism
can work both ways.
And therefore it's possible that the
corona can
be driven by the heliospheric current
sheet. But, if so where could the
heliospheric current sheet motion come
from? The recent evidence from the IBEX
mission suggests that the heliosphere
sits in the center of a galactic
Birkeland current. And
it seems reasonable
to assume that the presence of the
heliosphere effects the
Birkeland current,
which either bulges around it as NASA
says shown on the left, or perhaps
pinches down onto it
as we might prefer.
Now we know that a
Birkeland current has
a radially varying
helicity which allows
each particle to follow the magnetic
field line at its own location. The
balance is maintained automatically
because if it is not
parallel to B at any
location, the cross-product
will generate a radial
force, which moves
the plasma back into alignment.
So suppose that the
heliosphere causes the
Birkeland current to
become misaligned at
the bulge or the pinch,
then some plasma
will be shifted radially into or out of
the heliosphere. If
it's incoming it will
still be carrying the spiraling current
which is carried mainly
by the electrons.
So the incoming electrons will have a
strong orbital velocity
component and an
inward radial drift in which the
electrons are moving faster than the
protons. Once inside the heliosphere we
would see this as the current in the
heliospheric current sheet, which
according to Alfven spirals in towards
the Sun in alternate cycles. The motion
of the heliosphere current sheet could
then drive the corona by the Alfven
mechanism in reverse.
During the other cycle, when the sun's
magnetic field is reversed, but the
rotation remains the same, the radial
component of the current must reverse
and flow back out. And it may be during
that phase the corona is driving the
heliospheric current sheet.
So it seems possible that
the solar cycle is due to
the galactic current bleeding into the
solar system in one cycle and leaking
back out again in the next.
And Don Scott has recently
referred to a paper by Decker published
in Nature in September 2012. Decker
reported that contrary to NASA's models
Voyager 1 had measured zero north-south
plasma flow near the heliopause. And
instead they found an
unexpected totally
unexpected east-west ion flow plus a
continued radial drift.
So already there seems to be some
evidence for the suggested interaction
between the heliosphere
and the Birkeland
current. So to summarize I suggest that
the evidence does not seem to support
Juergen anode Sun but
it's more in favor
of a CFDL near the Sun and this may be
a result of normal
plasma cell formation
around a force-free
plasmoid which could
have been formed by discharge from a
kink instability in the original
galactic Birkeland current. The energy
would come from the plasmoid similar to
ball lightning and caused ionization of
the plasma next to it.
The DL accelerates
the islands and draws
in electrons until
there's an imbalance when
high-temperature electrons escape fire
holes in the DL which
we see as sunspots.
The role of the Alfven circuit seems to
be largely rotational transferring
momentum between the corona and the HTS
and exchanging electromagnetic and
kinetic energy during the solar cycles.
The coronal torus does store part of
that energy during the cycle.
The primary
driver for coronal rotation in may then
be the galactic Birkeland
current leading
into the heliopause
due to misalignment at a pinch or bulge
around the heliosphere.
And oscillations
of the misalignment might cause the
saivors cycle but is it right? I don't
know we need more evidence.
I do suggest that the
forthcoming SAFIRE
experiment should keep an open mind as
to whether the Sun is an anode or not.
And I think the Thunderbolts project
either has to find convincing evidence
for a drift current towards the Sun and
a better means of maintaining the anode
voltage or perhaps we have to consider
abandoning the anode. Electricity is
undoubtedly the key,
but how and where it
flows is uncertain. But the good news
is there's still plenty
of physics to be
sorted out and I think it's exciting to
be involved in the
search for answers. I
hope you agree because there's a role
here for anyone who's interested.
Thank you for listening.

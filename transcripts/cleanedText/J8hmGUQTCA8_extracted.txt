Welcome to the Electricity of Life, brought to you
by the Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info
In the 21st century, scientific discovery
routinely forces a new perspective on
the nature of reality, including physical
phenomena at every scale in the cosmos.
One of the strangest beliefs in
cosmology is that celestial bodies exist
in isolation, with no connection or
influence on one another. However, today
our most powerful telescopes reveal
astonishing networks of plasma filaments
which connect stars and galaxies across
unfathomable distances. It's been said
that no man is an island and likewise,
in our Electric Universe, no islands exist
in space. For generations,
a similar strange belief about the human
body has prevailed in the world of
Western medicine. Specialization means
treating each organ and part of the body
as a separate isolated instrument and
just as finer technological data reveals
the connectedness of the most distant
celestial objects, today, mainstream
medicine increasingly recognizes the
basis for a more integrative approach
to human health. Just as an electrical
circuitry connects distant celestial
objects, the electrical circuitry of the
body is a stupendous, complex network
central to life. One of the leading
pioneers in integrative health is Dr.
Jerry Tennant, a world-renowned
ophthalmologist whose book series
”Healing is Voltage” describes his
groundbreaking research into the body's
circuitry. Recently, Dr. Tennant offered a
series of presentations as part of a
continuing medical education class for
Naturopathic Doctors in Arizona.
Dr. Tennant and his group have kindly
granted us permission to share these
presentations in a series of videos.
In this introductory episode, Dr. Tennant
begins with a remarkable summary of his
personal and professional journey. To

This is Dr. Jerry Tennant. I'd like to

in bio geometry. So, I was trained as an
ophthalmologist and had a great deal of
enjoyment and fun, and in doing so I was
able to do a lot of different things in
ophthalmology but one of the things that
I did was to do the majority of the
research for the laser from the company
called Visx used in Lasik surgery.
So, as an ophthalmologist, I was able to
accomplish many of the things that
people strive to do. I was successful in
my efforts as an ophthalmologist. I
changed the way ophthalmology is
practiced by introducing and helping to
develop the techniques for outpatient
eye surgery. I developed intraocular
lenses that were widely used in eyes
after cataract surgery, and one of the
things that I was able to do was the
majority, as I mentioned, of research for
the laser used in Lasik surgery. So, one
of the problems was that we didn't
recognize that the laser wouldn't kill
viruses, and so I treated a gentleman
from Europe who had leukemia and also
had scarring in his cornea, and I used
the laser to carve the scar off his
cornea. What we didn't understand at
the time was that the laser would not kill
viruses and as the viruses escaped his
cornea, they went up through my mask,
through my nose and into my brain, and I
developed encephalitis. That resulted in
me having overwhelming fatigue. I got to
the place where I could see a patient, I
knew what was wrong with him, but I
couldn't remember how to write a
prescription.
Also, I developed spastic movements, which
doesn't work really well if you're
operating inside somebody's eyeball. And
I came to the place that I could
only have two or three hours a day in
which I could think clearly enough to
understand the newspaper. Otherwise, I spent
about 16 hours a day sleeping. I also
had a bleeding disorder and had some
bleeding under my skin. If you'll notice
the picture with the dogs, you'll see
that I had viruses in my brain and
viruses in my spleen, and these two dogs
seem to understand where my problems
were. So, the brown dog, Teager, would
always come and lay on my head, and
the Hawaii dog, Poo, would come and
curl up next to my spleen. So, I always
considered these two dogs the original
bio modulators. So, as you can see in the
image of me, I was robust and had a great
life, but then slowly over time, as you
can see, I began to fade away and where I
was basically totally dysfunctional.
I eventually figured out that the
difference between peak performance
and death was voltage. So, in the
two or three hours a day I could think,
I began to read cellular biology books
with the concept that, if I could figure
out how to one make one cell work, I
could figure out how to make them all
work. Because after all cells look
different but they really have the same
hardware, just different software. And in
all of the cellular biology books I
began to realize that cells had to have
voltage to work. So, for a moment let's
look at the concept of regeneration
versus healing. If I cut myself with a
knife, then the skin will heal, leaving
behind perhaps a small scar. On
the other hand, if I cut off a finger,
but that finger actually regrows,
then that's called regeneration. And
regeneration is controlled by voltage. So,
the purpose of this lecture, among others
is to focus on the role of voltage in
stem cell function, along with exosomes
and recovery from chronic disease. This
subject cannot be adequately covered in
the few minutes we have allotted, but it
is hoped that this lecture will focus your
attention on its role so you will want to
learn more. Now the foundation work of
this subject was done by Robert Becker and
by Dr. Bjorn Nordstrom. Becker wrote the
book “The Body Electric”, Nordstrom wrote
the book “Biologically Closed Electric
Circuits”. So each of us, working in this
field, are standing on the shoulders of
these pioneers. So, in Becker's
work, he was interested in
the subject of, if a human loses a piece
of bone, they grow more bone, but if they
lose another body part, it's replaced
with scar. And he wondered why that was.
Why is it that the human can make bone,
but has difficulty replacing other
organs. So, to study this, he used the
salamander. The salamander has
essentially the same anatomy as the
human, that is the same number of bones,
muscles and nerves and in the same
arrangement. But unlike the human, the
salamander is capable of growing an exact
replacement of an arm, leg, eye, ear, up
to a third of its brain, almost all of
its digestive tract and up to half of its
heart. A salamander is so efficient at
regeneration, that it does not get cancer.
The regeneration of the salamander
cannot be explained by chemical-
mechanistic views of traditional
medicine. So, Becker studied the
salamander by studying its voltage
patterns. So, he found that, if you cut off
the salamander’s arm, then over the next days,
it would actually grow a new arm. So, a
salamander’s base voltage is minus 10
millivolts, compared to a human which is
minus 25 millivolts, as we'll discuss
later. As the arm is amputated, the
voltage drops to approximately plus 25
millivolts of “electron stealer”. So again,
it goes from minus 10 millivolts of
electron donor, to plus 25 millivolts of
electron stealer. Then, as
the voltage begins to recover,
and as it does so, it eventually gets up
to minus 30 millivolts of electron donor.
And as this occurs, then stem cells are
formed and the salamander grows a
new arm in somewhere around 25 to 30
days. Now, Becker found that, after you
amputate the arm, the skin grows over the
stump and then at somewhere around a
week or so, stem cells begin to
accumulate in the stump and by two weeks
or so, there is a large number of stem
cells. And then by three weeks, the arm is
beginning to regrow and somewhere in
the neighborhood of day 25 or so, the
hand begins to form. Now, he found some
other very interesting things. So, if he
amputated the arm and waited until the
stem cells formed and he extracted those
and made an incision
somewhere else in the body,
the salamander would grow whatever the
local area was. So, for example, if he
amputated an arm, early on extracted
the stem cells, made a slit by the
salamander’s hind leg and put the stem
cells in there, it would grow another
hind leg from those stem cells. On the
other hand, if he waited until the stem
cells were more mature, before he
extracted them, it was totally different.
So, he amputated the arm, he waits till
the stem cells are somewhat matured,
extracts them, makes an incision on the
top of the salamander’s head and puts
them in there,
the salamander will grow an arm at the
top of his head. So, what became obvious
is that early on, the stem cells had not
been programmed into what they were to
become, and wherever you put them, they
would become or regenerate one of those
body parts. On the other hand, if you left
them a bit longer, they would be
programmed to become what they were
locally, and then when you extracted them
and put them elsewhere, they would
continue to grow that organ. Now, in the
lower right picture, you see an image of
a dog that was on the news recently, who
had a tail growing out from between his
eyebrows. And of course, they didn't seem
to understand how this could happen, but
looking at Becker's work, it's quite
obvious. The stem cells from this dog's
tail had been programmed to grow another
tail, but somehow got moved and inserted
between his eyes, and thus grew a tail
there. In this image, we see an amputation
of a salamander’s arm at 48 hours, and
you can see the bone sticking out the end.
You can see the skin and the muscles
have retracted somewhat. Here at 18 days,
you can see the stem cells that are
quite prominent. This is a collection
of stem cells that are called a blastema,
and you can see, begin to see, the
differentiation of the muscle cells.
Here at 42 days, the limb pattern is
completely restored and as the
salamander continues to grow the new
arm. Now, this is an image of a young boy
who was a passenger on a four-wheeler;
the driver of the four-wheeler turned it
too sharply and actually caused the
four-wheeler to roll, resulting in this
injury. This boy was taken to the
hospital, then taken to surgery
and the wound was cleaned up.
The surgeons felt that this was going
to require attention by the plastic
surgeons, and that perhaps that recovery
would be difficult. I received a call
from his father, and he sent me a picture
that you saw. So, I quickly sent him a bio
transducer and a bio modulator which,
of course, that bio transducer puts out
scalar energy and the bio modulator puts
out electromagnetic energy. The boy had
been crying constantly since his injury,
in spite of the narcotics that they were
giving him. Within minutes, after they
placed the devices in this position as
you can see, the boy quit crying. The
following day, he was taken back to
surgery and the plastic surgeon
showed up. But the general
surgeons were able to close this
primarily without a skin graft. And the
plastic surgeons were saying, “so, why are
we here?” as they left the operating room.
Well the picture on the right is a
recent photograph of this boy's foot. You
can see that it healed quite well.
And this boy now can play soccer and
football, and has no apparent symptoms
that he ever had this injury. So, to some
degree you will have to acknowledge that
this was, in some regards, regeneration as
well as improved healing, by
restoring the voltage to the area.
So, you must realize that the human body
is an electronic device. Now, any cellular
biology book will tell you that cells
are designed to run at a pH of
7.35 to 7.45. pH is
actually the measurement of
voltage in a solution. So, if you have
a copper wire, if the switch is on,
electrons flow through it and if you
turn the switch off, they do not. And
that's called conductive electricity.
But a liquid is completely different, and
that is, a liquid has the ability to be
either an electron donor, or an electron
stealer. And so, if you take a pH meter,
which is a type of sophisticated
voltmeter, it has a switch in which you
can measure in millivolts or you can
measure in pH. So, by convention, if the
liquid is an electron stealer, you put a
plus sign in front of the voltage and if
it's an electron donor, you put a minus
sign in front of it and then you convert
it to a logarithmic scale that goes from
zero to 14. So, plus 400 millivolts of
electron stealer is the same as a pH
of 0, and minus 400 millivolts of
electron donor is the same as a pH of 14.
if it's neither electron
donor nor an electron stealer,
it's a pH of 7. Now, I mentioned that
all cellular biology books will tell you
that cells are designed to
run at a pH of 7.35 to 7.45.
So, 7.35 is synonym
of -20 millivolts of
electron donor, and 7.45 is
synonym of  -25 millivolts of
electron donor. So, what you see is that
cells are designed to run between minus
20 and minus 25 millivolts. Now, some
people get confused because, if you
take a cell and put it into a petri
dish, and put an electrode inside the
cell, and another outside the cell, and
measure the voltage across the cell
membrane, you'll get
about minus 90 millivolts.
However the environment in which cells
are designed to run, is between minus 20
and minus 25 millivolts. So, cells
need minus 25 millivolts to run
correctly, and minus 50 millivolts to
make new cells. So, this leads us to
understand that all chronic disease is
characterized by having inadequate
voltage. Let me say that one more time,
all chronic disease is characterized by
having inadequate voltage. Now, the
other thing that's important to realize in
understanding chronic disease, is that
we're constantly wearing ourselves out
and having to make new cells. So,
different sources have slightly
different times, because studies are
based on tissue turnover time from
natural stable isotope labeling, which
varies according to bomb testing and
other environmental factors. However,
in general you will find that you get new
cells in the macula of your eye every
48 hours; the lining of your guts is
replaced every 3 days; your skin is 6
weeks old; your liver is 8 weeks old; your
nervous system is between
8 and 12 months old,
etc. So, what's critical to understand is
that chronic disease only occurs when we
lose the ability to make new cells that
work. So, let me say that one more time:
chronic disease only occurs when we lose
the ability to make new cells that work.
So what's it take to make new cells that
work. Well, as I mentioned, cells run at
minus 25 millivolts, but it requires
minus 50 millivolts to make new cells.
And as we also pointed out, if you measure
across a cell membrane and a petri dish,
you'll get about minus 90 millivolts. So,
we need to make new cells, we need minus
50 millivolts, but we also need all of
the materials that are necessary to make
new cells. This is called “nutrition” and
requires a functional digestive system,
including stomach acid. And finally, we
must deal with any toxins that destroy
cells as fast as we make them. The most
common toxins are heavy metals like
mercury, dental toxins, GMO foods with
pesticide, called Roundup or glyphosate.
So, what's the body's voltage and wiring
system? Well the body has five battery
packs. The most important that are
perhaps, or at least the largest, is our
muscles. Our muscles are rechargeable
batteries and the fascia around the
muscles serves as the body's wiring
system. Our cell membranes are small
batteries called “capacitors”. Water inside
the cell membrane is called EZ water,
which is H3O2 - and it's an electron
donor form of water. Inside the
mitochondria we have a rechargeable
battery system called “ADP/ATP” and then
finally our DNA has its own battery,
using scalar energy. So, this diagram was
sent to me by Dr. Al-Tubaikh, who is
also a medical artist and I'm grateful
for his sending this to me. What one sees
here, is that we have the muscle battery
packs. So, one must understand that the
muscles are piezoelectric. So, what does
that funny word mean? If you take a piece
of quartz and you squeeze it with a pair
of pliers, it emits electrons. So, the
process of distorting something and
causing it to emit electrons, is
called piezoelectricity. So, one of the
reasons that we exercise, is that doing
so causes the muscles to emit electrons.
Our muscles are rechargeable batteries
as well, and so every time we exercise, we
are actually recharging our muscle
battery packs. Now in addition, our
muscles are stacked one on top of each
other in a very specific order to create
a battery pack. And it's that pack of our
stack of muscle batteries is surrounded
by a stocking of fascia and thus this
stack of muscle batteries and fascia
creates the muscle battery pack for
every organ, that is to say, every organ
in the body has its own battery pack,
and such a pack of muscles is called an
acupuncture meridian. Now, each
acupuncture meridian extends from a leg
to the brain, or an arm to the brain, and
then makes a loop and comes back to near
its origin. So, these large muscles then
are acupuncture circuits, [they] are the
major battery for all of our organs. Now,
each of these circuits runs through very
specific teeth and thus our teeth are an
integrated part of every circuit. As the
voltage from the muscle battery packs
gets to the cell membranes, we have
another battery pack here, or a
battery that is called a capacitor, and
that's the cell membrane. Now, if you
take an electron conductor and a second
electron conductor, and separate them by
an insulator, you have what's called a
capacitor. A capacitor is actually a type
of small battery; the difference is that
a regular battery can discharge
electrons slowly, whereas if a capacitor
is asked to deliver electrons,
it empties itself and
so it then has to recharge. Well, our cell
membranes are made by opposing pairs of
specific types of phospholipids, that
have a ball on one end and two legs on
the other. The balls are electron
conductors and the legs are electron
insulators and thus they form a
capacitor. So, we have our muscle battery
packs, then we have the cell membrane,
which is a capacitor or a small battery,
and just inside the cell membrane we
have what's called EZ water, which I will
explain more about in just a moment, and
then we have our mitochondria. Now, inside
the mitochondria we have a rechargeable
battery system; when the battery's
discharged, it's called ADP and when it's
charged is called ATP. And then finally
we have the DNA, which has its own power
system in that scalar energy inflows
into the center of the DNA to give it
its voltage. So, here we see a diagram of
the EZ water; EZ stands for “Exclusion
Zone” and so, you can see in the upper
image on the right, the EZ zone
is thinner and if you expose it to
specifically, infrared light, it expands
into a larger battery pack, if you please.
Next, we have the DNA battery.
So, the characteristics of DNA was first
elucidated by Rosalind Franklin in 1952.
Her work was stolen by Watson and Crick
and they received a Nobel Prize
for the technology that they took
from Dr. Franklin. Nevertheless, you
can see on the left her original picture,
photographing the DNA from within. Now
most pictures of DNA that you see are
from the side, but when you look
at it from the end, you can see its
torsional pattern and also the hole down
through the center. So, scalar energy
implodes down through this hole or canal
in the center of DNA to energize it,
because scalar energy will implode
into anything that's golden mean,
and certainly DNA is golden mean. Now,
the scalar energy as it implodes into
the DNA, is capable of reading the code
there. It's capable of transmitting that
code to a new cell, if a cell division
occurs. It's also capable of
communicating with nearby cells, through
the use of the scalar energy. This work
has been recently published by
Konstantin Miele, a physician/
physicists in Germany. Now, let's look a
bit at the voltage oxygen control
mechanisms. So, if we look at the fetus,
everyone understands that there is the
umbilical cord that comes from mother,
providing blood and nutrition to the
growing fetus. But it's important to know
that this umbilical cord also brings
voltage into the fetus. Now, as you can
see, the fetus has very little room for
exercising inside the uterus, and thus
the normal mechanism of charging our
muscle battery packs is impractical
in a fetus, that is in the process of
growing its muscle battery packs
and acupuncture wiring system, and
there's just not room for that. Well,
at the time of birth, a string is tied
around the umbilical cord and it is cut,
so that it leaves the new baby free from
the umbilical cord. This then
scars over on the end and
becomes our umbilicus. Now, it's at this
point when the umbilical cord is cut,
that the baby switches from this fetal
or original wiring system, to the muscle
battery pack acupuncture system. Now, here
you can see that surrounding the blood
vessels, we have a fibrous sheath and
this fibrous sheath, like the fascia, is
capable of acting as a wiring system
and moving electrons from place to place.
So, one of the things you should
remember is that around our blood
vessels and also surrounding our muscle
battery packs, we have this fibrous
connective tissue. Around the muscle
battery packs, it's called fascia
and it has a different name around the
the arteries and veins
called tunica adventitia. An
important thing to know is that these
structures are semiconductors. So, what's
a semiconductor? A semiconductor is a
collection of molecules, arranged in such
a way that electrons flow through them
at the speed of light, but only in one
direction. So, understanding that, helps us
understand how the body can quickly move
electrons from one place to the other.
For example, if you put an essential oil
on the foot, the frequencies of those
are in the brain at the speed of light,
because those frequencies travel through
the fasciae which is a semiconductor. Now,
in the fetus, as you can see, then we
have this wiring system going to all of the
organs and in this slide you can see how
that works. So, it goes from the placenta
through the umbilical cord, to basically
every organ in the body, using the
semiconductor of the tissue
around the vessels. Now, because the
umbilicus scars, where it was cut
from the umbilical cord, it is blocked;
electrons cannot flow through there.
However if you simply put the bio
transducer with its scalar energy over
the umbilicus, what you will find is that
it reorganizes the scar as we'll discuss
later and once it does so, electrons can
now flow through it, and so now we
are capable of again using the original
fetal wiring system. So, when you open
this system, now you have access to that
original wiring system that goes to
every cell in the body. One of the
reasons that this is important and
useful, is that this system is rarely
blocked, whereas muscle battery packs can
be blocked by scars, dental infections,
emotions, etc.

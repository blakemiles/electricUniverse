Hello. I wanted to give a short tutorial on how I go about
analyzing images. A friend of mine sent me a link to an
image from the James Webb Space Telescope. As I was
playing around with it, I thought this would be a good
opportunity to give a little demo. OK, so enjoy.
And here is the Webb page that my friend sent me.
James Webb reveals complex galactic structures.
Look at that, that is incredible. This is apparently a galaxy,
just looking at the caption here, IC 5332. That's a
catalog number for galaxies. So, I'm going to copy that,
and I'm going to go to one of my go-to applications for
looking at telescope data, which is this sky.esa.int.
It combines telescope data across a very wide range
of telescopes. Very easy, very good interface to use.
Right now, we're looking at the Crab Nebula. When you launch
it up, it'll [shows you things to choose from]. So that's the
Crab Nebula. Look over here on the left.
This is the layers you can put on top of each other.
We're looking at an optical image, DSS2 which is the
Digital Sky Survey number two, in color. But we can choose
different telescopes. Look at that. All those choices; those
are all optical telescopes. HST is Hubble. Let's see if
there's a Hubble image of this. That might be good
for later research. Good raw data. Okay, nothing
that's beautiful from Hubble on this one. So, let's 
go back where we were on digital Sky Survey. Let's
add on a new row, say in the near infrared. Oh, that's nice.
How about the mid infrared, “Oh look at that!.” OK, so
we're going to do a near infrared and then I'm
going to add also a new row of far infrared.
OK. [excitement] You can change the opacity.
So, I can blend the images. This is
one of the great things about this tool, you can blend the
images from different wavelengths and different telescopes.
We're looking at one object here, the Crab Nebula.
We're looking at it in different wavelengths
captured by different telescopes, and we're 
blending across the telescopes to give us a
fuller view of this mysterious thing that we are looking at.
OK. Got a little sidetrack there. Let's go to the
IC 5332. That was what we started with here.
So, I'm going to type in IC 5332.
(Oops, I got an editing problem here, it's going to say
nothing there) ... And there is the galaxy that is the
subject of this video - IC 5332, it's coming 
up. An optical telescope Digital Sky Survey
Cool, I'm just going to zoom out a little bit. (Just for 
the heck of it, let's just see what else we got here.
We can see this in near infrared, a little bit, 
not much). There's different telescopes one can
choose; not all telescopes have all the data on here.
You're not guaranteed to find a picture of this
in any other wavelength. I'm just showing that
you can choose different wavelengths. Okay, so
there's the object in question. You'll notice up here
there's a couple of icons for Hubble and for James Webb.
Hubble and James Webb have both made the effort to 
put some of their specialty images, high quality images,
into this tool. it's not the best integration, but it 
certainly is worth using. So, I'm going to click on the
James Webb version, since that's where this all 
started. It knows that I'm looking at this part of the
sky. It calls up the pictures that I want. Let's look at
this one. Webb, I see, yeah that's it. That's the one,
right? That's the one that we started with. There 
it is. Now the blending, it's awkward with these
James Webb and Hubble specialty images. You don't get
to do everything you want. So, what I'm going to do,
is take this image and put it into another tool, to do my
own blending with it. I'm going to zoom in a bit, so that I
can get rid of those boxes. There we go, and I'm going
to zoom in - nice big image - and on the upper right
hand here, take a screenshot and you can 
download this image (I already did it), so I'm just
going to say, you can download the image,
save it to your computer and then I'm
going to look at a the Hubble version of this. So, there's 
the Hubble one. It's amazing, right? And then I can
save the Hubble version of this, download that.
Now I want to blend them. You can use
Photoshop - I don't have photoshop on this computer - so
they go to ’Online Image Editing Tool’. This one [Photopea]
(I don't know how to pronounce it - ’photopia’?) I'm
going to load up, one image. Say put Hubble first,
IC 5332 Hubble Space Telescope. Open that.
There it is! Oops. Just want to zoom in.
There we go, and now I'm going to open up
the James Webb, but I open it in place,
so that they can be layers. So they can
be on the same image, but just layers of
the same image. So, open the James Webb. All right.
so now you can see over here. Here's the layers.
We have the Hubble and then we have the James 
Webb beneath it - I'm just toggling the visibility here -
of the top layer. Let me rename that. That is IC 5332 Hubble
Space Telescope, so I can keep track here. When you blend...
there's a lot of ways to blend, and
the simplest is with ‘opacity’ or ‘fill’ for
these images. They're basically the same option. So, 
opacity - I'm going to toggle the opacity of the top layer,
which is the Hubble Space Telescope. That's kind of 
awkward. How it's blending out the blacks there. Let me try
switching the order - see if it matters. Opacity, that's
better. So, there was something weird going on there with
having the one image on top versus the other. I don't know
what it is, don't really care right now. I think it had
something to do with how the zero pixel was being stored.
Okay, back to the project. The top image is the
James Webb. I'm going to toggle the opacity and you can
see there's the Hubble, there's the James Webb. There's
the Hubble, there's your James Webb.
And the human visual system is very advanced,
and it will start putting things together 
for you, if you give it information and
let it do its job. Wow! So, what I'm seeing - which I didn't
even notice till now - is on the Hubble there are these
dark areas. Wow! Didn't even notice those.
Look at all those dark areas and what do
you want to bet that those are exactly where the James
Webb is bright. So, we got to choose some features and
check it out. Like right around here,
See this orange thing here. You see
like an S-shaped ‘wiggle – wiggle’ dark lane. Let's see
if that ‘wiggle – wiggle’ dark lane... Yeah, pretty much.
Okay, it's not a hundred percent, but clearly, like up
here, let's look up here. There's nothing in the James Webb
there, it's a dark area with the James Webb.
What does Hubble give us? Yep, that is a
very clear image for the Hubble - it almost reminds
me of the Nautilus shells, when you cut them,
and they have the chambers in them. This reminds me 
of that. That kind of segregation. So, segregation
in the plasma world is... It's a very elaborate 
complex thing. Plasma does it very well. You can see...
There's these very well-defined boundaries.
I'll zoom in on one of these boundaries here. Now.
Oh, no back up. Hey, I want to zoom in. Well anyway.
Those boundaries are a clear delineation of energy
levels - a very sharp delineation of composition.
So, whatever is along this thin line here,
is a very different energy and composition than
what's over here in this dark area. And that kind of
segregation is everywhere in the plasma
universe. It's everywhere in biology too,
frankly. You know the body is segregated into ...
The muscles are in bundles; the nerves have their own
segregation; the nerves go on their own channels, 
etc. Okay. Well, that was really it. I am done
with the little demo. I'm just going to keep
playing with this, and hope you enjoy it. Bye.

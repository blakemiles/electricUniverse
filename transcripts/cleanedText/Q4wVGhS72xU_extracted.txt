Welcome to Space News from the Electric
Universe brought to you by The
Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info
In Part 1 of this two-part
presentation, Dr. Raymond Gallucci began
his independent mathematical analysis of
cosmological alternatives to the
standard interpretations of cosmic
redshift. For many decades, astronomers
have believed that cosmological redshift
indicates “stretching” of light in an 
expanding universe. The higher an
object’s redshift, the farther away it is
from our perspective on Earth. However, as
we've reported exhaustively on this
series, an imposing body of scientific
research contradicts that perspective.
Today, Dr. Gallucci concludes his
analysis on the mathematical
plausibility of the respective
alternative redshift explanations by
scientists Halton ARP and C-C Su. Now, let me
switch over to the quantization concept
and I'll now read from quotations from
Halton ARP’s talk given to the Kronia
group at the conference in Portland in
Oregon 2000. He was talking about his
theory on intrinsic redshift. “in the
early 1950s, they saw thin connections
between galaxies and radio lobes, going
from the central galaxy out to the
radio lobes on either side. This material
is actually being ejected; that's about
the only way you could get this
configuration. if the galaxy is going to
eject something, it's going to eject
along the path of least resistance, which
is out the poles of the galaxy. You have
this nice relationship that, as the
quasars proceed out as time goes past,
they age and drop, in preferred
quantized redshifts. What I, Halton Arp,
have interpreted this to mean, is that
these quasars move out, evolving to low
redshift.” And if you look at the various
videos or some of the websites, or even
the books that Halton Arp has
published, he has some very nice
pictures that show galaxies, apparent
galaxies with a series of smaller
galaxies at various distances from
the galaxy, with these
quantized redshifts. So, if we look at the
regression fits that I had back in slide
10, again there were five
regression fits of which three I
selected as being possible contenders
for calculation for quantization. What I
have here, I have the five observed redshift
peaks, their time increments. Again,
the redshift drops as the time, or the
distance, increases. So, you'll see that
the time increments go from 5 down to 1,
while the Z-peaks go from 0.3 up
to 1.96. I then took the three best
regression fits; the first was a function
of the square root of the mass ratio
again, the mass of the quasar or
QSO, to the mass of the Sun. The second
fit was based on the natural log of the
ratio; and the third was based on the
ratio to the two-thirds power. And I
calculated the mass ratios that would
come from these formulas. And their
average is shown in the rightmost column.
So, those are the
QSO mass ratios for the various
Z-peaks and the text there reads, “From the
three best regression fits, estimate the
QSO mass at each of the main five
redshift peaks. If there is a quantization
phenomenon as the QSO is
ejected and travels outward, with
redshift decreasing in specific
increments (these are increments of time or
distance), we expect some relationship
between redshift, and therefore mass, of
the QSO with time and/or distance. With
time or distance increment 1 being
associated with the newly ejected QSO
(that's shown as time increment 1), it
has a redshift of 1.96, a scaled mass,
mass ratio of about 2E+9 It's the
largest redshift and it's also
the largest mass, and increment 5
associated with the oldest
QSO; that's shown in the first row,
that's the redshift of 0.3, the scaled
mass of 1.65E+8, about a
factor of 10 lower.
So again, Arp's theory is that as the
QSOs are ejected, they travel outward
from the parent galaxy and their
redshifts drop with time, which is the
same as with distance, as their mass
decreases. Now again, going back to the
previous slide, I'm going to do another
regression, using the average mass ratio
in the rightmost column, at the various
time increments 5-4-3-2-1,
which are analogous to distance increments.
You can see the results there,
on the graph we have the mass as it’s
scaled to the mass of the Sun, versus time
or distance increment. And again, I had
five regression fits; the exponential in
purple fits the data best, passing
through all the quantized values. The
natural log in blue as nearly as good;
the inverse time shown in green is
slightly weaker, but it's still
acceptable. If you look at these you'll
see that all three of these, the ones
highlighted in yellow, stay above zero
through the fifth increment. The
other two that are still decent fits,
hit down to zero around 5, so I
didn't work with those any further. The
question asked is, do any of these in
yellow highlights, suggest the
quantization mechanism? Again let's
return to Halton Arp’s talk at the Kronia
conference group in Portland, and I'll
quote from him again.
Here he's now talking about particle
mass being variable with time, and to
quote Halton, “Einstein’s solution in
1922, made an approximation which I,
Halton Arp, think was wrong. The
particle masses were constant everywhere
in the universe - that was the
approximation by Einstein. With this
approximation, they got the Big Bang
solution and they predict expanding
coordinates, singularities at time equals zero,
and this demands that all the redshifts
are velocities of recession. Jack
Narlikar and Fred Hoyle did not assume
that particle masses were constant in
time, and they got a very simple solution
that the masses varied with the time
squared. That is, as time went on, they
communicated with more and more of the
universe, and their mass grew. This is
a Machian theory: if the electron mass-
when it makes its transition in the atom
and emits the photon- is small, the photon
is weak and it's red shifted. As the
electron grows in mass, the photon which
is emitted, is stronger and it drops in
redshift. So, this is a perfect
explanation for what we've been seeing,
that younger objects are highly
redshifted and the sacred Hubble
constant is just the inverse age of our
galaxy. Continuing with the Halton Arp’s talk at
that conference, if you start in the
galaxy nucleus, you get a high density in
the center of this active nucleus, this
mysterious engine where the stuff is
created. The new particles are in that
environment and they're gaining mass
from their environment very rapidly. When
they step out of the nucleus, they go
into a different, much lower density,
environment into the bulge of the galaxy,
and then, if they come out in the plane
of the galaxy or along the axis, they
drop here into the local group. These are
enormous drops in density and finally
when they drop out of the local group of
galaxies, they take another step down
into the local supercluster of galaxies,
and out the local supercluster they take
yet another step down. These particles
will be gaining mass very rapidly and
the redshift will be dropping very
rapidly and then it finally levels off.
And there goes another step in the drop,
and there are just about six drops and
there are six major quantization levels,
and he quotes the values of 1.96, 1.41,
0.96, 0.6, 0.3 and the one that was postulated at
a very low 0.061. And the
following slide, this is taken again from
Halton Arp’s talk at the Kronia group.
He presented a series
of slides that show these drops in
density and I made a composite schematic
from his presentation; and there's
incremental increases in particle mass
and corresponding quantized drops in
redshift. If we start from zero, which is
at the top, that shows the galactic
nucleus and the leftmost axis there
shows drops in density, while the left
axis, the vertical axis and the y-axis,
the x-axis is time/distance as the
QSO moves outward. So, we start
from zero which is the galactic nucleus,
then proceed to the first step, which is
the drop to the galactic bulge, which is
step 1. Following that, we go to the
galactic plane or axial ejection which
is shown as step 2. That then proceeds
to the local galactic group, which is
step 3. Next goes to the galactic
super cluster, which is step 4 and
finally then there's a step 5, which
is postulating, he does not specify what that is,
but again, the key here is that
Halton Arp sees the stepwise incremental
increases in particle mass corresponding
to the quantized drops in redshift. So
this is his explanation for the
quantization of redshift. Now I'd like to
talk a little bit about the theory of
C-C Su, from whom I use the redshift data.
This is from an article taken from the
arXiv website in physics in 2006.
According to Su is the following.
According to the ejection model, quasars
are formed from the gas of atoms, plasma
and dust ejected from the parent active
galaxy. Suppose that the material of
the gas cloud together forms a local
ether. The gravitational potential on the
surface of the quasar is extraordinarily
strong. The wide variation in redshift
can be ascribed to a variation in
density and size of the gas cloud, which
can be due to the strength of the
initial ejection from the parent
galaxy. The speed at which the cloud
moves away, to the gas expansion, to the
fragmentation of glass clouds, and to
star formation. So, he has multiple
explanations for the wide variation in
redshift. Due to the non-uniformity
in particle velocity and density, or to
some internal disturbance, the quasar may
break into pieces of identical or
similar sizes. Suppose the fragments are
also spherical and the density remains
unchanged. Thereby their radius is
shorter than the previous one by a
factor of 2^-1/3 power; and
the gravitational potential on the
surface of either fragment will decrease
by a factor of 2^-2/3 power.
And after the nth splitting in half, the
gravitationally induced intrinsic redshift
is given by the formula shown there,
1+zn equals the square root
of those terms there. Continuing with
gravity induced quantization from C-C Su,
what are the terms inside the square
root on the previous formula? The 1 plus
z0 squared minus 1, denotes 2 times the
normalized gravitational potential,
corresponding to the 0th redshift,
z sub 0. For the cases of very high
redshift, this can be approximated as 1
plus Z to the n equal to 1.26
to the minus n times 1 plus Z sub 0. By
adopting the preferred redshift value
of 1.956 as the 0th redshift once
again, this formula leads to the
prediction that the preferred
intrinsic redshifts are a series
starting at z equal to 6.08,
and shown there are the series
down to 0.06, with n
ranging from -4 to +9  by integers.
And the ones highlighted in red,
are the ones that have been observed.
You notice that the
0.06 isn't shown there. But
what see C-C Su observes is that a
redshift distribution around 0.6
may actually be a merger of two
close distributions around 0.71 and
0.49 which are two that he predicts, and
that just happens to be the average of
the two, 0.6. So, he does get
the 6 key redshift peaks from his
formula. Low redshift peaks are expected
to be smeared, since other affecting
factors of uneven splitting, gas
expansion and star formation,
will accumulate with time.
Now, my observation is that unlike Arp’s
theory, Su’s does not postulate the
series of quantized redshifts represents
QSO evolution with time and/or distance,
although he does agree that QSOs are
formed by injection from a parent galaxy.
His quantizations are static for each
QSO and dependent upon various initial
conditions and interactions until the QSO
”stabilizes” and exhibits one of the
characteristic, preferred redshift values.
So, whereas Arp believes that QSOs
are ejected and they evolve with time,
as they move outward from the parent
galaxies and the redshifts drop in
quantized amounts with variable particle
mass, Su’s belief is that they're all
ejected at the given redshifts that are
already quantized due to other factors.
It's not a case of each QSO going
through an evolution and a change in its
quantization of redshift. Now I’m going to
offer some speculation on my part. From
Halton Arp’s theories, the QSO quantized
redshift values with QSO distance, or
time from the parent galaxy, which could
be either or both a time or distance
phenomenon. QSOs are ejected with
high redshift, which seems to correlate
well with high mass, therefore high
density, provided the “emitting nucleus”
remains relatively constant in size. Arp
bases the observed quantization on
variable particle mass, which increases
with time and correspondingly with
distance, as the particles evolve and
travel outward from higher to lower
density regions, in a piecewise, not
continuous manner. If you accept Arp’s
variable mass postulate, this appears
reasonable. For C-C Su, the quantized QSO
redshift and mass results from initial
conditions and subsequent interactions.
Presumably, the spatial distribution
around the parent galaxy, whereby the
higher redshifted QSOs are closest
and the lower one's farthest, is the result
of the initial energy of the
QSO’s ejection, its initial size and
various interactions with surrounding
material. The more energetic ones travel
outward farther and interact more with
material, thereby losing more mass
and showing lower redshift
with distance. Regarding Su's theory,
although he predicts at least some of
the quantized values, he does not offer a
definitive reason for the quantization
as Arp does, which is variable particle mass.
Therefore, in my opinion, his theory appears
less plausible than Halton Arp’s. Continuing
with my speculation, I'm going to offer
another possible mathematical
observation for quantization that could
have a yet to be identified physical
basis. My simplest equations that
reproduce well the quantized decreasing
QSO redshifts as a function of
uniformly increasing time or distance
intervals, suggest an exponential decay,
or roughly a decay as a function of
inverse time, or distance. I'll just
go back a bit to that earlier
slide for familiarity. I'm referring to
the slide here where I show the mass,
the scaled mass relative to the Sun's
mass, as a function of equal time or
distance increments. And the one in
purple was the one that showed an
exponential dependence:
e to the minus 0.6. So, what I said
is the exponential decay is a
fairly common physical phenomenon. For
example it's typical of radioactive
decay, but the discrete aspect appears to
be unique to QSO redshifts. It's not a
continuous decay; it is again in a
stepwise fashion; at least from what's
been observed. An inverse distance
dependence, which was also shown on the
earlier slide, the inverse distance one
is the one in green, where we have
distance or time to the -1.2
which is basically inverse time or
inverse distance dependence. An inverse
distance dependence is characteristic of
a magnetic or electric field around an
infinitely long string of charges, or
current-carrying wire, and this
suggests Electric Universe theory, where
we have intergalactic Birkeland currents
pervading the universe. Galaxies form
where these currents flow and could
exhibit surrounding magnetic or electric
fields with the inverse distance
dependence. What is more difficult to
ascertain is the quantization aspect.
I do make the following
mathemetical observation, that the
quantization of both QSO mass and
redshift can be represented very well by
a sine curve with decreasing amplitude
of the same decaying exponential form as
my previous equation. And that's shown on
this next slide here. This is my own
speculation; what I've plotted here is
the scaled mass which is the scaled mass,
or the quantized redshift because
they're related, as a function of the
time or distance increment. The formula
at the bottom M/M0 equals..... The
equation on the right is actually an
absolute value, and that's shown by the
bars, and that indicates absolute value.
I have a scaling factor
of 2.73E+9, it's a scaling factor which is
corresponding to the quantized masses.
I have a shift factor for the sinusoidal
variation, -0.55 and that enables me
to set the peaks at the integer values.
Therefore the peaks for each
of the sine curves come out at
integer values of 1 through 5. You'll
notice that the peaks occur at scaled
masses of 2.05E+9 etc., for increments
1 through 5, and what I reproduced there
is the table earlier, where I showed the
average scaled mass ratios as a function
of the Z peaks, the redshift peaks and
the increments. And the arrows there show
how well the sinusoidal curve, the peaks
correspond to those values. They all
align very well with them. In fact, the
comparison with the observed value shows
agreement to within ten percent. Now I
don't know what phenomenon might exhibit
a sinusoidal behavior with exponentially
decaying amplitude. Could it be some form
of harmonic dependence? I'm
only offering this as food for thought. I
just thought it was rather..., I know if
it's pure coincidence or what, that I was
able to come up with a sinusoidal
function that matched the Z peaks, or the
mass ratios that result from the Z peaks.
The Z peaks are shown in red,
decreasing trend, the mass ratios are
shown in the dotted curves here, and the
predicted values as shown, the five here
at the tops of the peaks, align very well with the
ratios that were derived from the
regression analysis using the much
earlier data from C-C Su. So, finally in
summary, my approach to the topic of
quantization of intrinsic QSO
redshifts, especially based on the
lifetime work of Halton Arp, was purely
mathematical - developing a theory for
intrinsic quantized QSO redshift is
beyond my experience. I postulated a
geometric explanation of intrinsic
redshift possibly dependent on mass to
the two-thirds power, related to possible
attenuation of light energy (and
therefore frequency) within the emitting
nucleus of a QSO, compounded by a further
dilution (and therefore energy and
frequency) decrease due to spread over
the surface area. To do the quantization
aspect justice, I summarized two theories
by other experts and examined their
plausibility within my realm of
knowledge. Finally, I offered at least a
mathematical representation of the
quantization aspect as food for thought.
That concludes this presentation.

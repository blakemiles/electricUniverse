Today, we continue our exploration
of the early scientific data from NASA's
historic Parker Solar Probe
mission to the Sun.
In part one, Dr. Donald Scott
began his analysis of some of the most
intriguing early findings, including the
probe's "unexpected" detection of
magnetic reversals as it moved in
the plasma solar environment.
As one new report describes,
"Unexpectedly, the probe
also detected a series of flips in the
Sun's magnetic fields -- dubbed "switchbacks"
-- as streaming winds of plasma
flowed past the spacecraft. During these
periods, the magnetic field suddenly
reversed itself by 180 degrees and then,
seconds to hours later, flipped back."
As Dr. Scott continues, he explains why the
so-called "switchbacks" could be the
telltale signs of the Birkeland currents
hypothesized by the Electric Sun model.
In describing the switchbacks, or
magnetic reversals the Parker Probe has
seen, press release stated, "These
reversals happen at a high rate of
occurrence. That high rate
is surprising. In fact
the nature of these
structures remains unknown.
Well, we can help them with that,
I think, but anyway, we know
that the Parker Probe is traveling at a speed
of approximately 430 thousand miles an hour.
That's fast, it's in fact, it's
a hundred ninety kilometers per second.
And so, in a couple of minutes, the probe
travels about 15,000 kilometers, so that
distance could very well be the
thickness of one of the layers in the
Birkeland current which would be the
cause of those magnetic reversals, as it
goes through the Birkeland current.
The press release also announced that, close
to the Sun the solar wind seems to get
sped up by powerful "rogue waves"
that move through the magnetic field.
The quote from the press release states,
"We'd suddenly see a spike in the
flow, where in just a couple of seconds
the solar wind would start flowing at
300,000 miles an hour faster."
That's about a hundred and thirty-four
kilometers per second increase in the
speed of the solar wind that they're
observing, and if the velocity of the
wind is about 400 kilometers a second,
the press release said they were
doubling the speed, it's not quite
doubling, also they quote, they said there
are jets of plasma in these streamers.
Well, I maintain, the
increases in the solar wind
speed may indeed be
caused by double layers.
Now, in the past, our
viewers have seen this image that I've
included here, of what
a double layer looks like.
So just to refresh the viewer,
there are three plots there.
The top graph is the voltage that we would
measure as a function of radius distance
out from the Sun, so you can see that the
voltage is dropping rather precipitously
from point c to d to e, and that results
in the middle plot which
is the electric field
that is produced by that
sharp drop in voltage.
Now, there's nothing
mysterious about that electric field.
It's just the force on a positive ion
and if the electric field is positive, as
you see it, there it
is, that means that
the force on that positive ion is
outward, in the positive direction.
Outward from the
Sun, is the positive direction.
So, the bottom plot
there is the plot of the charge
distribution that would be there to
cause what those other two plots look like.
That's from Maxwell's equations, but
if we look at the charge distribution
there, you can see that there are two
spherical shells, one of positive ions
and then right on top of that, a shell of
negative charges, mostly probably electrons.
And that's why it's called a
double layer, the plus and the minus
layer are right there together.
And there are two different
spherical shells
in that double layer,
the inner half, the
inner one is positive, and the
outer half is negative.
And in between, in the center
of that, that the layer is at,
is an extremely strong electric field.
Now, that electric field,
if it's strong enough, can
actually rip apart any charged
intruder into the double layer.
So the SAFIRE experiment,
that everybody has
been hearing about,
it has worked out so
well for us, that experiment produced an
image of a whole series of these double
layers surrounding the anode, the Sun, and
the most powerful one is right there
above the, or actually on the surface of
the anode, and that's completely
consistent with Juergens' Electric Sun
model, because that's the photosphere,
that's where the sunspots
all happen and in that
double layer there, all
sorts of things occur.
And then, as you go out
from that layer outward from
the Sun, the double layers get dimmer and
weaker, you can see them finally
disappear off in the distance.
And we don't see any of those double layers
around the Sun with our eyes or with
telescopes now, simply because they're, if
they're there, they're in the dark mode
of plasma operation, they're in the same
mode of plasma operation that surrounds
the North Pole of the Earth and it's
dark mode, we don't see that either.
Unless, of course, there's an Aurora
at which time the plasma jumps into the
glow mode, and as it did in that
photograph that Monty so kindly sent us.
But normally, it's not visible,
it's a dark mode plasma and so are those
double layers around the Sun.
Also, and things are
happening very quickly these
days, in a new paper
entitled "Probing the
energetic particle environment near the
Sun," the authors seem to acknowledge that
magnetic reconnection
can't actually explain
some of the effects
they're observing.
I was waiting, predicting that
we would hear about magnetic
reconnection but I'm very
pleased that they have
essentially written that
off, at least in this paper.
And they said instead,
"We find a variety of energetic
particle events accelerated
both locally and remotely including by
co-rotating interaction regions, and
impulsive events driven by acceleration
near the Sun, and an event related to a
coronal mass ejection."
But so, they used the word co-rotating and I
wonder if, by using the word co-rotating,
did they actually mean counter-rotating?
Nothing more was said and so, we'll have
to wait to see what they have discovered,
but they've discovered, everything that
they have discovered is certainly
explainable by Birkeland currents.
Also, incidentally, regarding the question of
how all those other elements get onto
the face of the Sun, that we discussed
earlier, one of the most important
results of the SAFIRE team was their
discovery that in their electrical
plasma discharge, and we
remember that was in a
hydrogen atmosphere, just
like the Sun, it's hydrogen.
The transmutation of
elements occurs, that's the kind of
process that the old prehistoric alchemists
were looking, they wanted to change lead
into gold or something like that.
They've actually, SAFIRE has done it in
microscopic amounts, but they've done it.
So that in a plasma discharge, hydrogen
apparently can give birth to a long list
of other elements, not just water, that
were not there before the discharge started.
So that may well be how those
other elements got onto the
Sun and get onto the Sun as we speak.
And the point is, fairy dust
has nothing to do with it.

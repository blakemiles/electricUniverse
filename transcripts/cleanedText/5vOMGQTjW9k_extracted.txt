Well, they say the planets are as the lore
of God which moves in mysterious ways
but apparently, I've got a bad
throat, something's concocted here.
It won't silence me, no, but I've
got some medicinal knowledge here
so we'll pop that
down for the moment.
Instant fossilization.
Now what a subject!
Everyone's talked about planet
configurations, of the damage they do.
This could be one of the subjects, I think,
we should tap into far more than we do.
But Instant Fossilisation...
Now, around the world,
living plants and animals have
been petrified into solid rock
in violent paroxysms of nature!
Their end was agonizing
and instantaneous
as witnessed by their
contorted death throes.
Now there are plant fossils
and there are animal fossils.
How do you turn
this piece of wood
into this fossilized
piece of wood
which has high calcium, silicon,
and other mineral content?
Or even into this
fossilized piece of wood
which has very
high iron content?
I'm not going to the next slide.
So let's look at four
examples of petrification
and we will come to the
difference between petrification
and just mere
fossilization, soon.
Here's some.
Ammonites are like squids but in a
shell, swimming along soft-bodied,
and now we see them
fossilized within this beach.
They're associated with the Jurassic age
and can be anything up to six foot across.
So let's go, that's
the first example.
Let's go to another one.
I'd wanted you to actually see
the reality of these things.
So these have come off
the tree on Lesbos
And how do you explain this?
They are all cut off.
Not ripped apart, cut!
And it's solid rock, solid rock.
Amazing!
That's example two.
So this is the reality
of petrification.
Here's the next one.
Here in the area and he was
leveling that - kinda took maybe
It took ten feet off the top and up and
the bulldozer operator looked behind even
there were big bones sticking
out everywhere he had been.
Right and it's
an incredible site.
Now we're treating there roughly,
I've got to think in terms of feet.
Where it's about a 100 foot
by about 80 foot something
- About 125 by 100.
- Yeah
- This is a kind of ellipse
and although this is a mammoth site, in actual
fact there's a number of species in situ,
isn't there?
Right, the mammoth kind
of dwarf everything else.
That's what I love.
Notice the layering
of the limestone.
I will come back to this anyway.
This is a fourth example
and this is my favorite.
The northward... whoops, sorry!
The northwest mineral
gallery I've come to
and you've got not only
petrified trees to show us
but some really interesting
concretations containing...
you tell us about!
Yes Peter, these, um,
what you're going to see inside of the
museum here are fossilized crabs.
They're actually soft bodied fossils
which are found inside of concretions.
So when we say concretion, we'll
be talking about a round egg shaped rock
and it's solid rock.
- Yes
And within that rock when you break
them open, there is a crab, right?
And that crab is actually
rock as well, is that right?
- Yes
Fossilized, so okay, sorry.
Just want to make sure
I understood.
Yeah, well, concretions are, the most popular
and known kind of concretion are round rocks.
There are other kinds but the ones
most of us know are round rocks
and they are, they often form
around the nucleus of a fossil,
a little bit of rock, a little,
I mean a little bit of shell maybe, a
little piece of leaf or something.
- Yeah
In this case we have
the whole crab.
- Yeah
And the crab has a
lot of his anatomy,
it's all right there, you'll be
able to see his orifice,
you can see the spikes on
his, his back, his claws.
Right, you'll be
able to see them
down to the minute detail
of the whole skeleton.
- Yes
So that's amazing, isn't it?
So what do these petrified
organic fossils,
remember they were actually
living, have in common?
Their end was instantaneous
and dramatic.
Their chemical
composition changed,
they changed from a carbon water
base to silicon whatever.
But the unanswered question,
what pungent force of nature
changed their chemical composition
whilst they're in their death throes?
Let's look for some answer.
Now conventional geology counts time as a
slowly moving tool that leached their bodies,
all the chemicals are taken out,
and replaced them, the carbon
with silicon and calcium.
That's the conventional wisdom.
But the rapid decay
of biological matter,
in my opinion, makes a
nonsense of this theory.
What then is the answer?
Now let's go outside
the scientific square
but before we do, I just want to get
some of these terminologies sorted out.
There's fossilization,
there's petrification.
Now, fossilization can preserve
tissue and particularly bones.
For instance Alaska and
Siberia, Antarctica.
The uh, within coal and the peat of
Snow Mass Colorado is, when I visited,
where they've got
mastodonts and mammoths etc.
There they're preserved, but they're
not actually changed to rock.
Petrification is a subset
where the original carbon-like material
is either replaced or transmuted,
remember that term transmuted,
to different compounds of silicon,
calcium, iron, aluminum, etc.
In other words,
they turn to rock.
They're not just preserved.
Now although fossilization generally is
undoubtedly the result of cataclysmic events,
as you know, we can read
about in Velikovsky etc.,
petrification tends to
occur either in a bolus
such as we saw with Larry Agenbroad
in South Dakota or along coastlines.
Now I'm not sure how we can
explain this but let's try.
So there you are.
Petrification would seem to
magnify the catastrophic event
and actually transmute
elements and compounds.
I suspect this is a result of
powerful electromagnetic forces
that have centralized
in a certain area.
They're not necessary
over a broad area
such as the normal catastrophe
that does fossilize things,
but petrification tends
to be in secluded areas.
Not sure why but anyway.
Often these,
so there we go,
we've got some examples here.
There's the Hot Springs ones,
Romsey Marsh in Australia,
at the Jurassic Coast we saw before and
Diamond Bay which you'll see later.
OK, the causes of petrification.
Now, I noted before,
we should search in other places
apart from scientific endeavor.
And mythology from Rens Van der
Sluijs to Dave and Wal, etc, etc,
holds a lot of the key
to this, in my opinion.
They're witness to
catastrophic destruction.
Now Georges Cuvier who visited the
Americas around about 1800 or so,
around the time of the French Revolution
and the American War of Independence,
investigated a lot of
apart from looking...
He was a paleontologist.
Apart from looking at bones
and things like that,
he was extremely interested in
local or the Indian mythology.
And Adrienne Meyer studied this a lot and
followed up on Georges Cuvier's efforts
and she advocates, as a lot of this
myth, Indian mythology talks about,
the cosmic thunderbolt as the weapon of
choice in this megafauna destruction.
Now let's just listen to this.
Monstrous creature
preyed upon early humans
and that the Creator then wanted
to make the Earth safe for,
for the new human beings.
So the Creator then killed them with
a sort of cosmic lightning bolts.
Something beyond just
ordinary lightning.
So it wasn't just as description
of normal everyday?
No!
No, this was a massive
destruction of these creatures.
And it's actual fact that did happen,
the megafauna are now extinct.
They did, yes.
And they're the, the early
colonists described
the Americas as a land
of, covered with bones.
I mean, they were
everywhere you went.
There were skeletons emerging
or partially petrified, yes.
And apparently Georges
Cuvier came out.
Georges Cuvier, the father
of paleontology in Paris.
He was extremely interested in the stories
that were told by the Native Americans
because he was at that time developing
his theory of extinction and evolution
which was quite different to, let's
say, Darwin and some of those.
I mean, Darwin essentially was saying that
it's taken millions of years to develop
whereas Georges Cuvier was, more
or less, saying something like
number of extinctions
have occurred.
He thought there must have
been a series of catastrophes
whether there were floods or
volcanic or something like that.
I think he settled on floods but he was
very interested in the disaster scenarios
that the Native Americans
had in their oral cultures
explaining the
disappearance and mass...
OK, so let's look at
a couple of these,
there's here these mythologies
from the Native Americans
and here's one cited by Erdoes and
Oritz around about the Creator.
We'll get to quote of what i said,
the Lakota Nation had sent hunting
tribes down here for many, many years.
And they had a different interpretation
on what had caused the fossilizations
of these great beasts.
Karley repeats the traditions
of the first Americans.
The Creator sang a
song of destruction
and set down fierce thunderbirds
to wage a great battle
against the humans and
the giant animals.
They fought for a very long time
because the evil humans and the
animals had become very powerful
and neither could
gain an advantage.
Finally, at the
height of the battle
the thunderbirds sent down their most
powerful thunderbolts all at once.
The fiery blast shook
the entire world
toppling mountain ranges and setting
forests and prairies ablaze.
The flames lept up to the
sky in all directions
sparing only a few people
at the highest peaks.
It was so hot that the world's lakes
boiled up and dried before their eyes.
Even the rocks burned up red-hot
and the giant animals and the
people burned up where they stood.
A great flood followed and
when the survivors went out,
they found bleached bones of the giant
animals in mud and rocks all over the world.
They're still found today
in the Dakota badlands.
But can we believe these bizarre
stories of mass destruction?
Mythology from the Lakota Nation tells us
precisely how this destruction happened
and it was not so long ago.
Now what event was
that, we're not sure.
You know, you go back through the mass
destructions of the Velikovsky and Hesiod,
you know, from around about 2000
BC before right up to a 500 BC.
So we can tie that in though with
a lot of the Greek mythology
and Rens Van der Sluijs is very good at
that as are many of the people in the EU.
So let's look at some of this,
particularly the Gorgons.
Earthquakes and volcanoes routinely
emit flashing transparent plasmoids
emerging like giant bubbles
out of the ground.
These chaotic electromagnetic formations
come in many shapes and colors
and can travel at supersonic speed while
seamlessly passing through or alternatively
boring through obstructions.
Plasmoids reach far
in destruction
and according to Regan Buck, they burnt down
cities and tunneled through mountains.
And in great fear the ancients called
these ground emerging destroyers Gorgons.
Hesiod was writing about
them around 900 BC.
Stratification of
rock under the sea.
Now it seemed that the Gorgons may have been
active in Australian aboriginal mythology.
Verbal records and dance traditions
recorded these demonic plasmoids
at many sites and
in various forms.
Their Rainbow Serpent was responsible
for carving river systems
as Lichtenberg scars on
the face of the Earth
and even held responsible for
building mountains and forming lakes.
Fantasy, you might ask?
Well, I don't believe
it was fantasy.
Let's go to the next.
So here we go.
We're in search of the
causes of petrification.
We've dealt a little
bit about mythology.
What about going to the scientific
side of things and plasma physics?
Anthony Peratt certainly is an advocate of
giant plasma discharges that shaped history.
To him, this mythology could be
simulated in his laboratory.
But what evidence do we have that electrical
phenomena can cause elements to transmute?
E.g. water, and I say water so
think about that, to calcium.
What tool of nature fossilized these
once watery marine ammonites?
The ones along the
Jurassic Coast.
We have a powerful clue.
Now there's two.
There's Eric Milton and some work Wal did
at the Telstra Laboratories years ago
which gives you an indication of
the power of electrical discharge.
Conversion of the wood to rock.
Wal again demonstrates the creation of
fulgurites by powerful electric discharge.
Here
There we go.
Right there in that
light, right there.
What is this, Wal?
This is a fulgurite.
It's fused silica which follows the path
of the lightning or electrical discharge.
Which is how these
trees were petrified?
Further evidence
comes from Canada.
E.R. Milton describes his examination
of a petrified tree trunk in Alberta.
The piece was pure
clean silica inside.
It was coated with a rougher opaque
crust of partially fused sand.
The tree whose stump was petrified
was alive five years ago.
After the tree was cut down to
accommodate the right of way
for a new power
transmission line,
an accidental break allowed
the live high-voltage wire
to contact several tree
stumps in the ground.
The power was cut off
within hours of the break.
All of the tree roots which contacted
the broken wire were fossilized.
Obviously, electricity can
metamorphize matter quickly.
Look at this!
A round about 67 foot long [this
is Lesbos, again] solid rock
but it's amazing.
clearly a tree
See how this is actually
still wood, part of it.
But otherwise, it has
been turned to rock.
A substance a bit like marble.
Here's another example.
Opal mines in Australia,
White cliffs.
We're just going to go down one of the
opal mines and see some interesting things.
These are essentially limestone caves
carved deep into the hillsides.
This is where they
find the opals.
But what really intrigues me are these
Lichtenberg figures you see in front of you.
I interpret these as telluric currents coming
deep from within the bowels of the Earth
and thrusting upwards under some
dramatic geophysical crisis.
These are where the
opals are found.
This current coming up through the
Earth seems to have transmutated
the calcium into some
sort of ferrous compound.
Notice all the red.
And at other times, under different
conditions, it's formed opals.
And the opals we're interested in are these
shells and various other forms of life.
They've been totally
converted and opalized.
Some scientists take this
as a sign of very old age.
But are there other
explanations?
Let's continue our
investigation.
Well with red colored rock pebbles scattered
over miles and miles of countryside.
I suspect C.J. Ransom with experiments
in creating concretations
in his laboratory may have been very
interested in these rounded pebbles.
They bear a remarkable resemblance
to the Martian blueberries.
Is this yet again some evidence of a
major electrical discharge event?
In fact, my colleague in the US has done
experiments on material like Martian soil
and he has created the
blueberries that they found.
- OK
You know, he's done
that in the lab
and yet the blueberries themselves are a
mystery at present to the planetologists
who are studying the
surface of Mars.
We can enlighten them.
Well it's interesting that you say that there
are magnetic reversals found at the site
because that indicates a
change in electrical currents.
Basically you don't get a magnetic
field without an electric current.
- That's a precursor to
That, yeah, that's an indicator that we're
looking at an electrical phenomenon.
And at certain places,
for instance Lake Mungo,
because after a magnetic variation
when the rock turns molten
it actually collects the
signal of the magnetic field.
It was found that a magnetic field was
up to eight times what it is today.
That means a powerful
electric current flow.
Could that be a possible
indicator of petrification here?
But what if.., here's
another question.
This is where we start to think
hopefully a bit laterally
and I don't have a solution
but I'll propose a couple.
What about the medium the fossils
were actually embedded in?
And in the cases we're
talking here, it's water.
The ammonites, the crabs possibly,
well we would think so certainly etc.
They're in a bolus and it's
a volumetric disaster.
So if, let's have a
thought about how,
if a crab is in water which it was,
and the fishes were in water,
and the mammoths have
fallen to watery pit.
Could the calcium
change to water?
Big question and certainly
is contentious.
But if you look at the chemistry here,
we got H₂O, two elements, hydrogen and oxygen,
with a combination of 10 protons,
2 hydrogen protons and 8 oxygen.
Calcium, the basic stuff of limestone is,
has a proton count of double that, twenty.
This is twice that of water.
All that is theoretically needed
to convert the water to calcium
is an abundance of neutrons to match
the lack of ones in the hydrogen
which only has one
proton but no neutrons.
Is that feasible?
You know, the chemistry's
there, I mean,
some people could look at H₂O as
an isotope of calcium, possibly.
Russian studies of
lightning discharges
have shown that neutrons are
promulgated during a lightning storm.
So neutrons could be
involved in this.
It's a possibility.
But something tells me if the
fish and the crabs are in water,
and that's in rock later on,
how the hell did that happen?
And this, the water itself has been
transmuted together with the bodies.
And they have the periodic tables; hydrogen, helium,
lithium, beryllium, boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen,
we know them all and
how close they are.
And only one, for instance, nitrogen
oxygen, only one proton away.
Silicon, the most abundant element
on Earth if I remember rightly,
they're all fairly
close together.
So there's a lot of scope and
we still don't understand
how elemental change can occur.
It certainly can do, though.
But how can it?
Plasmoid research by Matsumoto
and a number of other people,
shows that when you put electrodes
into a certain solution,
the damaged electrodes can produce new
totally different elements in that solution
and also plasmoids.
Let's have a look at a
little bit of this.
July the 19th, 2012, an
eruption occurred on the Sun.
A moderately powerful solar flare
exploded on the sun's lower
.. sending out light and radiation.
Next came a CME which shot off
to the right out into space
and then the Sun treated viewers to one
of its dazzling magnetic displays.
A phenomenon known
as coronal rain.
This is a little bit about
the Kimberley diamond region
where a giant Barramundi jumped out and
came back in on diamonds on either side.
Other icon of
Australian mythology,
the Rainbow Serpent.
The Rainbow Serpent is cited by the aboriginals
as the creator of geological formations
such as rivers, mountain
building and gorge cutting.
But the other real question is,
could these very same
processes create diamonds?
Plasmoid research in cold fusion
suggests that this might be replicated.
In laboratory experiments with various
electrodes immersed in different solutions,
we can witness cold fusion.
This creates new elements around
damaged parts of the electrode.
The electrical current flow forces mini
plasmoids to emerge from these very electrodes.
Some quite curiously look
totally like comets.
With their tails and angled colored sampling.
[This is very interesting to me at least.]
Claims by Wal Thornhill that
electrical phenomena are scalable
gives us pause to think.
The emerging plasmoids then leap and
wander across sensitive gel plates.
Work from Matsumoto and others show how
they crater and form tracking lines.
In fact, they perform exactly as the legend
told to me by Aboriginal elder Murray Butcher.
He tells the story of
the wee Wagtail bird
that lept and darted along
rivers, boring water holes.
He insists these are
actually facts, not fiction.
Large plasmoids from
volcanoes and earthquakes,
these are other
electromagnetic phenomena,
have been shown to sculpt the Earth as
they bore and tunnel at great velocities.
They often convert to the
tightly related tornado.
Even tsunamis are produced
when giant plasmoids explode.
But the plasmoid's ability to create
new elements whilst emitting light,
is an area still at a pioneering
stage of our understanding.
Where on Earth these major
electrical discharges came from,
that completely changed the
geology of the landscape?
And what's more, what could possibly
have caused the electrical fossilization
of not only giant wombats
but mammoths and other megafauna in
this period of the Earth's development?
Both of us agree that some
form of Peratt instability
led to the final discharge
causing these geological effects
and I believe, electrical
fossilization.
This is not only backed up by
mythology, with petroglyph carvings
but also by a large
amount of mythology.
Not only Aboriginal, the North
American and around the world
from Zeus's thunderbolts, the
aboriginal lightning brothers.
Aboriginal mythology and tradition
is all about cosmological warfare
in the plasma space.
Comets are mentioned, meteorites,
planets in disturbed motion,
great flashes of thunderbolts
from outer space,
earthquakes, tsunamis
covering the land,
people going mad,
huge oral traditions.
But one thing is plain
in Aboriginal mythology.
It's not myth, it's fact.
Every word that's breathed by these
oral traditions actually happened,
here in Australia.
I'll just pause
that for a second.
I hope I can go on with this.
This is Diamond Point Bay
where I live, Victoria.
And the Australians spell it wrongly
but we won't worry about that.
See this big hole here.
This is where a giant wombat,
if you don't know what a
wombat is, it's like a badger,
I think you have badgers
here, I'm not sure.
But it was the size
of a Volkswagen.
It was fossilized, petrified.
And this amazing area
it only came out last year.
But hopefully I can play this.
We might go on to the next one.
And home we go!
Electric fossilization
and the Carolina Bays.
I decided to include
this because
you're finding out that
it's again the possibility
of things that have happened that have
transmuted or created elements.
So I won't bore you with
reading all that out.
Let's see some of
the guff about it.
This is Rick Firestone from
Berkeley National Laboratories.
He ran the first
cyclotron in the US
and is the current table
of isotopes expert.
He knows his stuff.
Had to say about these
mass destructions.
We discovered that there was
a parallel line of research
where they had been studying the
disappearance at that same time
of mammoths and bears and horses ...
and bison.
All of these animals virtually
disappeared from just that region.
So it's kind of like a dress rehearsal
for what happened 13,000 years ago.
So he did a survey
of the Carolina Bays
and the Carolina Bays, you'll
see about them in a moment,
but there are thousands of depressions
all on the east coast of the US
and up into Canada, I believe, and
even down this far in some cases.
But let's see what he found out.
The remarkable study of
the Carolina Bays system
by Berkeley nuclear
physicist Rick Firestone
stimulates even further speculation
on the production of diamonds.
The Carolina Bays is a vast system
of shallow elliptical depressions
whose origin is
highly debatable.
Some claim meteorite storms, however their
shallowness and lack of debris precludes this.
Others speculate windborne
dramas from past eras.
However, plasmoids may be
involved in the Bays production.
Importantly it should be noted
that Carolina Bays accompany and bank
along Lichtenberg river systems.
EU Theory suspects,
Lichtenberg river systems
are ancient electromagnetic
discharge lines along,
and I suspect, beneath
the Earth's surface.
So what did he conclude?
Well, he was laborious in a lot of these
studies, driving around hand and foot,
analyzing them and taking
things back to the laboratory.
But he found they contained large
concentrations of nano diamonds
and we're talking about
creating new elements here.
This is not outside of
these small craters.
It's actually within them.
Outside it’s totally different.
Nano diamonds, iridium, helium-3,
fullerenes, that's Bucky Balls, carbon glass,
hollow spherules and
magnetic particles.
Could an electrical discharge
or an emerging plasmoid
such as we saw with
the electrodes,
plasmoid instability
possibly create diamonds?
And we're talking here
about transmutation.
So is this a vehicle of transmutation, if
plasmoids did actually create the Carolina Bays?
Is this an indication of, they could
do other things like petrification?
And some backup stuff
here that I was curious.
I actually went to Calabria
but I couldn't find these.
See these round craters?
They were penciled in at this stage
around about 1560 I think it was.
There were huge earthquakes
killing thousands upon thousands
and one of the things that happens with
earthquakes and volcanoes, as we know,
plasmoids emerge out of
the Earth on mountains.
It's well documented
and these, they're so.
They're fairly similar to the
Carolina Bays but in a smaller way.
So Louis Hissink, a geologist involved
in diamond exploration in Australia,
said to me, he said you know,
some of the cherished theories
we hold may be quite wrong
and that's a typical EU
statement if I've ever heard one.
Get it right... Here's
the summary note.
Sort of dead and perish, they're actually
living at the time of fossilization.
They're instantaneously, you believe,
frozen if you like, in time.
Yes, what these fossils
dramatically illustrate,
even though concretions with soft body
fossils are found all over the world.
These will dramatically
illustrate to you that
these are not creatures
which are disarticulated.
They appear to have undergone no
breakdown and no decomposition.
They are in very lifelike positions and
you may have some of your own favorites
but some other examples of soft
bodied fossils were found by,
that are in particular moments of life
seemingly fossilized and turned to stone.
There was a plesiosaur that was
giving birth in Holtzmaden, Germany.
She was seemingly fossilized.
The famous paleontologists Charles
Wolcott also found concretions
which had specimens of jellyfish
which were actually dividing into
two when they were fossilized.
So it is an instantaneous thing.
It would seemingly be so.
They display all of the kind of
characteristics that you would expect
from an electrical discharge,
formation of these types of stone orbs.
It's got the layering,
it's got the,
it's got the equatorial
bulge, if you like,
it's got the polar markings and
and it's wonderful because I think that
the work that C.J. Ransom is doing
kind of gives us an alternative unified
view of how this type of geologic formation
which is really found all over the United
States, all over the world, could be,
could have been formed not by a patchwork
of explanations depending on the area
but really we can see that the
qualities that we see in concretions
in electrically formed, in
electrically formed stone.
That's Paulina West, by the way.
So here we are. Let's
start summing up now.
Here's a classic, a petrified fish turned
to rock in rock, eating another fish.
Caught at a moment of death.
Quite staggering.
So let's sum up what
we've gone through.
Is instant fossilization
an electrical phenomenon?
And I think we've, we can
never say positively
because we haven't
actually seen it happen
but let's go through
some of the things.
Mythology states unequivocably
that plasmoids and...
I was talking to Rens Van
der Sluijs the other day.
He's coming up with a lot of research
he's done in mythology that brings in
not only electrical
discharges such as Zeus
but plasmoid formation.
So I'm waiting to see on that.
But ...and celestial thunderbolts
cause petrification.
C.J. Ransom and others have shown the ability
of electrical discharge to form (concretions).
It would appear that the medium in
which the petrification has occurred
has also dramatically changed and
no one seems to get that bit.
That's so important to me.
You know, something's in rock.
How can it be in the
middle of rock?
I mean, if that was molten they would
have just vaporized it, surely.
But it's not, it's intact.
And it's therefore, has the rock, has
the water turned to rock as well?
Big question to me anyway.
Elemental, a change occurs
during the process.
At some fossilization you
get marginal change.
You certainly get mammoth bones
preserved in muck and peat and ice.
But in, particularly in petrification
it's turned to rock.
Elemental change,
compound change.
The change, and this
is an important part,
is very rapid and theories that
endorse long periods of transition,
the classic theories,
do not fit the fact
that biological matter
deteriorates very quickly if
not preserved by some means.
And that about sums
it up, thank you!

What fills the vast space in
the unimaginable distances
separating celestial
objects in the cosmos?
Space is indeed a big place but
it's not a perfect void or vacuum.
Today this fact is acknowledged
even by the NASA space agency
which states in an
official report from 2014,
"Space may appear empty -- a soundless
vacuum, but it's not an absolute void.
It flows with electric activity
that is not visible to our eyes."
The movement of electrically charged
particles requires a medium
and that medium in
space is plasma
or the so called 4th
state of matter.
Plasma is commonly
referred to as a gas
whose constituent atoms have been
split into electrons and ions
which move independently
of each other.
Well over 99% of the visible
universe is composed of plasma
including the Earth's ionosphere,
the Sun and All Stars
and nearly all of the interplanetary,
interstellar and intergalactic medium.
Electric currents
flowing through plasma
can be recognized through their
distinct filamentary shape
as seen in the familiar
novelty plasma ball.
With extraordinary advances
in space telescopes
we see today, in unprecedented
detail, filamentary structures
that pervade the visible
universe at all scales.
The appearances of these distinct structures
have proved puzzling to astronomers
far more often than not
as they defy the expected form and
behaviors of hot gas in a vacuum.
In part two of this
10 part presentation
we explore why filamentation throughout
the cosmos is just one of 10 reasons
why the universe is electric.
Filaments in Space
Let us begin by considering the examples
of filaments that we see locally
associated with celestial
bodies in our own solar system.
The most dramatic displays can
surely be seen on our Sun.
Of course we see huge
plasma filaments,
sometimes a million
kilometers or longer,
that occasionally erupt or
explode off of the Sun's surface.
But one of countless unresolved
problems in solar physics
is the observation of giant
snake-like filaments
reaching from the surface of the
Sun to the dark cores of sunspots.
For decades, scientists following
the standard solar model
have viewed the Sun spot penumbra
filaments as "convection cells"
or columns of hot gases transporting heat
from the Sun's interior to its surface.
But as physicist Wal
Thornhill has observed,
the filaments bear no resemblance to any
known form of convection in a hot gas.
Indeed, in our first
ever Space News episode,
we reported on the discovery of
anomalously weak solar convection
by scientists measuring the
Sun's internal plasma motions.
The Electric Universe theory
proposes that the Sun
is not powered by an internal
thermonuclear reaction
but rather it receives its electrical
energy from interstellar space
in which case the absence of
convection is to be expected.
The complex magnetic fields associated
with the penumbra filaments
are acknowledged by
solar physicists.
As seen in the text of the Astronomy Picture
of the Day image seen on your screen,
"Here magnetic field lines can be clearly followed
outward from the sunspot to distant regions."
A clear defiance of the expected
behaviors of so-called convection cells.
In a 2002 article on his website;
Thornhill wrote on the
mysterious nature of sunspots,
"It is crucially important
to understand a sunspot
because it is the only place on the Sun that
gives a glimpse below the bright photosphere.
And what do we see?
It is cooler down there
by thousands of degrees!
That is not expected at all if the
Sun is trying to rid itself of heat.
The sunspot center should be much hotter
and brighter than its surroundings."
In the Electric Universe, the penumbral
filaments are electrical discharges in plasma
in the characteristic form of
long thin rope-like structures.
If the filaments are
"convecting gas"
then one would expect the filament centers
to be the hottest and brightest points.
But instead, solar physicists
were amazed to observe
that the penumbral
filaments have dark cores.
In the Electric Universe, the Sun and all
stars are positively charged anodes
and the Sun's
electrical circuitry
reaches across vast distances
throughout the solar system.
The electromagnetic connection
of the Sun to planets,
including the earth,
is now undeniable.
In 2007, NASA scientists were amazed to
discover dynamic so-called magnetic flux ropes
that constantly "form and unravel
in Earth's magnetosphere"
and, in 2017, scientists with
NASA's Cassini mission
were astonished to discover that
these same "magnetic ropes"
connect the Sun and
the planet Saturn
over the incredible distance
of nearly 900 million miles.
These so-called magnetic ropes are in
fact electrical Birkeland currents
which are now known to
power Earth's auroras.
It's now more clear than ever that planets
within the Sun's electrical domain
are electrically charged bodies.
On our own Earth, this fact is best demonstrated
by the relatively recent discovery
of powerful lightning that sometimes
occurs above thunderstorms,
reaching towards space.
For decades, airline pilots have reported their
observations of the stupendous lightning
though it wasn't until the early
1990s that institutional science
finally recognized the
phenomenon exists.
More recently, scientists working
with the ESA Swarm mission
reported their discovery of "supersonic
plasma jets" high up in our atmosphere.
A Phys.org report on
the discovery stated,
"The theory that there are
huge electric currents,
powered by solar wind and guided through
the ionosphere by Earth's magnetic field,
was postulated more than a century ago by
Norwegian scientist Kristian Birkeland.
While much is known about
these current systems,
recent observations... have revealed that they
are associated with large electrical fields."
The spectacular filamentary discharges
we see in our upper atmosphere
may have analogs in other
bodies in our solar system
that scientists have
yet to recognize.
The most extreme example may
be seen on the Jovian moon Io
which astronomers have
characterized since 1979
as the most volcanically active
body in the solar system.
But as we've discussed
many times on this series,
the theory that the spectacular, so-called,
plumes are a form of cryovolcanism
has been falsified
on numerous counts.
Just one of many problems
for planetary scientists
is outlined on the official Wikipedia
page on Tvashtar Paterae region of Io
which states that the over 300 kilometer
high, so-called, volcanic plume displays
"an as yet unexplained
filamentary structure".
However, this statement
is factually incorrect.
The filamentary structure
was explained decades ago
by plasma scientists who
recognized that the "plumes"
are high-energy
electrical discharges.
This theory was first proposed by the
renowned astrophysicist Thomas Gold in 1979.
Then in 1988, plasma scientist Dr. Anthony
Peratt and co-author Alex Dessler
explained, in a peer-reviewed
paper, that the Io plumes
are comparable in
form to a plasma gun.
Similar filamentary plasma discharges are
seen on the Saturnian moon Enceladus,
though again, planetary scientists can
only apply theories of cryovolcanism.
But for several years
astronomers have recognized
the electric current systems connecting
Saturn and Jupiter to their respective moons
though they still imagine volcanism
producing the detected charged particles.
The Electric Universe
is a connected universe
and the braided filamentary structures
we see throughout our solar system;
jetting from planetary surfaces,
on the surface of the Sun
and in the plasma structures
surrounding comets
as seen in this NASA infrared
image of comet Holmes,
all attest to the electrical circuitry
that governs our celestial neighborhood.
We turn our attention now
outside of our solar system
to our galaxy's
interstellar medium
and the extraordinary role that plasma
filaments play in the formation of stars.
A key prediction of the Electric Universe
theory was outlined in the 2005 monograph,
The Electric Universe, by Wal Thornhill
and David Talbott. They wrote,
"Plasma physicists argue that stars are
formed by an electromagnetic 'pinch' effect
on widely dispersed
gas and dust.
The 'pinch' is created by the magnetic
force between parallel current filaments
that are part of the huge electric
currents flowing inside a galaxy."
In 2015, this prediction was affirmed by
data from the Herschel Space Telescope
which imaged, in unprecedented detail, networks
of filaments throughout the Milky Way.
A Phys.org report on the
observations states:
"ESA's Herschel Space Observatory
has been a true game changer...
One of the key aspects that
emerged from these observations
is the presence of a
filamentary network
nearly everywhere in our
galaxy's interstellar medium.
The picture that is emerging
is that these structures
are closely linked to the
formation of stars."
The principal investigator
of the survey stated,
"The greatest surprise was the ubiquity
of the filaments in these nearby clouds
and their intimate connection
with star formation.
But there is more: these
observations revealed that filaments,
which may extend to several
light-years in length,
appear to have a universal width of
about one third of a light year.
This suggests that something
fundamental is lurking underneath."
Of course, the fundamental thing, lurking
underneath the stupendous filaments,
is electricity.
The universal width of the filaments that
Herschel observed is not coincidental.
On Earth, lightning bolts of constant width
are sometimes observed to stretch for miles.
Unfortunately, standard
astronomy still holds
to the pre space-age notion of
an electrically sterile universe
and thus the researchers attempt to explain
the filamentary networks as follows,
"Turbulent motions of the
interstellar gas and dust
create an intricate web of
filamentary structures..."
However, from the Electric
Universe viewpoint
it is paramount that the
most prominent filaments
are seen drawing matter from a
network of smaller filaments.
Smaller coronal filaments are also
characteristic of electric discharges in plasma.
Other filamentary structures
throughout the Milky Way
attest to the spectacular
electromagnetic energies
that, in fact, organize
and drive all galaxies.
Near the center of our galaxy is a structure
called the Galactic Center Radio Arc,
a long-standing source of
mystery for astronomers.
The long parallel rays that shoot
straight out from the galactic plane
are described in an Astronomy
Picture of the Day as follows,
"The radio arc is connected
to the Galactic center
by strange curving filaments
known as the Arches.
The bright radio structure
at the bottom right
likely surrounds a black hole at the Galactic
center and is known as Sagittarius A*.
One origin hypothesis holds that the Radio
Arc and the Arches have their geometry
because they contain hot plasma flowing
along lines of constant magnetic field.
Recent images from the
Chandra X-ray Observatory
appear to show this plasma colliding
with a nearby cloud of cold gas."
But plasma cosmology recognizes the
dynamic behaviors of electric currents
flowing through
conductive plasma.
What standard astronomy describes
as "long parallel rays",
plasma physicists recognized
as spiralling pairs
of magnetic field aligned
Birkeland currents.
The so called strange curving
filaments are Birkeland currents
feeding electrical power
into the galactic center.
In plasma cosmology it
is not a black hole
but a plasmoid that is responsible for
the tremendous concentration of energies
and therefore mass at
the centers of galaxies.
As we look at an
even greater scale
we see affirmation of the underlying
concept of the Electric Universe that
"there are no islands in space".
Earlier this year, researchers publishing in the
Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society
reported the first ever measurement
of the "magnetic bridge"
linking the Milky Way's two nearest
galaxies. Known as the Magellanic bridge,
the unimaginably vast filament stretches
for approximately 75 thousand light years
connecting the large and
small Magellanic Clouds.
One of the researchers
says of the findings,
"Not only are entire
galaxies magnetic,
but the faint delicate threads
joining galaxies are magnetic, too.
Everywhere we look in the
sky, we find magnetism."
The lead researcher
of the study stated,
"In general, we don't know how such
vast magnetic fields are generated,
nor how these large-scale magnetic fields
affect galaxy formation and evolution.
Understanding the role that magnetic fields play
in the evolution of galaxies and their environment
is a fundamental question in astronomy
that remains to be answered."
But as we explained in the
first episode of this series,
magnetism in space will
always remain mysterious
unless and until astronomers recognize
the electric currents required
to induce and sustain
the magnetic fields.
In fact, at the galactic scale, some of the
world's most distinguished plasma physicists
have provided experimental proof
that resolves the "mysteries",
both of the motions of galaxies
and their magnetic fields.
Plasma experiments
show that rotation
is a natural function of interacting
electric currents in plasma.
A good example is the
ubiquitous spiral galaxy,
a predictable configuration
of a cosmic scale discharge.
Computer models of two current
filaments, interacting in a plasma,
have reproduced fine
details of spiral galaxies
with no need for the influence
of hypothetical dark matter.
Consider the comparison of
the images on your screen:
On the top is a picture
of the spiral galaxy M81
as imaged by NASA's
Spitzer Space Telescope.
Beneath are snapshots from a computer simulation,
by plasma scientist Dr. Anthony Peratt,
illustrating the evolution of galactic structures
under the influence of electric currents.
Through the electromagnetic
pinch effect,
parallel currents converge to
produce spiraling structures.
Peratt was a protÃ©gÃ© of the Nobel Prize
winner, plasma physicist Hannes Alfven,
who stated of cosmic
electrical activity,
"Space is filled with a
network of currents
which transfer energy and momentum
over large or very large distances.
The currents often pinch to
filamentary or surface currents.
The latter are likely
to give space,
as also interstellar and intergalactic
space, a cellular structure."
Indeed in the 1920s, it
was Irving Langmuir
who is credited with having coined the
term plasma to describe an ionized gas
due to its seemingly lifelike
properties reminiscent of blood plasma.
The filamentary structures
we see throughout the cosmos;
in the spectacular threaded
networks in nebulae,
to the high-energy collimated
jets, light-years in length,
shooting from so-called
Herbig-Haro objects,
to the stupendous cometary knots
seen in planetary nebulae,
to the cosmic web where galaxies,
like stars in our Milky Way,
line filaments of matter
like pearls on a string;
all testify to the electromagnetic force
exponentially more powerful than gravity,
organizing matter at every scale.

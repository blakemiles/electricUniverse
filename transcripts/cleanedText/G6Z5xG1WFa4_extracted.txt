You have just entered
the theater of an alien sky.
If the words and images seem strange to
you, there's a reason for the this -
our world was once
a vastly different place.
To experience this won't hurt you
and there is nothing to fear.
Before we get too deeply into these
presentations, I'd like to leave a
few thoughts with you as
to what we hope to achieve.
We're exploring solar system
history, Earth history
and human history from a radically new
vantage point. At each step, our attention
will be on a bedrock of fact -
yes! a bedrock of fact.
I'll be using that phrase a lot,
because reliable conclusions
do emerge from human testimony
despite a thousand contradictions.
The underlying concrete agreement
will be impossible to deny.
The first segments in this series
will come largely from
talks I've given in recent years,
but will move as efficiently as possible
into a much larger library of evidence.
Our goal is to reconstruct
the celestial spectacles that
defined an early phase
of human history,
what we've called
the 'myth-making epoch'.
Well established facts will force us to
reconsider many entrenched beliefs
about the evolution of our planetary
system.
For several centuries, the space sciences
have been trapped
in the spell of an unjustified dogma.
That dogma just assumed that planets
have moved on their present courses
for a billion years and more.
But always remember, this
was just a theoretical guess.
As we'll see, that guess
can not withstand scrutiny.
The facts I'll present will
add up to a readily testable story.
That's one of the promises I'm happy
to make since we'll be drawing on
3-dimensional representations
of named planets gathered
in a unique configuration
extremely close to Earth. The electric
discharge forms between these gigantic
bodies metamorphosed in the
sky above ancient witnesses.
In the course of these segments I'll talk
about physicists, astronomers, plasma
scientists, geologists and others
in the sciences who've already
acknowledged the power of the evidence.
We will respond as best we can
to comments and challenges,
even answering questions that may have
lingered in your own mind for years.
This series is about the predictive
power of a reconstruction.
The global archetypes present
to us a verifiable
substructure of
cross-cultural memory.
Seen in 3-dimensional space, the
celestial forms will not allow us to
just make things up.
Hundreds of predictions
will follow inherently
and inescapably from the
details of the reconstruction.
If the forms and events
reconstructed really did occur,
what should we expect to find? And would
anything presently experienced account
for a single instance of the global patterns?
How about memories of a primeval sun god
ruling before the present sun.
Or memories of a mother goddess
identified globally as the planet Venus?
Or worldwide descriptions
of the planet Mars,
always as a male figure, a great warrior
whose far famed weapon
turns out to be a cosmic thunderbolt,
nothing like terrestrial lightning
however, but exactly like electric
discharge configurations
in the plasma laboratory, Suddenly, the
ancient obsession with planets and
planetary motions will make sense,
and the concrete
descriptions of planetary gods
will no longer surprise us.
But the acid tests
noted here are just the first scratches
on the surface.
Countless thousands of ancient drawings,
sacred chronicles of the gods
and ritual re-enactments must now be
addressed in terms of an underlying agreement.
That agreement is entirely coherent
and it's parts are fully interdependent.
One story told around the world.

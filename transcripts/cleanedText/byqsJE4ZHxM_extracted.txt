In the early 1920s, Alexander Gurwitch in
Russia was experimentally exploring the
idea that all life emits, and is embedded
in, a morphogenic field. At one point he
took two onions out of the ground
careful to preserve their root tips.
Because the root tip has the highest rate of
mitosis, the cells are dividing fastest at the tip.
He pointed the tip of one root at the
middle section of a second root. The
cells in that middle section of the second
root then started to divide much faster.
He further experimented with blocking
the effect and found that if he put a
barrier between the two, he could stop the
effect, if the barrier blocked ultraviolet
wavelengths of light. Here was the first modern
experiment, showing that living cells emit light, and
that this light can directly change the behavior of
other cells. Today you can verify that your eyes emit
light, by purchasing a Hamamatsu photo-
multiplier and going into a completely
dark room and pointing the photomultiplier 
at your eye. Living systems emit light
from ultraviolet to very low frequency 
radio waves. Different tissues emit different
wavelengths at different times and at varying
intensities. Why is this not more obvious?
Well, I would argue that it is, since we've 
all noticed the light in someone's eyes.
Or have said things like, ‘she has a glow 
about her’, or ’you were simply radiant’.
If we would all trust our own experience more, 
then science could progress much faster.
The amount of light given off by
creatures varies quite a bit - from a few
photons per second to tens of thousands
or hundreds of thousands per second.
That places the intensity in the range of walking in
a dense forest at night when things are really dark.
But somehow plenty of nocturnal animals 
do just fine. What is this bio light doing?
Here are a few examples. Over the 
winter a seed will not emit any light.
As the rain falls and the temperatures
rise, in the quiet darkness of the soil the
seeds start emitting light, green light, up to
ten thousand photons per second. Another example.
Put someone in a dark room. Shave off
a bit of the hair on the scalp, and place
a photo detector against the area of the 
visual cortex. Take a baseline reading.
Ask the person to imagine a bright light -
the photon count will immediately shoot up.
Your brain gives off more light when you
imagine light. The light emissions from
the entire human body were recorded
periodically over the course of a year.
The entire body brightens in the
summer and is darkest in the winter.
Within a single day the body brightens as the Sun goes
to its zenith, then the body gradually dims, as the day
moves to night. The light emitted from the center
of the body stays the most constant, while the
hands and the head show the most variation.
The colors emitted are centered around
green, but go to blue and yellow.
But the light from the center of the
palms is shifted slightly more to the blue.
Our blood is constantly emitting light.
Blood that had a higher immune response,
in this case carrying more neutrophils,
had a measurably higher photon count.
To our alert biomedical viewers: this is
probably the best area to look for new diagnostic
techniques, as you can be absolutely certain that
the complex rainbow of colors given off by
our blood perfectly reflects the ever-changing
physical and emotional state of our 
organism. Diving into individual cells,
biophotons travel from mitochondria through
microtubules. When I was in graduate school, it was
just observed that microtubules were
used by cells as highways to actively
transport materials to where they were
needed in the cell. And now we know that
those tubules are also carrying light.
We've also found that single neurons act
as wave guides for visible light photons.
Neurons not only behave as electrical
wires, but also act like fiber optic cables.
Light and electricity are really two
sides of the same coin, so we probably 
should have seen that one coming.
In the old picture, any light present in biological
systems was just the random thermal energy.
And yes, there's plenty of that. But 
now we see that specific biological
processes are initiated by specific frequencies of
light which are emitted at specific times and places.
The biology of light is just as
regulated as the biology of molecules.
We're down to the final two experiments.
My runner-up favorite is based upon the
fact that when you are in bright
light, your brain emits more photons.
Take two people. Place them in the same
room along with an antenna which emits a
weak oscillating magnetic field. Person 
One then stays in the room while
Person Two goes to a second room which is completely
dark. Shine a bright light on the first person.
The second person's brain will
immediately emit more biophotons.
This only worked if the two people first
shared the experience of being in the
same oscillating magnetic field. I 
read this paper over six months ago
and I'm still wondering what it means.
Before looking at my favorite experiment,
let's discuss things a little. Light emits light.
In some cases we see the light is doing
specific work, such as initiating mitosis.
If humans were nocturnal creatures this
would all be obvious, as the luminosities are
roughly that of a forest on a moonless night.
We have light shooting out of our eyes;
the ground below us is radiant with the
ultraviolet light of root mitosis. For those 
with a classical bent, you might be saying,
”Plato was right, once again?”
Plato said that in human vision light
goes out from our eyes and blends with
the light coming from objects and the
combination results in what we see. Now 
we have proof that our eyes emit light.
To a physicist this was always an
obvious possibility since all receivers
are also transmitters. A radio antenna can send a
signal, or receive the same signal. It has to work
both ways. The rhodopsin molecules in the
retinal cells can absorb visible light. Therefore
they must also be able to emit the same visible light.
Why might the light coming from our eyes
blend with the light coming in? To answer 
this, we can look at how the ears work.
Decades ago, it was found that our ears emit 
sound. This was shelved as an interesting
oddity, until someone wondered if 
there might not be some purpose to it.
They found that the ears emit sound for
the purpose of actively producing signal
canceling and signal enhancement.
Ever wonder how it is in a crowded room
you are capable of focusing in on one
conversation? Even someone else's
conversation, several feet away?
It's the same principle as the noise-
cancelling headphones but several light
years more advanced, as your auditory
system somehow knows where is the voice
you want to hear. How far away is it; how
long does it take for the sound to travel
the distance between your two ears.
And then in real time, as the sounds in
the room keep changing, your eardrums
emit a sound signal that will reduce
everything else and enhance the
particular voice you want to hear.
The same is happening with your vision.
I've not found the research yet,
but it will come along soon enough.
How is the biology of light different
from the biology we learned in school?
One hundred years ago, people did not 
much think of biology as a chemical process.
Yet everyone listening to this lecture
was educated inside the biochemistry
paradigm. We were taught that biology is only a
chemical process. What do we mean by biochemistry?
Take the example of a cell needing to
build out some new bits of its machinery,
such as a new ribosome. Ribosomes are
the primary machinery that cells use to
build all the other proteins the cell needs. This
requires raw material, enzymes and an energy source.
Imagine the new ribosome is almost completed
and just a final bit needs to be attached.
The final required bit of protein 
is there, hanging around.
The precise enzyme needed for just this
final attachment also happens to be there,
and the ATP molecule is also hanging
around, and then they all come together.
Energy is released from the ATP molecule,
travels through the enzyme and the final
bit of ribosome is added. Biochemistry is great
because biochemists have worked out all the
players in this construction story and a
thousand others, and have measured the
amount of energy needed in each case. Now 
let's retell the story adding light and electricity.
What do we mean by ’energy is released’ from 
the ATP? Electron orbits are broken, rearranged.
This is a change in electric currents.
This change in electric currents emits
light, just as the radio antenna emits
light as the electric current is changed.
This bit of light emitted by the ATP travels
through the optical conductor called enzyme,
and is used to rearrange electric currents on
the almost finished ribosome. Think arc welding.
These changes would look like sparks and
rippling rainbows, if we had the eyes to see it.
You cannot have chemical changes without light.
When electric currents change, light is produced.
When light is absorbed, electric currents 
change. Light and electric currents are two
sides of the same coin: they are the energy
and the matter corresponding to each other.
To better understand organic life, we need to
see it as a hierarchy of worlds within worlds.
A piece of light is not the same as a molecule.
A molecule is not the same as a cell.
A cell is not the same as a human body.
these are all worlds of vastly different
sizes and properties. Yet, all these worlds
interpenetrate one another and influence each other.
We could not have organic life without cells, or 
without chemicals, or without light and electricity,
nor could cells live without ecosystems,
and the whole earth and the Sun.
This hierarchy holds together
because all the levels communicate,
and exchange energy and information. Starting 
with the onion, let's step our way down the ladder.
An onion is living. Inside the living onion, the root is
growing. Inside the growing root, cells are dividing.
Inside the dividing cells, loads of
chemical changes are happening.
In those chemical changes are electric
currents, and from those changing electric
currents, ultraviolet light is emitted.
When this ultraviolet light is absorbed
by a second root, this initiates the whole process
in reverse, causing rapidly changing electric
currents, needed for rapid chemical
rearrangements, needed for rapid cell
division, and the root of the second onion begins
to grow. Root cells are both transmitters and
receivers of everything roots are capable of doing.
In general, if there's a problem at any one level,
it affects all the levels. If some-
thing goes wrong with a molecular
process in my cells, I experience that as ill health.
The molecular world makes itself known to a person.
Or the whole person might engage in
unhealthy behavior such as persistent
negative thoughts, or useless fears,
which will inevitably trickle down to
cause disordered molecular activity in some 
cells. With this picture of interconnection up
and down the ladder, we now widen 
our view and look further up the scale
If a large number of people are engaged
in unhealthy activity, this must work its
way up to cause ill health in whatever
larger groupings exist, be they families
or countries, or even all life on earth taken all
together. Going the other way, if we can imagine it,
if there were something gone wrong at a
planetary level, then this must find its way down
to humanity. Not necessarily to make each
person sick, but certainly cause changing
trends of illness that appear
and disappear across the globe.
Our ladder now stretches from the 
entire earth down to individual photons,
and we are ready for my number one favorite
experiment involving the biophotons of DNA.
The lab of Luke Montagnier was studying
radio frequencies emitted by DNA.
In the last of a series of truly
boggling experiments, they placed a
string of DNA into a vial of water and stimulated
the vial with various radio frequencies.
Then filter out the DNA. This leaves just water, but
the water is now emitting radio frequencies, which it
somehow got from the DNA. Place 
an antenna around the vial of water
and send that signal to a second lab, several miles
away. In this other lab, you have a second test
tube that contains water and all 
the individual building blocks of DNA.
Broadcast our signal into the second vial.
In a few hours the original DNA strand
will be constructed in the second vial.
Sounds like magic and I guess it is, but it is also
experimental data. Water can hold the radio
frequency signal, which can be used to rebuild the
DNA sequence from raw materials.
I would hope that entire new research
labs will be set up to further explore these results.
Luke Montagnier has many admirers and many
enemies. As often happens with people
who achieve a great deal in life,
shortly before his death last year,
he had the distinction of being canceled
for daring to point out some obvious
problems with a novel medical treatment
that was being rolled out around the 
world. Hence it is possible that anything
connected with him will be erased from future history.
What frequencies worked best in this experiment?
The results were clearest when the
initial strand was energized with 7 Hertz,
14 Hertz, or 28 Hertz radio signals.
Of course, these are the resonant
frequencies of the entire electrical body of
the earth known as the Schumann resonances.
That is worth saying a second time:
the entire electrical body of the earth
vibrates loudest at 7, 14 and 28 Hertz.
These are the same frequencies that
allow DNA in the experiment to best convey 
its information through water to rebuild itself.
It is absurd to think this is an accident.
This obvious connection between the
electrical body of the earth and the
DNA in each of us makes me.... quiet.
Like, I sometimes get quiet in church, or 
in an overwhelmingly beautiful landscape.
At this point poetry meets experimental science.
The bridge between the two seems long
but is also undeniable. Antennas work both 
ways. The entire electrical body of the earth
is both the sender and the receiver of all the
vibrations in all the DNA in all the living creatures.
over all the eons that have unfolded within 
her. Inside you, are a trillion antennae that
are both the senders and receivers of all the love and
wisdom contained in the long body of our Mother Earth.
This would be enough, but we're not done 
yet. In simple physics, the length of an
antenna is comparable to the size of the wave it
absorbs and emits. The AM radio antenna on your car is
one-fourth the size of the AM radio waves 
that are being sent out from the radio stations.
Since we have already verified
experimentally that our DNA is an
antenna that both absorbs and emits, we might ask
what is the length of our DNA and is there any station
broadcasting that wavelength. The DNA in one 
of your cells unrolls to roughly your own height
that's a notable connection an organism the size of
a person needs an antenna roughly its own size to
adequately send and receive all the information
required for an entire life, from conception to death.
But what about the combined length of all the DNA in
all your cells? That combined length is the size of our
entire solar system. We have within us antennas
whose combined length happens to be the right size,
to resonate with the entire body of the Sun, the
planets, all the comets, even out to the heliopause.
Who could believe such a thing?
How could there be a connection with the
life of a person in the entire solar system?
Yet the connection must be there,
because the ladder is unbroken. Whether 
or not any one of us can knowingly receive
these signals, or is capable of intentionally
broadcasting up to the whole solar system.
It's a good question I dare say
it's a very important question.

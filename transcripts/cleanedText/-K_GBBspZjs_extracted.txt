Wow! Does a year
pass by quickly.
Last time I stood up here
we were showing you pre-models,
computer-aided design models of SAFIRE,
where we thought we were going to go.
And tonight, we're going to show you
where we've come and how we got there.
So, I'm not sure how fast I'll
go through the presentation;
I think I have what 600 slides.
No, not that many, but there's lots of
colorful ones. We're going to get into some
of the hard core engineering that goes
into designing a machine of this nature
and some of the questions that the team had
to address for us to get where we are.
So SAFIRE: Stellar Atmospheric
Function in Regulation Experiment.
It's a test of the Electric
Sun Model and this model,
we see here are we going...
OK, this is the overview...
Here we go.
The Electric Sun Model.
I was asked back in 2011
[I'm just going to give you a really quick
overview for some of you that are new]
by the EU and by individuals
to examine this model.
And what I did is I compared it
to the contemporary model
and I discovered that there is a lot of
disparities with the contemporary model
and came to the conclusion that, at least
at this time here, it's not testable.
But during this, I used a statistical
evaluation tool called Design of Experiments,
which you can apply to filter through
hypotheses or different models
to determine whether they
can be tested or not.
So that's really the first couple of
years, and I came to the conclusion
that I think that the Electric Universe
Model is based on the principle
of charged plasma affecting matter
of a different electrical potential.
And I came to that conclusion finally after
Scott Mainwaring had given me a book,
written by Crookes, where he had a
cathode at one end of a small jar
and an anode at the other end
and had rubies in the center.
And when he lit it up, the
ruby started to fluoresce
and radiate, is what he called it,
what we call plasma discharge.
But the rubies themselves were not part of
the circuit they were just in the plasma
and what it indicates is that there's
certain elements that we know now
do not want to climb or fall to the
electric potential of its environment,
when that happens that's when you
end up with a plasma discharge.
And it was based on that that I came to
conclusion that we may be able to test this.
So Phase 1 was a proof of concept,
and it was really just to see
if we could shake it out
and see if it worked.
Can we go in and recreate
these things and can we
introduce some instrumentation
to do some measurements?
Because the data and instrumentation
to measure what's going on in plasmas is
extremely weak. There's not much information
about it, and we're going to get into that.
And we did test it.
And we discovered
that it would work.
(video Clip Narrator) * We
adjust pressure, voltage,
but I'm gonna introduce some more helium
right now first, just a little bit more,
* current, and time.
* Time is also a key element.
* When the proper combination
of these factors is arrived at,
the plasma
spontaneously ignites.
* A glow discharge
forms in the chamber
Look, look! Look at the emissions
coming off. Look how bright it becomes.
* We adjust the various parameters to
obtain a variety of plasma regimes.
Look, Look, Look, Look,
Look, Look, Look
* What we are observing
has no clear precedent.
* We are seeing things
we did not expect.
Look at the pressure changes!
Nice, nice. Look at the spin!
And that was just the initial...
Afterwards, we were able to control
the plasma, and these are some of the
plasma phenomena that we observed,
and we were starting to measure.
And these double layers, we
ended up finding that we had 2, 3, 4, 20...
These aren't disks.
These are spherical discharges.
Plasma has a unique characteristic where it is
translucent as you look through the center of it.
And it looks like it's a
disk, but in fact it's not.
What you're looking at
actually are spheres.
And then we end up looking at things
that had certain types of perturbations,
but what we thought and looked at the
geometry here was quite remarkable
with the hexagonal-type formation,
and this is all moving.
This is not static.
Further to this, as
some of you know,
we saw a dark or an extremely intense
ion cloud build up around the core,
this is very common for what
we see happening in SAFIRE.
And when it did, it would
blow off into the chamber.
And when that happened, it would often release
power surges of over 10 million watts.
Now what we did is we limited the power to
1800 watts, and we don't understand this,
but these are the things that we are going
to now investigate in Phase 2, and...
this is what you're going to
be introduced to tonight.
This is kind of a panoramic
shot of the lab.
What you're looking at in the center
there is the chamber, which can, uh,
it's about 3 cubic meters.
It's about 7 feet long, and
it's about 4 feet in diameter.
And we're going to go and explore the
engineering that went behind this.
But what's behind this?
This is SAFCON.
Everybody in the team, we
have to come up with a name,
let's call it the control
room, and nobody liked that.
So we said okay, well let's really...
they came up with the name SAFCON.
So, this is SAFCON.
And this is kind of a again a panoramic view
here; it's not complete in this picture of
where the main control for gas, vacuum,
data acquisition, and in real time
we get to monitor what's going on
with all the systems in the chamber.
Now there are two things that we're
going to talk about tonight.
One of them is systems, which is the
chamber itself to maintain its stability
so that it's a stable
experimental environment.
And the other is the data that we get back
from the instruments like the Langmuir probe,
optical spectroscopy, mass
spectroscopy, and other things.
So, you're not
looking at the Sun.
This is the result of the first
discharge from SAFIRE PHASE 2.
And this is what happened.
And so, we believe now
that it is scalable.
Well, we know it's scalable.
So the SAFIRE environment: we know that
the plasma itself is extremely intense.
We know that it's extremely hot.
And one of the things that
happen in a plasma discharge,
one of the characteristics of a plasma
is what we call radiation emissions.
And radiation emissions is the thing
that you feel when you walk outside,
and you feel the hot Phoenix sun
after if you've been in the shade.
And those emissions in SAFIRE, they
travel at the speed of light,
and they impinge on the
surface of the chamber.
Now, I didn't think that this would be
a big deal when we first started out
because it's such a big chamber; it weighs
almost 2,000 pounds; it's stainless steel;
and I found out that was
actually was not the case.
This is just a small graph to show you
the different types of radiation.
The complete spectrum, you go right
from what they call non-thermal,
thermal, optical, broken bands, gamma
rays, x-rays, and ultraviolet.
The stuff that we feel predominately
are within the kind of the infrared
to ultraviolet range when
we walk out in the Sun.
But SAFIRE'S going to experience many of
these because it's an ionizing plasma.
And this is what happens
to the chamber.
So when this radiation hits the surface of
the chamber, some of it is reflected back.
But in our case, because we
have a certain type of finish,
a lot of this energy is
absorbed into that material,
and there's transmitted radiation
that comes off the outside.
So, if you think about your engine,
it's got gas burning on the inside,
and you feel the heat migrating through
the engine; it gets extremely hot.
And so you have this thermal conductance
within the material itself.
So in engineering: we had to take a look
at what we call potential failure modes--
the melting of o-rings (is it going to get
too hot?), thermal stresses on viewports,
thermal expansion of materials causing
stress, thermal effect on cameras,
electrical discharge, erosion of
materials, deposition of materials.
When you have a plasma, an ionizing
plasma, we watch things get vaporized.
And when we say vaporized, these
are like happening in seconds.
So, you can have something that's metal,
and it's no longer there.
So you've got to be careful about
how much energy is in this chamber,
and you've got to have, you
know, good control over it.
So potential failure modes: what
temperatures are we dealing with;
how long will it take to
reach these temperatures;
how do we limit thermal
heating in the chamber;
what are the thermal
limitations of the gaskets;
how do we limit the thermal
heating of the viewports;
what are the effects of
thermal expansion...
Potential failure
modes, and it goes on.
And the list becomes endless because
once you have this radiation in here
it's like putting a very hot, let's say,
tungsten light bulb inside a shoe box,
and that heat and that energy's got nowhere
to go, and it will cause a fire.
Molecular solubility: well,
we're using hydrogen.
What about the polymer
hoses that we're using?
Well, they're designed
to handle the hydrogen.
Well, what happens if the
polymer hose starts to heat up?
Well,, it opens up the molecular
structure of the polymer holes,
the hydrogen starts to migrate through, and
maybe you get hydrogen embrittlement,
and then you, you break a hose.
It doesn't sound like a big deal, but if you've got
pressurized hydrogen moving into the chamber,
and you've got a very hot anode, it might
cause some consternation amongst the team.
Lowell said, ah, I said "Can 
we expect an explosion?"
And he said, "Well, if we
do, it won't be very big."
Now you have to understand with
Lowell, what his background is,
because he used to work at Los Alamos and 
Lawrence Livermore Labs, and nuclear weapons,
So...
So I asked him, I said, "Are we talking about
one megaton or 70 megatons?
You know, or are we just gonna
become like cosmic dust?"
So, we have what we call a system, it's
called Open Issues and Project Tracking.
And that means that every single person
on the team has a responsibility to,
if you think that it's a problem, it's a
problem unless we know that it isn't.
It's broken unless we
know that it's fixed.
It's not gonna work unless
we know that it does.
It's kind of a, you might
consider it a negative approach,
but in the automotive industry we would do the
same thing with your braking system on your car.
As an engineer, we would say, would you be
happy if your brakes worked most of the time?
Or do you, because I got accused
of being a perfectionist one time,
and that's the way I
answered them back.
And I said well, you know, if I'm
designing your braking system,
do you want them to work most of the
time, 90% of the time, 99% of the time?
And what I I discovered is that people want
their brakes to work even if the pads are gone.
So, we look at where a system is going to fail,
and if we can eliminate the failure modes,
then we have a reasonable
confidence that it's going to work.
So, there are
thousands of issues.
And each person on the team is
assigned, they're a champion.
We identify what the
task or the issue is.
The team discusses it
amongst ourselves.
We come up with recommendations.
The person can pursue it
and then come back maybe a day
or two later a week or a month
and say OK, this is what I found,
and maybe they are stuck on it.
But, the approach is that if any
member of the team has an issue,
the whole team has an issue
because if they're
stuck, we're all stuck.
So, we tracked through every single
issue that we can think of.
And that brings us to
Computational Fluid Dynamics.
And it's a big word, and it's a
science and engineering that is used
from designs of kettles,
to rockets, fighter aircraft.
And it covers a wide range
of things in thermodynamics,
and it includes radiation
emissions, that's light emissions.
It means fluids
as well as gases.
So, gases fall under the same kinds of laws and principles
in our calculations as what liquids do.
So, CFD is a
software solid modeler.
It uses proven applied
mathematical equations,
algorithms to evaluate the
effects of various interacting
and non-interacting factors affecting
fluids, gases, and materials.
So think about when they designed
the radiator of your car,
they know that, as a radiator
heats up, it's going to expand.
And if it didn't let it expand,
it's gonna break; it's gonna leak.
So, you want to understand the materials and the
effects of the heat on these kinds of materials.
And the same thing
happens in SAFIRE.
And you can do all these
calculations at once
with some of the most
advanced solid modelers.
So as I said before,
at the beginning,
I didn't think that thermal radiation
was going to be too much of an effect,
cause the thing weighs
about 2,000 pounds.
It's a lot of steel there, and I
thought okay we can fire it up,
and that's not going to
be like a small bell jar.
We can run it for maybe, you
know, a number of hours.
But what I discovered in my
initial calculations is that,
even at 30 kilowatts, because you need
more power it's a bigger chamber,
we would get maybe half an hour out of the
chamber before things started to melt.
And if we allow the chamber and
the energy to go beyond that,
maybe up to 80 kilowatts,
or even 165 kilowatts,
which it has the capability of
doing because it's a big chamber,
we might get half an hour before it
heats up to 500 degrees Celsius.
And when you see something
that's red hot,
that would be in the range of
around 5-600 degrees Celsius,
and that's where
things start to melt.
And that's a big problem. We can't
run, you can't run an experiment.
So what you're looking at here is a
calculation is called "total heat flux,"
and you're going to kind of get a kind of a
basic 101 engineering thing on, on this.
And I discovered
something that EU might find
very useful on the heating of
the cores of planets and moons,
but this here is showing you the
anode in the center of the chamber,
and as time goes on, how
radiation emissions
impinge on the surfaces of the
materials and the chamber itself.
Now, the core plasma, remember the core
plasma we figure is around 3,000 degrees,
but the radiation is leaving
at the speed of light
and is traveling through the atmosphere
in the chamber because it's in a vacuum
even faster than it travels
through our atmosphere on earth.
So there's nothing to slow it
down; there's nothing to stop it.
So, the static results,
that was Dr. Lowell
Morgan's calculations.
So he came out and he said, "Well, it looks like it's
going to heat up to about 521 degrees Celsius,"
and I was coming up with numbers
of around 535 degrees Celsius,
then I contacted some friends that
we're doing some work with NASA
and some aerospace
down in the Carolinas
and they were saying maybe
550 degrees Celsius.
So we have a problem.
So what this is is some
of the calculations.
This is just really a return graph,
I'm going to show you some other
more graphical representations of the results
that the calculations came out with,
but it meant we
have a big problem.
And it meant that I had to
make a telephone call to Scott
and say that if we ran the chamber,
we could run it for about 10 minutes
before you see kind of a
melting thing on the floor,
and that's the end of SAFIRE.
What this is here, you have
static results, which means
this is going to be the maximum temperature the
chamber will come to, and it will stabilize.
The next as you see right here
it's kind of migrating along,
you see the graph drops
down, it comes back up,
that's giving us the time domain and how
long it will take the chamber to heat.
And we came up with approximately
the same number, about 30 minutes.
So then I thought, okay well, I don't
want to call Scott yet and say
"It's over!"
So, I thought, well,
maybe we can cool it.
So, we'll wrap some
water around it,
OK, some hoses or whatever we need
to do so we can cool the chamber.
But as you can see here the analysis is showing us
that well where the hoses are it's nice and cool,
but right where the
center of the chamber is,
which is where the
most of the heat is,
it's going to be too complicated for
us to get anything effective in there.
And what you're looking at from the green to
the red is what we call a thermal gradient,
and it's too steep. You just
don't do that to materials
without causing a lot
of stress and problems.
So I'm thinking, "Well, how do
we cool engines?
What if we blew some air on it?"
So, I started to do
some analysis, and
I thought, "Well, what
if we put a fan on it,
and we suck the air down through
a shroud along the surface,
and we got some sort
of laminar flow?"
And laminar flow falls under
Computational Fluid Dynamics,
and this is the kind of math that they
use to do wing design on aircraft.
You know, how much laminar flow, how
well will the air actually stick
to the surface to
lift the aircraft up.
And air's a very effective
way to get rid of heat;
you use it in your
radiators in your car.
So, it looked promising.
And I thought okay,
what we could also work out here is
the flow of air over the surfaces.
So, we can effectively predict how the
winds or the air is going to flow
over the surfaces to be more effective in
cooling it -- more effective, more efficient.
And this is some of the thermal
distribution, and it's a lot more even.
So, we're not getting
500 degrees now.
Now, if I can get a fan to pull
air over the surface,
we can bring the chamber into stability
of around 100 degrees Celsius.
Now that's something
we can work with.
It's still going to boil water,
but the worst case scenario
is about 100 degrees Celsius.
Its not going to melt gaskets; yes, you
could fry eggs on it, but it's workable.
So then I thought,
"Well, I need a fan."
And that big blue thing is the
fan that we came up with.
I told Scott that, yes
we have a solution,
but what I didn't tell him at the
time is just how big a fan we needed.
And so he thought okay, this is good,
so we're going to keep moving ahead.
And the fan actually will suck
about 14,000 cubic feet per minute
at a pressure of about 2 inches of 2
atmospheres, oh uh, not 2 atmospheres,
but 2 inches of water, which basically
would suck the air out of this room,
all the air out of this room here, oh,
I would say approximately 30 seconds.
So keep your hands and feet in
at all times.
I mean that's me standing there, I don't what
I'm doing, I'm looking at something, I guess.
So then we looked at the
outside, that looked good,
so let's take a
look at the inside,
because that's where the
real nasty environment is.
And what we can model now, very
accurately, is what these conditions are.
And the conditions is showing you with
the little arrows, it's showing you,
those arrows are showing the effects of
buoyancy so as hot air heats it rises.
And so effectively what those arrow are
showing you that it's going to rise,
and it's giving you a velocity
of how fast is the gas rising.
And so this is gas, this is
not radiation emissions.
The radiation emissions are passing
through the gas at the speed of light,
but then there's the gas in the
chamber, and how fast is it moving?
OK, do we have any kind of
convection motion happening in here?
And it's actually quite
stable, if you look at it.
The velocity is
actually not that high.
 
So what we're looking at here, I took a
cross-section, and we're just kind of
moving down through the chamber to the
core, which is where the anode is.
And it looks like a heck of a
fire that's in there, and it is,
but the velocity
is very, very low.
We're talking .0005
meters per second.
So, it means the gas is
not moving very quickly,
which is good for us,
because it means that,
you know, gravity is going to have a
limited effect on the plasma discharge,
if that makes any sense.
OK, the gas is very
stable inside.
And this is just actually
looking down into the core.
So, this here is the effect of
what's called "total heat flux."
It's how you can heat up a
body using electricity.
So, I'm just going to digress here from
SAFIRE just to talk about a possibility
that the EU might want to consider, because
in the course of doing this analysis,
it occurred to me that we
use this tool all the time,
and it means that the center
of the anode might be around,
let's say, 2500 degrees Celsius,
but the surface temperature of the anode
was almost one order of magnitude cooler.
I thought, "Well now
what is going on?
Like, you know, I'm going to heat it up,
it should be just kind of uniform heat."
But in the analysis what it showed
is that the radiation emissions
leaving the surface of the anode
are leaving at the speed of light,
but it takes a lot more time for
the heat to migrate from the core
through that very dense material
that we call the anode.
So if you think about it, you don't need
gravity to heat the core of a planet or a moon,
and this is very effective
mechanism to do this.
And it does answer for why you can
have hot cores in planets or moons,
that really by now, in my opinion, if
the result is as they say they are,
should be frozen rocks,
and they're not.
And even with bodies that are
even smaller than our own moon
might have hot cores
and volcanic activity.
Just a consideration for the
EU, but it's something that
appears to me that
might have some legs.
So, it's just another kind of a
3-D view of the core.
It's fun doing this work
because its really pretty.
This is stuff you could put on
t-shirts, you know.
So this again, what we're
looking at is the radiation
and the effects of the radiation
on components like the cathodes,
because we're like we have large
cathods, and you'll see them tonight.
They are 3 feet in diameter.
They're very thick copper, and
what we have to identify now is
whether or not they're going to
melt, or they're going to expand,
and what kind of changes can
we see occur in the chamber
without it going
into a failure mode.
And this is really
what it's showing you.
The green means that its
cool, the red mean it's hot,
and the little arrows
show you the direction
that the air is moving or the
gas moving in the chamber.
This here is the results.
So the maximum
temperature that we got
from radiation is about
600° Celsius for the copper,
and that's well within
copper's ability to handle.
It's going to get hot, but
it's not going to melt.
But when things heat
up they expand.
And if you're holding
something too rigid,
and it's wanting to expand, well,
that's when you start to break things.
So, we can take the
information that we've got,
and the results that we got from
the Computational Fluid Dynamics,
and read that directly into what's
called Finite Element Analysis.
And that really deals with the structure,
of the strength of materials.
It's used in building buildings and
cars and virtually every kind of thing
you can think of that
undergoes any kind of stress.
So, if you take your hand on
your desk tonight,
and you just put your fingers on the
edge, and you push your hand down,
you're going to get what's
called "displacement."
If you feel your muscles stretching,
this is what we would call "stress."
So things can displace like the wings on an aircraft,
but the stresses are within its
limits so they don't break off.
And this is basically
what FEA does.
And you can apply
thermal forces.
And what this is showing us is the effects of the
radiation emissions on the SAFIRE viewports.
OK now, if I was paying for this,
where, these are SAFIRE viewports.
Now if anyone knows anything
about vacuum chambers,
these are really are not
cheap viewports, OK.
And you don't wanna be blowing
them out of your chamber
because you've subjecting
them to extremely high stresses.
And what this is saying in effect as long as
we've got air moving over top of the surface,
we can keep it cool down to a point
where we can effectively use them
without blowing the
the viewports out of the chamber.
But what about the cathode?
Well, you come up with some ideas.
You want a nice flat disk.
The team we all agreed that a nice flat disk
could be the most effective way to do this,
but you gotta hold
that disk up somehow.
And this was the first concept.
And this here what you're looking
at is kind of a pie shape section
out of that round, that cathode
that you'll see very soon.
And what it's showing you is the
stresses due to thermal forces.
And you can see...
 
OK, you see right in this area here, the
stresses are 370, 372.9 megapascals.
Now that may not mean
much to most of you,
but what it does say is that it's about
400% beyond what copper can handle.
It means that the copper is
going to, because the expansion
due to the deformation
that we see here,
that cathode under these temperatures
is going to grow about half an inch.
So how do we how do we let it
grow half an inch without,
you know, the support
structure breaking,
because it can't
hold it anymore?
 
 
 
OK, so what we say, well look,
let's, let's think of some concepts
that come out of aircraft.
Well if there, if the, if the wings on an
aircraft are stiff, actually they break off.
And when you take off in a big airliner
nowadays you can see the wings moving up.
If they didn't, all those
stresses would be so severe,
they would actually crack and fracture, and
break off, and that's not a good thing.
So, what we're going to do with
SAFIRE, or what we did, is
we want to let it grow.
Let it grow.
So, in this case here, you know,
we just put a small joint in here.
I don't know how well you can
see it on the big screen,
but there's a joint in here, and
it's gonna let the cathode grow.
And it's not going to put stresses
on the structure in here,
but the stresses that you can see here
were actually supporting the cathode
are 77 megapascals, which is about
300% below what copper can handle.
So, we're in good shape.
And I have enough experience with this
to know that it's going to work.
OK.
 
 
OK. So Systems.
Systems Design and Engineering.
If you have a computer, you
have a computer system.
You have chips, and you
have wires, you have fans,
and you have cooling systems
within that computer.
And that system itself is hooked into a network
called the Internet, and we have systems.
And with this particular machine, we
have to start breaking those systems out
into something that's actually going
to work for us in a laboratory.
So the main control panel, data feedback and
capture, this is in SAFCON, video feedback.
OK, we need to see what's going on
in the chamber. We have a couple,
you know, we have one wide angle camera;
we've got a high-resolution video camera
that you're going to see some
of the results from tonight.
A main data vacuum, and controls raceway,
so we got to bring all the controls
and other things across from the
chamber into the control room,
and the main power supply.
And we have deionized
water cooling system;
the reason why we use deionized
water is due to its resistivity,
and we'll talk about
that a little bit.
And then of course you
have the main chamber.
This is just a quick
kind of overview
of what SAFIRE was modeled
an engineered to be,
and the pictures you're going
to see is really a replica
of what has been modeled here
over the course of the year.
So, we have the gimbal.
You saw that last year in the model; you're
going to see the real thing tonight.
The chamber door, mass spectrometer, and
remote data data acquisition junction,
that's kind of uh, you'll see
some interesting things there.
Anode isolation chamber.
Actually, that was Scott
Mainwaring's idea.
He says, "Monty, so what if we just--
'cause that chamber's so big it's going
to take you days to suck it down
and get the vacuum that you want--
if we want to change the anode out, we're going
to lose three days every time we do that."
And so we designed
an isolation chamber
where we could pull the
anode back, close the gate valve,
save the chamber, and switch out
the anode. And this happened,
I don't know how long it took us,
because we did this, maybe 20 minutes,
and put a new one in and brought
it back into the chamber.
Recirculation Recirculation pumps, air cooling,
cryogenic vacuum, and a lot of other systems.
What you're looking at here is the
main gas and vacuum control systems.
And the point of the
presentation tonight
is not just to show you SAFIRE
and some of the results
but the effort and the amount of work
involved with the whole SAFIRE team
to get to what you're
going to see tonight.
And what you're looking at here is really
the mains gas and vacuum schematic.
And everybody on the team
contributes to this.
The questions: well,
where's it going to fail?
What kind of gas we're using?
What direction is the gas
going through the valve?
Is the valve designed
to go one way?
Is it more effective if
it goes the other way?
What about an emergency stop?
What if Lowell's right, you know,
and we need the big red button?
What happens? How do
we deal with that?
Do we need to have nitrogen
flood into the chamber
to assure that in fact we've got
a safe and secure shut down?
We would like to be on the
evening news, but not for,
because we've all become cosmic dust.
So, we start to model
these things up.
So, we take the schematic and we say, okay
what's it gotta to look like in real life?
And we have new members on our
team this year, Jason Lickver,
and he was my engineering manager
with another company that I had.
And so we start to
design these systems.
We take the schematic, which
is really the engineering,
and that's going to translate into
drawings and parts and bills of materials,
and with SAFIRE we figure there's at least
over 40,000 components, give or take.
That doesn't even include the
parts inside the computers.
So this is a model, these are
3-D models.
And we're not at the Iron Man stage
where we're talking to the computer,
but it's really getting
quite advanced.
We can take materials like this here;
we can know what the stresses are,
read that data into an analysis software
and determine whether or not it's
strong enough, its properties.
So, what you're looking at is
a 3-D model,
but it understands all the mass
properties of every single component
that are in this model.
This isn't just a rendering.
This is where
engineering is today.
So now, we're going
to create drawings.
Things that people could actually use
to buy materials and start to build,
and this is, uh, just a drawing
of the control panel itself,
the typical balloons. And then, we get
into things like bills of materials,
and all the parts and components, and
fittings and ferrules, and nuts and bolts.
And each part has to be ordered.
And you have to
identify a vendor.
And you have to
identify the lead time
so we get the parts on the floor
in time so we can build it.
So, what you're looking
at here is purchasing.
And I asked Jano last year if
he'd be interested in helping out in
the purchasing side of things,
and he's never done it before.
I have a lot of experience
in this with my other companies,
and he thought well maybe, maybe it's calling the
company up saying. "I'd like to buy this part."
What he discovered was, what I didn't
tell him is, there's this many pieces,
and you're going to have to identify who
the vendor is, lead times, pricing,
you gotta to get quotes, and just follow up
at when are the parts going to hit the floor,
and you really kind of have to
have the view that the vendor's
not really going to tell you the
truth about the price or delivery,
and they're not gonna
deliver on time,
and when they do, it may not
even be the right part.
So, this is the Jano's creation.
And he had worked
on MRP systems,
but we all agreed that that probably
wasn't necessary for SAFIRE,
little did I say anything, we
have a very limited budget,
but it really did deserve a full-blown,
you know, materials purchasing system.
There's a lot of components.
So, there were times
that when, Jano,
I'd call him up and I could see his
eyes were like two little black dots,
but he hadn't run out the door yet, so I
knew there was still hope, and he survived.
 
So there he is, Jano's our control,
science, data acquisition guy.
He's the guy that is going to be
responsible and is responsible
for collecting all the data from
all the different instruments
and bringing them in and
coalescing, you might say,
and synchronizing the data
from all the instruments.
And so here we are at a lab, and
he's probably looking at...
So, we have to wire it up.
And we have to do checks, and
vacuum checks, and leak tests.
And then, we have fabrication.
Now, some say, well you know the
panel had to be fabricated,
and I didn't know how to split the
presentation up into different,
into the different
aspects, so, you know,
the panel did have to be fabricated,
but when we think of a fabrication,
we're thinking more on the lines of, you
know, machining and building and welding.
That's really cool to see
how things are made.
So, when we go to fabricate things,
ultimately you have to
get the raw materials,
and you have to get the parts,
and they have to be machined,
and they go on big boring mills, and they
go, you have to drill holes in them,
and you have to prepare the holes for
the feed through and the flanges
and the glass and all the different
parts, and this is what it takes to,
just in the fabrication level.
And there's a lot of parts.
And they all have to fit
together, the first time.
So, what we're doing
here right now,
we're welding the
flanges into the chamber,
and we're checking the welds.
I'll just like the audio
carry out here for a second.
 
If you have one pin hole,
you no longer have a stable
vacuum in your chamber.
And normally when you
build a machine this complex,
you're going to
have vacuum leaks.
And we do, at this stage.
We've got some work to do.
We may have to go
and discover,
we may discover that there's a pin
hole someplace in one of these welds.
And we'll have to come back and we'll have
to plug that weld.
And then we take delivery.
It's welded up.
And this is at Venture
Machine and DMI Precision.
We have moved SAFIRE from a laboratory in
Mississauga to another lab in Mississauga,
because basically
we ran out of room.
And this is the power supply.
It's a big boy, but it's DC, we have
extremely low for the electrical people,
we have extremely low ripple, which
means that the DC power is very clean,
which is a requirement of the
Electric Universe Model,
because nature expresses
electricity in DC form not AC,
although it may be that
there's responses.
I'm digressing here, but we take
delivery, and we're making preparations.
And part of the
preparations of course is,
well, if we've got a scratch on
the surface that's got a gasket,
it's got to be polished out.
And the surface, well, this is Scott, and he
offered his assistance, free of charge.
And he asked me, 
"Do you got a job for me?"
And I just had the job, and I said,
"Here's a stone; it's a very fine stone.
You see this big lip
across the chamber here?
Well, if you see any imperfections, see
if you can you can pull those out,
because every imperfection means that's
where we're going to have a gas leak."
I just let you know Scott, we don't
have any leaks in the chamber door.
And this is Leighton MacMillan. He's
on the team as well. He's not with us,
but everything has to be
cleaned with alcohol and
prepared before you start putting the
gaskets and the copper rings together.
This here is the new anode base.
What you're looking at is the
bulkhead, services through the anode,
because at this time around we
want to be able to bring other,
we want to cool the anode, ok,
we want to be able to
make sure that we didn't
see some of the failures
that we saw in Phase 1.
So, what you're seeing here is a heat
exchanger, and we have water coming up,
and we actually can, using a particular
taper, we can take a new anode
and shove it in there like
you do in a drill press,
and with a small screw
retain the anode.
We know from the Computational Fluid
Dynamics, the thermodynamics,
that the temperatures are going to
reach about 1,600 degrees Celsius.
So, you've got composites that are in
there, those plastics are going to melt.
So, we have to get
that heat away.
So, we're starting to
assemble the anode.
Actually the anode base,
the receiving base.
And this is the anode
isolation chamber
with it pulled back where we
can actually put the anode in.
And what you're looking at
here, actually, is this good?
Yeah. This is the
big gate valve.
So right now, the chamber can be in
vacuum, we close this gate valve,
and well we close it first,
we pull the anode first, we
better pull the anode out first.
OK, then we close the gate valve, and then
we open up the isolation chamber here,
so that we can get to the anode and replace
it, or do whatever kind of work that we want.
Then we close it back up,
open up the gate valve,
and we can bring the anode
back into the chamber.
And it works pretty slick.
This is a cathode.
This is one cathode.
There's a coffee cup, but
kinda give you some scale.
I didn't mean to leave the coffee cup
there, but I see that it's there, and
it's 3 feet in diameter, and the
copper's about 3/8 of an inch thick.
And the rings on the
back are for support,
because you get that kind of heat as you
know, with metals it'll start to warp.
So, we have to have structural
integrity as well.
And this is the
inside of SAFIRE.
We have a cathodes, the
anode, instrumentation ports,
and we're going to be looking
at some other things,
and just take you for a tour.
So Systems.
We're going to go
back to systems here.
And systems is how you get everything
to talk and work together.
Electrical, vacuum, water cooling
systems, there are a lot of systems.
There are primary vacuum systems;
there are secondary vacuum systems;
there's low vacuum and high vacuum;
there is high voltage systems,
medium voltage systems, and low
voltage systems used for controls.
There are data
acquisition systems,
computer numerically controlled-servo systems, air cooling systems.
 
Yes! And there are primary pneumatic
systems, secondary pneumatic systems,
gate valves switches, normally open,
normally closed, indicators lights,
red lights, green lights, pumps, valves, sensors,
burst systems, exhaust systems, compressors,
gas systems, diffusing
systems, gas analyzing system,
and an emergency stop big red button
in case one of the systems fails.
And I think that's it.
So it's complex.
This is the main vacuum pump, and it
sucks, big time.
It will It will take the chamber
down to 10 minus 3 or 2...3,
10 minus 2 in about 15 minutes.
OK, if anybody knows about,
anything about vacuum pumps,
this is from Oerlikon;
it's a particular pump.
The nice thing about this pump is
that all you have to cool is water,
because you got your
water cooling system,
but you've got nitrogen cooling and
diffusion line, what's that all about?
Well, what that's about, is if
you take a look at the middle,
it says nitrogen cooling
and diffusion line,
it allows us to run hydrogen in the
chamber, evacuate the hydrogen out,
and it allows us to introduce nitrogen
into the exhaust so that it's not dangerous.
You see?
So part of that, is part of the
mass spectrometers measuring
what the hydrogen content
is in the exhaust,
so we don't end up with dangerous fumes
coming out the exhaust system of the chamber.
Nice pump, expensive pump, it's
a really good pump.
It's a dry pump by the way.
Now, that's important because we don't
want any hydrocarbons in the chamber
other than what we
want to put in there.
We don't want oil bleeding back
through the pump into the chamber,
which we think we may have
had a problem Phase 1.
So, we're not gonna look
at the cryogenic pump.
We hear the word "cryogenic"
and really what it means
is you bring things down to
a very cold temperature,
just a few degrees above absolute
zero, and it condenses the gas,
and by doing that we can bring the chamber pressure down even lower.
Down, theoretically we should be
able to get down to 10 minus 7,
but I think operationally in order for us to
evacuate all the impurities that are in the chamber,
because we need to do that if we're
going to do good mass and optical
and spectral analysis, we need to
make sure the chamber's clean.
And there's really not many things
in the way of moving parts,
it basically uses helium to bring
the the the cryo-pump down.
I mean the temperature of the pump
down to a place where it condenses the gas.
We have, if you can see here,
part of what's going on here,
we also need to measure...
In the system, when we talk
about systems we have one,
what we call a thermal
vac pressure sensor,
because we need to monitor the pressure of
this system before we actually turn it on.
So, this is the feedback
that goes back to SAFCON.
This is just one.
We got the cooling
system, of course,
and we have to make sure that the
water that's going into the center of
SAFIRE is deionized water.
It doesn't have any
minerals in it
because the plasma, the anode
is charged at 5,000 volts.
So, we can use water
as long as it......um.....
So, we have to deionize the
water. And the temperatures,
we need to keep them low; so, we
use a re-circulation system,
because we can't afford to just bring
fresh water in and deionize it.
Deionized water will not
conduct electricity.
So, you can use water
to cool things down
as long as it doesn't have
any mineral content in it.
And so, we have a high pressure
pump and manifold system to
distribute the cooled water out
to the various characteristics,
or you might say parts of the
chamber, to keep them cool.
And we have a deionizer that actually monitors
the resistivity of the water as well.
This will give you an indication
of the complexities of SAFIRE,
to make something
like this work.
Primary Plasma
Measurement Instruments
Well, we've covered this before.
This is showing the equipment that we have
either on the floor or it's on route.
So Langmuir probe.
It took us about eight months to work out
with a Langmuir probe manufacturer
to get the right kind of
probe manufactured for SAFIRE.
These probes are approximately 6 feet
tall, and they're very, very sensitive.
The section here is
made of alumina,
which is like a very
fragile material,
but it's extremely good when it comes
to extremely nasty, hot environments.
And of course in the past, you've
seen the optical
spectrometer that we've been using to
get some of the signatures that we got,
and of course the mass
spectrometer itself.
Now, the mass spec is probably one of the more
important pieces of equipment in SAFIRE
because it tells us what we've got as
a constituent gas inside the chamber.
And it'll measure all the
elements, every 500 milliseconds,
and return that
information back to us.
So, we know that when the chamber has got
hydrogen in it, or if it's got argon,
or some other gas, or if we end up
with some strange species, as some,
we indicated at last
year's conference.
But what we did this time
is we said look, you know,
we want to measure in different
regions in the chamber;
we want to measure right down near the
anode; we want to measure the exhaust gas;
and so we have a system by which
with just a flip of a switch
we can sample any area
of SAFIRE at any time.
And this is what
goes on in SAFCON.
This is what goes on
in the control room.
Data Acquisition and
Systems Control.
 
And no scientific experiment would really be
complete unless you had a rats nest of wires,
and communication, and pressure systems,
and pressure and data acquisition, I mean.
So, this is Leighton, and
he is building, the,
I guess really might say, the
nervous system of SAFIRE.
And diagnostics, we
have to troubleshoot.
And all this information
comes back to SAFCON.
So, we know if there's
something getting in trouble;
we know if we got a pressure
leak, over pressure.
So, the main power supply,
as I said before,
it has a capability of delivering
200 kilowatts now, DC, clean.
We can control the voltage, and
we can control the current.
And you'll see what happens when
we didn't control the current.
 
I think this is Joel giving me a lecture;
Jano's listening intently.
And this is just before we
start to do the fire up of SAFIRE,
which you are going to see
in just a few minutes here.
Now for the EU, Don Scott and I've
talked back and forth a little bit
about the low energy discharges.
We can go from 0
up to 5,000 volts,
and we can go from 0 up to
35 amps or better actually,
but we have some work to
do to get it refined.
We have a lot of work to do.
We just fired up SAFIRE for
the first time last week.
The Gimbal,
As some of you know, it's a
primary instrument to use
to move a variety of instruments
freely through the SAFIRE chamber.
It's CNC computer
numerically controlled;
we have position accuracy to
almost a thousandth of an inch,
which means we can move
the Langmuir probe
through some of the double
layers that we've seen,
and start to examine
possibly Birkeland Currents,
and diagnose what's
actually going on there.
Maybe we get some answers as to
why there is charge separation.
Optical spectroscopy,
Langmuir probe measurements,
and other instruments can be
added and put into the gimbal.
And here it is here.
So, last year was a model, and
now you see the real thing.
And this will give an indication here,
I think it should start the movie,
yes, how smoothly
the gimbal works.
So, it's like a long needle and we can
bring the needle down into the plasma;
we can move it anywhere we want.
And we can use it
using a joystick,
or we can pre-program different
types of motions that are in there,
or different motions
that we can move.
If we wanted to move a comet around,
let's say the anode itself,
we wanted to move out towards the cathode
and measure at the anode at the same time.
There are two gimbals on SAFIRE,
and the patent was just filed
on Friday, yesterday actually.
So, that's pretty cool.
And this is all within the year.
So, we've been busy.
It's pretty tall.
The gimbal standing
would be right now,
I guess from where it's mounted, it'd
probably be close to 7 feet.
And now we're going to start up.
Ben [Ged Low] was kind enough to edit this
next video we're going to see
because there are certain
things that occurred,
and this is the startup
of SAFIRE Phase 2.
Take the voltage down!
Kill it! Kill it!
OK, so that was the first day.
And what I had forgot
was a little thing
that Don Scott and a couple
of us had talked about.
Instead of limiting the current on the
first discharge, I was limiting the voltage.
So, I was thinking, "OK, well, we just want
to get enough voltage to get it ignited."
But I should have actually
limited the current.
Now, what's missing out of this film here,
well actually, what I should say is
what you actually saw at the very end was
what we call a "plasma flow discharge"
and it resembles something like
the Death Star out of Star Wars.
OK, and what it does is an extremely intense ion
discharge to wherever it's going and its focus.
Well, what you don't know,
what you didn't hear,
was actually the power supply
was maxing out of 200 kilowatts
and the amount of energy
was impinging on a,
I thought the chamber of the time,
but it was a screw this big.
And what happened was I started,
you didn't see it in the video,
but I started to see all
the stuff flying off, OK.
And it was actually
vaporizing the screw.
I thought it was drilling a hole
in the side of the chamber.
So, Ben was kind enough to remove some
of the colloquialisms I was using
prior to him saying "shut it off" because
it was about 30 seconds in there that Joel
because we didn't actually
have you know the main control
actually hooked up inside
SAFCON at the time.
It was Joel sitting out and
standing out by the power supply
listening to us to please
turn it up or down,
and we're all screaming inside because
we're freaking out because we thought
we were just going to smoke a new hole in
SAFIRE, and we haven't even got it started yet.
So, Day 2, we learned
a few things.
We're going to see if we can control the
current this time and not let it eat
as much power as it would like. And so
what you're going to see next was Day 2.
And that was Day 2.
So, we thought that
was pretty cool too.
We thought okay we've got some good news. And 
now we can go to the conference and
tell everyone actually
it works, which is great.
Capabilities
Should we stop to talk now?
Should we talk about
capabilities?
I'm going to fily through these
quickly because I'm getting that
OK I've been up here long enough
and I might be boring you guys.
You're good?
OK, OK.
Well, because now that
we've got SAFIRE fired up,
the real work, hard work, science work,
elucidating cause and effect, starts.
That's when the Design
of Experiments starts.
And we can start to ask some of the
questions that we have been longing
to get some answers to
for a very long time.
So the capabilities.
So it has the ability to form a variety
of spherical plasma discharges.
And what I will say now I can't
get into some of the details
but we do have full control over all
aspects of the plasma discharge
according to Paschen's Law.
If you look into that, we can control
everything now as a variable for us.
Now, that's never been
done before, ever.
It can move instruments freely
through the plasma atmosphere.
It can do synchronous and
simultaneous measurements.
We're down to
picoseconds, by the way.
So, we can synchronize all the measurements
that we're taking into picoseconds.
That should be really important for
us because, as we move forward,
there are certain events that happen very
quickly, and we can capture those events.
And we can synchronize all the rest of the
instruments and do graphical overlay,
and we can see the
history or what
what was occurring in the chamber before
it actually led up to that event.
This is very important for us to do the
kind of diagnostics that we need to.
High-resolution video, materials testing,
material deposition, erosion test,
Langmuir probe analysis, optical
spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy,
near-ultraviolet light measurements,
infrared measurements, polarimetry,
Design of Experiments
methodology.
And Questions, questions
that we have:
Why do ions and electrons not
recombine in a double layer?
Why does ionized hydrogen not go
back to a stable hydrogen atom
when it's in a double layer?
What is the mechanism, what's the
process, why is it staying like this?
Why are double layers
in SAFIRE quasi-stable?
So, why do we form these spheres,
and they're quite stable?
We don't know. We don't
know why they form;
we have some ideas but we don't
know the mechanisms and processes.
We can recreate them because we
understand what leads up to them
but we don't understand
the physics.
Why do we get the huge energy
surges over 10 megawatts?
Maybe it has to do with
the paper that Lowell...
my name is on the paper too,
I edited some of the things
but Lowell really is the
master of that paper
on ion-electron trapping
in these double layers.
And this may be an answer to why the
Sun's photosphere is so intense;
maybe why, that's why, there appears to be
fusion occurring in the Sun's photosphere.
Are we getting transformation of elements?
Good question.
Are we getting more
energy out than in?
We could ask that
question all the time.
We think now we may be able to
answer some of these things.
What does the voltage gradient
look like before SAFIRE fires?
We can confirm right now that there is a
voltage gradient in SAFIRE in Phase 2
before it actually ignites.
But we can now go and
measure that gradient.
We may even be able to, we may even be
able to measure the voltage gradient
before it actually does an intense stream
plasma discharge to a particular point.
This is the thing that leads
up to lightning bolts.
What's actually the
environment around there,
that lightning bolt, before you actually
see a lightning bolt or plasma discharge.
So, is the voltage gradient, as an example,
it is uniform throughout the chamber?
We can measure these things now:
x-rays, neutrons, gamma
rays, and much more.
And that's really it
for this presentation.
So, we will leave you with this.
What I'm going to do
right now is invite
some of the like, really the people
that have been involved in SAFIRE.
People that you don't really hear about
up to the stage, introduce you to them,
and then I guess we're going to do a
question-and-answer with just the core team.
So, thank you! It's
been a privilege.

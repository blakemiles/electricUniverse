You've just entered the
theater of an alien sky.
If the words and images seem strange
to you, there's a reason for this.
Our world was once a
vastly different place.
To experience this won't hurt you,
and there is nothing to fear.
Archetype & Symbol
Is a unified approach possible?
In these Discourses, our goal has been to
identify the cross-cultural patterns of
world mythology and religious
symbolism, the Archetypes.
With these deepest patterns
as a starting point, our goal
has been to show how they arose under the
influence of extraordinary natural events.
Extraordinary events in the
ancient sky, events not occurring today
can only mean that a
fundamental assumption
guiding the theoretical
sciences is mistaken.
You can call this
'the uniformity principle.'
Simply put, it declares that
the present is the key to
the past, as today so before.
So astronomers typically draw on computer
simulations to represent the dynamic
motions of planets and
moons in ancient times.
All they need to do is run
their simulations in reverse.
Of course, if the underlined
conditions in the solar
system have changed, then it should go
without saying that the present could
not be the key to the past, in which case
computer simulations of ancient
conditions are simply
instruments of self-deception.
Based on systematic research
over more than 40 years, we've
challenged every idea derived
from modern assumptions.
It was explicit ancient evidence
that led us to describe
a gathering of planets close
to Earth in ancient times.
Our line of reasoning began
with a prehistoric mother goddess,
then led us upward to the first mythical
images inspired by a planetary gathering
we've called the 
polar configuration.
From that starting point, we could follow
the configuration's dynamic evolution
over time, observing its direct impact
on commemorative practices and ancient
storytelling on every
habitable continent.
By immersing ourselves in the
ancient evidence, we exposed the
substructure of myth-making globally,
when unstable planets extremely close to
Earth were seen as divine
rulers of the sky.
The ancient sky worshipers are in
fact the most compelling witnesses to
events that inspired every mythic
archetype we've now documented,
a unified and testable 
reconstruction.
From this radical vantage point, we've
asked entirely new questions.
Why did every culture on
Earth celebrate the towering
god at the center and
summit of the sky, a power
said to have presided
over a lost Golden Age?
What are the first creation
stories telling us?
What's meant by the repeated
insistence that the
creator himself brought forth a shining
home of the gods in primeval times?
Or the seemingly ludicrous location of
that dwelling at the celestial Pole?
Or the god's subsequent fall
from his primordial position?
In these stories we also meet a
larger caste of ancestral gods and
goddesses, a divine mother, a central star
of light and life magically radiating
her divine essence to the theater of the
gods, or the subsequent attack of a chaos
monster or Medusa figure seeking to
destroy the created world, or the
paradoxical identity of this very
monster as the terrible aspect
of the original love goddess, or a
warrior hero magically born to rescue
the world from unpredictable chaos
powers, or a cosmic mountain rising from
the abyss to support the divine
habitation above, or the Great Wheel
turning in the sky, the most revered
symbol of the sovereign god, the goddess
and the Warrior in their
primeval conjunction.
Though the stories have come
down to us in diverse forms, the
transformative realization is the
discovery that different words and
different mythic interpretations point to
the same archetypal substructure of
world mythology and symbolism.
In the end, we've learned,
it's this underlying unity
that opens the door to a mind-altering
shift in perception, the realization that
our cosmic environment
has radically changed.
What has come down to us as
elusive fragments can then be seen as
echoes of an alien sky, still
haunting us from the past.
The surprising truth today
is that a massive library of known
archetypes can now be named, though not a
single archetype has ever been explained
in conventional terms,
not a single one.
Yes, we've all seen various claims to
have explained one archetype or another,
but then, when we investigate, we discover
that no proposed explanation has
actually met the acid test.
No one has identified a natural
condition under which the archetype
would be explicitly expected.
In contrast to this state of
things, we've named many
dozens of widely distributed archetypes,
all inseparately connected to each
other and all suggesting a concrete but
extraordinary cause in natural
experience, which means that the events
from which the ancient myths arose
are not occurring today.
In this new paradigm, no
archetype lies outside a
plausible explanation and every
archetype leads to a larger, inseparably
connected, complex of themes.
The universal myth of an original
paradise or golden age leads invariably
to memories of a founding 
King, the first
in the line of Kings presiding over the
golden age, but then we meet the
outrageous identity of that luminary as
an ancient Sun god seen in the sky
before the present Sun and then, even
more outrageous is the explicit identity
of that primeval sun as the
now remote planet Saturn.
And still more outrageous
is the location of the improbable power
at the celestial Pole, a location never
visited by any planet in our sky today.
Hence the logical question, how could a
concrete, highly coherent, set of ideas
arise to find direct and obvious
observation at every turn?
Of course, the reasonable
answer is that the coherence
is due to a human experience as yet
unrecognized, not imagination, conjuring
worlds never experienced.
In all of this, we see that it's the
traditions closest to the original human
experience that leads us to the
most extraordinary story elements.
Here we confront the
descent of the world into
chaos and darkness,
the attack of a fiery
serpent or dragon, the heaven-altering
wars of the gods, and most significantly,
the Earth-shaking power of the cosmic
thunderbolt--weapon simply out of this
world with no similarity to lightning in
today's sky but perfectly matching the
complex morphology of
high-energy electric
discharge in the
plasma laboratory.
Suddenly, a revolutionary
scientific interpretation enters the
picture, shifting the attention to new
fields of evidence--all confirming the
same underlying story, 
and of course the
end of the story is just as 
extraordinary as the rest, the renewal of
celestial order within a
radically transformed world.
But just consider the
big picture implications.
From beginning to end, the
ancient narrative affirms
that today's sky bears no connection
to the primeval sky under which the
myth-making phase of 
human history arose.
And what distinguishes that environment,
above all else, is the pervasive impact
of an extraordinary planetary system,
highly electrified, as we shall next
demonstrate, and provoking all of
humanity to entirely new forms of
cultural expression.

Good afternoon.
This is a great conference,
it takes a huge amount of work and an
effort to organize an event like this,
so, to all the organizers,
thank you very much.
I'm glad...
I'm glad to be here today and talk
to you about the instrumentation,
data acquisition, data
transformation and analysis.
My job with the SAFIRE team is to not
only collect data from the experiment
but the collect it in such a way
so that it can be used after
an experiment has been done
for our team to more easily see
relationships between various events
that are occurring
during the experiment.
Further to this point is to also be able
to pull the data from an experiment,
so we can do detailed analysis
on those relationships.
In these data and the integrity...
it is these data and the
integrity of these data,
which is vital to the quality
of the work that we do.
But first, I would like to talk to
you about what is an experiment,
how experiments were done in the past
and how the SAFIRE team does them today.
An experiment is a procedure to
test a concept or hypotheses.
The reasons why we do
experiment is to gain insight
into what causes are involved
in an observed effect,
which may support the hypothesis or
show that the hypothesis is false.
Galileo's hypothesis was that on Earth
all object fall at the same rate,
but prior to these most people thought
that the heavy ball should drop faster.
Galileo found that his
hypothesis was correct,
but the big question
became, why?
Why are they dropping
at the same rate?
It was not until Sir Isaac Newton
defined the law of gravity,
that scientists started to understand
why the balls fell and the same rate.
So, as science progresses and
experiments become more sophisticated
the causes of effects become
more difficult to determine.
This also means it is more important to
conduct a robust or repeatable experiments
and use measurement devices capable
of high degree of accuracy.
It also becomes more challenging
to clearly show to everyone
the causes of a
particular effect.
I want to introduce the important
concept of time in an experiment
we start over the beaker of cold water and
we are going to heat the water one way
and then we will hit the
water by any another method
you need to add a stopwatch
and the thermometer,
so we can see how long it
takes to boil the water.
Now if you added the heat
we will watch and document how
long it takes the water to boil.
After approximately 10 minutes,
the water comes to full boil.
But then I ask myself, is there more
effective and quicker way to hit the water?
I had the idea that if you could use
the afterburner of an American F18
that might be a more effective
method to heat the water.
I discovered that,
in fact I was right.
It took approximately 0.05 nanoseconds, to
not only hit the water, but vaporize it.
and the beaker with it.
I suggested to Monte that
we should keep the F18,
but he was mumbling something
about budget constraints.
Now, back in today, when
scientists work in the laboratory
they had to document
everything manually,
as experiments got more complex
it required more scientists
to record and collect data
they created procedures on
how to collect the data.
Aligning the data to the same time
line was a challenge in the past
as it is today.
Then plott of the data and
finally do analysis of the data
to determine the
cause of the effects.
So, as experiments
become more complex
the necessity of more sophisticated
methods of measurement
become vital to the
success of the experiment.
Let us have a look at the
progress of the data acquisition
specifically in this case
capturing of what have seen.
This picture of the Egyptian Sun was most
likely creative with a hammer and chisel.
In the mid 1800's an astronomer
and physicist Warren de La Rue
design and built the first cube photograph,
used to photograph the sun's corona.
For his time this was a major
scientific breakthrough,
since up until this time no known photographs
of the sun's corona ever existed.
But as we all know advances in the technology
of the ions have help humanity in many ways
and we now have through the hard
work of Lockheed Martin and NASA
the Solar Dynamics Observatory.
What we are looking at
is a full disk multi-wavelength Extreme
Ultra Violet image of the Sun,
taken by SDO on March 30th 2010.
For scholars trace different
gas temperatures,
and these temperatures are
represented in their own images
as the Olight spectrometer
returns this light spectra.
At the top of this graph we are looking at
the SDO broad light spectrum from the Sun.
Below we are looking at
the actual light spectra
converted to specific
light wavelength peaks,
every element and it's very specific light
spectral signature, when it is ionized.
And it is by using optical
spectroscopy you can tell
what elements make up
the light from the Sun.
or, in our case, the light
is coming from SAFIRE
this is a SAFIRE plasma
discharge and the light we get.
And this is an example of spectral signatures
we get back from the optical spectrometer.
The SAFIRE experiment is based on Monte's
announces of the electric Sun model
of charged plasma affecting the matter
of a different electrical potential.
So, we introduce electrical power
in the form of voltage and current
than chamber pressure
and plasma gas types.
And when these factors are
introduced into the experiment,
then we measure these responses:
Plasma voltage and current;
Chamber pressure;
Plasma gas types;
Light spectra;
Langmuir probes voltages;
Temperature;
Video capture;
Photography.
Here is a picture of
phase one of SAFIRE
showing the array of many instruments
we are using to acquire data.
As each instrument
is acquiring data
we also recorded video of each
instrument computer monitor.
This is the mass spectroscopy,
this is a screen of voltage
current and pressure gauge,
this is a screen of
the light spectra.
And we also conduct
synchronize video recording
of the changes in the SAFIRE
chamber in real time,
this then consolidate all the video
feeds into one master video,
as a video recording
of each experiment.
This is the grand tour of the video, it
helps our team very effectively recognize
the points of interest that
happened during the experiment.
Let us investigate how data
acquisition devices work.
You have seen some of the results, now let's
take a look at the vorish under the root.
There is an analog-to-digital converter at
the heart of each data acquisition device.
The controller connects the data acquisition
device and collects the digital data.
The computer communicates
with the controller,
reach the controller's
data and stores the data.
The data acquisition path follows
from the data acquisition device
through the controller into the
computer where all the data is stored.
A data transformation engine takes
all the data from the experiment
and transforms the data into
comprehensive graphical overlays
and this is to help the SAFIRE
team to analyze the data
looking for causes of the effects
the observer of the time.
Here we have thousands of data
points of the plasma current,
now be overly the voltage,
and high pressure measurements,
and high vacuum pressure measurements
and these are just a few,
there are thousands and
thousands of data points.
But what we see is that in
this region, for example,
after the pressure drop in the chamber, there
is a huge spike in voltage and current.
The data transformation
engine allows us
to zoom into these regions
with extremely high resolution
and we see that both, the
voltage and current,
are discharging out in
this region of the graph.
What we discovered was quite
profound, that during a short time
SAFIRE had an intense plasma discharge
that measured over 2 million watts.
What is so profound is that we limited
the input power to only 1800 watts.
The transformation engine
allows us to zoom in
and examine in extremely high
detail these points of interests.
It is these kind of information
that helps us determine
what factors need to be used
in the design of experiments
that Dr. Paul Anderson
will present now.
Thank you.

Well I think I'll start with what I call a
“head” note. You've heard of footnotes,
right? Well “prologue” sounds a little
formal and so I’m calling it a “head” note.
My first experience with the Electric
Universe conference was 15 years ago.
I believe the group was called Kronia
then and much smaller; maybe eight
speakers, maybe 40 attendees. At first,
the subject matter really mystified me, and
the context of what the different
speakers were talking about and how it
intertwined, was a mystery. But I was
really fortunate, I sat next to the late
Amy Acheson, a brilliant mind and one of
the pioneers of this group. Back then I
think it was called Kronia. It wasn't
called EU then. Amy patiently answered
every question, but I scribbled on paper
and shoved at her during the conference.
And she'd whisper back and she'd write
the answers. During breaks and during
lunch she'd answer more questions.
Eventually, Amy became a very good friend
and my mentor. It wasn't long before all
those questions got patiently answered
by Amy, that I got it and I was hooked.
Through the years, I have come to
understand the Electric Universe more
and more and have made many dear friends,
many of whom I see out there today.
I wish Amy were here today, to see how
the EU has grown, expanded not only in
size, but in context for the speakers. The
talk I'm about to give is my way of passing
on Amy’s mentoring and hopefully help those
of you who are new to the EU, to see the
big picture. There are many paths to
discovering the nature of our universe.
Established members of the Electric
Universe, Dave Talbott, Wal Thornhill, Ev
Cochrane, Dwardu Cardona, have been
focusing on different aspects of the
nature of the world that surrounds us.
And yet they have to offer
interconnections, the ways that
interconnect in an intriguing way. Those
interested in the EU, who specialize in
the areas of planetary history, mythology
electricity, plasma, geology, archaeology
and prehistoric man, often have
hypotheses that interconnect and support
each other, and thus suggesting a history
and a present-day understanding of our
universe that is revolutionary and
compelling. A fascination with the
universe that surrounds us, dates back to
an age long before there were telescopes,
space probes, or shuttle missions. When
prehistoric man cast his eyes to the
heavens, pictographs of a
great diversity of early cultures
independently depict man's fascination
with, and fear of, what he observed. Myths
and lore tell of strange and violent
events, terrifying dramas in the heavens,
and catastrophic changes in the cosmic
order itself. Early man built temples to
the heavenly figures he worshipped as gods.
The myths and pictographs of antiquity
clearly show that at
one time, our eyes
saw a vastly different sky from what
astronomers view in their instruments
today. As Wal Thornhill has stated,
today's narrowly compartmentalized
specialists have a form of tunnel vision,
because they are not trained to see any
relevance in other fields than their own.
Or merely refer to observations no more
than a few years old. Don Scott has
observed that most astrophysicists’
education stops with Einsteinian
gravity and have little or no knowledge
of electrical science, and thus come
up with convoluted explanations for
phenomena they don't understand, or they
call mysteries: black holes, dark energy,
string theory and the Big Bang. At
one of our EU conferences Pierre Marie
Robitaille presented impressive
fundamental scientific evidence that one
of the favorite, universally
applied principles of astrophysics is
not as generally valid as had been
assumed. Kirchhoff's law of radiation,
together with Max Planck's derivation of
it, are often assumed to be applicable in
about just any case, even when they
really are not. The idea that a peak in
the emissivity characteristic from any
body whatsoever, will reveal the exact
temperature of that object, no
matter what it's composition, is
fatally flawed. Pierre Marie and Stephen
Crothers, an expert mathematician, have
published a groundbreaking paper,
”The Theory of Heat Radiation Revisited.”
Pierre Marie has given numerous
presentations, (he'll be giving another
one here today, or at least
during this conference),
pointing out that many previously
accepted research results are fatally
flawed. Their work, as with so many other
EU researchers, have been met by the
establishment with denial, derision or
been ignored. Ev Cochrane, author of the
book, “The Many Faces of Venus”,
observes that the recent history of the
scientific investigation of Venus,
reveals a vast theoretical graveyard of
discarded hypotheses, false deductions,
erroneous premises, shoddy observations,
and wishful thinking. While many
astronomers, Carl Sagan among them,
expected the Venusian clouds to
be composed of water, Mariner 9
found precious little water and plenty
of concentrated sulfuric acid. Cochrane
notes that where leading astronomers
observed luxuriant Venusian vegetation
in full bloom, modern space probes
discovered a barren desiccated wasteland.
Indeed, if truth be known, the Mariner,
Magellan and Pioneer missions have
forced astronomers to radically revise
their previous assessment as to Venus's
origin, nature and geological history.
Cochrane states than on virtually every
major feature of the Venusian landscape
and atmosphere, the astronomers’
theoretical expectations have been
proved wrong, time and time again. Given
this dismal record, there would appear to
be some justification for maintaining a
healthy skepticism with respect to
astronomers’ current best guesses as to
what is possible regarding
Venus's recent history,
or possibly that of other planets as well.
Indeed, there are good reasons for
believing that other, even more radical
revisions of our understanding of Venus
are in order. Many traditional
astronomers and mythologists dismiss
early stories and drawings as the
fantasies of primitive cultures, lacking
an understanding of what they saw.
However, comparative mythologists Dave
Talbott, Ev Cochrane and Dwardu Cardona,
have found that there is a consistent pattern
in these stories. When many different,
widely separated cultures, tell the same
story, the probability exists that
these are not mere flights of fancy,
but valid observations. If astronomers
today were to re-examine their
assumptions about what is and is not
possible in the cosmos, and take a new
and unbiased look at the pictures coming
back from NASA's probes, as well as the
images from their own telescopes, they
would find strong evidence to support a
view of cosmology different from the one
espoused by mainstream astronomers. One
that ancient man saw all too clearly.
Dave Talbott notes that in earlier times,
man worshipped heavenly bodies as gods.
Myths proclaimed, we once lived in the
presence of gods. Gods were visible
powers, often capricious and frequently
violent. The priestly astronomers of
ancient Mesopotamia and elsewhere, made
clear that these remarkable powers were
planets. If the myths surrounding these
gods were to be taken seriously,
they raised many questions. Why did
ancient man worship the god Saturn?
The planet Saturn is very difficult for
the average person to even find in the sky
today. Some mythologies postulate that
there is evidence in ancient lore to
connect the scarred warrior hero of
legend with the god Mars. Yet the planet
we know as Mars is only a tiny speck in
the sky and its deep 2,400 mile long
scar canyon, Valles Marineris cannot be
seen from Earth without a powerful
telescope. Why did the ancients depict
Venus as a fiery dragon, as a goddess
with flowing hair, when that planet is
merely a bright dot in the sky today. The
myths of many ancients tell of violent
thunderbolts in interaction between the
gods. Of course, we see lightning in the
(sky) today, but never thunderbolts that
streak between planets. What could have
caused these violent interactions long
ago? Because of their understanding of
plasma, electrified gas, that makes up
90% of our universe, Wal Thornhill and Don
Scott have formulated some reasonable
hypotheses as to the cause of such
violent interactions of the past.
Relating to the present electric sky,
Scott has studied the behavior of plasma
in the form of Birkeland currents (I think
you've heard of that), and spoke at
the last two EU conferences about their
counter-rotating currents (I think you've
seen that picture recently too), that are
descending on the North Pole of Saturn.
Shortly after he showed diagrams of his
hypotheses of these rotating
current Birkeland currents,
shortly after, not long, a video produced
by NASA appeared on the Internet
clearly showing exactly what Scott had
predicted. And yet, his proposal of just
such a thing, and the reason
for it, has been ignored.
Another hypothesis, and the reason for
it that proved to be real, was Thornhill's
prophecy that, if a comet were to be
impacted by a block of copper, as NASA
announced it proposed to do, a powerful
electrical discharge would occur shortly
before impact. Although NASA never
predicted such a possibility, this is
exactly what happened. Since that
event, Thornhill's explanation of the
electrical discharge has either been
ignored or denigrated, most likely
because those in the astrophysical world
have developed a collective mindset
against any sort of electrical causality
in the universe. An excellent resource
for information about the Electric
Universe is the website Picture Of the
Day, managed by the industrious EU
scholar. Thunderbolts picture of the day
remember it and check it out. You'll
get a lot of interesting information there.
Prehistoric man was also fascinated by
our universe, as are Scott and Thornhill
today, but often what the ancients chose
to depict has little bearing on what we
see in the cosmos. Talbott notes that
pictographs show what is commonly
considered to be the Sun as a huge
disk, with a smaller one in the center,
often with rays flowing out of it. With
a third darker circle superimposed in
the center. Our Sun looks nothing like
that. In many different cultures we see
the symbol of a Crescent
with a star at the center. How
could this be, when there is no star or
planet closer to Earth than our Moon to
form such a configuration. And
most importantly, why do so many...
.... and most importantly
why do so many disparate
and far-flung ancient cultures, people
who could never have come in contact
with one another, such as the Sumerians,
Egyptians, Chinese, Native Americans, Mayans,
Babylonians, Australian Aboriginals and
many others, all tell the same story and
draw similar pictures? If these ancient
writings were based on valid
observations, rather than
fantasy, what do they tell us?
Cardona, Cochran and Talbott theorize
that Earth formerly moved in a linear
alignment of planets, (which I think is
the picture that's been here a little
early) having no resemblance to our
current solar system. As seen from Earth,
several planets appear together as a
towering form in the northern sky. In its
stable phase the planets moved in
collinear equilibrium. They stayed in a
line as they moved through space. For
observers on Earth, the result was a
unified configuration in the heavens,
visually dominated by a large glowing
planet, one we theorize to have been
Saturn, then seen without its present
ring system. This highly unusual
planetary assembly was centered on our
North Pole. it was regarded around the
world as the cosmic center, the theater
of the Gods. Talbott offers
that this can only mean that
the axis of the earth
was directed along a line
running through the collinear system.
When the earliest religious texts and
mythological sources are permitted to
speak for themselves, this is precisely
the arrangement they describe. What the
ancients were seeing when they depicted
the Sun as three concentric disks, was a
different alignment of planets from the
one we see today. They suggest that at
one time, Earth was in a different polar
alignment, an alignment Talbot, Cochrane
and Cardona theorize as having been
Saturn, Venus and Mars. The large
outer disk in the pictographs being
Saturn; the next inner disk representing
Venus, often with rays emanating from it;
and the center dark or red disk being
Mars. The view of a crescent with a star-
like body at its center is impossible.
However, if it would indeed be the
scene viewed from Earth in its polar
alignment, if the Crescent were Saturn
somewhat illuminated by the Sun, and the
star-like object Mars, superimposed upon
Venus. Interdisciplinary physicist Wal
Thornhill ventures that at one time,
Earth may have been in the protective
aura of a cool brown dwarf star, the
proto-Saturn which provided an ideal
atmosphere for life on Earth. Given
this configuration, Earth would have been
bathed in Saturn's constant beneficent
glow, with no difference between day and
night, and a continual benign
single season. This would have been the
”time before time” that Dave Talbott
theorizes ,was the golden age, the age of
perfect virtue, or Garden of Eden,
depicted in one way or another in all
diverse myths and religions. our early
forebears portrayed celestial events
through ritual reenactment and storytelling,
bringing the original celestial
personalities down to earth, to become
legendary ancestors of those telling
the stories. By this identification with the
gods, nations the world over became
the special children of the mythic creator
and the creator himself often
metamorphosed into a legendary first
king, or god, of the land. Sacred activity
was enacted the world over, as humans
relived cosmic events on Earth. Two
primal motifs stand out: a nostalgia for
the lost paradise of the Golden Age, and
a fear of doomsday. A fear of Doomsday's
return, fueling collective war,
sacrifice and guilt. A group of
astronomers, physicists, electrical
engineers and experts in the field of
ancient mythology, have begun to
challenge some of the generally accepted
hypotheses of the history of our solar
system, and conventional theories of
cosmology, and agree that our solar
system had a catastrophic past. A
common theme in the myths and
religions of many disparate cultures, is
of a doomsday that brought the Golden
Age to an end. Could it be that a
disturbance and the Saturn polar
alignment was the doomsday these
cultures each independently remembered?
The exact cause of the eventual breakup
of this polar alignment, is a mystery. It
may have been the result of a close pass-
by of an asteroid, or a comet. Perhaps
an inherent instability of the alignment
resulted in its natural dissolution.
Whatever the cause of the
break-up, we know the final result is what we
see today: the placid, almost circular,
well-separated orbits of our present
solar system. Dwardu Cardona
hypothesized that what became known
as the creation, did not proceed out of
nothing but out of a pre-existing
chaotic substance that was, among other
things, understood as a celestial ocean,
circumscribing the sub-brown dwarf star
that emitted the radiating light and that
went down into mytho-history as Day
One. Many skeptics say there is no
mechanism that could have circularized
the widely divergent paths of the
planets that were ejected from the polar
configuration. Electrical engineer Don
Scott points out that plasma physics
shows us that planets can interact
electrically, if they are within each
other's protective plasma sheets
magnetospheres’ electrical repulsion
that is alternately felt when the
planet sheets intersect and then not
felt when the sheets do not intersect,
could circularize orbits relatively
quickly. In addition, there is strong
evidence that gravity and mass itself are
dependent on electrical charge. Traveling
along another path to present-day
understanding of our universe, is Scott's
suggestion that the workings of the
Sun's photosphere can be characterized
by and better understood via a detailed
study of how an electronic transistor
performs its functions within an
electronic circuit. Several unique
phenomena observed on and above the
Sun's surface are relatively easily
understood through the analogous
behavior of Scott's transistor model of
the Sun. Another question that relates to
the enigma of how Earth is different
today from ancient times is the size of
the giant dinosaurs. Given what we know
about mass-to-muscle ratio, there is no
way these huge beasts could have held
up their heads, much less walked in the
gravity that we have at present. Could a
different planetary arrangement and/or
electrical charge on Earth have provided
the decreased gravity they allowed these
giants to stand up and walk? Although
there are questions about the Earth's
gravity at the time of the dinosaurs,
it is widely acknowledged that their
rapid demise was caused by a catastrophe.
Somehow our gravity and our environment
have changed, probably abruptly and
perhaps repeatedly. It is well-known that
there is a universal memory of doomsday-
type catastrophes, from age-old tales of
floods, fearsome thunderbolts in the sky,
and an age of darkness that descended
upon the Earth. The question is, how did
these catastrophes come about. Certainly
for the planets to change their
alignments and gravity, cataclysms of
gigantic proportions must have occurred.
Islands in the Arctic that consists more
of shattered bones than of earth, ancient
cities submerged in oceans, sea shell
fossils found on mountaintops, and behemoths
found flash-frozen in the Arctic with
palm fronds in their stomachs, are
evidence of such violent events. Arcing
and scarring are strong indications of
past cataclysmic events in the solar
system. Wal Thornhill proposes that the
Valles Marineris scar on Mars may well
have it been made by an electrical
discharge and that the Grand Canyon in
Arizona, right here, could
have been formed in the same
manner. The origin of the Grand Canyon
has long been in controversy and
geologists are presently rethinking
their long-held theories in this area.
Those in the EU ask, if the canyon were
caused by a river, where is the delta, the
debris and why are the so-called
tributaries perpendicular, rather than at
an angle, as is typical of
river tributaries? From the air,
the Grand Canyon resembles a Lichtenberg
pattern, a pattern that is carved
on a golf green, when the pole is hit by
lightning. If you look at the Grand
Canyon from the air that Lichtenberg
pattern looks very much like the Grand Canyon.
Thornhill points out in his work, The
Electric Universe, that plasma pervades
the solar system and arcing will occur
when and if, charged bodies interact
electrically. Makes sense to me. He
proposes that it is just such arcing
that has caused craters on planets, and
asteroids, and moons, and even on Earth. He
postulates that pictures of craters,
coming back from our space probes, do not
show a shape consistent with either the
impact or volcanic models. Almost every
crater we observe is round, not
elliptical, as many of them would be, if
the meteors were coming in at an angle.
They have flat bottoms, often with
conical central cones. The strata of the
central peaks are undisturbed, and in
many so-called ‘impact craters’, their
walls are terraced. Secondary craters
form on the rims of primary craters.
Plasma physicist Dr. C.J. Ransom has
simulated such craters in his Vemasat
Laboratory via an electrical arc.
Thornhill has demonstrated in the
laboratory, that such characteristics are
expected with electrical arcing, but not
with impacts. On some small asteroids, the
craters are huge, with diameters
more than the asteroids’ radii.
If these craters had been caused by
impacts, surely the asteroids would have
been destroyed. Are these craters
caused by electrical arcing? That's the
the phenomenon that was interpreted as
the thunderbolts that raged between the
gods, or planets, as described in
ancient myths. A corollary to Thornhill's
Electric Universe Theory, is a theory
that engineer Ralph Juergens originated
concerning the mechanism that powered the
Sun. Following in Juergens’ path, Donald
Scott contends that mainstream
astronomy is attempting to ignore data that
contradicts their accepted nuclear
fusion model. He suggests that both the
polar configuration and the electric
hypotheses are strongly supported by
research in the field of plasma science.
Scott's carefully crafted mathematical
model of Birkeland currents, shows how
energy in electrical form is transported
across huge distance in cosmic space,
without being dissipated and diverted
from its path. Scott was the first person
to demonstrate that the magnetic field
within a Birkeland current, reaches
outward and remains effective at far
greater distances than any other known
type of cosmic phenomenon. He has
explained the physical rationale for why
the orbital distances of the planets
from the Sun, correlate perfectly with
certain properties of his Birkeland
current model. Might the flowing
hair of Venus, or the fiery dragon,
as that planet is depicted in many
ancient myths and drawings, actually have
been the glowing ions of twisting
Birkeland currents, or stringy things as
mainstream calls them? Perhaps
petroglyphs, showing ladder formations,
and tales of a ladder to heaven, or
Jacob's Ladder, might well be the
sightings of Birkeland currents and
plasma instabilities, such as those Tony
Peratt has seen in his plasma
laboratories at Los Alamos. It is
interesting to note, how often a planet, a
sphere, is included in pictures of a
Chinese dragon. Astrophotographs taken
at Mount Palomar and Mount Wilson by
astronomer Halton Arp, have removed
one of the main linchpins supporting
standard modern cosmology. Astronomers
traditionally assume that, if an object
such as a galaxy strongly exhibits a
quality called positive redshift, then
that object must be 1) receding rapidly
away from us and 2) very distant. This
assumption has led astronomers to
pronounce the existence of such
counterintuitive notions as Big Bang,
missing matter, black holes, neutron stars,
dark energy and expanding curved space.
Dozens of Arp’s photographs provide
strong evidence that the ‘redshift equals
distance’ assumption is wrong. Arp
theorized, based not only on his own
photographs, but also an images being
taken by X-ray satellites such as
ROSAT, that there is an evolutionary
process of galaxy birth and maturation.
Young objects are born from the active
nuclei of parent galaxies. These youngsters
are called quasars or BL Lac objects.
They are often ejected symmetrically
from the parent galaxy along its semi-
major polar axis, perpendicular to the
plane of the parent. This ejection
process is strongly supported by the
Electric Plasma Universe theory of
Thornhill, Scott and Peratt. The thread
that connects all of these innovative
researchers is they're willing to base
their hypotheses on the data they
observe and change these hypotheses as
new data is received. Too often,
scientists stop asking questions
and try to adjust new incoming
data to their preconceived and accepted
theories. The Electric Universe
proponents, representing a variety of
disciplines, are aware of how vastly
different fields that date back to the
earliest of time, can intertwine and
discover rational new hypotheses about
our universe. The most important element
in the search for truth is the
asking of questions. The advocates
of the Saturn model polar configuration
and the Electric Universe are asking
fundamental questions, based upon
what they have observed on the paths of
discovery they have taken, and as a result
have proposed some reasonable hypotheses.
All they ask now is that they be
listened to and that the listeners open
their eyes and their minds to the
possibility of new paths to discovery of
some very reasonable ideas. Thank you.

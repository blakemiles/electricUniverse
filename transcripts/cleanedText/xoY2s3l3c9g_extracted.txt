Reinterpreting the MAVEN Mission to Mars
What I want to do in this
presentation is to tell you a story.
Scientists have that story,
of course, about Mars
and they've modeled it on
the story of the Earth.
In fact they've
already decided on
the equivalent of the geological
ages of the Earth for Mars.
They have the Amazonian period
and that kind of thing.
In other words, all they've done is to
transfer the story of the Earth to Mars.
What I want to do is to alert you to
the fact that there's a spacecraft
which is due to arrive
at Mars in September.
Which is aimed at answering
questions that the
story that the scientists
believe about Mars is correct.
And they want to try and learn about
the reason why Mars lost its water.
There is this belief that there was a
time when Mars was much like the Earth.
But they want to find
out what went wrong.
I'm here to tell you that
whatever conclusions they draw,
it will be based on wrong ideas.
So the opportunity is there
for you in this audience,
after I've told
my story of Mars,
to be able to compare
it later this year,
with the kinds of stories that
come out of NASA and ESA.
So to make it clear what this
particular spacecraft is supposed to do,
I have a video which will,
I hope, explain it.
Billions of years ago, when the planets
of our solar system were still young,
Mars was a very different world.
Liquid water flowed in long rivers that
emptied into lakes and shallow seas.
A thick atmosphere blanketed
the planet and kept it warm.
In this cozy environment, living
microbes might have found a home,
starting Mars down the path toward
becoming a second life-filled planet,
next door to our own.
But that's not how
things turned out.
Today, Mars is bitter-
cold and desiccated.
The planet's thin, wispy
atmosphere provides scant cover
for a surface marked by dry
riverbeds and empty lakes.
If Martian microbes still exist,
they're probably eking out a meager existence
somewhere beneath the dusty Martian soil.
What happened?
This haunting question has
long puzzled scientists.
To find the answer, NASA is sending a
new orbiter to Mars called MAVEN.
The goal of MAVEN
is to figure out
what processes were responsible for
those changes in Martian climate,
says Bruce Jakosky,
principal investigator for MAVEN at the
University of Colorado at Boulder.
Scheduled for launch in November 2013
and due to arrive in September 2014,
MAVEN is bristling with instruments
to study Mars' upper atmosphere.
That's where many researchers
believe the answer lies.
The only way Mars could have been
wet and warm four billion years ago
is, if it also had a
thick atmosphere.
CO₂ in the Martian atmosphere
is a greenhouse gas,
just as it is in
our own atmosphere.
A thick blanket of CO₂ and
other greenhouse gases
would have provided the warmer temperatures
and greater atmospheric pressure required
to keep liquid water from
freezing solid or boiling away.
Somehow, Mars lost
most of that blanket.
One possibility is
the solar wind.
Unlike Earth, Mars is not protected
by a global magnetic field.
Instead, it has magnetic umbrellas
scattered around the planet
that shelter only part
of the atmosphere.
Erosion of exposed
areas by solar wind
might have slowly stripped the
atmosphere away over billions of years.
Recent measurements of isotopes
in the Martian atmosphere
by the Mars rover Curiosity,
support this idea.
Light isotopes of hydrogen and argon are
depleted compared to their heavier counterparts,
suggesting that they
have been lost to space.
Scientists have also speculated that the
planet's surface might have absorbed the CO₂
and locked it up in
minerals such as carbonate.
However, while carbonates have
been found on the surface,
they aren't present in enough abundance
to account for an early thick atmosphere.
MAVEN will be the first mission to Mars
specifically designed to help scientists
understand the ongoing escape of
CO₂ and other gases into space.
The probe will orbit Mars for
at least one Earth year.
At the elliptical orbit's low point, MAVEN
will be 125 kilometers above the surface.
Its high point will take it more than
6,000 kilometers out into space.
MAVEN's instruments will
track ions and molecules
in this broad cross-section
of the Martian atmosphere
thoroughly documenting the flow of CO₂ and
other molecules into space for the first time.
MAVEN's instruments also will
measure the solar energetic inputs
into the Martian upper atmosphere,
and the atmospheric response.
This will allow us to determine the processes
that are responsible for that loss to space.
Once Jakosky and his colleagues know
how quickly Mars is losing CO₂ right now
and what might be
causing that loss,
they can extrapolate backward in time
to estimate the total amount lost
during the last
four billion years.
MAVEN will determine if loss to
space was the most important player
in driving Martian climate
change, Jakosky says.
In the grand scheme
of the solar system,
Earth orbits alongside a world that began
with as much promise for life as our own
yet turned out so differently.
After all these years, MAVEN
could write the final chapter
in a haunting planetary mystery.
What we have here? A whole string
of wrong ideas about Mars,
the history of the solar system,
the history of the Earth,
and the recent history
of these planets.
So this 4.6 billion year old
clockwork solar system is a myth!
Of course, by studying mostly meteorites
and using radioactive dating techniques,
specifically looking
at daughter isotopes,
scientists think they have determined that
the solar system is 4.6 billion years old.
But this requires that the solar
system has not been disturbed
to any great degree
since it was formed.
It also relies on the idea that it was
formed in the way that was advertised
and that is via a nebula.
What I want to do in this talk is to show
you that the story is completely different
and it's much more interesting than
the fairy tale we've been taught.
No theory of planet
formation works.
But that doesn't stop us seeing
and hearing through the media
the familiar story about the 4.6 billion
year old formation of the planets.
In the case of the Earth, there is
all these unanswered questions.
Why do we have an
atmosphere of oxygen?
Where did all the
nitrogen come from?
And why do we have
so much water?
In fact, why is there so much
sodium chloride in the water?
None of these questions are really
answered by the standard theory.
The speculative story
of Earth's history
involving catastrophic
extensions, has been concocted
and as I said, Mars has a
fabricated history too,
with the Amazonian,
the Noachian periods.
The Electric Universe accepts
evidence that petroglyphs
are an enduring record of the
frightening collapse of a former cosmos.
And this is the starting
point of this new story.
It has taken ten
thousand years for us
to be able to see in laboratory
plasma discharge experiments,
what our forebears saw in awesome
cosmic proportions in the sky.
I would say that petroglyphs
are the Rosetta Stones
of the recent history
of the solar system.
The monumental effort
involved in carving them
shows that what was happening
in the celestial arena
was of paramount concern to
the prehistoric artists.
It was a concern that still has
echoes in our doomsday nightmares.
Velikovsky challenged astronomers again
at the 1974 AAA's ambush in San Francisco.
He said, "I was greatly surprised
to find that astronomy,
the Queen of Sciences, lives
still in the pre-Faraday age,
not even in the time
of kerosene lamps,
but candles and oil.
Nothing has changed. So powerful
is the Newtonian ideology.
The evidential history
is quite different.
And this story is built on the evidence
looking at, from the point of view
of Velikovsky and those
mytho-historians
like David Talbott, Dwardu
Cardona and Ev Cochrane,
who have extended his research.
The first thing is that, to deal
with is the idea that Saturn
had a former state
as a brown dwarf.
And a brown dwarf is not actually a
dwarf star in the Electric Universe,
it is quite huge.
The planet's, Saturn's, entourage
of satellites and planets
actually existed within a
vast glowing plasmasphere.
For instance, it's been said
that if we could witness
Jupiter's plasmasphere from the
Earth when it's in opposition,
it would appear the size of the
full Moon or the Sun in the sky.
So if you can imagine Proto-Saturn
having that kind of size,
all of the satellites of Saturn
and also if you would
apply that to Jupiter,
those inner satellites will all
be within that plasmasphere.
Brown dwarfs flare
and this is a surprise to astronomers
because they're supposed to be failed stars,
they shouldn't have the
energy to flare. But they do!
So they must dump matter
on their satellites.
And this can be an answer to many conundrums
about the formation of the planets.
Water. We know that Saturn, the
rings of Saturn are water ice
so here is the origin of
the water for the Earth.
Oxygen, reddish light, low-gravity, gave rise
to the Earth's plant and animal gigantism.
The era of megafauna
and megaflora.
Evidence of the breakup
of this earlier system
given in "Symbols of an Alien Sky" and
Dwardu Cardona's "Star" series of books,
has been around for some years now
and is available for research
for those who would like to test these
ideas against what the MAVEN mission finds.
And of course as we've seen, the hard
evidence of the thunderbolts between planets
which sculpted the Martian surface, came
from high-energy plasma experiments.
So this is a summary,
Earth and Mars where planets orbiting
a brown dwarf star in a previous life.
You could say that we are the
aliens in this solar system.
It was the most hospitable
environment for life.
This is something that astronomers
have come to recognize in recent years.
However, they still talk
about a Goldilocks zone.
If a planet orbiting around a faint
dwarf star or red dwarf star,
is in a particular orbit,
it can harbor life.
What I'm saying is different.
The Electric Universe proposes
that the real environment for life
is within the actual glowing huge
envelope of these red stars.
The atmosphere, water and
minerals are deposited
and this can explain layering
of moons and planets.
The system broke up on encountering the
Sun and I will describe this in detail.
And interplanetary Thunderbolts
stripped the surface of Mars.
So let's talk with,
actually we've presented quite a
bit of material in this conference
about stars and planets forming
in cosmic Thunderbolts.
So we can expect that the
Earth and Mars and Saturn,
or Proto-Saturn as we call
it in its stellar form,
were formed in one of these cosmic
lightning bolts in a molecular cloud
close enough together. So that
once the discharge abated,
they were able to form a
small planetary system.
Now one of the things about
stars formed in this model,
and it refers both to Don Scott's
presentation and also to Marklund convection.
As Don said, the heavy elements concentrate
at the center of these discharges.
So the cores of stars are
composed of heavy elements.
That's not hydrogen.
So there can be no hydrogen fusion at
the center of the Sun or of any star.
They all have cool,
heavy element cores.
In the Electric Universe model and
I've written about this on my website,
electricity plays a central role in both the
capture and the stabilization of orbits.
So that capture is far more
likely in the Electric Universe
than in the
gravitational universe.
In fact, this is one of the difficulties
that astronomers have to deal with early on,
was that a body
passing by the Sun
will normally just swing
past it and then off again.
There's nothing to reduce the energy of the
incoming object so that it is captured.
But in the Electric Universe, as I
will discuss, that is possible.
In fact, it's likely.
The other thing is that
one of the big puzzles
that have affected planetary
scientists in recent years
with the discovery of so
many so-called exoplanets
that is planets
around nearby stars,
is that they found these hot Jupiters
orbiting the central star extremely closely.
Some of them going around in
a matter of hours or days.
There is another aspect
of the formation of stars
and that is that, if an instability
occurs during the formation of the star
as I've discussed the other day, each celestial
body has an internal electric field,
positive charge towards the center,
negative charge at the surface.
If you can imagine, if the center of
the object is positively charged
and has a slight displacement,
then there is an
accelerating electric force
which can actually cause
the object to fission.
And this may be the explanation for why
stars exist in a narrow range of sizes.
This is also not explained well
by the gravitational story.
So in the Electric Universe, brown
dwarfs are not failed stars
too low in mass to sustain
hydrogen fusion reactions.
As I said, there are no hydrogen fusion
reactions, stars are powered electrically.
Red dwarfs, shining
brightest in infrared,
represent about 70% of the
stars in the Milky Way.
So these are the most
likely places to find life.
Those faint dwarf stars might be called
the galaxy's, (pardon me), silent majority.
But red dwarfs come
with a major drawback.
Their stellar radii are hard
to determine accurately.
And this is where the astronomers
have missed the point
that red dwarfs are
not dwarf stars.
They are huge. All
red stars are huge
for the simple reason
that a star that does not,
is not capable of attracting
sufficient electrons to satisfy
the current demands of their
electrical environment,
will expand their photosphere.
In fact, the red dwarfs and so on, don't
actually have a bright photosphere.
So the plasma sheath around them
expands until it can attract,
intercept sufficient electrons
to maintain the discharge.
These pictures here of
red stars you can see,
some of the stars are so big, the giant ones,
that they can be measured from the Earth.
Betelgeuse is a good example
which, it's envelope would actually
reach to the orbit of Jupiter.
So in that particular case, if
Betelgeuse does have satellites,
they are orbiting within
that red glowing sphere.
Our brown dwarf is no different.
You don't have to have different models for
different stars in the Electric Universe.
So a brown dwarf is a small star
with a very large glowing envelope.
Jupiter, the gas giants
and so on, if you like.
If Jupiter and Saturn were now
taken outside the solar system,
they would once again
become brown dwarfs.
In December 2008, NASA found that the
brightness of a nearby brown dwarf,
at 17 light years distance,
was twice that expected for a brown
dwarf with its particular temperature.
This is using the
standard model of stars.
So the solution?
Completely ad-hoc, the object must have
twice the surface area. It must be twins.
Now the Electric Universe says,
I mean, that is just an
amazing ad-hoc solution.
The spectra of red dwarfs are crowded
with molecular absorption features
that are not well understood.
So it's hard to extract the physical properties
of a given red dwarf from its spectrum.
That is also interesting.
But the fact that there are so
many molecular absorption features,
indicates that all of the requirements for
life exists within that glowing envelope.
So all stars are electric.
All stars or red
stars are gigantic.
Planets can orbit within their anode glow.
And even astronomers acknowledge that.
They have suggested that there could be
satellites orbiting within the Betelgeuse glow.
However, with their notion that the red
giant is formed by an ultra hot core,
those plants would not
be suitable for life.
In the Electric Universe
it has a cool core.
Objects orbiting within the red
envelope are suitable for life!
Now one of the very
interesting things is that
there are no seasons on any satellites
orbiting within that red sphere.
Because the energy received
on any body within that sphere,
is equal over the entire
surface of that body
so that a planet orbiting within
that red sphere has no seasons.
Even temperatures.
In fact, I would say the brown dwarfs are
the cosmic wombs of life in the universe.
One of the interesting facts of course
that would suddenly come out of this,
is that these red spheres
are glowing plasma
and glowing plasma will not
let radio waves pass through.
So the search for extraterrestrial
intelligence using radio waves
is in my opinion a wasted effort.
Because anyone living on a satellite
inside one of these glowing red wombs,
would not even be aware that there
was a greater universe out there
full of stars. Let alone
try and use radio
because any radio signals
would not pierce that,
that plasma.
Just an interesting
side issue here.
So this is my view
of Proto-Saturn
and I've just put two satellites
there but there are obviously more.
Titan for instance, would have
been one of the satellites...
Earth and Mars.
So there they are inside
this glowing shell,
and the evidence of the earliest
recollections of mankind
appears to be that the purple
dawn of creation was the,
the sky light.
That was the color of
the sky. Purple dawn.
And that is precisely the color you
would expect in this circumstance
because you have the red
end of the spectrum
and you also have a certain
amount of the violet and
ultraviolet light due to
electrical activity in the plasma.
So this fits with the, if you like, the
earliest recollections of mankind
that that was our environment.
50% of red dwarfs have Earth-sized
planets in their habitable zone.
Remember, I said that astronomers feel this is the
place where life is most likely to be found.
Now if you look at Jupiter for instance
and consider that as a red dwarf,
and its plasma
sphere was lit up,
Io has a 1.75 day orbit,
Europa has a 3.5 day orbit,
Ganymede 7 days and
Callisto 17 days.
Any of the satellites that were
released from Jupiter's grip,
would have a rotation rate which
equaled their daily rotation rate
because they're locked always with the
same face towards the central body.
It suggests that the Earth and Mars had
orbits which were about a day in length.
This is the kind of information that
you can get from this kind of model.
The other thing is, you'll notice
in this diagram there is no Venus.
So we have huge red anode glow which
was what we call Proto-Saturn.
We had a 'purple dawn' of
creation and no Venus.
These are the important things to
understand about Proto-Saturn.
Just recently, a map of a
nearby Red Dwarf was produced
using a Doppler
imaging technique.
It's one of a pair of red
dwarfs near Alpha Centauri
with a separation of
three astronomical units.
There's a bright near-polar region which can
be clearly seen in the upper right panels.
And a darker mid-latitude area
visible in the lower left panels
is consistent with large-scale
cloud inhomogeneities.
However, that's an assumption that what
we're looking at is an atmosphere.
But we're not looking at an atmosphere.
We're looking at a plasma sheath.
So that this variation, said in
the Electric Universe model,
would be due to objects orbiting
within that plasma sheath,
either inside or outside that plasma sheath
because that would affect the discharge.
The other thing is that this
bright spot towards the pole,
is the same kind of thing that's found
with Betelgeuse, the red giant,
which indicates that that's the electrical
connection with the Birkeland currents
that drive these
particular stars.
If I'm right, the patterns here should be
more repetitive than weather patterns
and without banding like Jupiter,
which is undetectable so
far by this technique
but you never know what
they can do tomorrow.
Red Dwarfs and Giants
changing radius,
which is not the kind of thing that you
would expect if this is a normal body.
However this change in radius
is the star's response to changes
in its electrical environment.
It's quite natural.
It's a plasma effect.
They also tend to
flicker in brightness.
All of this is indicative of a star
lacking the stabilizing effect
of the bright photosphere
of bright stars.
That's according to Don
Scott's transistor model.
That is a stabilizing
influence in all bright stars.
Red stars don't have that luxury.
Proto-Saturn's Capture
This is the interesting part of it.
This took me decades
to try and figure out
because the model of planets arranged
with their poles in a line is unstable.
There's no Newtonian theory to
explain a daisy-chain of planets.
So it eventually dawned on me that
what we had was a dynamic arrangement
where Proto-Saturn which is
in this diagram over here,
that's Proto-Saturn,
and you can just see a few little
brighter red dots behind it.
They are the Earth and
Mars and other satellites.
That's meant to represent
those satellites.
The explanation came to
me once I had realized
that the stabilization of the planetary
orbits as we see them today...
Why is the Newtonian
system a clockwork system,
or it appears to be
a clockwork system,
when you only have one force?
Well the answer is you cannot have
a stable system with one force.
There has to be a
feedback mechanism.
And as I explained the other day, you can
change the mass of a planet or a star
by either placing charge on
it or taking charge away.
And it occurred to me that a
small star like Proto-Saturn
entering the
environment of the Sun,
would suffer a drastic change
in its electrical environment
with a result, actually that Proto-Saturn
would have become one gigantic comet.
Because a body which is negatively
charged with respect to its environment,
is a cometary body,
and a body that's positively charged
with respect of its environment
is an anode in the discharge
and it is a star.
So this was a change,
a sudden change,
once Proto-Saturn approached the
solar system at that time closely.
At least, it would have been most
drastic once it entered the heliosphere,
the boundary of the sun's environment
with interstellar space.
So Saturn as a comet
is removing electrons
and the result is that
it is losing mass,
it's accelerating
towards the Sun.
The bodies behind it...
Actually, sorry, I got
that around the wrong way.
The Proto-Saturn itself is
losing electrons as comets do.
They are being passed on
to the, its satellites.
The satellites are gaining in
mass, Saturn is losing in mass.
Conservation of energy says that
Proto-Saturn accelerates towards the Sun
and this is part of the
electrical capture mechanism.
The Earth and Mars and the other satellites
gaining in mass will tend to fall behind
and line up, rather like
comet Shoemaker-Levy 9.
The electrical discharge, the polar
discharge, in my opinion, then
is the central column of
Saturn's cometary discharge.
We were sitting in this cometary
tail, right in the middle of it.
And all of the plasma
discharge effects
that were witnessed by the
ancients and chiseled into rock,
come from that period of capture.
I've said, as the cometary body Proto-Saturn
loses electrons. It accelerates towards the Sun.
All of this could explain all of the
plasma phenomena, discharge phenomena
recounted by Dave Talbott
and Dwardu Cardona.
The latest measurements by
Pitjeva and Standish suggest
the astronomical unit is increasing
about 23 feet per century.
That means that the Earth is actually,
its orbit is shifting over time.
But according to the
beliefs of astronomers,
the astronomical unit
shouldn't change at all.
The mechanism I'm describing for
the modification of gravity
provides a mechanism
that can be tested
because the Earth's orbit expansion should be
a discontinuous function with discrete jumps
following major solar storms and
at Venus's inferior conjunction
when it actually, we sit in
the cometary tail of Venus.
So there are various means
of testing these ideas too,
outrageous as they may seem.
This is Saturn.
In June 19, 2004, I posted on my
website Cassini's homecoming.
Before the Cassini
mission began to send
all of the detailed
information back about Saturn.
And I wrote back then,
"a scenario follows that is so alien to any
conventional theory of Saturn's history
that it should be easily tested against any
information gained from the Cassini mission.
It shows striking connections between many
seemingly unrelated facts about certain planets."
Because if the planets that I mentioned
were part of the same family in the past,
we should be able to see
family resemblances.
"That is something that conventional
cosmogony has not been able to do."
That was the end of the quote.
For instance, the tilt of Saturn at
27 degrees to the ecliptic plane
is itself an enigma unless it
formed independently from the Sun.
The axial tilts of Saturn, Earth
and Mars are very similar.
The short-lived rings
of water ice that...
It's been said by astronomers that they
shouldn't last for any length of time,
geologically speaking.
And yet here they are, brilliant.
And as I said before, it gives us a clue as
to the origin of all of the water on Earth.
We come to Titan because Titan has
been examined closely in recent years
and it also had the Huygens probe
which landed on the surface.
I was very pleased
that that happened
because I predicted what will
be found beneath the clouds
and I was proven correct.
Before the spacecraft
descended to the surface,
it was thought that Titan must
be covered in a methane ocean
simply because methane is found
in the atmosphere of Titan
and it cannot have been
there for 4 billion years
because it's dissipated
continuously.
But if Titan (were) lost, lost its
place in its original birthplace,
only a few thousand years ago,
then it hasn't had time
to lose this methane.
Before the Huygens Lander
pierced the clouds
and we could see the
surface for the first time,
I said that Titan would have a surface
that looked like the Earth or Mars.
And that was proven correct. There
wasn't an ocean of methane.
Also it has an enigmatic
thick nitrogen atmosphere.
It has a very thick
nitrogen atmosphere.
And when you think about it, the Earth
has mostly nitrogen in its atmosphere.
There's no good explanation
for why that should be so.
So we come to Titan's
big brother, us!
Brown dwarfs are
noted for flaring.
That is, they suddenly brighten
and appear to eject material.
As I said, that's the only way they have
to adjust to their electrical environment.
The flare ejects stellar material
from the brown dwarf equatorially,
preferentially, or axially
if it's really serious.
So its satellites have solids, liquids
and gases rained down on them.
The composition will vary
depending on the depth
from which matter was
dredged up from the star
and the orbital encounter of the
stream of matter with each satellite.
It usually comes out in a stream.
This helps explain the layering seen on
solid planets, moons, asteroids and comets
and it can explain global
mineral strata on the Earth.
Venus is interesting.
Its rotation is anomalous, its heat is
anomalous, its atmosphere is anomalous.
Venus' slow retrograde
rotation and odd axial tilt
are, in my opinion, due to
ejection from Proto-Saturn
as observed and recorded
by the ancients.
"[Venus shows] a
surprisingly young surface"
and this is a quote from
one of the early reports.
So the astronomers
then had the problem.
Maybe it's been resurfaced and
that, so that was the explanation.
Venus were underwent some drastic
resurfacing in recent times.
But there's no need for
that, if it's newborn.
The other thing that's
obvious in this picture
is this belt of scars
around the equator.
But the ancients also witnessed
planet-girdling filamentary scars.
Well, they didn't witness the scars
but they saw the discharge in the sky.
And this is obvious in Dave Talbott's
reconstructions with those radiating streams.
And remember, we were underneath
the pole of Venus at that time.
So those streams are
coming from the equator.
And they are typical of electrical scars
from lightning through a thick atmosphere.
The electrical universe account
explains many odd things about Venus.
Its hellish temperature was born
from the cool star, Proto-Saturn.
So this gives you an idea of the kind
of temperature of the core of a star
like a red dwarf.
It has a thick 96% carbon dioxide
and 4% nitrogen atmosphere
plus a bit of a few hydrocarbons.
It also has some water in the atmosphere
but strangely the water decreases
until it becomes extremely
dry near the surface.
And this is a puzzle.
If you think about it, you've got a
surface which is of red-hot minerals
and you've got this thick
atmosphere of nitrogen.
It was Louis Kervran, the French
scientists who in years gone by
showed that nitrogen on
a red-hot iron surface
can actually be transmuted
to carbon monoxide.
And there's a process that was used
some time in the past to produce
hydrogen for burning,
you know, home fuel,
which used heat, carbon
monoxide and water
and the water is split to form
carbon dioxide and hydrogen.
The hydrogen is lost to space and
the carbon dioxide of the nitrogen
which was once Venus's
atmosphere is now carbon dioxide.
The process is still going on
because the water disappears near the
surface where the reaction takes place.
So the Venusian atmosphere is an
altered version of Titan's atmosphere
where nitrogen is being converted to
carbon monoxide and into carbon dioxide.
Because the atmosphere is so
much thicker than that on Earth,
Venus's total nitrogen is actually
four times more than the Earth's.
Let's get back to
battle-scarred Mars
and this will sort of, lead into the
next presentation by Steve Smith.
The evidence of Mars' battles with Thunderbolts
is written hugely on its scarface.
And I wrote, many years ago now,
that the huge scar here which extends about
a third of the way around the planet,
is actually in the form
of the most prevalent
and most colossal electric
discharge in the universe --
that of a barred spiral galaxy.
So Mars was stripped of
rocks, atmosphere and water.
The form of a barred spiral is there, that's
just the central part of a spiral galaxy.
And the pattern I recognized because
this puzzled me for decades,
is how did you actually form
that huge gash on the planet.
And it appears that it came in the
form of twin Birkeland currents
which are the central
axis of a barred spiral
and the pattern on Mars
is exactly the same.
Where you get, the pattern becomes
chaotic up towards the left
and down here. This is the chaos region.
It extends all the way down here
Up here you get all these giant channels
which come all the way up here.
So this is a pattern of a
gigantic electrical discharge.
And of course, this will rip material off
the surface and eject it into space.
We're still receiving Mars
rocks on Earth today.
And there's no good explanation
for that in terms of impacts
because you would expect that the material
would be vaporized rather than forming rocks.
This poor planet was
severely damaged
because it was, acted like a
an oscillating charge carrier.
It was between Proto-Saturn,
you had Proto-Saturn,
Venus, Mars and Earth
and Mars would move up
towards Venus, get zapped,
if you'd like to put it that way,
and then carry the charge down to the Earth
where it would discharge to the Earth.
This is why it was regarded as a
colossal threat and the God of War
because it was the planet that did most
of the charge transfer to the Earth.
But in the process of charge
transfer, it ripped the surface apart.
But if you remember
and this is important,
it occupied a similar place to the Earth
in the cosmic womb of Proto-Saturn.
So it's quite likely that it had an
environment pre- the catastrophes
that was very much
like the Earth.
So we have misunderstood Mars.
This is an artist's impression
of an early wet Mars.
Late Hesperian, this is one of these
other, so-called geological, eras on Mars,
mythical ones.
The up-flow channels are shown.
But of course, they may be correct insofar
as there was probably water on Mars
because it occupied
Proto-Saturn's environment.
The geologic history of Mars from
oldest to youngest are: the Noachian,
the Hesperian and the Amazonian.
They are defined by the number
of meteorite impact craters
and here we run into the problem of
what kind of craters are they really.
If they're electrical craters,
they cannot be used for dating.
But the Electric Universe says
that hemispheric cratering...
Northern hemisphere is,
there is kilometres of matter been
removed from the northern hemisphere.
All of this can happen
in a single Cataclysm.
Martian geological
history is a myth.
The Mars Atmosphere and Volatile
Evolution or MAVEN mission
is to study the loss of atmosphere
today and extrapolate backwards
over 4 billion years to figure out what
happened to make the Martian environment
so different to the Earth's.
I predict the evidence will make no sense
for the conventional evolutionary story.
But that will not be
enough to discard it.
The comforting dogma of evolution
in place for four billion years
requires extraordinary disproof.
What will scientists do when lazy retro-
calculation and speculation are discredited
by proof of sudden catastrophe and links
to other members of its original family?
So strong is the attachment to the
old fairy tale that I'm confident,
ad hoc adjustments will be made and
anomalies filed a way to be figured out
someday or forgotten.
As the philosopher
David Stove wrote:
"Newtonian physics is a guarantee
against the occurrence of
just about anything
disagreeable."
The irony for us is that
Mars was more Earth-like
within the time of
modern humans on Earth.
After all, until recently we
shared the same cozy stellar womb.
Life on Mars should have stood an equal
chance before the hapless small planet
became both a ruddy symbol and
a casualty of celestial war.
Shrapnel from those prehistoric
battles still arrive on Earth today.
The story of Mars is far more
dramatic and catastrophic
than anything dreamt up by theorists or
imagined by science fiction writers.
Our challenge will be to make sense
of data from the MAVEN mission
that conforms to the evidence gleaned from
prehistoric eyewitnesses of Martian events.
They were events beyond
all Newtonian imagining.
Thank you.

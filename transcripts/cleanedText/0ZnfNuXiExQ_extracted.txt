For the last 5 years on this series we
have presented a vast library of evidence
for the role of electromagnetism
throughout the cosmos.
Though institutional science still
insists that gravity is king,
gravity-centric cosmology has
faced an ever-growing crisis
in light of countless
baffling discoveries.
With no explanation for the
origins of cosmic magnetic fields,
cosmologists have little left but
to resort to random collisions,
explosions and
gravitational collapse.
But if gravity is not king,
what is the best evidence
for the dominant role of electromagnetism
in the astrophysical phenomena?
In commemoration of the 5 year
anniversary of this series,
we begin our summation of arguably
the top 10 points of evidence
which most clearly point
to an electric universe.
Cosmic magnetic fields
It's a fact known to every
high school physics student,
electric currents
produce magnetic fields.
But this law of physics
is almost nowhere evident
in the standard
Astrophysical literature.
In fact with ever finer
technological data
the influence of pervasive powerful magnetic
fields at all scales throughout the cosmos
has been one of the great
surprises of the Space Age.
Although astronomers
have had no choice
but to acknowledge the existence
of magnetic fields in space,
it's important to keep
an historical context
and remember the predictions of the
standard gravity centric cosmology.
Consider the following excerpt
from the early online NASA feature
Dr. Magneto's
questions and answers,
archived in the
official NASA website.
On the question, do magnetic
fields exist throughout space,
the answer reads as follows:
"On the cosmological scale, there is no data
to suggest that magnetic fields are present.
They certainly are not important
in the dynamics of the universe
for any reasonable range of field strengths
consistent with present observational constraints."
But fast-forward to 2011
and the undeniable conundrum is
acknowledged in the Universe Today article.
It states,
"The mention of cosmic-scale magnetic
fields is still likely to be met
with an uncomfortable silence
in some astronomical circles --
and after a bit of foot-
shuffling and throat clearing,
the discussion will be
moved on to safer topics.
But look, they're out there.
They probably do play a role in galaxy
evolution, if not galaxy formation --
and are certainly a feature of the interstellar
medium and the intergalactic medium."
But what causes these
magnetic fields
which astronomers and astrophysicists
had long believed to be
"not important"?
To answer this question, let us consider
some of the scientific discoveries
which clearly affirm the electrical
interpretation of cosmic scale magnetic fields.
A great shock for
scientists came in 2008
with the detection of an astonishingly powerful
magnetic field in a so-called young galaxy.
A Phys.org report
on the discovery reads,
"Astronomers have made the first direct measurement
of the magnetic field in a young distant galaxy,
and the result is
a big surprise.
Looking at a faraway proto galaxy
seen as it was 6.5 billion years ago,
the scientists measured a magnetic field at least
10 times stronger than that of our own Milky Way.
They had expected
just the opposite."
And of course, ever finer data across
the entire electromagnetic spectrum
only deepens the
so-called mysteries.
In 2014, a comprehensive study was published
on the, so called, supermassive black holes
that are believed to exist
at the centers of galaxies.
Scientists made the unexpected discovery
that powerful magnetic fields
play a significant role in
the dynamics of the systems.
A Phys.org report
on the study states,
"The magnetic field strength was
confirmed by evidence from jets of gas
that shoot away from
supermassive black holes.
Formed by magnetic fields, these
jets produce a radio emission...
the new results mean theorists must re-evaluate
their understanding of black hole behavior."
A contributor to the
research stated,
"The magnetic fields are strong enough to
dramatically alter how gas falls into black holes
and how gas produces
outflows that we do observe,
much stronger than what
has usually been assumed...
We need to go back and look
at our models once again."
However, as we will explain as
we continue with this list,
the standard assumptions about
the sources of cosmic jets
are also severely challenged
by science discovery.
The real problem astronomers
and astrophysicists face
is succinctly summarized in a Scholarpedia page
on the origins of galactic magnetic fields.
It states,
"The origin of the first magnetic fields
of the Universe is still a mystery...
It calls for a mechanism to sustain
and organize the magnetic field."
At a smaller scale in our
own celestial neighborhood,
scientists call on
mysterious internal dynamos
to explain the magnetic
fields of planets and the Sun.
Dynamos are also now
proposed inside of galaxies
to explain the galactic
magnetic fields.
But plasma cosmologists have shown
theoretically and experimentally
that the magnetic fields in galaxies
are due to electric currents
flowing into the centers along
the spiral arms of the galaxies.
It's proposed that, when the current
reaches the center of the galaxy,
it's twisted into an
object called a plasmoid
where all of the electromagnetic
energy is stored
until the plasmoid
becomes unstable
and ejects matter in jets along the
galaxy axis as observed in deep space.
Many of these concepts were
published in understandable terms
in the book, The Big
Bang Never Happened.
In plasma physics,
the plasmoid is the most concentrated
form of electromagnetic energy known.
As proven experimentally, a plasmoid can
store the energy of a room full of capacitors,
in its tiny doughnut shaped form
only a few millimeters across.
To contain that energy, that plasmoid
has an intense magnetic field,
self generated by electric currents
twisting themselves together.
In our own solar system the electric
universe predicts and explains
many of the ongoing surprises for scientists
investigating planetary magnetic fields.
In the last year, scientists reporting
the findings of two major NASA missions
to the gas giants, Jupiter
and Saturn respectively,
have shattered all assumptions
about the powerful magnetic fields
and those planets' highly
electrified environments.
The predictions of the theory that an
internal dynamo deep inside of Jupiter
produces the planet's magnetic field, have
been falsified by NASA's Juno mission.
Instead, the magnetic field is
both much more powerful and
"irregular than scientists
had ever imagined."
If such an invisible dynamo does
exist then, as Juno scientists admit,
it would have to be much closer to the
planet's surface than theory can explain.
As Juno principal investigator
Scott Bolton stated,
"I didn't expect all the
theories to be wrong,
but there's motion going on in
the planet we did not anticipate."
Saturn's magnetic field has proved equally
perplexing to scientists on the Cassini mission.
A major shock was the discovery
that the planet's magnetic field
appears to have no
discernable tilt.
As reported by Imperial
College London,
"Based on data collected by
Cassini's magnetometer instrument,
Saturn's magnetic field appears to be surprisingly
well aligned with the planet's rotation axis.
Previously, mission scientists
thought that 0.06 degrees
would be the lower limit of tilt that could
generate the observed magnetic field.
However, the results show the
tilt may be much less than this.
Scientists currently think
that planetary magnetic fields
require some degree of tilt
in order to sustain currents
flowing through the liquid
metal deep inside the planets.
With no tilt, the currents would eventually
subside and the field would disappear."
The leader of Cassini's magnetometer, professor
Michele Dougherty, said of the discovery,
"The tilt seems to be much smaller
than we had previously estimated
and quite challenging
to explain."
So if, like Jupiter, Saturn's magnetic field
is not generated by an internal dynamo,
what causes and maintains
the magnetic fields?
In the Electric Universe, both gas
giants are electrically charged bodies
that are part of the larger electrical
circuits connecting them to the Sun.
In fact, in 2016, scientists
reported their first observation
of so-called magnetic ropes traversing the
vast distance between the Sun and Saturn
and connecting the two bodies.
The lead author of a paper in the Geophysical
Research Letters says of the finding,
"Contrary to previous ideas
about Saturn's magnetosphere
being unlike its
terrestrial counterpart,
these findings reveal that Saturn at
times behaves and interacts with the Sun
in much the same way as Earth."
But how can the fluid dynamics
the NASA envisions explain,
"rope-like structures that
twist and change dynamically"
and extend to nearly 900 million
miles from the Sun to Saturn?
The phrase "magnetic ropes" is used to
describe twisted filamentary pathways
traversed by charged particles.
But, to electrical engineers, such
terminology reveals the inappropriateness
of concepts that came to dominate astronomy
and astrophysics in the 20th century.
As Professor Donald Scott, author
of the Electric Sky, states;
"Ropes, of course, have beginnings
and ends. Magnetic fields do not...
(T)his use of language from NASA
fails to explain anything,
and is conceptually wrong
as well as misleading."
The "ropes" to which the
investigators refer
are commonly described in plasma science
as electrical Birkeland Currents.
The rope-like structure
is not merely a curiosity.
It's the structure,
taken by current flow,
due to the long-range attraction and short-range
repulsion between current filaments.
The "twisted magnetic fields" are simply
the signature of the electric current flow.
In plasma cosmology these entwined plasma
filaments act as transmission lines
carrying "field
aligned currents"
across interplanetary
and interstellar space.
In recent years, professor Donald Scott has
published his own mathematical modeling
of the structure of
a Birkeland Current
which can be visually identified
as counter rotating cylinders.
Critically, this counter
rotation is clearly seen
at the north poles of
both Saturn and Jupiter.
In our next episode, the question of the
true source of cosmic magnetic fields
will be further explored as we
investigate the pervasiveness
of filamentary structures
throughout the universe:
the second of our ten reasons
why the universe is electric.

Welcome to Space News from the Electric

A groundbreaking new scientific
report provides dramatic confirmation of
our planet's dynamic electrical
environment and the Earth-Sun connection.
Phys.org recently reported that the
European Space Agency SWARM mission has
discovered, "Supersonic plasma jets
high up in our atmosphere" that can push
temperatures up to almost 10,000 degrees
Celsius. Attempting to provide historical
context for the discovery, the report
states, "The theory that there are huge
electric currents, powered by solar wind
and guided through the ionosphere by
Earth's magnetic field, was postulated
more than a century ago by Norwegian
scientist Kristian Birkeland. While much
is known about these current systems,
recent observations... have revealed that
they are associated with large
electrical fields." In fact, in recent
years the term "Birkeland current" has
appeared with increasing regularity in
mainstream scientific literature. Today,
professor Donald Scott discusses his own
original modeling of a Birkeland current
structure and he explores the
significance of this new discovery from
the Electric Universe perspective. SWARM
is a constellation of three satellites
designed to look at the geomagnetic field
of Earth. They wanted to put some decent
sensors, better sensors than had ever
been flown before, I guess, up, and to
investigate what exactly the properties
of the of the Earth's geomagnetic field
were. It's encouraging that this recent
article about SWARM not only mentions
the phrase Birkeland current several
times but it also talks about electric
fields. Well that's a word that almost
never gets mentioned in the
establishment literature but it's
getting to be fairly well-known that
electrical energy does indeed come from
the sun to Earth in large tube-like
conduits that have, over the years, become
known as Birkeland currents.
The establishment usually only talks
about magnetic and gravitational fields
but the all-important term "Electric
Current" usually has been missing. This
latest SWARM article makes it appear that
the establishment may have been quietly
listening to our ideas. Now of course,
they're never going to give us credit
for it, they will now claim that they discovered
everything and they will try to ignore the
existence of our prior claims but I
think it's our duty, to ourselves and
that actually to posterity, to stake out
those claims and say exactly what we
have said, in the past, about things
like Birkeland currents. I will say that
my model, which I hasten to say, is an
extension of the work of some other
folks such as Hannes Alfven, who won the
Nobel Prize in physics, and Anthony Peratt
and a fellow with a name Stig Lundquist, who
actually started the work on this
model back in 1950. That model
predicts most, if not all, of what the
SWARM release refers to as their
discoveries. It makes me a little bit
worried about whether they have ever
heard of some of the people. Certainly
they had never heard of me but, you think,
they might have heard of Hannes Alfven and
Tony Peratt and of course Kristian
Birkeland. But anyway, in 2015, the
scientific journal "Progress In Physics"
published an article of mine in which I
included the quantitative derivation of this
model. I finished it off, where Lundquist
started it, and then I ended up
developing the equations that describe
the physical structure of the Birkeland
Current. Those equations must be interpreted to
follow, they follow up on what those
equations predict about what the model
must look like. Lundquist, in spite of my
giving him credit for coming up with
some of those equations; he never, like I
guess most mathematicians don't,
interpreted what those equations
predicted for what the Birkeland current
would look like and how it would act. But
the model, as I developed it, shows
the presence of electrical currents that
flow in spiral paths in opposite
directions, those things were in that
SWARM article. Oppositely directed
currents, yes, and the Birkeland current
itself is made up of a set of and this is,
I think, the important point. The Birkeland
Current is a set of concentric counter-
rotating cylinders of electrical current
and magnetic fields. And the currents and
the fields are at all points in those
Birkeland currents parallel, they're
aligned. When you align the currents with
the magnetic fields, the internal
stresses on the Birkeland current
relax and go to zero and that's what,
that's the single property that makes
those Birkeland currents able to go over
tremendous distances, mean, we know they
go from the Sun to the Earth, and that's
93 million miles. Well that's, that's
nothing, that's a, that's a child's foot-
step for, compared to the astronomical
distances in light years. Some of these,
so-called, jets from galaxies and they extend
over and those currents don't come apart,
they don't spread out like that, like a
garden hose will end up in a bunch of
droplets sprinkling over your lawn. They
hang right together in collinear
alignment and that's, that's the reason
they do. The formal name for a Birkeland
Current, really, is a field-aligned
current. It's a force free current
because the fields are aligned. Anyhow, the
SWARM article says, "Each satellite
has an (electrical) electric field
instrument positioned at the front to
measure plasma density, drift and
velocity." Well if that's indeed the truth,
then I would think they should have
measured some kind of concentric counter-
rotation because the counter rotation is
the prime property, as far as I'm concerned,
on the Birkeland current. But either they
haven't observed it or, if they did
observe it, they neglected to mention
it. Maybe because they don't know why it
occurs. It's well known that the Earth
has a geomagnetic field. It's less well
known, but it's equally true, that the
Earth and many of the planets also have
their own electric field
and the electric field that emanates
either to or from Earth is a very
powerful electric field. The Earth is, and
most of the planets I think are, also
electrically charged. If
you sit down and analyze what that
phrase means, supersonic plasma jets,
plasma is a word that defines a
cloud-like collection of charges, you know,
plus ions, negative electrons, all going
along and they're traveling along in a
cloud-like formation and a jet
is a moving stream. It's a flow. So a
flow of charge. Well that's the
definition of an electric current but we
already knew this. That's, that's what
Birkeland himself, back in the early
nineteen hundreds, said was going on.
That's what they laughed at him for saying.

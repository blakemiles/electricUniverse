You've just entered the
theater of an alien sky.
If the words and images seem strange
to you there's a reason for this.
Our world was once a
vastly different place.
To experience this won't hurt you
and there is nothing to fear.
The Ship of Day and Night
Ancient images of a cosmic
ship give us an opportunity
to question many popular
assumptions about the ancient sky.
Our message is that
the sky we see today
does not provide a useful guide
to the ancient experience.
Extraordinary celestial formations
above the early sky worshipers
provoked an explosion
of mythic images.
If we can see these images as a
reflection of concrete human experience,
a reconstruction of the
events is possible.
For observers on Earth a revolving
crescent in the polar sky,
reflecting light from the Sun, turned
visually around a central orb or star
in a daily cycle of
brightening and dimming.
In human imagination, that revolving
crescent was the ancient ship of heaven.
One additional feature must be
included, as we've earlier noted:
the crescent appeared above a cosmic pillar,
inspiring a diversity of mythic images.
All pointing to the same underlying
form - one form in the sky
fully explaining what will otherwise
appear as hopelessly contradictory images.
In our previous episode, we
noted the strict identification
of the crescent ship with the
horns of the Bull of Heaven.
Inhabitants of the celestial
kingdom sailed on these horns
in the daily revolution
of a crescent-like ship.
We also noted the absolute
identity of the Bull's two horns
as the twin peaks of
the cosmic mountain.
We have further suggested that Egyptian
and other images of a pillar god
either holding aloft the ship,
or standing upright in the ship,
must be understood in terms
of the underlying equation
of the ship itself with
these outstretched arms.
This equation can be
fully elaborated.
The Pyramid Texts say
that the deceased king
ascends to the sky to find
his place in the cosmic ship
- "within the arms
of Atum", they say.
This identity of the ship and
the enclosing arms of the sky
is confirmed again and
again in Egyptian sources.
"[The king is raised up] in the Day-bark...
within the arms of Anubis".
"Make ready your arms for me, O Ra, come
and ferry me over to yonder side..."
In the same way the god Osiris sails
"on the two arms of Horus".
Any doubt on this equation is removed by the
description of the ship in the Coffin Texts:
"Her starboard side is the right arm of Atum.
Her larboard side is the left arm of Atum".
But a huge confusion has taken over
the language of day and night,
due to the subsequent radical
change in celestial conditions.
In the ancient planetary configuration, the
crescent - the mythic ship of heaven -
was decsending to
the left at sunset
and beginning to grow more
bright amidst the darkening sky.
The ship achieved it's
greatest splendor
when the crescent reached it's
position directly below at midnight.
The ship's brightness then began to
diminish as it rose to the right.
And it was at its weakest
when directly overhead.
In today's reckoning of time,
that would be called Noon.
But when Egyptian texts describe
the primeval Sun growing bright,
the translators can only
think of one thing:
our familiar Sun
rising in the east.
That fundamental misconception
sets in motion a series of
irreconcilable contradictions in
all of the standard translations.
Egyptian sources are far and away the most
complete references on this question.
In unequivocal terms, they describe the
vehicle of the gods, the ship of heaven,
in two phases of a daily cycle, a phase
of brightening and a phase of dimming.
These phases have nothing to do with
the appearance of the Sun itself.
The Sun was not even present within
the visual theatre of the gods.
It was simply the external source of
the illuminated circumpolar crescent
and it's daily phases of
brigtening and dimming.
As commonly translated, the Coffin
Texts express the hope of every king,
upon his death,
to find his place
"in the Night-bark and the
Day-bark like Ra, every day".
But the translators can offer no
natural referents for the terms.
All that is literally meant are the two
contrasting phases of growing bright
and growing dim, of growing
strong and growing weak.
Strength and weakness,
life and absence of life,
waking and sleeping are the
literal meanings of such terms.
The boat in the phase of
growing bright was named Atet,
meaning literally, "strong
or growing strong".
And the boat of growing
dim was named Sektet,
meaning literally, "weak
or growing weak".
Once the literal meanings are clear, the
mistranslations become transparent.
"May you sleep in the night-Bark (Sektet),
May you awake in the day-Bark (Atet)"
a popular translation reads.
The implied connections to sunrise
and sunset are provably incorrect,
and we can make this clear by simply
observing the regional positions of the ship
and the directions of the
ship's motion in it's daily cycle.
Did the ship actually move
upward in it's phase of dimming
and descend in it's
phase of brightening?
As we intend to establish
beyond any reasonable doubt,
the position of the ship was below
in the phase of brightness,
and above in the
phase of weakness.
That means a descending motion of the ship
as it began to shine brilliantly in the sky
and an upward motion
as it began to dim.
The directions of movement and the associated
conditions of brightness and dimming
are all critical to the
integrity of the symbolism.
The Coffin Texts describe
the gods sailing upstream
in the so-called "night",
literally the phase of dimming,
exactly the opposite of
the solar interpretation,
while another spell
announces that
"The sun shines forth when going downstream
from the region above to the region below".
Again the opposite of the solar interpretation,
and the literal meanings are the key,
"May you sail upstream, toward the
upper region in the night-Bark
(literally the ship of dimming) and
downstream, toward the lower region
in the day-Bark" (literally the phase
of brightening or growing bright).
Such texts as these are
complemented by numerous others,
all confirming that the ship of heaven is
indeed an acid test of our reconstruction.
We'll return to this explicit
evidence in our next episode.

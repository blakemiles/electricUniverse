Welcome to Space News from

This month on Space News, we reported
on a recent study that confirms
electrostatic dust transportation
occurs on airless bodies in space,
including comets,
asteroids and moons.
The NASA-funded research suggested
that electrostatic effects
could explain a number of
mysterious discoveries
including the emission of fluffy dust
particles from the nucleus of Comet 67p,
the formation of weird dust configurations
on 67p on the asteroid Eros.
And the surprisingly smooth
surface of Saturn's moon Atlas.
The investigators observed electrostatic
effects in the laboratory
when dust was exposed both to UV
radiation and to plasma.
Nevertheless, few astronomers today consider
electrical effects on comets or asteroids
when attempting to explain the still
mysterious behaviour of these bodies.
This may be evidenced in recently
published scientific research
into a newly discovered active
asteroid called P/2016 G1.
The object has been studied, in part,
to try to answer an ongoing question.
Should asteroids that show comet-like
activity be categorized as main belt comets?
The team observed that asteroid
P/2016 G1 became active
350 days before perihelion or its
closest approach to the Sun.
Over a period of 24 days,
the asteroid emitted a total dust
mass of at least 17,000 tons.
The only hypotheses scientists
have considered are impacts,
thermal fracturing, rotational
instabilities and sublimating ices.
The explanation the team is settled on is
that an impact partially destroyed the body,
causing the subsequent
emissions of dust.
Their paper states,
"We speculate that this dust ejection
could be associated to an impact,
and that the subsequent
modeled activity
is due to the asteroid
partial or total disruption.
The impact itself had produced the
ejection of some 240 tons of dust."
The team noted that,
"...a conspicuous westward feature
in the head of the comet-like object
indicates that a significant
fraction of the dust was ejected
along a privileged direction,
right at the beginning of the event."
Let us also consider
the case of P/2013 P5,
an asteroid which was recently
reclassified as a main belt comet.
The asteroid astonished
scientists around the world
when it suddenly displayed
six comet-like tails.
One scientist said at the time, "It's hard
to believe we're looking at an asteroid."
The mystery for
astronomers was apparent.
How can a rocky asteroid
grow and maintain
highly collimated jets of material,
forming the comet tails?
An ad hoc theory arose
to the effect that
the asteroid suddenly began
spinning faster for some reason.
Possibly because, as one
scientist suggested,
pressure from sunlight exerted
a torque on the body.
This change in the asteroid spin-rate
may have caused material to,
"avalanche down slope towards the
equator and maybe shatter and fall off,
eventually drifting into
space to make a tail."
It was then suggested
that radiation pressure
stretched and comfined the
dust into the comet tails.
If mainstream astronomy is now recognizing
electrostatic dust transportation
on airless bodies in space then why is
this not among the hypotheses considered
for asteroid or comets'
dust emission?
Traditionally, astronomers have only
envisioned minor electrostatic effects
on asteroids and comet nuclei
due to direct surface exposure to
solar radiation and the solar wind.
But for decades, surprising discoveries
in the study of both comets and asteroids
have demanded new
theoretical pathways.
Mysterious comet-like behaviours from
asteroids are not a mystery.
Comets and asteroids are not as different
as astronomers have long believed.
In the Electric Universe theory,
as developed by Wal Thornhill,
asteroids, comets and meteoroids were all
born in interplanetary electrical events.
Their distinctive orbital
groupings and spectral features
point to separate catastrophic events
and to different planetary bodies
involved in different phases
of solar system history.
Comet activity, including the production
of the familiar coma and tail
are not the result of sublimating
ices due to solar warming.
A long-standing mystery is why
comets sometimes flare or even explode
at vast distances from the Sun, much too
far to explain through solar warming.
This will happen when a comet
experiences a sudden voltage spike
when traveling through varying
regions of electrical potential.
One such source of a voltage
spike is solar flares,
a subject of growing
scientific interest.
At the recent Thunderbolts
conference in Phoenix - Arizona,
the Russian scientist dr.
Subhon Ibadov
proposed that a capacitor-like breakdown
occurs between a comet's charged subsurface
and a differently charged surface due
to arriving protons from the Sun.
In the electric universe
theory of Wal Thornhill,
any body moving on an elliptical orbit
within the Sun's weak electric field
can exhibit comet-like
electrical discharge activity.
Though of course on a
much smaller scale,
such behavior may have
been recently witnessed
when astronomers observed giant plumes
jetting from the surface of Mars.
Scientists recently reported the
completely unexpected discovery
that a coronal mass ejection hit Mars
immediately before the plume was first spotted.
The NewScientist report
on the Discovery states,
"One possibility is that plasma could be
interacting with ice grains or dust
lower down in the atmosphere and
electrically charging them,
boosting them higher, but it's not clear
how the effect would be big."
A similar phenomena may have been witnessed
on the aforementioned asteroid P/2016 G1.
Just as the Martian plumes
were not caused by an impact,
the asteroid's emission of dust, which initially
ejected along a preferential direction,
was most likely caused
by an electrical discharge.
Investigating scientists should explore the
changes in the asteroids' plasma environment
such as the asteroid's proximity
to a planet's magnetotail.
Just as the Earth's magnetotail
has been found to create
regular electrostatic
dust storms on the Moon.
With each new discovery, it seems
that the behaviors of comets,
asteroids and all bodies
within our Sun's domain
provide greater and greater affirmation
that we live in an electric universe.

Welcome to Space News from

The picture of the formation,
evolution and death of stars
is changing with
each new discovery.
The Electric Universe theory has offered
predictions for stellar phenomena
that have proved far more successful
than those of gravity-centric cosmology.
Stars do not form in a process
of gravitational collapse
but rather they form from the
electromagnetic pinch effect
along vast filaments of
remarkably constant width.
Stars are not powered by
internal thermonuclear reactions.
Rather, the Sun is a
positively charged electrode
at the focus of incoming
electrical currents.
Stars do not collapse and explode when
they "burn up their nuclear fuel".
Rather, electric stars have
internal charge separation
and can relieve electrical stress by
fissioning or blowing-off charged matter.
In fact, the standard
theory of a supernova
which has never been shown
to work experimentally,
has grown more severely challenged
with each new discovery.
In November of 2017, a paper
published in the journal Nature
reported the observation
of a star that exploded,
somehow survived, then exploded again
more than half a century later.
A phys.org report describes
the discovery as follows,
"The finding,
published by Nature,
completely confounds existing
knowledge of a star's end of life...
somehow this star exploded
more than half a century ago,
survived, and exploded
again in 2014."
A co-author of the
paper stated,
"This supernova breaks everything we
thought we knew about how they work."
In part 1 of this
three-part presentation,
the chief science advisor to The Thunderbolts
Project, physicist Wal Thornhill,
will begin our discussion
on the nature of stars
with an examination of
so-called neutron stars,
hypothetical entities which
were invented in the 1960's
after the unexpected discovery of
pulsing electromagnetic emissions in space.
But as Thornhill explains, like
the standard theory of supernovas,
the hypothetical neutron star is a
questionable proposition at best.
It was argued in a recent Space News, that
bizarre whirling neutron star lighthouses
are not needed to produce rapidly
flashing pulsar signals.
Conventionally, neutron stars are believed
to be the remnants of a supernova explosion
but supernova explosions are said
to be 'not fully understood'!
Which means ― keep
sending money.
So, exploding stars are a good place
to begin exploding theories.
Neutrons are only seen to exist
outside an atomic nucleus
for a few minutes before they separate
into an electron and a proton.
So we can't just assume they
can be packed closely together
to form the bulk
of a stable star.
Insisting that neutrons
exist in atomic nuclei,
forces an unconvincing
nuclear model upon us
with positive charges held together
by an ad-hoc strong nuclear force.
There appears to be very
strong statistical evidence
that an atomic nucleus
is made up of protons
in a rapidly revolving
geometric structure
where electrons are in sufficient
numbers to occupy, on average,
the midpoint between
pairs of protons.
The attractive force
to the closer electron
overcomes the powerful repulsive
electric force between pairs of protons.
This greatly simplifies many subjects
in atomic and nuclear physics.
So we can forget neutron
stars, they don't exist!
It's far simpler and
more likely to suggest
that a normal stellar body subjected
to abnormally high electrical stress,
is the source of the steady
flashing signals from pulsars.
The disturbing fact is
that plasma physicists
have shown this both theoretically
and experimentally.
The electrical model of stars
is real evidence-based science.
Further support for the
electrical model recently came
from the discovery of gamma-ray
flares coming from the Crab Nebula
which encloses a pulsating
supernova remnant
only 6,500 light-years away,
in the constellation Taurus.
In Physical Review Letters of November
the 24th, there appeared a letter titled
'Inductive spikes in the Crab Nebula
- a theory of gamma-ray flares'
by John Kirk and Gwenael
Giacinti. They report:
"The detection of powerful gamma-ray flares
from the Crab Nebula by the AGILE satellite
and the Large Area Telescope
on the Fermi satellite
has provided theorists
with three major puzzles:
How are particles able to
emit synchrotron radiation
well above the ~ 100 MeV
astrophysical 'upper limit?'
What is the geometry and
location of the source,
given that it varies on
a time scale of hours,
whereas the nebula has a
light-crossing time of months?
By which mechanism can such a
small source achieve a power
of only one order of magnitude less
than that of the entire nebula?"
On November 27th, it was reported
in more popular fashion
in the New Scientist
under the banner,
"Mysterious gamma rays in Crab
Nebula traced to pulsar winds".
It says and I quote:
"Waves of charged particles
slamming into gas and dust
may be responsible for unexpected
super-bright flashes in the Crab Nebula
...in 2011 two telescopes observed unusual
short-lived gamma ray bursts in the Crab.
These exceeded 100 MeV,
hundreds of times brighter than
the nebula's normal emissions.
The source of the
flashes was a mystery.
Some suspected it had to do with the
pulsar's magnetic field splitting
or becoming knotted as they move away from
the star and into surrounding material.
Now, new research pins
the gamma ray emissions
on charged particles like
electrons and positrons
that flow from the neutron star at near
light speed, like a constant breeze."
Here we see the blind spot of astrophysicists
toward electrical effects in space.
They can't see beyond explosive winds
slamming into slow-moving matter
and mysterious magnetic fields
which are tied in knots
and magically cut
and reconnected
to somehow produce what are
clearly electrical effects.
What we are not told is that
physicists in the 21st century
have no physical understanding of
the magnetic force, just equations!
Magnetic field lines are a graphic
representation and not a real thing.
Magnetic field lines must always
terminate at a magnetic pole.
They cannot be disconnected and
reconnected in empty space.
The only electrical
reference in the report
is to the gamma ray energy
measured in excess of 100 MeV.
This voltage is easily exceeded
across a cosmic plasma double-layer
which form in a Birkeland current
in a stellar or galactic circuit.
But astrophysicists don't do circuits
in space because they are taught
electricity doesn't
do anything in space.
Back in 1986, the pioneering Nobel Prize
winning plasma cosmologists Hannes Alfvén said,
"Double layers in space should be classified
as a new type of celestial object.
It is tentatively suggested
that x-ray and gamma-ray bursts
may be due to exploding
double layers.
In solar flares, double layers
with voltages of 10 billion Volts
or even more may occur, and
in galactic phenomena,
we may have voltages that are several
orders of magnitude larger."
Alfvén was right, it is
the simple mechanism
behind all of the mysterious
gamma-ray bursts in deep space.
He explains further,
"If the current density is too high, an
exploding double layer may be formed.
This means that in the plasma a
region of high vacuum is produced:
the plasma refuses to
carry any current at all.
At the sudden interruption
of the [circuit]
inductance produces enormous over-
voltages, which may be destructive."
The result is a high-energy flash of
X-rays, gamma rays and cosmic rays.
Here we see the dramatic release
when a circuit breaker opens,
of the electromagnetic energy stored in a
long distance 500,000 volt transmission line.
A voltage pulse across the opening circuit
breaker, rises to millions of Volts
causing a powerful arc
several meters long.
That same voltage pulse in the stellar
circuit accelerates charged particles
to energies capable of generating
the observed gamma-ray flashes.
It shows how a small
source can achieve a power
only one order of magnitude less
than that of the entire nebula.
The astrophysicists' conceptual blind
spot is evident when we look at
the explanation for the gamma-ray
flashes offered by scientists
where they actually describe the
exploding double-layer effect
without recognizing
the electrical cause.
"...new research pins the gamma ray emissions on
charged particles like electrons and positrons
that flow from the neutron star at near
light speed, like a constant breeze.
'We propose that at some moments you
have pockets inside this wind'
where the density of electrons and
positrons drops, says Gwenael Giacinti
at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear
Physics in Heidelberg, Germany.
Lines of electromagnetic force
usually maintain a constant current.
When they encounter these lower density
pockets ...that current is disrupted.
Some of the energy in the particles
gets converted into kinetic energy,
causing the electrons and
positrons to accelerate
and smash into the
nebula's gas and dust.
The effect is similar to the behavior
of a circuit containing an inductor.
Should the current in the
circuit suddenly drop,
the inductor ― which acts to
smooth out the electric current ―
will try to rapidly counteract the loss with
a huge pulse, often resulting in a spark."
The effect is not similar, it is precisely
that of an exploding double layer.
As for the wind with
its pockets and lines
of electromagnetic force
maintaining a constant current,
the concepts are adrift from
any real physical model
involving electricity supplied
by a galactic circuit.
Instead, the Crab Nebula is treated
as an isolated, closed system.
So the descriptive words are
either misleading or meaningless.
Of course, there is no
reference in the paper
to Hannes Alfvén and his 31 year old
explanation for high-energy gamma-ray bursts
based on the tried and tested
physics of electrified plasma.

The Electric Universe
The Electric Universe
-- The Essential Role of Plasma --
What does it mean to say we
live in a plasma universe?
And why is the plasma universe,
an Electric Universe?
We typically describe matter
as solids, liquids, and gases.
But across the cosmos, plasma is the most
pervasive and fundamental state of matter.
It's the electrical behavior of plasma
that assures us there's no empty space,
in space.
No domain anywhere is entirely free
from electric and magnetic fields.
That's the reason for our
oft-repeated mantra:
There are no islands in space.
The continuous electrical
conversation occurs everywhere.
if we're better at detecting this
energetic conversation today,
that's because advanced instruments
give us a much closer view
and not just across the sliver of
visible light on the spectrum.
It's freely moving charged particles that
give plasma its electrical characteristics,
including its conductivity.
Electric currents are essential to
comprehending the new picture of space.
Electrified plasma creates
surprisingly lifelike responses,
and it creates similar
behavior at all scales.
From microscopic up to
galactic dimensions,
the responses to an electrified
environment are fractal-like:
plasma in the lab, plasma in
computer simulations of charge,
and plasma structures in remote space
show virtually identical geometries.
So, it's the plasma universe that
makes our Electric Universe possible.
Now, it's the job of astronomers,
astrophysicists and mathematicians
to take up the challenge.
How far can the discovery
of the Electric Universe
take us in our understanding
of events in space?
Events close to home and in the
farthest reaches of the cosmos.

count on is this,

You've just entered the
theater of an alien sky.
If the words and images seem strange
to you there's a reason for this.
Our world was once a
vastly different place,
to experience this won't hurt you,
and there is nothing to fear.
The Separation of Heaven and Earth
A mythic archetype is a
broadly distributed pattern
of ancient storytelling
and magical re-enactment.
In the past century cross-cultural studies
have identified hundreds of archetypes,
and our own study has added
many themes to the list.
Of all the named archetypes, one
of the most recognizable is
the towering God holding aloft
the great sphere of Heaven.
Greek poets and philosophers named
this Heaven bearing giant Atlas
but almost all of the early cultures seem to
have remembered a similar mythic personality.
And how curious that this
archetypal quasi-divine power
was said to have separated
Heaven and Earth,
dividing a world above
from a world below.
What natural phenomenon could have
provoked this remarkable theme
-- the separation
of above and below?
Our claim in these Discourses is
that extraordinary natural events
occurring just prior to the emergence
of the great civilizations
sparked an outpouring of creative
activity and commemorative rites,
all encoding a universal
human experience.
Hundreds of cross-cultural
themes or archetypes
traced to the beginnings
of human history
and to the early experience of what
we've called the polar configuration.
In earlier Discourses, we introduced
the role of the world mountain,
a visible pillar rising along
Earth's rotational axis.
In response to this awe-inspiring presence,
the early cultures consecrated sacred hills
and holy mountains as special symbols
of a formerly witnessed cosmic column.
And they invested massive labors
in monumental construction,
all commemorating the celestial home
and resting place of an ancestral God.
In fact, the theme of the world mountain
converges globally with another theme,
the cosmic giant bearing
aloft the sphere of Heaven.
By following this theme back
to its first expressions,
we uncover the original meaning
of the phrase above and below,
a radical meaning that is essential to the
story of the world mountain or cosmic pillar.
Egyptian texts and art depict
the Heaven-supporting God Shu
as a pillar-like form
with upraised arms.
The priests declared that these arms
created the separation of above and below.
We explain this relationship by the
role of the illuminated crescent.
In visual terms the crescent suggested
two extensions of the pillar,
and it divided the vast sphere of the primeval
unity, Atum, into upper and lower regions.
With this connection
in mind, we can avoid
the fatal mistake in common
treatments of the Atlas theme
-- the assumption that Atlas
bore the Earth on his shoulders.
That idea is directly contradicted
by the Greek chroniclers themselves,
who consistently recognized the celestial
nature of the burden Atlas carried.
"...And he, no other, holds the tall pillars
that keep the sky and Earth apart."
- Homer
"Atlas through hard constraint upholds the
wide Heaven with unwearying head and arms."
- Hesiod
"Does not even now great Atlas struggle
to bear up the weight of Heaven?"
- Pindar
Many additional citations could be given to
make this point, but in these Discourses,
we're not just calling for a correction
of one popular interpretation.
Those who followed earlier episodes will
not be surprised by our identification
of the upraised arms of the Egyptian
Shu as a crescent-form appearing as
extensions of a single pillar reaching
upward along the polar axis of the Earth.
As detailed in previous episodes, the twin arms
of Shu trace to the role of a visible crescent
upon the giant sphere of Saturn in
the ancient sky close to Earth.
The language takes its meaning from the
early phase of the polar configuration
as it emerged from the undifferentiated
ambient glow of an earlier time.
In this earlier phase, the dusty plasma medium
through which the gathered planets moved,
diffused and softened our Sun's
natural illumination of these bodies.
The arrival of this crescent
was a widely celebrated event.
It meant the beginning of a daily
cycle which the mythmakers themselves
designated as the coming of
the first day and night.
Our identification of the polar column
with the activity of the planet Mars
constitutes a prediction as to the prime player
in the so-called separation of Heaven and Earth.
Classical authors recognized in the
Egyptian Shu their own archetypal warrior;
the Greeks named the God either as Heracles,
a name they gave to the planet Mars,
or as the warrior Aries - the
most common name for Mars.
The Romans followed suit, naming
their own far-famed warrior as Mars
and identifying their semi-divine
ancestor Hercules as that very planet.
When viewed as a mythic image of
the crescent and polar column,
the explanation leaps out
from the historical material.
The crescent arms of the Heaven- supporting divinity
being the upright crescent form of the configuration,
visually extending the mythic
function of the pillar itself
and most dramatically so in its
symmetrical midnight position.
That was the most celebrated
moment in the ancient day.
This archaic day began at
sunset when the sky darkened
and the planetary configuration
continue to grow brighter,
reaching its peak
brightness at midnight.
Thus, it is that from earliest
times in ancient Egypt,
we see the arms of Shu raising
up the primeval sun-God Atum
from the darkness of the abyss.
So when Atum declares, "I do
not fall on account of Shu",
it is the pillar and twin arms of Shu that
give concrete meaning to the language;
the cosmic perch and resting place
of the primeval sun-God Atum
as noted in our previous episode
is the pillar of the sky,
its function emphasized
by the twin arms of Shu.
The two extensions of the cosmic pillar,
or in the two peaks of the world mountain,
mean precisely the same thing.
As presented in Egyptian sources, the
creation story focuses on the separation
or holding apart of two regions typically
mistranslated as Heaven and Earth.
Egyptian priests knew Atum as the primeval
unity meaning the one -- the all.
In the creation events
through the activity of Shu,
this unity gave way to profound
differentiation into a duality.
What was then seen from Earth as
the extended upright arms of Shu
produced the visual
appearance of a division
-- a formerly unified whole divided
into regions above and below.
Thus, our explanation of the pillar-
God's two most vital functions;
as the stable support of Atum
and as the ancient power
that created the so-called
separation of Heaven and Earth.
Egypt: The Ka-arms of Shu
separated above and below
We identify both functions with the
visual contribution of the planet Mars
to the emergence and evolution
of the polar configuration.
Specifically, the World
Pillar or World Mountain.
Egypt: "I am raised aloft on my perch
above yonder places of the Abyss."
Egypt:
"I do not fall on account of Shu."
Of course, distance from
these events over time
allowed the concepts to drift
away from things originally seen.
And yet many centuries later,
we still see the God Shu standing
upright as the pillar-God
filling the space between the arching
form of the Goddess Nut above,
and the recumbent form of
the male power Geb below.
When presented in this
way as opposites,
the Egyptians named the domain marked
out by the crescent above as Pet
-- equated with the Goddess
Nut in the emerging duality;
and the region marked out by the crescent
below as Ta -- equated with the God Geb.
But in the absence of anything
presently observed in the sky,
the translators render the upper region of the
sphere as Heaven and the lower region as Earth,
introducing contradictions that could
only confuse these Egyptian concepts.
For any reliable interpretation,
the reference must be considered
in their archetypal original
and testable contexts.
For us the objective contexts mean concrete
forms in the sky and concretely experienced
natural events reconstructed from the
deepest cross-cultural agreement.
In fact, as we intend to show
in the episodes to follow,
every archetype relating to the so-called
separation of Heaven and Earth
will fall into place as predictable themes
within the context of this reconstruction.
As you follow these Discourses, you can
assess this testability for yourself
as we continue surveying the entire panorama of
ancient myths, symbols and sacred practices.
The most critical
themes are firstly,
an original undifferentiated
condition or absence of form;
and secondly, an emerging geometry of creation
with specific regions above and below;
and thirdly, a central role of the archetypal
warrior hero as the cosmic pillar personified,
filling the role of the Demiurge -- a primeval
power executing a divine or intelligent plan.
Thus, the role of the cosmic
Warrior was paramount.
The separation of above and below was, in
fact, the Warrior-God's first achievement,
even before he had earned
his title as Warrior-God.

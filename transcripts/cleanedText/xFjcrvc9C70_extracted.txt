In part 1 of this presentation, Thunderbolts
colleague Andrew Hall began exploring
some of the best case studies of
electrical scarring on planet Earth.
The features don't seem to fit with
any standard geological process
but as Hall explained, they do
show the expected characteristics
produced by electrical
discharges.
Today, Hall continues his presentation
with a focus on the stunning geology
in the American Southwest.
In part one of
'Lightning-Scarred Earth',
Shiprock was presented as an example
of a pinnacle created by lightning.
Fulgarites are created when lightning
strikes and current penetrates the ground,
leaving a hollow tube of
glassy, fused material behind.
Current from the lightning vaporizes
and extracts material in its path,
while its heat vitrifies the surrounding
soil, leaving behind glassy tubes.
Based on its features, it's proposed here
that Shiprock is a standing fulgarite,
created by lightning so powerful
and sustained that the material
began to recombine in the current
as it was pulled from the ground,
leaving behind a pinnacle of fused
material instead of a hollow tube.
Once material recombines, it's no longer charged
and attracted to the lightning channel,
so is left behind, its ionic makeup
altered by the current and heat.
The morphology of Shiprock
displays this very well
with columns of fused rocks
surrounding an inner core of minette,
ionically altered material pulled from
the ground by the flow of current.
Surrounding the pinnacle are minette
dikes radiating away in a star pattern.
Minette is high in potassium
and low in silica content.
It contains high volumes
of orthoclase and biotite.
Both are minerals with high metal content,
such as potassium, iron, and sodium.
Silica dioxide will readily
exchange oxygen with metals,
such as those found in the
orthoclase and biotite
when sufficient heat is applied.
The prevalence of potassium and
other metals crystallized in Minette
and its under-
saturation of silica
is evidence of the reduction
taking place as it was formed.
This suggests that the lightning
forming it was positive lightning,
which is the type of
powerful lightning seen striking
from the stratospheric anvil
clouds in thunderstorms.
Electrons and negative
ions in the ground
pulled out by the positively
charged lightning
left behind a concentration of
positively charged material
which was not attracted
and drawn away.
The dikes and inner core of the pinnacle
show the path of the current
being drawn to the
lightning discharge.
Following the lightning
strike that formed the pinnacle,
the area was left with
a net positive charge,
which attracted a secondary
ground discharge, or arc blast
that emanated from a
different discharge process.
This secondary discharge will
be explored more in the future,
but it's worth mentioning now
because it left a magnificent
Lichtenberg pattern across the ground,
unique to the area immediately
surrounding Shiprock.
The next series of images show the evolution
in the magnitude of this type of formation.
These are all examples from the Four
Corners region in Northern Arizona.
First, when lightning similar in magnitude
to what we see today strikes the ground,
it sweeps surrounding
surface sand to it,
drawing it to the lightning channel
and creating a shallow crater.
Examples of this were
shown in part one,
where lightning created small
craters with a pile of sand
left behind in a small cone.
Again, these are not anthills,
although they could easily be mistaken
for them on cursory examination.
There are no ants, no
opening in the mound,
and it's dusted over the top
with sand fused into pebbles.
The pebbles rest in a thin layer over the
top, like sprinkles on an ice cream cone.
And beneath it is
powder-fine sand.
The top layer was
formed from sand
pulled into the lightning channel
and fused into pebbles by heat,
then dropped back on top of the mound
when the flame extinguished.
They bear the same character
as the Minette material
in Shiprock's center
and dike formations.
All of the mound material and
surrounding sand measures high in pH.
The following images show buttes
at various stages of growth.
The first exhibits an
up-welling of Minette.
The second and third images show
the broken remains of the sheath,
and the last image
shows the dark Minette
partially surrounded by
the lighter rock sheath.
Another type of lightning-formed
butte has a different morphology
that appears to be created by a
negative cloud-to-ground lightning--
the type of lightning that emanates
from the belly of a thunderstorm.
Because the Earth is generally
a negatively charged body,
at least in terms
of ground charge,
it forms a double layer at the
interface with the atmosphere.
When a thunderstorm forms and
the electric field strengthens,
positively charged ions in the
atmospheric zone of the double layer
collect above the ground
beneath the storm.
Before negative cloud-to-
ground lightning strikes,
it pulls this material into
positive ionic streamers
that reach up to connect with the
electron avalanche produced by the cloud.
When the streamer and avalanche leader
connect, a circuit is completed
and current discharges
through the channel,
electrons flowing to ground and
positive ions flowing up to the clouds.
The magnetic field created by the current
wraps tightly around the channel,
compressing it to a narrow path
in what is known as a Z-pinch.
'Z-pinch' has been
demonstrated in the lab
by simply passing current
through an aluminum can,
with the electrodes connected
at the top and bottom.
The resulting pinch crushes the
can into an hourglass shape.
In the huge primordial storms that we
theorize occurred in Earth's past,
such lightning and pinch effects
resulted in huge amounts of positive ionic
material being swept to the lightning channel
with such extreme force it sometimes
created supersonic winds.
Fulgamites formed by sustained,
giant cloud-to-ground arcs
display the effects of discharging
current, accumulation of ionic dust,
Z-pinch, and the supersonic winds
and shockwaves they produced.
The images presented show the
progression of such an event.
First, the strike forms a raised platform,
with a shallow crater in the center
where the lightning created
an electrode spot.
The rim of the crater is material swept
inward by ionic winds and fused.
There is a road cutting through
the crater in the first image
to give some perspective of
how large this feature is.
These images are from Arizona, near Pastora
Mountain in the Four Corners region.
A more sustained strike begins to accumulate
neutralizing material on the spot,
forming a flat-topped
dome, like a pancake.
As the material accumulates, the pancake
grows to a mesa-type structure,
held together in a round
form by the magnetic pinch.
In the next phase of growth,
the mesa grows taller
and the inflow winds begin
to reach Mach speeds,
creating shockwaves that mold the rim
material into triangular standing waveforms.
A detailed discussion of this shock wave
and the triangular buttress
formations they create
is presented more fully in
previous articles on Arc Blast.
As neutralized material builds, the
anode spot the lightning connects with
is at the top of the
mesa and rises with it.
The strength of the pitch
narrows the top forming a cone,
and new regions of windblown, fused
and shock-shaped buttresses
form rims outside the older rim.
The difference between lightning-
formed pinnacles like Shiprock
and the broad mountain
forms shown in these images
seems to be polarity
in the lightning.
This interpretation
is preliminary,
but it appears that positive
lightning burrows into the ground
to connect with negative ionic
matter beneath the surface,
whereas negative lightning attracts surface
winds and dust to it to build a mountain.
Positive lightning
raises a narrow pinnacle
of negatively charged material
that boils up from the ground
with dikes which display the current
path through the subsurface.
Not much material is drawn
to it from the surroundings,
except for the sheath of
rock it forms around it.
Negative lightning connects
with pools and streamers
of positively charged matter at the surface
and pulls huge amounts of airborne dust
to create a dome with
hardened, buttressed rims.
In both cases, mountains can form around
them due to ambient winds and blowing dust.
Positive arc fulgamites can form
monoclines along the dikes
if ambient, supersonic winds strike
them to create a standing wave,
where dust piles into long, linear
ranges of triangular waveforms.
The last image of above, taken at Comb
Ridge monocline in northern Arizona,
shows where fulgamites and dikes
are exposed in the monocline.
These protrusions
created a shock wave
in Mach speed ambient winds that
formed a linear standing wave,
against which the monocline was formed
like a dune, as blowing dust accumulated.
There are several monoclines
on the Colorado Plateau
that exhibit the same
or similar features.
Negative arc fulgamites
create their own winds,
bringing dust to pile against
them from all directions,
and if powerful enough,
form standing shockwaves
that generate buttresses in
a ring around the base.
The circular craters and mesas in
the images were formed by lightning
while the mountain was expanded by
wind-borne dust accumulating around them.
There are several examples of mountains with
these features in the Four Corners region.
Mountains are a misunderstood
feature of the planet.
Geological concepts are based on rocks
forming deep in Earth's crust and being exposed
by erosion and tectonic motions, entailing
of course, hundreds of millions of years.
It's a very complex
process that has not,
and cannot, be witnessed or
confirmed by experiment.
Mountain formation by wind and electric
discharge, however, can be witnessed in nature.
Sand dunes are a prime example.
Mountains can also be produced
in laboratories. So can rock.
It happens when slag is
produced from welding,
ore and metal processing, or from
chemical reactions like cement.
Atomic and molecular bonding
is an electrical process --
the exchange and
sharing of electrons.
Electricity and wind is a far more
plausible mechanism for mountain building
than what is proposed by
the consensus theories.
Especially since the actions
of wind and lightning
that formed mountains on the Earth
can be seen in any thunderstorm.
One only needs to extrapolate the
forces and energies involved
to what they would have been
when Earth was in a much larger,
stronger electrical environment.
Amplify the electric field of a
thunderstorm by orders of magnitude,
and it will produce
an ionized atmosphere,
screaming with supersonic winds, ionized
dust, and incredible discharges of lightning
that dwarf what we
experience today.
For examples, we need only to
look at our neighboring planets.
These conditions exist on
Jupiter, Saturn and Venus.
Why would Earth
be any different?
Thank you.

Welcome to Space News from
the Electric Universe,

The NASA Space Agency is
preparing to launch a spacecraft
that will approach the sun more closely
than any man-made technology in history.
NASA's Parker Solar Probe,
a robotic spacecraft intended
to explore, among other things,
the mysteries of the solar wind,
and the enduring puzzle
of coronal heating,
will approach within less than four
million miles of the sun's photosphere
or what is sometimes referred
to as the sun's surface.
For decades, within the
Electric Universe community,
our scientists have proposed a
radically alternative model of the Sun
based on principles of electrical
engineering and plasma physics.
Today, retired professor Dr. Donald Scott
outlines the opportunities for the NASA mission
to test the predictions
of the Electric Sun model.
NASA has been talking for several
years about their Solar Probe.
This is a space probe
really, that is going to go as close
to the Sun as they can get it
without melting it.
The vehicle is due to be
launched about August 11th
and the only reason I thought maybe we should
talk about a little bit here on Space News
is that there are some things
that are very good about it
and some things that I think
are sort of overblown about it.
So let me just, sort of, give
you a mind-dump from this end
as to what I think
about it.
The mission is scheduled
to last about 7 years
and it's going to use a slowdown
technique of using Venus to slow it down
and so on these various
orbits around the sun
it will approach closer, more
closely and more closely.
But NASA says it will "fly
through the sun's atmosphere."
Well now, that right-off-the-bat depends on
how you define the extent of the atmosphere
because the particles in the so-called solar
wind travel out as far as the heliopause
and that's about 18
billion kilometers.
That's more than three times
the distance to Pluto
and that's really the sun's
atmosphere using one definition.
But I don't think they're talking about
that. They're talking, I think, about
the atmosphere as far
out as the Corona.
Well, that presents
a problem actually
because this morning's NASA press release
says that the Parker Solar Probe will
"Touch the Sun".
That's, I think we recognize
that as overblown rhetoric
and it's designed to
impress the public
but it doesn't lend confidence to anybody who
wants to take their press releases seriously.
Be that as it may, the vehicle
is going to get closer to the Sun
than any other man-made
object has ever gotten
and the orbit of the probe will be
closely restricted to the ecliptic plane.
That is to say it'll go around the Sun
in, essentially around the sun's equator.
So anything that's going on over
the sun's poles such as these
very important, to me at least,
coronal plumes or coronal streamers,
these long thin twisting streams
of current and magnetic field
that extend outward from the
sun's North and South poles,
those are possible sources of
the electrical charge flow
that maintains the
sun's positive voltage.
Well, we aren't going to learn anything
about those from the Parker Solar Probe.
But anyway, NASA says that the
probe will get within a distance,
when they really get down to saying it,
about 4 million miles from the Sun surface.
Now that's about nine solar radii. That
is, if you look at a picture of the sun
and put an imaginary dot
right in the middle of it,
the distance from that dot out to the
what looks like the surface of the sun
is the so-called surface
of the photosphere.
It's the closest-in surface
that is not opaque
so that photospheric surface,
you can't see through it.
So we talk about
that as the sun's surface.
But that four million miles that the probe
will get within is nine solar radii
so if you measure from that dot
out to the edge of the Sun
and then go nine
times that distance,
that's as far in as this
Parker probe is going to get.
Well, the farthest out that the corona
extends is about five solar radii
or so. It varies with the time of
the quiet Sun and the active Sun
but it gets about five, three
to five to six maybe at most
out from the surface of the Sun.
So my point is, the Parker Solar Probe
is not even going to get close
to the outermost
regions of the corona.
So this is a far cry
from "Touching the Sun".
However, it's a lot closer
than we've ever been before.
The power density radiation that's coming out
of this, out of the photosphere of the Sun,
is in the neighborhood of 6,000
watts per square centimeter.
So if you put your fingers and make a
little square about one centimeter, this
is roughly a half
an inch by half an inch,
and think of 6,000 watts of electrical
light coming out of that
one square centimeter,
that's a lot of power.
So, at a distance of 9 solar radii which
is where the probe is going to get to,
that radiation power ought to be about
74 watts per square centimeter.
Maybe you say well,
that's not very much,
74 watts per square centimeter.
Well yeah, but you realize there are 10,000
square centimeters in a square meter
so that means that that solar
probe, the heat shield on it,
has to either absorb or reflect
some 740,000 watts per square meter.
That's a lot of energy, a lot of power
energy per unit time coming at that thing.
So, NASA says they're expecting a
temperature of around 2,500 Fahrenheit.
Well okay, so I guess the
main 'get down to brass tacks',
what can the
Parker probe measure?
We've mentioned some
things that it can't measure.
Well, one of the things
I hope it can measure
and I don't know whether they will program
it or be interested enough to do it,
is there are these things
called coronal caps.
If you look at a nice picture of the
sun when it's at solar eclipse,
you can see these, all
these triangular things.
Some people say they
look like dunce
caps, other people
say they look like
wizards' caps with streamers
coming out of them,
but they're these triangular things
and there's so easily, well half a
dozen or more usually
are around,
somewhere around the sun.
Why they form, these coronal
caps, why do they form?
Well, we in the Electric Universe
know very well why they form,
they're due to the tendency
of plasma to form filaments.
When plasma leaves the Sun, it
doesn't go radially outward,
or like if you spread 
the fingers of your hand
and look at the angles at
which your fingers go out.
Plasma doesn't go out
like that, radially.
It goes out and then comes
back and joins in together,
it forms these triangles,
these solar caps.
I'm hoping that the Parker probe
might be able to get close enough
to take some pictures of those solar caps
and get the detail of what they look like
because those caps may very well be
the origins of the Birkeland currents
that connect out from the
sun to the various planets.
We have of course one to Earth
there's a gigantic one out to Jupiter,
another one to Saturn,
to Neptune, to Uranus...
And so, if they can ever
get pictures of what those,
what those condensed
plasma streams,
what some people call it, the
magnetic flux ropes, look like,
that would be very nice.
This probe is going to carry
a wide-field imager.
It's called WISPR, W I S P R.
That WISPR might
get some pictures.
I'm praying 'might', of the, first pictures we've
seen up close of a Birkeland current stream.
Finally, one of the
announced goals of mission
is to identify the cause
of coronal heating.
This coronal heating effect is, astronomers
were worried about that for decades.
Why is the lower
corona 2 million degrees
whereas the photospheric surface of the sun
right below that 2 million is only at 6,000?
And so, it's pretty mysterious.
It's been that way for decades
and they are desperately trying
to find out why that occurs.
We in the Electric Universe,
we know what causes it.
It's caused by collisions of
electrically accelerated ions
coming out of the top of
the photospheric tufts
and going, slamming into the bottom of
the corona. These collisions
create turbulence and turbulence
is measured as temperature.
So this happens right above
the surface of the photosphere.
That's at one solar radius,
not not 9 or 6 or whatever.
So the Parker probe will be unable to
reveal the cause of coronal heating
because it can't get
to where the action is,
it can't get to where
the effect is happening.
So keep your eyes peeled for any new
hypothetical non-electrical explanations
that fall out of this.
I hope that they don't do that because
they will be imaginary of things
if they are. The cause
of the coronal heating
and the temperature minimum,
so-called, of the sun,
is way beyond the capability
of the probe to see it.
The probe is instrumented to be able to
measure electric field strengths though
and magnetic field strengths.
An instrument called SWEAP, S W E A P
that stands for Solar Wind Electrons
Alpha-particles and Protons.
That instrument can measure the velocity
density and temperature of those particles.
And that would be very interesting to
get measurements of those particles
and see how closely they fit
into the Electric Sun model.
I suspect, if they do
make those measurements
they will probably be surprised
and I'll be very happy.
There's another
instrument called ISOIS
and ISOIS will also measure the
properties of solar wind particles.
NASA's description
says this will
"... help determine which of
several theorized mechanisms
causes the particles in the
solar wind to accelerate."
Now that is not possible if
you stop and think about it
because if you measure
however accurately,
the velocity, the density and the temperature
of a particle or a bunch of particles,
that tells you nothing at all
about where they came from.
You can take a picture of an automobile
flying at high speed down a major highway
and so he says, well, why
is it going that fast?
And so he says, well, it's got
a high rpm gasoline engine
and the other guy next
to it says, no no no
it's a high-torque electric
motor, it's a Tesla, you know.
That's my sort of half humorous
attempt or attempt at half humor
to say that you can't by taking an
instantaneous measurement of a velocity
or even an acceleration,
determine why this thing has
the properties that it does.
What got it going so fast. You can't
tell.  You can tell it's going fast
but there's no way to say this
will determine this measurement.
Which of several theorized mechanisms
caused the particlesâ€™ acceleration?
Anyway, we're gonna hear about
lots of data being collected,
lots of these images being taken,
what particles were
seen in the solar wind.
I'm praying that we do not hear
that they have observed magnetic
reconnection one more time
because it's nonsense.
I think, eventually they will
come to realize this but...
But what will be very
interesting for any measurements
that are mentioned, interesting to
us in the Electric Universe
are: any actual physical measurements
of electric field strengths,
current densities, particle
velocities and accelerations
and also measurements of the
filamentation I was talking about.
And the reason is because
astronomers have long maintained
that plasma cannot support
an electric field.
Well then why did they instrument
the Parker Solar Probe
with instruments that can
measure electric fields?
Because they have put out of their mind
the possibility that electric fields
can exist in plasma.
And by golly, there is one thing
sure, they're gonna be flying around
within a tremendous
amount of plasma
and trying to measure the
electric fields there.
I suspect, they will indeed
measure electric fields there
and I don't know how they're
gonna cope with that,
how they are going to explain it.
I'm confident because in SAFIRE,
the SAFIRE laboratory experiment
that we have here on Earth,
they have measured electric fields
of upward of 8,000 volts per meter.
And so, if they do measure any electric
fields out there, it's gonna be interesting
to see how they
explain them away.
Anyway, every day that the
Parker probe survives
this wildly hot environment that
it's gonna pass through, is a testament
to the professional
expertise of its designers
and the engineers who created it.
I feel very strongly that it's going
to be a marvelous engineering feat.
But the official NASA interpretations
of any data it manages to send back
must be filtered to
exclude fictions
such as magnetic reconnection
and open-ended magnetic fields
and shockwaves in non-
collisional plasmas.
There's no collisions,
how can there be shockwaves?
Well, there's a whole bunch of things
like that that NASA seems to be fond of
dredging up and
throwing at the public
that we have to be aware of.
This new NASA probe has the possibility of
making some new, very useful measurements
provided that everybody realizes that the
actual restrictions inherent in its abilities
are what they are.
Anyway, we await the
reports with bated breath
and we are also armed
with a rational skepticism
of overreaching assumptions that may
be proposed as factual causations
that are not.

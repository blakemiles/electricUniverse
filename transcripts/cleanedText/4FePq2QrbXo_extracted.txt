Albert Einstein is a cultural phenomenon. He has enjoyed
scientific celebrity status for decades. He also has a lot of
critics, although you don't hear too much about them from
Popular Science sources. Ironically, I sometimes wonder if he
would be more sympathetic to his detractors if
he were still around today. And I say that in all
seriousness. “I am no Einstein” he once joked
in response to the adulation that began in his
lifetime. According to Wikipedia – yes, I know - the
German-born theoretical physicist is widely ranked among the
greatest scientists of all time. Despite his cult-hero status 
however, growing numbers do not even regard him as a
scientist, let alone great. The clue is in the two words
‘theoretical physics’. This rests almost entirely on
mathematical modeling, unlike classical
science which emphasizes experimentation and
observation. Quote, “As far as the laws of mathematics refer
to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are
certain, they do not refer to reality.” Close quote,
Albert Einstein. To summarize this philosophical
viewpoint, one common among critics of Einstein and apparently
Einstein himself, ”Math should be ancillary, not dominant.”
Making science subservient to mathematics is putting the
cart before the horse, let alone hubristic. Just think
epicycles, where the mathematical model can make accurate
predictions up to a point, yet fail to reflect the underlying
reality. Heavier-than-air flight was also considered impossible
a little over 100 years ago, and they had the math to prove
it. The importance of mathematics is not denied. Again, the
point is that the math should follow the science, rather than
building the science on idealized mathematical models
and selectively interpreting data to fit. Furthermore,
current models rely on three variables to balance the equations
- equivocations, some might say - dark matter and dark
energy are the oft-cited Achilles heel of pop science.
They remain undetected after decades of searching
despite allegedly comprising roughly 90% of the universe. Those
who pretend there isn't any debate to be had on the dominant
role of mathematics and science have a problem. But don't
take my word for it. Quote “Physics is mathematical not
because we know so much about the physical world,
but because we know so little. End quote, Bertrand
Russell. Quote, “Today’s scientists have
substituted mathematics for experiments,
and they wander off through equation after equation,
and eventually build a structure which has no relation to
reality.” End quote, Nicola Tesla. Oh, and here is
another one from Einstein himself, quote, “Since the
mathematicians have invaded the theory of relativity,
I do not understand it myself anymore.” End
quote. Even if you think Einstein had his tongue planted
firmly in his cheek at the time, I would suggest that many a
true word is spoken in jest. Philosophical issues aside,
Stephen Crothers has done a fine job exposing the flaws
and leaps of faith in so much math-based
cosmology. A preeminent mathematician, he
is counted among the most competent critics of 
general relativity, the Big Bang and black holes et al.
Quote, “Hawking was a pop scientist who ipso facto contributed
nothing of value to science. Einstein was the first pop
scientist; promoted sometime or another
by that other entertainer, Charlie
Chaplin. Hawking and the Einstein cult have ruined physics
and astronomy, turning them into circus freak shows.” Science
cannot just wait until they all disappear. Whilst they
are active, they are ruining young minds entering science,
to be caught up in the same rat race, producing more pop
scientists. The cycle must be broken.” End quote, Stephen
Crothers. Too bad that, for the time being at least, complex
and esoteric math shield so much institutional science from
robust scrutiny. Quote, “If you can't explain 
it simply, you don't understand it well
enough.” End quote, Albert Einstein. Isaac Newton
admitted he did not understand the mechanism behind
gravity and had to settle for describing it mathematically.
Quote, “But hitherto I have not been able to discover the cause
of those properties of gravity from phenomena,
and I frame no hypotheses.” End quote, Isaac
Newton. Einstein solved this problem by factoring in time
as an additional dimension, the fourth dimension resulting
in alleged spacetime curvature. But has he effectively
replaced a mathematical description with a mathematical
abstraction? Quote, “There is no model of the theory of
gravitation today, other than the mathematical form.” End quote
Richard Feynman. In classrooms today, Einstein’s solution is
sometimes illustrated by rolling balls around on suspended
blankets with the smaller balls being attracted to the
larger mass in the middle, as if falling into the well of
spacetime. This self-evidently relies on gravity as
its own explanation. It's a classic case of circular
reasoning. Time dilation is often cited as conclusive
evidence for special relativity. But could bias confirmation
be the significant factor here? In 1972 Hafele and Keating
performed experiments that purported to confirm special
relativity. The evidence was derived from the differences
in time recorded by cesium clocks transported in aircraft
moving east and west. However, the results have
been contested. Louis Essen for example, the
inventor of the atomic clock, published an article in which
he discussed the inadequate accuracy of the experiments.
Essen concluded that the theory was no more than a
bunch of contradictory assumptions, together with actual
mistakes. It is important to add a caveat to the above.
When time contraction and length dilation can be observed, it
doesn't necessarily lend credence to the fantastical
spacetime framework. Quote, “Poincare’s advancement of
Lorentz's ether is mathematically indistinguishable
from ‘Special Relativity,’ while being utterly opposed
to Minkowski's diagrams and formalization 
of ’isotropic constancy’ found in the
spacetime metaphysics regime.” End quote, Anti- 
Relativity.com. GPS is often cited as conclusive
proof for general relativity but this is a fallacy too. but
According to this 1996 paper published by the GPS joint program
office, quote, “The operational control system (OCS) of the
Global Positioning System (GPS) does not include the rigorous
transformations between coordinate systems that Einstein's
general theory of reality would seem to require.” End
quote. Adjustments are made, but this is because clocks at
high altitude tick faster resulting from variations in air
density, not gravity. The air is denser closer to the Earth's
surface. Atomic clocks are also sensitive to temperature
and pressure changes in their orbit. In addition to
dark matter and dark energy, black holes are also talked
about today as if they were real. Consensus scientists
who describe them as one of the most successful
predictions of relativity choose to ignore the fact that
Einstein dismissed the idea. In a 1939 paper from the Annals
of Mathematics, he concluded that the black hole hypothesis
was not convincing and the phenomena did not exist in the
real world. The paper is now hidden behind a
paywall, but there is also a reference to it at
History.com. Bizarrely, theoretical physicists
describe black holes as points with zero
volume, infinite density, and infinite mass. Think about that.
Does this concept sound credible, or more like another
mathematical abstraction? Claims that a black
hole has been pictured for the first time at the
center of Galaxy M87 are at best contentious. The
straightforward plasma focus approach makes more sense on every
level. Einstein coined the term “spooky action
at a distance,” latterly referred to as “quantum
entanglement.” It seems that one particle knows something
about another particle instantaneously over a vast
distance. This phenomenon is problematic because it breaks
the speed of light barrier, supposedly the upper speed limit
of the universe. Because it contradicts special
relativity, Einstein was compelled to issue a traffic
violation. Quote, “I cannot seriously believe in it because
the theory cannot be reconciled with the idea that physics
should represent a reality in time and space,
free from spooky action at a distance.”
End quote, Albert Einstein in a letter to Max Born 1947. 
SAD - Spooky Action at a Distance - has been
confirmed post Einstein. As a result,
we have seen numerous attempts to
reconcile it with SR - Special Relativity - by the mathematical
mysticism known as quantum physics. Quantum superposition
conjectures that particles can exist in
different states simultaneously. Much
like the criminal who claimed to be at home
when he was seen robbing a store. Science
fiction can't hold a candle to it. That much
is certain. But I'll take a step back. I'm
not saying quantum physics is entirely without
merit, just that it's highly speculative too.
To be fair to Einstein, he was a modest man and a reluctant
hero. The truth is that others ran with his ideas,
and ran, and ran. Today they are still
running around like dogs sniffing each other's
butts. Typical of this breed is the British Professor Dr. Brian
Cox who made the seamless transition from pop star to
pop scientist. He was a keyboard player
with D:Ream in the '90s. They had a UK number
one hit with “Things Can Only Get Better.”
I'm not saying Cox is any worse than any
of the other talking heads paraded on television today. But
things really don't seem to be getting any better. Daring to
question relativity remains an anathema, and doing 
so is liable to draw comparisons with flat earth
quackery. Cox is the UK's answer to
America's Neil deGrasse Tyson. Several
luminaries regard him as the best man to front 
BBC scientific programming moving forward.
Which reminds me of Fred Hoyle’s famous words. Another former
Royal Astronomer, Hoyle was critical of peer review and the
graduate school system and their abject failure to encourage
independent thinking. Prophetically, he summed it up: “The
road ahead is hammered out!” Quote, “Unthinking
respect for authority is the greatest enemy of truth.”
End quote, Albert Einstein. A famous line from
Shakespeare's Twelfth Night seems apposite: “Some
are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness
thrust upon them.” I submit that Einstein belongs in the
latter category. He was more victim than genius at a time
when science took a wrong turn and mathematical modeling
began to take precedence over traditional 
empiricism. Doubt is supposed to be at
the heart of good science. The funny thing is though,
while Einstein's fan club hang on almost every word he
uttered, they ignored his many doubts. 
The last word belongs to him, but
quote, “You can imagine that I look back
on my life's work with calm satisfaction.
But from nearby it looks quite different. There is not a
single concept of which I'm convinced that it will stand firm,
and I feel uncertain whether I'm in general on
the right track”. End quote. Albert Einstein.

Every butte has a crack, but not 
all cracks are beautiful. Though
some are magnificent, ruler-straight and
parallel, some can be ugly, chaotic mangles.
But there's a quixotic pattern to ugly
cracks, so we must not discriminate.
Whether they make lovely geometric
shapes or chaotic mangles, a study of
cracks is essential to Electric Universe science.
The reason is cracks are interfaces –
boundary layers – and electrically,
that's where the action is.
To understand any geology, the first
thing to look for is boundary layers.
Charge collects at boundary layers where
it displays the effects of inductance
and capacitance most prominently.
To begin with, the outside of Earth's
crust is a boundary layer. Sonic
shockwaves made the geometry, and
electricity made the chemistry. Wind, 
also motivated by electric currents,
made things move – kinetics. Energy 
came from within the Earth as a
release of stored capacitance. That in a 
nutshell explains the face of the Earth.
The creation of virtually every
mountain, hill, and dale on the planet is
summarized in those sentences.
The devil is in the details, however, so
that's why we're looking at cracks.
Cracks are the remnant of capacitor
interfaces in Nature's circuitry. They are
boundary layers between different materials.
The boundary layer separates two dielectrics
with a double layer of charge – a capacitor.
The dielectric difference was due to
difference in dielectric properties of the
material at the time it was laid down by plasma
winds. The dielectric properties differed due
to the elemental and molecular makeup of the
material and the state it was in at the time.
The material's temperature, density and 
pressure influenced the material’s dielectric, and
shockwaves produce sharp
discontinuities in pressure, density,
temperature, as well as charge density.
First, let's dismiss cracks that aren't
part of the electric circuit we want to examine.
Some cracks are from thermal stresses as
matter cooled and contracted, or
structural as matter shook and settled
from seismic forces. These cracks are
generally vertically aligned due to gravity.
Gravity makes the fracture plane
vertical because it's the path of least
resistance, where gravity's force vector
has no influence holding the rock together.
A good example is how hydraulic 
fracturing is done in oil and gas production.
A fluid is pumped into the wellbore to
the bottom of the hydrocarbon formation,
and pressurized until the wellbore
pressure exceeds the overburden pressure.
Fluid pressure separates the rock
vertically, creating a fissure that
extends the contact to the wellbore upward
into the hydrocarbon-bearing formation.
The practice allows access to
hydrocarbons otherwise locked away in
dead zones far from the well.
But that's just to illustrate that
vertical fracturing is predictable, applied science.
A cooling, contracting rock will fracture
vertically for the same reason that
is swelling the rock under pressure
fractures vertically – Newton's laws.
Some cracks are due to lightning. These
are certainly electrical, but lightning finds its own 
path. It's not wave-guided by interfaces other
than the surface it contacts, which 
still leaves much freedom of motion.
Therefore, lightning wanders, following
conductive paths on the surface it strikes.
It may be vertically oriented,
vectored by the electric field,
but it will generally not display a pure
geometry, such as straight lines and
polygonal forms. Its form is chaotic.
Lightning-blasted rock often displays
shearing where the blast fractured rock,
or melting, burning or chemical reaction
from the heat and charge. A dipolar 
magnetic signature should be
detectable across the current path.
But lightning scars are not the type of
cracks we want to talk about today.
We want to discuss cracks generated by
shockwaves and electricity at the shear
zone between the land and plasma winds,
at a time when Earth was embroiled
in the epic maelstrom of creation.
In other words, we want cracks made 
where the filthy underbelly, the Ouroboros
scraped the land. The Ouroboros, or the
penultimate representation of the concept anyway,
is the plasma wind that wrapped the
Earth during key stages of its evolution.
Sharp discontinuities and plasma winds
caused by supersonic shockwaves left
imprints in deposits of ionized dust,
which manifested as cracks as the dust
recombined to form rock. The 
discontinuity in a shockwave
includes density, pressure,
charge density and dielectric properties, which
electrically makes it act like a capacitor.
Therefore, cracks in rocks are the
all-important proof of wind formation
and the circuitry in the plasma winds.
To define a crack, first of all means an
intrusion or separation between rock matrices,
or the boundary between stratified
layers, whether the space between is a
void or filled with material.
Therefore, we include rock, veins, dikes,
shelves, faults and similar geologic
structures, along with empty cracks.
The difference is whether material is
pulled into the crack, or expelled from
the crack by electric fields. Either way 
the crack was made by shockwaves.
That is why there are a lot of diagonal
cracks. Also, polygonal cracks. There are
triangles, rectangles, squares and
diamonds, everywhere in the rocks, the
mountain flanks, and the outline of mountain peaks.
The mountains are composed of triangles
at virtually every scale. These were caused by
shockwaves. It's also why they form at particular
angles. Mainstream theory assumes rock
strata always form horizontally, and then
”uplift” shifts strata into various angles.
Uplift is assumed to be caused by the
stretching and compression of the
crust due to tectonic movements.
It is then assumed erosion from wind, ice,
vegetation, and rain over millions or
billions of years then polishes the crustal
surface into the forms we see today.
The assumptions they make are actually ridiculous.
Most rock is very brittle. Limestones and
sandstones can break in your hands.
Igneous rock like granite, break with a
whack of a hammer. If the planet's crust churned the
way they say, under the forces of compression and
expansion, lifting and falling, all the while
scraping and jostling for billions of years,
the mountains would be piles of rubble,
not sharply defined tetrahedrons.
Erosion would further break rocks apart,
smoothing their edges, rounding their
corners, and dissolving any geometry they might
have had. The mainstream model of tectonics would
leave piles of sand and rubble. Yet, 
what we see are sharply defined
geometries that accurately and
predictably follow the form of sonic
shockwaves and the separation bubbles
they form at the wind-ground interface.
When a shockwave forms, it forms at an
angle to the wind's direction determined
by the ratio of the wind's speed to the
speed of sound, called the Mach number. A
Mach number of one or more means the
wind is supersonic. A Mach number of two
means the wind is twice the speed of sound, and 
so on. The incident angle the shockwave makes
with the ground varies with the Mach
number, so it can be used to determine if
winds were consistent, forming at consistent
angle or variable in either speed or direction.
If you know the density of the
atmosphere you can determine the
velocity of the wind from the Mach angle.
Shockwaves reflect from an interface,
like the ground, just like a beam
of light reflects from a mirror.
The angle of reflection complements the incident
angle. The ground forms a plane shockwaves
reflect from. Wherever supersonic winds blew,
and evidence suggests that was nearly the
entire face of the Earth, standing waves formed
and reflected from the ground from every channel of
jetstream wind. In fact, shockwaves formed
whenever a jet stream wind changed direction or
expanded or sheared against the Earth or another
wind. Therefore, shockwaves patterned the
winds. And the wind rippled with shock-
waves as they deposited dust and sand,
and the deposits retained those patterns.
Figure 9 compares images of a diagram of
a standing shockwave reflecting from
a surface from wind tunnel tests
with an impression of a shockwave reflection
in a mountain exposed by a road cut.
Every feature of the laboratory-produced
shockwave is evident in the road cut. The
angle between the incident shockwave
and the reflected shockwave forms a Y.
Inside the Y there is a step in the stratigraphy.
The Y forms a discontinuity where the
layers take a step down as if this wedge sank.
They also angle, or dip differently, just
as the pressure regimes inside the Y in the
diagram do. The stratigraphy inside and out of the
discontinuity closely matches the
”stratigraphy” of pressure regimes in the
boundary layer of supersonic winds –
because this hill was formed in the
boundary layer of a supersonic wind.
Look people, this ain't no damn coincidence.
How could this happen by conventional theory?
How could this wedge drop a few feet and
neatly fit the Y without its edges even getting
ruffled? The Y isn't straight; it has a hyperbolic
compound curve. How could the wedge sink and 
still match this curve perfectly without pinching or
leaving gaps, and without disturbing the
geometry of the curves or strata inside
or on either side of the discontinuity?
Why does the angle of the wedge strata
shift with respect to surroundings on the
left and the lower right, but not at the upper
right where the strata remains consistent
across the discontinuity? How come,
while falling into the crack, the wedge became
thicker and the big white band of strata at the top,
but only on one side of it? None of this makes sense,
unless you consider wind deposition at the boundary
layer of a standing shockwave reflection.
The discontinuities are the impressions
left by the incident and reflected shock
waves. They form a sharp geometric
boundary with no evidence of friction between.
As dust deposited, it met this shockwave
and followed the pressure and charge
density profile of the shockwave.
Dust was sucked down into this hole by pressure
differentials across the boundary layer, but layered in
proportionate thickness to the step voltages
that segregated each pressure regime,
and the type of dust being delivered by the
plasma wind. The wind had to pile this dust and
gravel pretty fast, because the layers filled
concurrently. That is, these layers didn't stack up one
after the other. They fire-hosed in, each layer at the
same time, segregated by the dielectric properties of
the dust and the electric winds. It's 
amazing when you think about it, but
this was all one flow, segregated like a
rainbow that came suddenly to a stop and
compacted itself into a mountain,
freezing in that moment this shock
reflection and the effect of its sudden pressure
anomaly in the airflow. See the damn pattern.
These images are scientific proof, a direct link
between repeatable, empirical tests and nature.
This is far more evidence than anything
geologists have presented for any of
their tectonic theories. Any. Ever.
Their theories are built on the big
ideas of arrogant, goateed bow tied phonies,
without a shred of empirical evidence.
Their evidence is conveniently shrouded in the
depths of time. Millions and billions of years of
imperceptible, sand grain-by-sand grain
movement, which they are still working to
explain how CO2 made happen.
Who are we to question them?
Actually, there's no need to question them.
Just stop listening to them and for
christ's sake stop giving them money.
The shock features exhibited in the road
cut is only a small part in the full picture
of a supersonic wind-generated shockwave.
It's best to think of a shockwaves as the membrane
of a bubble. On one side of the membrane is a gas of
higher pressure than on the other.
The entire bubble structure is very
complex however, with regions of
expansion and compression, recirculation,
laminar flow and turbulence and a supersonic
wind is passing through the bubble.
In a dusty plasma, it gets even more
complex, with electric fields, sheets of
current and step voltages across the membranes,
which is no longer the physics of fluid
dynamics, but of magneto-hydrodynamics.
The following image shows where I think
the road cut feature came from. This 
part of the shockwave, circled in red,
is a part of the structure that dips
into the separation bubble, which is the
turbulent region at the base of the bubble.
The separation bubble is where dust
collects, which ultimately buried the tip of the 
shockwave. The shockwave is not the primary
incident wave, but it's a harmonic
reflection of it that does not always
form, but depends on conditions.
Note the fine vertical lines to the
right of the primary shockwave in the image.
These are stepwise gradations of
pressure in the airflow throughout the shockwave
structure. In the plasma these gradations are also
steps in potential. These vertical gradations can
be seen in rocks crisscrossing the diagonal shock
waves produced by the Mach angle.
Sometimes dust can fill the entire
lambda foot structure. In the diagram where the
incident and reflected shock meet at a triple point,
in which case you get mountains like
this. To be clear, some mountains are
formed inside the separation bubble
or separated flow zone which is the
wedge at the very bottom of the structure.
And some mountains fill the entire
lambda shock structure, the large triangular feature.
The lambda foot manifests at the base of
every shock reflection, so it is a
repeating fractal element of the shock
wave and appears at different scales.
The stratigraphy in the separation bubble
”dips”, meaning it's angled with respect 
to horizontal, consistent with the wind's
vector inside the shock bubble, because 
that is how the wind layers its dust load.
Mountains that fill the entire lambda
structure may have stratigraphy that
dips at a shallower angle than the dip of the
Mach angle displayed by its flat triangular face,
because the wind was vectored upward and dust
fell, filling the lambda foot from the bottom.
Although this should not be taken as
a hard and fast rule because there's
always variables. Generally speaking,
of wind-generated mountains,
it can be said that is why shallow
dipping hills, foothills and mountains
have layered stratigraphy that dips with
the contour of the mountain, while larger
triangular peaks are more like layered
bricks, not necessarily horizontal, but a
relatively shallow angle at odds with its outline.
Mount Everest is a good example of a big
lambda foot mountain. In fact at 29,029 feet I'm
pretty confident it's the biggest, baddest lambda
foot ever. Follow its stratigraphy, such as 
its famous “yellow band” and you can see the
dip in relation to the facets of its outline.
That's how mountains are formed.
The evidence is everywhere, and looking
at cracks yields well, mountains of
information about their genesis.
The interface between stratigraphic
layers are cracks by my definition, in
case you think I'm losing the thread;
talking about the shape of mountains instead 
of cracks. Cracks are the remnant signature of
shockwaves and electric currents
produced in the storm that built the
mountain, just as the outline of the
mountain is. The contour of the mountain,
the cracks in it, and the dip of its
sediments are all related to shockwaves.
The angles in their layers and contours
as pure information about their creation,
because information is always a waveform,
and the mountains store the waveform.
The shockwave and shockwave reflections
form an electric field across the walls
of the wave in the manner of a capacitor.
A double layer forms on the interface as
with a dielectric field between. The 
charged layers can be the same or
opposite polarity to the charge of the dust being
deposited, leaving either a void or hardened rock.
A hardened seam will have more
conductive material, like the quartz and
rock veins, than the surrounding rock matrix.
Mineral-bearing veins for instance, bear
conductive minerals like gold, silver and
copper because these conductive
materials were attracted by the electric field of the
shockwave, either as a vapor from the atmosphere, or
by diffusion through the ground.
Diffusion through the ground is how
consensus theory works, with the
attractor being hydrothermal venting.
Why hydrothermal venting should attract
metals from far and wide isn't clear.
An electric field does that though, without 
question. So our theory is already better if
Occam's razor means anything.
The quartz veins and the images of
granite were created by an emerging effect
of shockwaves, called traveling waves.
Note there are four wide quartz veins in the
larger image, in two pairs that parallel each other
diagonally across this granite face.
Traveling waves are semi-stable
reflected waves that migrate through a shockwave
structure due to instabilities in the bubble.
The even vertical lines that appear in
figure 10 are examples in a steady wind,
but shockwave bubbles can wobble
just like soap bubbles, producing
instabilities as wind speed and direction varies.
They move in harmony to the shockwave
frequency in repeating patterns and 
that is why there is a pair-of-a-pair,
of similarly structured, highly complex
repeating forms in these rock veins.
The next image shows clastic dykes in Washington 
state. These dikes are vertical-to-diagonal
intrusions in a sedimentary hill exposed by 
road cut. Each dike is layered vertically with
different fineness of sediment graded 
from silt to gravel, in each separate layer.
The sediments inside the dikes are completely
different material than the hill they intrude in.
It's as if each vertical layer of the
dike sucked a different dust down into it
from somewhere other than the mountain 
it's in. And that's exactly right. Each layer
in this dike was a separate funnel 
of air pulling dust down from
different regions of the shockwave bubble, 
where different grades and types of rock
were flowing in segregated jet stream winds.
The “funnels” were traveling waves that
deposited these dikes in little, downward-
pointing pressure regime spikes,
while the separation bubble filled around 
them. It's hard to think on this scale.
The cracks, dikes, and veins just shown
were produced in the very bottom of a
shockwave structure like the one shown in this image.
They formed in the turbulent back-end of the
separation bubble, a result of
friction where the wind literally
scraped the ground. Mountains like Everest, the 
Matterhorn, and thousands of lesser peaks were
formed by dust filling the entire lambda foot
structure, forged by winds and electric potentials
that are nearly incomprehensible.
Supersonic winds had to wrap the entire planet.
Earth looked like Jupiter, only a lot worse.
The fastest winds rolled up and down and
swept against the ground because they were
driven by electric currents coupled to Earth's.
Higher winds moved slower, circulating
positive charge in a halo over the
concomitant destruction and creation below.
Hence the Ouroboros.
It did circle the Earth, winding and coiling like
a serpent eating its tail. It's all circuitry.
Every feature points to the actions
upstream in the current path.
That is why the true creation story is knowable.
The patterns remain that tell the story.
Frequencies, harmonies, wavelengths, and 
wave guides. Shockwaves are wave guides.
Everything is electric. Everyone needs 
to know this, the sooner the better.

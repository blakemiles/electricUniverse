The surfaces of the rocky
bodies in our Solar System
testify to events that planetary
scientists have never considered.
The interpretive manual
of standard geology
limited to processes
such as random impacts,
wind and water erosion
and volcanism,
has never successfully explained countless
of the features we see on rocky planets.
For decades, experiments with electrical
discharges in the laboratory
have reproduced some of
the most puzzling craters
and other features seen
on planets and moons.
Within the Electric
Universe community,
a growing number of enquirers are
exploring the surface of our planet
identifying the indelible marks left
by high-energy electrical discharges.
In this episode, Thunderbolts
colleague Andy Hall
continues his remarkable
series of presentations
with his two-part exploration
of the 'Lightning-Scarred Earth'.
The blue-white arc of a
lightning bolt stuns the senses.
Blinding radiance, elemental
beauty, awesome power
and primordial danger flash
into existence from thin air
and vanish before
the mind catches-up.
We stare, immobile,
unthinking and awestruck.
In that moment, a channel of air the
diameter of a quarter heats 50,000 degrees,
as trillions of electrons
cascade to Earth.
The volume of air blows-up, radiating
energy across the spectrum,
and sending sonic
booms across the sky.
Lightning also pummels the land, creating
pressure waves exceeding 70,000 atmospheres --
that's 1 million psi.
It can create a layer of shocked quartz and
vitrify surrounding rock into glass.
Lightning is an interaction
between the Earth and sky.
Its cause is an electric field
between the electric storm above
and the ground beneath our feet.
'Ground' in this case is
also a technical term,
meaning the ambient voltage
potential of the soil.
Earth is a negatively
charged body in space
and current flows up from
ground to atmosphere,
normally in a drift of ions and
electrons that is invisible.
Storms reverse this current flow, causing
electrons to avalanche back to Earth.
The Earth and sky are
part of a circuit.
Storms result from
capacitance in this circuit.
The atmosphere stores energy
in the form of ionic charge,
and releases it through
lightning, among other effects.
The ground is one plate of the capacitor
where positive charge collects.
As negative charge
builds in the cloud,
it is repulsed from the ground below,
and positive ions are drawn in.
The ground reaches up
with plasma tendrils.
They collect especially around tall structures,
pooling densely at sharp projections,
surrounding them with a halo of charge the
cascading electrons target for connection.
When a connection is made, the arc
touches Earth, spreading current
in horizontal arcs across the
surface as much as 20 meters away.
This is a death zone.
If you're in it, you are part
of a 200,000 amp circuit.
The horizontal arcing
is a side flash --
a scatter of arcs tendrils that follow
surface conduction across the ground,
radially away from
the point of impact.
The ground potential,
type, and shape of the surface
influences the character
of the side flash.
Dry sand acquires
charge very easily
and so lightning attracts charged
particles and will sweep sand to it
leaving a display of the
entire strike zone.
Sand in the strike zone where
current surges across the surface,
pulls inward leaving a shallow crater
with a cone of sand in the center.
It's like grabbing a
bedspread in the center,
pulling it up and
dropping it in a pile.
The following photos were
taken near Kayenta, Arizona
on desert plains to the
south of Comb Ridge.
The form is like an anthill,
but these are not anthills.
Ants dig rock from below ground
and pile it outside the hole.
These are built
just the opposite way.
The sand is swept-up from the surroundings,
leaving a pile at the center of a crater.
Besides, these don't
have ants or antholes.
The mounds of sand are composed
of fine, almost powder sand.
But the tops of the mounds
are dusted with pebbles.
The pebbles are sand that was drawn
into the lightning channel and fused
before falling back to Earth
when the flame extinguished,
falling to cover the mound, like
candy sprinkles on an ice cream cone.
Nothing grows inside the
craters, or on the mounds.
It's as if the
soil is sterilized.
PH tests show the soil
to be highly alkaline.
What meager growth
there is are low, ground-
covering grasses and weeds around
the perimeter of the craters.
The desert in this region of Northern
Arizona is carpeted with lightning strikes
that left crater and mound
features like these.
The land is on the Colorado Plateau,
just south of Monument Valley.
They form what some call 'fairy
rings' when seen from the air.
The next images show clusters of them.
The craters vary in size from 15
to 30 feet in diameter, or larger.
The size of the central cone is
proportionate to the size of the crater,
ranging from about 8
to 18 inches tall.
The strikes especially cluster where
black rock crusts over the sand.
The lightning seems to have
punched through, scattering rock
and leaving the craters
bare, where nothing grows.
Whether the lightning is
attracted to the rock
or the rock was made with
the lightning isn't known,
but the rock provides a clue.
It appears the lightning
came in a coherent event
that peppered the land, punching
through and shattering the rock.
That, at least, is how it appears.
It's as if there were two events.
One that torched and melted the surface
of the land, creating the cap rock,
and a subsequent one that shattered
the rock with lightning.
What amazes is the number of them
clustered in particular areas.
They rarely overlap, spaced
fairly even, but randomly apart.
There are hundreds of thousands,
if not millions of them
scarring the land just
south of Comb Ridge.
There are regions
around the world
where features like these carpet the
land for hundreds of square miles.
They are seen in desert
lands especially
since there is little
undergrowth to obscure them.
The next image is from Namibia.
Here the features connect
with filaments of stream beds.
But note how they connect in linear arrays
and branch radially like little stars.
They are electric discharge patterns.
Each feature seems to be a shallow
basin or spring where water collects.
Map resolution doesn't
allow better detail
but these features are larger
than the Arizona features.
Many cover several acres.
Much of the country of Uzbekistan is
also carpeted with similar features,
as the following images from a small
portion of eastern Uzbekistan show.
The Uzbekistan features are
larger and more numerous still.
They also appear to be shallow basins
where the geology is distinctly changed,
and there appears to
be a source of water.
In the last image, there appears
to be a home, or ranch
with a livestock tank, well,
or catchment at the center.
It makes sense that water is
found where lightning has struck.
Subsurface water is a
source of ionization
that intensifies charge density,
and therefore the electric field,
attracting lightning
to its location.
Standing surface water won't do that
because ions have no point to collect --
they spread evenly over
the surface of the water.
But subterranean water
is trapped in the earth,
where ions can collect
and build concentration,
locally intensifying
the electric field.
Pits, craters, and rilles
formed by lightning
leave depressions over aquifers that
are natural for springs and wells.
But what about larger features --
bigger than pits and piles of sand.
Can lightning make a mountain?
Volcanoes form mountains by extruding
molten rock to the surface
from hot pools of magma
beneath the crust.
This is conventional understanding, and it
isn't in dispute in the Electric Universe.
After all, volcanoes can be
witnessed doing this in real time.
The resulting strato-volcanoes, cinder cones,
lava flows, ash deposits and lahars
are seen across the globe.
What creates magma chambers and causes
them to erupt is not understood.
Consensus science has a number of speculative
theories based on conventional beliefs
about the make-up and dynamics
of the interior of the earth.
It's these theories EU
has a problem with.
EU theory proposes the mechanism
for heating and erupting volcanoes
is electrical discharge
beneath Earth's crust.
But our theories are
also speculative
because there is no way to look
inside the Earth to be sure.
One type of geologic feature
attributed to volcanism
can be challenged by
EU Theory, however.
These are buttes believed by the consensus
to be the ancient throats of volcanoes,
where a magma plug
froze in the throat,
and later erosion exposed them
leaving a hardened pinnacle.
Archetypal of these is Shiprock, a
tall butte that lies near Four Corners,
where the U.S. States of Arizona,
Utah, Colorado and New Mexico meet.
It lies in the heart
of Navajo lands
Some Navajo traditionalists argue
Shiprock is the work of the 'Star People'.
Could it be they know more about it
than our consensus scientists do?
We can use this butte and
the surrounding landscape
to discuss how such features were actually
formed by lightning in the distant past
when lightning was a
'Thunderbolt of the Gods'.
But first, let's look at
some of the absurdities
in consensus theory
concerning its formation.
Shiprock does (not) sit near a
region of true volcanic activity.
Northern Arizona has volcanoes
along the Mogollon Rim
that lie to the South and West
of the Four Corners region.
This is part of a super-volcanic
complex much like Yellowstone.
Yet Shiprock itself, and
a number of similar formations
are well removed from
those volcanic fields,
standing alone on the
high desert plains.
They are attributed to an ancient volcanic
complex called the Navajo Volcanic Field
but are not surrounded by
lava flows, ash deposits,
or any other features provably
volcanic in origin.
In fact, for these to be considered
the throats of ancient volcanoes,
the consensus assumes it formed 2,500
to 3,000 feet below Earth's surface
and became exposed after
millions of years of erosion.
In other words, 3,000 feet of vertical surface
lands had to be completely eroded away,
leaving just the butte poking out
of the flat, sandstone desert floor.
Shiprock is 1,500
feet of broken rock,
meaning 1,500 feet of
surrounding plateau washed away,
in addition to the 3,000 feet of overburden,
along with the lava fields, ash deposits
and other traces of volcanic field,
without washing away the butte.
Let's just say that it's hard
to conceive how wind and water
could have washed across the land carrying
away trillions of tons of other rock
but left this shard standing.
It's not made of kryptonite. It's no
harder than the surrounding sandstone.
Exposed to millions of
years of such abuse,
it would have dissolved like a
popsicle in an Arizona summer.
Nor is there any evidence of how, or
where this material disappeared to.
There's no deposit of silts, or
remains of past river channels,
anywhere in the western hemisphere
to provide evidence of this.
How any river or inland sea could have
washed the land away without a trace,
leaving these 'volcanic
plugs' is a mystery
that the consensus can only explain
by invoking billions of years.
It's the only excuse they know
and they feel it safe as long as
they ignore the Electric Universe.
Shiprock and its
neighboring buttes
are made of sandstone and a
similar material called Minette.
Minette is chemically the
same as the surrounding stone
except it is highly potassic and
apparently fused together by heat.
The composition of the rock is not
hard, highly compressed, or consolidated
such that it could withstand
the kind of flood waters
required to wash away
the surrounding land.
Nor is it like any rock we can witness
being produced by volcanoes today.
A more plausible and
responsible theory
is that they were made the way
the Navajo say it was made.
In part two of 'Lightning-Scarred
Earth', we'll look closer at Shiprock
and other features caused by lightning,
and their role in mountain building.

A team of scientists on
Earth have made a surprising
and perhaps a very significant
discovery on the Sun's magnetic field.
The scientists were utilizing a solar
telescope to study the Sun's corona,
and through good-fortune were
able to observe and analyze
an exceptionally
powerful solar flare.
The team focused on estimating
the magnetic field strength
of features called coronal loops,
which are glowing arcs
of electrified plasma.
What they found is that the
coronal loops' magnetic field
is ten times stronger than solar
physicists had previously thought.
The lead investigator
of the study stated,
"This is the first time we have
been able to measure accurately
the magnetic field
of the coronal loops,
the building blocks of the sun's magnetic
corona, with such a level of accuracy."
However, the description
of coronal loops as
"building blocks" of the
Sun's magnetic corona
reveals enduring beliefs about
the Sun and its magnetism
that may demand reassessment.
Today, retired professor of electrical
engineering Dr. Donald Scott,
author of the book
'The Electric Sky'
shares his analysis of the real
processes behind the Sun's magnetic field,
based on the Electric Sun model.
In regard to that that press release
about the Sun's magnetic field
being measured as 10 times stronger
than what they thought before,
I think that's, that's very good.
That's very, I'm very encouraged that they
are measuring magnetic fields on the Sun.
The lead investigator,
Dr. Kuridze, I believe it is, said,
"Everything that happens in
the Sun's outer atmosphere
is dominated by
the magnetic field,
but we have very few measurements of its
strength and spatial characteristics.
This is the first time we have been able
to measure accurately the magnetic field
of the coronal loops",
that's important,
"the building blocks of the Sun's magnetic
corona, with such a level of accuracy."
So he says that the coronal loops are the
building blocks of the Sun's magnetic corona.
Well, that's just not so.
For several reasons.
If the astrophysicists have little or
no knowledge about how magnetic fields
are created within
the Sun to start with,
then it's, there's a little doubt,
there's a little surprise on our part
as to why they are always
surprised by what they measure.
In any event, the corona is
mainly an electrical phenomenon.
It's an electrically
driven plasma
and it's not primarily
a magnetic one.
There may be some magnetic
fields within it,
but the corona is mainly an
electrical phenomenon and
astrophysicists have gone
right to the precipice
of allowing their theories to
incorporate magnetic fields - magnetism
but not electrical ones.
Well, Hannes Alfvén pointed
out a long time ago that
the coronal loops are examples
of an electric plasma discharge
and he pointed out that these
loops are inherently unstable
because they incorporate or can
incorporate a magnetic electrical structure
called a double-layer.
And I said magnetic, it
happens within a plasma
and so there is a magnetic
field within that plasma
but the double-layer itself is
primarily an electrical phenomenon.
And the whole idea is
that the double-layer is,
can be, it tends to be at times
unstable and it can explode,
and that the explosion of that double
layer in that prominence, in that loop,
is what gives rise to what we
now call coronal mass ejections.
The material of which
the loop is made, plasma
is spewed out just like it would be from
any other explosions into space.
But anyway, astrophysicists
have now seized upon the idea
that anything they can't fully explain
was to be due to magnetic fields.
So for example, if you
ask an astrophysicist
what causes sunspots?
They'll usually answer
something to the effect that
the sunspots are cooler than the
photospheric surface around them.
Well, why is that?
The typical standard
answer is that
well, the Sun's magnetic
fields sometimes gets twisted.
Over time all that messy
an uneven twisting movement
distorts the Sun's main magnetic field in the
same way that your bedsheets get wrinkled
and bunched up when you
toss and turn in your sleep.
I kid you, not that I actually read
those words in a recent press release.
Then they go on to say, sunspots are
cooler areas of intense magnetism.
Oh, say that again? Cooler
areas of intense magnetism.
So intense that they inhibit the flow of hot
gases from the Sun's interior to its surface
and that's their explanation
of what causes sunspots.
That the magnetism has
stopped the flow of hot gases,
and having presented that
as a well-established fact
they immediately move on to the discussion
of what they see the sunspots doing.
But wait a minute!
Since when does magnetism push
gas around or inhibit its movement?
Can we move or halt gas flow by
putting a bar magnet at its path?
No, of course not.
But without explanation for their
assertion they continue; quote,
"The bunched up spots ...
have so much magnetic power
that they push back the
hot gases beneath them
and prevent the heat from
rising directly to the surface.
And so, that supposedly causes
a cool sunspot to occur.
If you're, I asked for example,
what causes thunderstorms?
The answer is not clouds.
It's much more
complicated than that
and that's the kind of level of explanation
that we're getting about sunspots.
It's that magnetism
cools things down.
Anyway, several years ago, Stanford University
announced that they had been studying
what they called flows
below the surface of the Sun.
They discovered jet streams or what they
called rivers of hot electrically charged gas;
OK, translation -- plasma;
flowing beneath the
surface of the Sun.
They also found features
similar to trade winds
that transport gas beneath
the Sun's fiery surface.
Well obviously, rivers of plasma
are rivers of electrical charges
and that is by definition
an electric current.
And currents cause
magnetic fields.
So it doesn't take much of a leap of imagination
to realize that flows of charge
within the Sun currents
are what cause
these magnetic fields.
That's why the magnetic fields
exist in the first place.
Well anyway, seeing their work, seeing
the work that the Stanford people did,
I began to think about, I hate to use that
word flows of gas and that sort of stuff,
so I said well, let's
put the real language on there.
If we label that with currents,
how could those currents result in
what we see on the surface of the Sun?
These magnetic loops.
Well, I realize I have a
picture there you can put on,
that is in my book,
that's my picture.
I'm very proud that other people have
borrowed it and use it from time to time
and I've seen it several times
in other people's papers.
And that's great,
but I want to emphasize that is
only my idea, my supposition
of what might be going
on within the Sun.
I think it explains the
magnetic loops sufficiently.
Now is this the only
arrangement of currents
and magnetic fields within
the Sun that can cause these?
No, of course not.
But it is one of
the possibilities.
So if you take a
look at that picture,
you can see that entering down
into the North Pole of the Sun
and entering up into the
South Pole of the Sun,
I have labeled there the main current
and it's increasing in strength.
OK well, let's presume, you know, there
is a sunspot cycle, 11-year sunspot cycle,
actually the whole
cycle takes 22 years,
but it's, half of it is up on the
upswing and half of it is on the downswing.
And so, during the
part of that cycle,
which is the active
Sun is growing,
I don't know but I
think it's possible,
what we're seeing is that the
main current into the poles,
those red currents, are
increasing in strength.
So I've labeled the diagram
'increasing in strength',
and as a result if you use
the right hand rule, you know,
put your thumb in the
direction of the current,
and let your fingers show you where
the magnetic field is going to be,
you can see that there circulating
around those main incoming currents
are some magnetic fields.
I think they've done
them in blue there.
And also if the current is increasing, the
magnetic field is increasing in strength.
And so, if we go down,
proceed down into the Sun,
these four concentric
circles are there to show that
those magnetic fields are
increasing in strength.
Well, transformers. Every
transformer on Earth
relies on what's called
transformer action
and that's what
we're seeing here,
is that if the current is increasing
in the transformer magnetic core,
the magnetic field is increasing
and there is that magnetic core links
an output winding in a transformer,
and here there is no
magnetic core,
but there is the possibility of
magnetic field being inside the Sun.
And the Sun inside
the Sun is a plasma.
And a plasma is conductive.
And so therefore the plasma which links
those increasing blue circles, they are
those increasing magnetic fields,
there's a possibility
for current to be formed
by the changing strength
of that magnetic field.
So let me say that again.
One of the basic rules of
electrical science is that
if there's a conducting path
through a magnetic field
and the magnetic
field is changing,
in this case
increasing in strength,
there will be induced in
that conductor, a current,
a secondary current.
And you can see, I've sketched it lightly
but I've labeled it secondary current.
So that's the main input
current, it's the primary winding,
and the secondary current is the output
winding, of a solar transformer, if you will.
Now if you look at that, there's
light little secondary currents.
If you put your thumb in the
direction of that secondary current,
your fingers will be in the
direction of a magnetic field
which is produced, which is the result
of those secondary currents.
So very lightly there in the northeast
quadrant, I've shown a magnetic loop
created by that
secondary current.
Well, we've observed for years
the fact that these magnetic
loops do indeed come from sunspots.
And where the magnetic field leaves the
Sun, that's by definition a North Pole,
and where it enters the Sun,
that's by definition a South Pole.
And if you look and compare what happens in the
North hemisphere with the South hemisphere,
you see that if going from, let's
say, east to west in the north,
you get a North Magnetic Pole
and then a South Magnetic Pole.
And if you go from east to
west in the southern hemisphere,
the first thing you come upon
is the South Magnetic Pole
and then you come
upon the North Magnetic Pole.
And so as the
sunspot cycle goes on,
these magnetic loops,
these coronal loops,
they change their location and
latitude. In the other half of the cycle,
those north-south
pole positions reverse.
And so this, I claim,
is a possible model
that explains several things.
One thing that is certainly
consistent with reality of these two,
the way these North Pole
and South Pole configurations
and the magnetic
loops change around.
Also that main current, you can
see it coming out at the equator,
I labeled it, main current
increasing in strength.
That's a well-known
current sheet.
In one of the press
releases they say,
"When solar physicists talk
about solar field reversals,
their conversation often
centers on the 'current sheet'."
That's the only time they actually
mention current but they do at that time.
"The current sheet is a sprawling surface
jutting outward from the sun's equator
where the sun's slowly rotating magnetic
field induces an electric current."
Huh? The magnetic field
induces an electric current!
Yeah well, the magnetic fields
can induce electric currents
but I suspect and suggest
to you at this point,
what's going on here is that that
current is producing the magnetic field.
That's just the reverse of what's
actually, what they say is going on.
I think it's actually
what's going on.
But anyway, when you see a
picture of a coronal loop,
that's not a magnetic
field you're looking at.
Magnetic fields are invisible.
They're invisible
to the human eye.
What we can see is electrically
excited glow- or arc-mode current,
plasma forming those loops.
The plasma is coincidental with the
way the magnetic field is moving
and certainly with the directions
the current is moving.
Mainstream physicists
try to avoid explaining
how the Sun's magnetic field
gets formed in the first place.
Electric currents which are
the only cause of magnetic fields,
they don't come
from anyplace else,
they don't come by mixing
gases or anything else.
They're coming from, they're
caused by electric currents.
They're almost never mentioned,
with one or two exceptions
like this current sheet
that comes out of this
equator of the Sun.
Magnetic fields
don't get twisted up
and they don't cool things down
unless they're, and they don't move unless their
formative currents produced that movement.
They certainly are not
able to modify sunspots.
They're the results of an
electric process that creates them.
Anyway, it's good to be able to
measure solar magnetic field strengths
and I'm very happy that
these people have done that
and with increased
accuracy, that's wonderful.
But it's kind of like improving the accuracy of
measuring exact length of an elephant's tail
while ignoring the
rest of the animal.

Welcome to Space News from
the Electric Universe,
brought to you by The
Thunderbolts Projectâ„¢

Today, we continue our exploration
of the recent update shared by the team
behind the groundbreaking scientific
experiment, the SAFIRE project.
As described in our recent interviews with
physicist Wal Thornhill, the SAFIRE
project is an independent audit of the
Electric Sun model first proposed by
engineer Ralph Juergens
in the 1970s.
As Thornhill noted, Thunderbolts colleague
Dr. Donald Scott also extended Juergens'
Electric Sun model through his
recognition of what is called the PNP
transistor action of anode tufts or
photospheric granulations on the Sun,
which were successfully reproduced in
SAFIRE's phase one -- proof of concept.
In this episode, Dr. Scott shares his
thoughts on SAFIRE's most exciting
results to date, including the evidence, that is
produced, of low-energy nuclear transmutations.
For over a hundred years now,
since Eddington first dictated that
he knew the answer how did the Sun make
all its power and all that energy, where
does it come from, it came from the
fusion of hydrogen into helium.
And they, everybody immediately sucked that
up, because Einstein was in his glory at
that time, the atomic nuclear chemistry
was in the news and so yeah, that's and
we got it, that's the way it is, stars make
their energy from hydrogen to helium fusion.
And then, some hundred years
went by and nobody had
questioned that until finally, I guess
you know, we also realized that there has
been 200 years of people looking
at the Sun through spectroscopes.
And we've managed to discover about 68
of the known chemicals, that is to say
elements, on the Sun, in the Sun's
atmosphere, they're there, they're in the
Sun, where did they come from, if the Sun gets
its energy from this hydrogen helium fusion?
OK, I see where the
hydrogen and helium
came from, but where did the calcium
and the manganese and the titanium and
all the rest of it come from?
And the standard answer is oh, it was made
by explosions in novae stars, way up
somewhere in our galaxy or even
in other galaxies, and then those
explosions blew it all over the place
like, it's like fairy dust, fairy dust
spreading through the cosmos and
then it, that settled on our star.
But that has nothing to do with our star,
stars are only hydrogen and helium.
What Monty did was not to falsify,
I mean, I say Monty but of
course, it's everybody
on the team.
But to simply give a real, we have done it
here in our lab, not explanation but example
that yes, you can form these other
elements in a very, well, let's say non-
hydrogen bomb kind of way, that is to
say, you do it in the laboratory in
a, yes, it requires something, this
magnificent SAFIRE, but the
only reason we need SAFIRE is because
we can't duplicate the Sun in our own
laboratories here on Earth,
we'd burn the place up.
So what we're trying to do is to
model the Sun, we're trying to come up
with example here in our lab of how the
Sun works, and he's done a very good job
and he's produced exactly
what we see in the Sun.
It is obvious now that those other
elements are indeed made right in
our Sun and very probably in all other
stars, at least most other stars, and it
is done not in the core of
the Sun but on the surface.
If you look at Monty's film,
those other elements
appear on the surface of the anode and
it's done electrically through electric
plasma, and I just think it's almost
obvious that we don't need any more fairy
tales about explosions of
novae in Alpha Centauri.
I did predict that, back in my,
when I first wrote my book
in 2006, I said that, "Whatever
nuclear fusion is taking place on the
Sun is likely occurring in the double-
layer above the photosphere, not
deep within the Sun's core. And the
products of this fusion process are the
metals that give rise to the absorption
lines in the Sun's spectrum."
And I think, Monty's work
has certainly shown that
that is very likely the answer,
that's what's happening.
The point is that it really
isn't that important.
It's not our purpose to disprove or
falsify their answers, but SAFIRE
has offered a very good reason why there
are the other types of elements and even
some molecules formed
that are not from these
novae explosions gazillion
light-years away.
Couple of observations I made
when I looked at that film.
You will notice there that Monty was
very excited by, and I can see why, I am
excited by it too -- he found in the very
powerful scanning electron microscope photos,
a sphere, and he found that at the highest 
magnification he was able to get to,
when they were looking and they found
all these other calcium, sodium
and all the rest of it in there, that had
not started there but was formed there.
Right down in the middle of this was a
little sphere, and I'm not sure if they
figured out what that sphere
was yet, but the first
thing that occurred to
me was uh-huh, a sphere!
Well, have we in the Electric
Universe ever come upon
anything like that?
Well, what about C.J. Ransom and Wal's
blueberries that they formed in C.J.'s lab?
And we saw those, they're called "the
Martian blueberries" for the reason that
they were first discovered on the
surface of the planet Mars, and as Monty
pointed out, nobody knew or could figure out why
these things were in such nice little spheres?
So there they are, they found,
it could be, at least I think
they should further investigate is that,
the genesis of these Martian blueberries
in a process very much like this.
The other thing that I did notice
is, if you look very carefully at
the image that Monty presents there, in
that video, at those little spherules, you
will see that the equator, if you will,
is slightly raised and it looked like
the last Space News with, who was it, Wal
talking about Bennu and the other one
and yeah, they have this strange shape,
and there is this raised equator.
Well, if you look very carefully at that
little sphere that Monty found with his
scanning microscope, that too has a
raised equator, and so we're seeing when
things begin to jibe like that, that
begins to make you think gee, maybe we
should see and think about why they're
the same, what's going on there.
That's all I really have
to say about the video
except to say that I think it's
magnificent, I think the future does
maybe hold jobs for the SAFIRE-like
reactor, for the remediation of nuclear
radiation from decaying
atomic fuel, you know.
As said, you don't have to bury it in
there in Nevada someplace but can we
make it, can we decontaminate the
fuel by somehow treating it?
It's all in the future and it's
all possible and it's all wonderful.
But the point is, I think, what we
really should celebrate and be happy
about is, that SAFIRE has definitely
shown that we don't need these
explosions on these far, far distant
stars to explain how the fairy dust got
spread through the cosmos.
It's formed right there on
the surface of our Sun.

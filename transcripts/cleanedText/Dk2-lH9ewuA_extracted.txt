Part 2 of our interview with Wal Thornhill
about the recently imaged "black hole".
Well, I think it's fair to say
that when it comes to conditions
at the center of any galaxy,
some of the most interesting data
has to come from our own celestial
neighborhood in the Milky Way.
I remember last year, we reported
on the "shocking discovery" that
low-mass stars were forming
just three light years away
from the hypothetical supermassive
black hole at Sagittarius A,
and in fact I have in front of me a quote
from a Phys.org report on that discovery.
It states, "At this distance,
tidal forces driven by the supermassive
black hole should be energetic enough
to rip apart clouds of dust and
gas before they can form stars."
But since the black hole's
non-existence is not
and has not been for a
very long time on the table
as a theoretical option
for astrophysicists,
this type of discovery, like countless
others, is simply forgotten
or at least no emphasis
is placed upon it.
So what are your thoughts on some of
the best evidences in the Milky Way,
which tell us that it is a plasmoid and not
a black hole at the center of the galaxy?
The stars that orbit that so-called
black hole in Sagittarius A star,
do so very rapidly which suggests,
if you're using gravity in your equation,
that the mass at the center of
the, or the focus of that orbit
is of the value they give, in millions of
Suns or, you know, maybe even billions,
and that's only because they're
using the wrong force,
we're talking about
electromagnetic forces.
The other thing is that it was pointed
out, I think by Ed Dowdye,
who's done valuable work on looking
at gravitational, so called,
gravitational lensing in pointing out
that it doesn't make sense.
He said that stars
orbiting that black hole,
particularly ones that may have an orbit that's
tilted and passes either behind the black hole
or very close to behind,
should suffer gravitational lensing,
and I've seen no evidence that in any of the
telescopic observations of the Sagittarius A.
And they've been following them
now so I think other manage to
observed complete orbit of at
least one star, possibly more.
The other thing was that there was
a report of a cloud of material
that was due to be sort
of 'torn to shreds'
as it went close to the black
hole and that didn't happen.
Well, of course we're not dealing with
gravity, we're dealing with electrodynamics
which is at the heart
of real physics.
That is, the fundamental physics
of the universe is electrodynamics;
gravity is merely
a minor effect.
We happen to live in an
electrically neutral environment
where gravity does have an effect
that is noticeable, but even for us
it is so weak that the entire Earth
can't stop us from jumping away from it
even if only for a second or so.
Well, one of the most important phenomena
we've talked about for years on Space News,
is the pervasive filamentary structures,
which we see everywhere in the cosmos.
Filamentation of course, is produced by
electric currents traveling through plasmas
and of the question of what lies
at the center of the Milky Way,
over a year ago we reported on the
discovery of a 2 ½ lightyear-long filament
which appears to reach directly
to the center of the Milky Way.
So how does this discovery relate
to the plasma cosmology theory
of a plasmoid at the
centers of galaxies?
These filaments, and some
of them are twisted,
I believe also that they've
seen a twisted pair of filaments
heading into the
Sagittarius A star region.
The circuit that Hannes Alfven
drew, all those decades ago,
the Nobel-prize-winning plasma
physicist, showed that the current,
it has to be a circuit, if you've got an electric
current, it must be part of the circuit,
and he showed that the current would
flow in along the Galactic arms
to the plasmoid in the center
and then out along the spin axis.
And then, at some distance he didn't go
into where, the circuit was completed
but it was at some
distance from the galaxy.
Now, since he put
forward that circuit,
it's been discovered of
course that galaxies tend to,
seem to align their spin axes along,
what you might call, cosmic strings
and they're beginning now to
be able to map these strings
and these connections
between galaxies.
Now, none of this makes any sense
from gravitational point of view,
because gravitational forces
are centered on a center of mass
― not along a line
which filament is,
so both Hannes
Alfven and Halton Arp
in his observational research into
galactic forms and structures and behavior,
all coincide and form the basis
for Electric Universe cosmology.
The very idea of curved space
or space-time as he called it,
he attached two words
together with a hyphen,
both of them are merely concepts,
they're not physical things
so how you curve non-physical concepts
is a question that is not answered,
and we're shown diagrams
where you have a heavy object
on what looks like a rubber
sheet being deformed,
the rubber sheet being deformed
by the weight of this object.
But that uses gravity
to explain gravity,
or to describe it and it doesn't make
much sense, if you think about it.
Deleting the force of gravity
raises a simple question, well,
what is it that stretches the spring on
the balance that measures the kilo of,
you know, potatoes?
That is a force that we
feel, a force,
you know, we're very well
aware of it when we fall over,
you cannot just make
it a trick of geometry.
So that's the first problem,
the major problem with black
hole theory and the big bang
is this idea that you can have a
concentration of mass or energy at a point.
Well, the point is non-physical,
no physical object, not even a
subatomic particle can occupy zero space
and yet we see all kinds of mathematical
concepts being put forward as being physical
and this has created
huge confusion.
In fact, the language has
become largely meaningless.
Even more so, when you consider
that there is no physical definition
of the quantities
mass and energy,
there is no physical definition.
Now, that means we don't
understand E=mc².
So come on Einstein, you know,
tell us what you mean!
Explain it, nobody can
explain it at present,
no physicists on Earth can explain it
because they haven't defined their terms.
And the problem has been the
dominance of mathematicians in physics,
rather than physicists and what
we call natural philosophers.
Those with a broader education,
the ones who got us through the 19th century
with the huge number of developments
which actually brought us to the brink of
the Electric Universe model in the 1870s
with the Germans, Wilhelm Weber in
particular and his electrodynamics law,
that you don't hear about that, I never
heard anything about that at university
and when you look in the textbooks,
you won't find anything about it.
We are not given ideas to
compare and think for ourselves
and that is the failure
of education these days,
we're just given things
to remember and facts
which are not facts but
conjectures quite often.
The result is that you are unfit for
the job once you leave University.
I've said this before, you
know, that electrical engineers
are the ones who should be doing astrophysics
because it is an electrodynamic universe,
it is not a
gravitational universe.
Well, of all the issues we've
talked about on Space News,
I think the most powerful evidence
for cosmic scale electric currents
is of course cosmic magnetism.
So but it's not technologically possible
to directly measure electric currents,
the way that scientists can infer
their presence and their strength
is indirectly through the magnetic
fields that they must produce.
So at every opportunity,
I remind the audience just how recently
mainstream gravity-centric
cosmology
downplayed or even dismissed the
idea of cosmic scale magnetic fields.
Here for maybe the third time,
I'd like to read this quote
from the 1999
online NASA feature
which asked the question,
do magnetic fields exist throughout space?
And it states,
"On the cosmological scale, there is no data
to suggest that magnetic fields are present.
They certainly are not important
in the dynamics of the universe
for any reasonable
range of field strengths
consistent with present
observational constraints."
So why don't you discuss what has actually
been discovered about cosmic magnetism
and why it's so important for the
Electric Universe and Plasma Cosmology?
Now, one of the beliefs that's inculcated
in students and postdocs as well,
at all levels in astrophysics,
is that electricity plays no
particular role in the universe
which is quite incredible when you
think of the use we have for electricity
and that the universe
has no use for it.
And when you map magnetic fields which
the radio telescopes have done for decades
and more recent telescopes that are being
built, which are able to do it even better,
they find that the universe is almost,
in fact they come to the point now,
where they think that magnetic fields
play a large role in star formation,
because they've been able
to map the magnetic fields
in star forming regions
inside molecular clouds.
Now this kind of modern observation
technique is showing more and more often
the fact that magnetic fields
are everywhere and not only that;
they are structured,
they're not chaotic,
which is what the gravitational
theory would have us believe
that it's a shock-induced chaos and
whatnot, but they find ordered fields,
particularly around
spiral galaxies.
And you do not have a magnetic
field without electric currents.
Electric currents are absolutely
necessary because you need
 an accelerating force on a charged
particle to generate the magnetic field
and the ordered magnetic fields
indicate ordered electric currents,
all of which matches the
filamentary nature of the universe
which is also being discovered.

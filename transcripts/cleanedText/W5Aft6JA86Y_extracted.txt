Welcome to Space News from
the Electric Universe,
brought to you by The
Thunderbolts Project™
at Thunderbolts.info
On this series, we have
presented evidence
for a dramatically new way of
viewing all celestial bodies.
In an Electric Universe, nowhere
can one find a "island" in space.
Across vast cosmic distances,
electric currents flow through
the conductive medium of plasma
electromagnetically pinching gas and
dust to form stars and planets.
In our last episode, we focused
on the electrical circuitry
in our own celestial neighborhood
in the inner solar system
connecting the Sun to all the
planets including the Earth.
Today we shift our focus
to the outer solar system,
for the tremendous electrified environments
of the gas giants Saturn and Jupiter
are the seventh of ten reasons
why the universe is electric.
Charged Planets in the
Outer Solar System
The NASA missions Juno and Cassini
to Jupiter and Saturn, respectively,
have provided data that could shake
planetary science to its core.
The discoveries dramatically highlight
the failures of standard theory
versus the successful predictions
of the Electric Universe.
We begin an exploration
of the Juno discoveries
which, in the words of
NASA investigators,
have proved that scientists' fundamental
ideas about the Jovian atmosphere were
― "totally wrong." ―
One of the greatest surprises the
team first reported was that
Jupiter's magnetic field, which was already
thought to be tremendously powerful,
is twice as strong as
previously believed.
The turbulent Jovian atmosphere
has also proved "mind-boggling"
with rapidly changing
cyclones at the planet's poles
proving far more dramatic and "weird"
than investigators had imagined.
As Juno principal investigator
Scott Bolton stated,
"Had someone shown me a picture
of the pole just 10 years ago,
I never would have
guessed it was Jupiter."
Scientists' estimates of the planet's internal
structure have proved equally troubling.
Scott Bolton states in a January
10, 2018, article on space.com,
"Our ideas were totally wrong
about the interior structure,
about the atmosphere, [and]
even about the magnetosphere."
The article continues,
"Astronomers believed that Jupiter had
either a very small and dense core,
or perhaps no core at all.
But data from Juno revealed
that Jupiter has an enormous,
'fuzzy' core that might
be partially dissolved.
This discrepancy between scientists'
expectations and the data
suggests that there's a lot we still
don't know about giant gas planets,
Bolton explained."
A critical clue to the missing theoretical
foundations for investigators
is found in the following statement
from the space.com report,
"Strangely, auroras on Jupiter seem to be
powered by a mysterious physical force
that astronomers haven't
been able to identify.
According to the
mathematical calculations,
Jupiter's auroras should be about 10 to
30 times more energetic than Earth's,
but Jupiter has seen auroras that are hundreds
of times stronger for no apparent reason."
Scientists had long proposed that a
kind of localized charge separation
produced Jupiter's X-ray auroras
in the planet's interaction
with so-called volcanic
plumes from its moons.
That perspective was summarized as follows
by NASA investigator Randy Gladstone,
"...the volcanic moon Io...
spews oxygen and sulfur ions
into Jupiter's spinning
magnetic field.
Somehow, these ions make their
way to Jupiter's poles
where electric fields send them
hurtling toward the planet below.
Upon entering the atmosphere,
their electrons are first stripped
away by molecules they run into,
but as they slow down they
start grabbing electrons back.
The 'charged exchange reaction'
produces intense X-ray auroras."
And here we see perhaps the fundamental
source of countless surprises
for space scientists at all
scales throughout the cosmos,
the belief that no celestial object
can have a net electrical charge.
But this antiquated
perspective is now refuted.
As reported in an October, 2017 Science
blog by author Emily Underwood,
entitled 'Can Large Electric Fields
Power Jupiter's X-ray Auroras?'
"The data revealed particle signatures
of parallel electrical fields
over the poles of Jupiter that forced
electrons near the poles upward,
away from the planet,
while protons and other ions moved
downward into the atmosphere.
This massive electric potential ―
upward of a million electron volts ―
provides a possible explanation of where
the X-ray auroras get their energy,
according to the authors."
It's always been the
Electric Universe position
that the tremendously
powerful Jovian auroras,
the weird and turbulent
polar storms
and the planet's tremendously
powerful magnetic field
are all ultimately induced by electrical
Birkeland currents from the Sun
focused at the planet's poles.
As noted many times
on this series,
in recent years, retired professor of
electrical engineering, Dr. Donald Scott,
has developed a mathematical modeling
of the structure of a Birkeland current
identified visually as
counter-rotating cylinders
clearly seen in the earthly auroras and
dramatically at the poles of both, Saturn
and is seen on your screen
in the at least 15 counter rotating
cylinders at the North Pole of Jupiter.
A law of physics, consistently
stated on this series,
is that electric currents and only
electric currents produce magnetic fields.
Neither the Earth's nor any
planet's magnetic field
is produced through
an internal dynamo
and all of the Juno data
clearly supports this claim.
Mission scientists acknowledged
that all of the models
which imagined a dynamo deep within
the planet, have been refuted.
As reported by Newscientist.com,
"(A) shock is that Jupiter's
huge magnetic field
is even stronger and much
more irregular than expected.
The irregularity of the field so far
is a sign that the dynamo driving it
may originate higher up
in Jupiter's interior,
perhaps from a layer
of metallic hydrogen."
Scott Bolton stated,
"I didn't expect all the
theories to be wrong,
but there's motion going on in the
planet we did not anticipate."
But the "wrongness" of all the standard theoretical
predictions has not forced investigators
to consider what Electric Universe
proponents have always argued,
that the source of
Jupiter's magnetic field
does not come from
inside the planet at all
but rather it is induced
by Birkeland currents
whose signature is clearly
seen at the planet's poles.
It has also been the prediction
of the Electric Universe
that a far more immense electrical
circuitry exists in the Jovian system,
connecting the gas giant to its moons, than
standard astronomy has ever envisioned.
It's critical to note that according
to recent scientific research
by the Cassini mission at Saturn,
the spacecraft's magnetometer
had only been able to detect about
5% of the electric currents
in the so-called plumes of the
Saturnian moon Enceladus.
According to data from
Cassini's Langmuir probe,
the electric currents may, in
fact, exceed 10 million amps.
Likewise, the electric current
system at Jupiter is the real cause
of the dramatic electrical discharges
seen on the Jovian moon Io,
which astronomers have long erroneously
identified as "volcanic plumes".
But the notion that the so-called
plumes are produced by cryovolcanism
has been repeatedly
refuted by discovery.
One of the most surprising features of the
so-called plumes was their filamentary structure.
The official Wikipedia page on the
Tvashtar Paterae region on Io,
states that the more than 300
kilometer high "plume" displays
"an as yet unexplained
filamentary structure".
But as we've outlined many times, this
statement is factually incorrect.
As early as 1979, the renowned
astrophysicist Thomas Gold
proposed that the
so-called volcanism on Io
is actually high-energy
electrical discharge activity.
Nine years later, plasma
physicist Dr. Anthony Peratt
and co-author Alex Dessler wrote
in their scientific paper
that the best analog for Io's
so-called plumes is the plasma gun,
a mechanism that produces the
distinct filamentary structure
that is never present
in volcanic plumes.
In 1996, prior to the arrival
of the Galileo probe at Io,
physicist Wal Thornhill made a
series of predictions including,
- the so-called plumes would be found
to move across the surface of the moon
- the "vents" of the plumes would be vastly
hotter than the expected temperatures of lava
and - the plumes are in fact the
jets of moving cathode arcs
eroding the periphery
of the dark areas
that planetary geologists
had been calling lava lakes.
According to Thornhill, these so-called
lava lakes are the solid dark surface of Io
beneath the "snow" that has been deposited
by continuous discharge activity.
Therefore, the "lava lakes" would not
reveal the heat of a recent lava flow.
All of these predictions
received stunning confirmation.
Io's "volcanic hot spots" were not
only hotter than any lava on Earth.
They were too hot to be measured
by Galileo's instruments.
Also, as predicted by Thornhill,
the discharging was focused on the
edges of the so-called lava lakes
though the rest of these dark
fields are comparatively cold.
In fact, the expected volcanic
vents were not found.
Inspiring further astonishment, the
"volcanic plumes" emit ultraviolet light
which is unthinkable under normal
conditions of volcanic venting
but which, of course, is
characteristic of an electric arc.
Nevertheless, space scientists
today still insist
that Io is the most volcanically
active body in the solar system.
The cryovolcanism or ice volcanoes
that scientists envision,
is produced by Jupiter "gravitationally
needing the moon" to induce tidal heating
producing volcanic eruptions.
However, in 2013, scientific
reports revealed
that Io's so-called volcanoes
are in the "wrong locations"
according to the predictions of
every existing tidal heating model.
As noted in a 2013
Huffington Post report,
"Io's major volcanic activity is
concentrated 30 to 60 degrees farther east
than models of its internal
heat profile predict,
suggesting that the exotic,
volcanic Jupiter moon
is even more mysterious than
researchers had previously thought."
As noted by the lead author of a paper
Christopher Hamilton, the findings,
"...can't be reconciled with any existing
solid-body tidal heating model."
As mentioned, the Saturnian moon
Enceladus displays filamentary jets
similar to the electrical
discharges seen on Io.
Planetary scientists interpret these
explosive features at Enceladus's South Pole
as "ice geysers and plumes"
produced by cryovolcanism.
But it's critical to remember that before the Cassini
team discovered the features more than a decade ago,
scientists had expected the
moon to be geologically dead
and the last place they expected such
activity was the moon's South Pole.
As reported by space.com,
"The finding flipped everything scientists
knew about Enceladus on its head,
because what should have been a dead
moon appeared to be geologically active
and what was supposed to be the moon's coldest
region turned out to be its warmest."
As in the electrical circuitry
of the Jovian system
where the electrical footprints of the
moons have been seen in Jupiter's aurora,
the electric currents
connecting Saturn and Enceladus
are now recognized by
planetary scientists.
And like the tidal
heating models for Io,
new discoveries have only
proved increasingly problematic
for the theory of so-called
cryovolcanism on Enceladus.
In 2016, scientists
were amazed to discover
that when jets of dust and
water vapor explode into space
when Enceladus is at its
farthest from Saturn,
the amount of gas accompanying the
outbursts is anomalously low.
As summarized by space.com,
"The researchers expected
quite a lot more gas expelled
at the far part of Enceladus's orbit,
to help explain the outpouring of dust,
but they found that gas output had
bumped up by just 20 percent,
far less than expected."
The team had focused on a
specific collimated jet
that was part of a
large water plume.
The leader of the studies
said of the findings,
"We had thought the amount of
water vapor in the overall plume,
across the whole
south polar area,
was being strongly affected
by tidal forces from Saturn.
Instead, we find that the small-scale
jets are what's changing."
Hypothetical cryovolcanoes, resulted
from tidal forces, are not necessary
to explain the stupendous filamentary
structures on Enceladus and Io.
More than a sufficient basis exists to finally
consider the electrical interpretation.
As we focus our attention
on the gas giant Saturn
and the stunning data from
NASA's Cassini mission,
we again see numerous opportunities to test
the predictions of the Electric Universe
versus those of standard theory.
In fact for over a decade, data
from the Cassini spacecraft
has confirmed many
of these predictions
all of which were completely
unexpected in standard reasoning.
In 2005, Wal Thornhill published his
analysis of scientists' discovery of a
"warm polar vortex" at
Saturn's South Pole.
He also offered an
explicit prediction,
"The Electric Universe also
predicts, experimentum crucis,
that both poles should be hot,
not one hot and the other cold."
In 2008, the Cassini spacecraft
confirmed the astonishing prediction.
Astonishing because the
freezing cold North Pole
had been deprived of sunlight
for more than 12 years.
The author of a paper
on the discovery stated,
"We didn't expect it to have
a hot spot at the north."
From the electrical perspective, it is not
coincidental that the hot spot is located
"smack dab" in the center
of the north polar vortex.
Like the planet Venus' polar vortexes,
Saturn's north polar hotspot
and the vortex structure
in which it is located
is created by a flow of electric current
along magnetic field lines to the pole.
In fact, the Sun's electromagnetic
relationship with Saturn
is also a stunning
recent revelation.
In 2016, scientists reported their first ever
observation of so-called magnetic ropes
traversing the vast distance
between the Sun and the gas giant.
The lead author of a paper in the Geophysical
Research Letters says of the finding,
"Contrary to previous ideas
about Saturn's magnetosphere
being unlike its
terrestrial counterpart,
these findings reveal that Saturn at times
behaves and interacts with the Sun
in much the same way as Earth."
But how can the fluid dynamics
that NASA envisions, explain
"rope-like structures" that
twist and change dynamically
and extend the nearly 900 million
miles from the Sun to Saturn?
The so-called magnetic ropes are in
fact twisted filamentary pathways
traversed by electrically
charged particles.
Again, the signature of Birkeland
currents, counter-rotating cylinders,
are clearly seen here at
the North Pole of Saturn.
Like the Juno data from Jupiter,
the Cassini mission must force
a dramatic reconsideration
of the real cause of
Saturn's magnetic field.
Again, the findings do not fit with
the predictions based on the belief
that the magnetic field is generated by an
internal dynamo deep within the planet.
A major surprise is that
Saturn's magnetic field
appears to have no
discernable tilt.
As reported by Imperial
College London,
"Based on data collected by
Cassini's magnetometer instrument,
Saturn's magnetic field appears
to be surprisingly well aligned
with the planet's rotation axis.
Previously, mission scientists
thought that 0.06 degrees
would be the lower limit of tilt that could
generate the observed magnetic field.
However, the results show that the
tilt may be much less than this.
Scientists currently think that planetary
magnetic fields require some degree of tilt
in order to sustain currents flowing through
the liquid metal deep inside the planets.
With no tilt, the currents would eventually
subside and the field would disappear."
Professor Michelle
Dougherty stated,
"The tilt seems to be much smaller
than we had previously estimated
and quite challenging
to explain."
Additionally, the Cassini mission
provides the opportunity
to test the electrical model
of the Saturnian rings
whose earliest origins trace
to the experimental work
of Norwegian explorer and
scientist Kristian Birkeland.
Well over a century ago, Birkeland's
famous magnetized terrella
simulated the earthly aurora's.
Revolutionary research, that standard
astronomy largely dismissed,
until Birkeland was finally validated
more than half a century after his death.
The terrella experiments also
produced intriguing rings
which led Birkeland to systematically
simulate the rings of Saturn.
He found that the rings
could be easily reproduced
simply by changing the polarity
of the electrical discharge.
And now, a Langmuir probe
onboard the Cassini spacecraft,
has made yet another unexpected
discovery for mission scientists.
A strong electrical chemical coupling
between Saturn's atmosphere and its rings.
As described on spacedaily.com
on December 12, 2017,
"The upper atmosphere
of Saturn is charged
and consists primarily of
hydrogen and hydrogen ions...
Strong variations in density indicate that the
electrically charged part of Saturn's atmosphere
(the so called ionosphere)
has a strong coupling to the visible rings
that consist primarily of ice particles.
The ice particles are also
electrically charged."
The principal investigator of
the Langmuir probe data stated,
"The first results
are surprising...
It is as though the small
ice particles in the D-ring
suck up electrons
from the ionosphere.
As a result of the coupling, electrical
flows of gas to and from the rings
along the magnetic field of Saturn cause
the greatest variations in density."
Like Jupiter, the tremendously electrified
Saturnian environment is undeniable.
Many planetary scientists
had long proposed
that Saturn's rings are
billions of years old,
perhaps even forming with Saturn itself in
the conjectured infancy of the solar system.
But in August of this year, the
Cassini team attempted to estimate
the mass of the rings in order
to guess the rings age.
The idea is that a great
mass would be required
for the rings to withstand erosion
from collisions over time.
However, as noted in a BBC report,
"...it is looking like the
opposite may actually be true
- that their mass is less
than previously estimated.
If confirmed it points to the Rings
being the remnants of some object
that has broken apart around
Saturn in the recent past."
Cassini project scientist
Linda Spilker stated,
"...if the rings
are less massive
they won't have had the mass to survive
the micro-meteoroid bombardment
that we estimate to have happened
since the formation of the planet.
So, we're heading in the direction of the rings
being perhaps 100 million years old or so,
which is quite young compared to
the age of the solar system."
But the chief principals of The
Thunderbolts Project have offered
a radically different recent history
of Saturn and all of the solar system.
A history that includes an understanding
of the electrical nature of stars
and the electrical expulsion and
capture of planets and moons.
In this thesis, it is not possible to
calculate the density of celestial bodies
by estimating their mass using
Newton's law of gravity.
In the electrical model of stars,
one cannot classify stars and gas giant
planets based on their calculated mass.
Stars are an electrical
discharge phenomenon
and their electrical environment determines
their mass, appearance and classification.
Our chief principals have proposed
the provocative hypothesis
that in the relatively recent past Saturn
was an independent brown dwarf star
with its own family of close
orbiting small planets
and with its ephemeral rings
being recently ejected
within the last tens
of thousands of years.
This thesis was summarized
by Wal Thornhill as follows,
"As a small star approaching the Sun, Saturn
flickered like a faulty electric light
when the two stellar magnetospheres
or plasma sheaths touched.
Saturn's electrical power was usurped by the
Sun and its appearance changed dramatically.
Such rapid variability in the
appearance of stars is well documented.
Before dimming forever, Saturn would
have flared up to relieve the stresses
caused by the sudden change
in electrical environment.
Saturn's present low
internal electrical stress,
as indicated by its low apparent
mass, suggests ejection activity.
But even so, the core of the electric
star has not completely cooled ―
Saturn still radiates more than twice
the heat it receives from the Sun.
And we have a simple explanation for the origin
of Saturn's mysterious short-lived rings."
Of course, neither recent
solar system instability
nor the electrical capture
of celestial bodies
are concepts that planetary
scientists have ever entertained.
But the failures of the standard model of
our solar system's formation and history
are dramatically underscored
with countless discoveries
of seemingly baffling
exoplanetary systems.
In fact, in recent years, astronomers
have more and more routinely
described our own solar system
as exceptionally strange.
Recently, this problem has been affirmed
by an international team of scientists
who have discovered that exoplanets
that orbit the same parent stars, are
"like peas in a pod".
The research published in
the astronomical journal
focused on close to 1,000 planets
in over 350 multi-planet systems.
A Phys.org report summarizes
the findings as follows,
"...the team found two
surprising patterns.
They found that exoplanets tend to be
the same sizes as their neighbors.
If one planet is small, the next
planet around that same star
is very likely to
be small as well,
and if one planet is big, the
next is likely to be big.
They also found that planets
orbiting the same star
tend to have a regular
orbital spacing."
The lead author of
the research stated,
"The planets in the system tend to be
the same size and regularly spaced,
like peas in a pod.
These patterns would not occur if the planet
sizes or spacings were drawn at random."
Of course, this is in stark
contrast to our solar system
where the planets are in the words of
physicist Wal Thornhill a "fruit salad".
This discrepancy has led astronomers
to increasingly entertain
dramatic changes to our solar
system since its formation.
The phys.org report states,
"...in our solar system, the inner planets have
surprisingly large spacing and diverse sizes.
Abundant evidence in the
solar system suggests
that Jupiter and Saturn disrupted
our system's early structure,
resulting in the four widely-spaced
terrestrial planets we have today."
Yet institutional science remains unready
to entertain a dramatic disruption
of our solar system that
occurred much more recently,
perhaps even within human memory.
But what basis remains for continued
faith in the 4.5 billion year old story
of our solar system's
formation and evolution?
A story that has led
to endless surprises
and intractable problems
for planetary scientists.
It is past time for scientists to wipe
the proverbial drawing board clean
to allow discovery to illuminate
an increasingly self-evident fact
that our world, our solar system
and our universe is electric.

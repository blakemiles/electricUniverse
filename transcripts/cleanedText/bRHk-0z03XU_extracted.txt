The myth of an
electrically sterile
universe is dead. Only those who paid
little attention to discovery could
think otherwise. But close attention must
be paid indeed since institutional
science has made no attempt to
contextualize the development as
significant. As we've reported many times,
electric currents in space, long verboten
in the astronomical literature, is now
acknowledged with increasing frequency
at all scales of cosmic investigation.
Scientific papers propose that colossal
electric currents flow through the light
years long jets exploding from active
galactic nuclei. Some radio astronomers
estimate the strength of such an
electric current as comparable to a
trillion bolts of lightning. In our own
solar system the electric currents that
connect the gas giant Saturn and Jupiter
to their respective moons is also now
recognized in science literature. However,
like the spectacular electromagnetic
cosmic jets, space scientists heretofore
have always proposed that the electric
currents are the result of strange
magneto-fluidic processes. Yet rather
than affirming these interpretations,
finer technological data increasingly
challenges standard theory while
confirming the Electric Universe
prediction of electrical circuitry
connecting the bodies in our solar
system.
In fact, the Saturnian moon Enceladus
displays some of the most dramatic
electrical discharge activities seen on
rocky bodies in our solar system today.
Well over a decade ago, prior to the
arrival of NASA's Cassini spacecraft at
Saturn, planetary scientists had expected
Enceladus to be "geologically dead".
Instead they found explosive filamentary
jets shooting material at tremendous
velocities up to hundreds of kilometers
from the moon's surface.
Adding to the surprise, the jets were
seen at the moon's South Pole, the last
place they expected
such activity. As reported by space.com
in 2005, "The finding flipped everything
scientists knew about Enceladus on its
head, because what should have been a
dead moon appeared to be geologically
active and what was supposed to be the
moon's coldest region turned out to be
its warmest." Astronomer John Spencer said
of the discovery, "This is as astonishing
as if we'd flown past Earth and found
that Antarctica was warmer than the
Sahara." Since their discovery, scientists
have interpreted the features as
so-called 'ice-geysers' which they view as
a form of cryovolcanism probably
resulting from Saturn's gravitational
forces producing tidal heating within
the moon. Over a decade ago,
Cassini's plasma spectrometer discovered
evidence for electric currents in the
jets that compose the plumes of water
and dust. In recent years, a number of
papers have been written on the presence
of negatively charged dust grains in the
so-called plumes. Today, scientists
studying data from the Cassini
spacecraft are reporting that the
electrical circuitry connecting
Enceladus and Saturn is more
"powerful and dynamic than conventional
theory had proposed." The NASA press
release from July 9, 2018, states, "New
research from NASA's Cassini spacecraft's
up-close Grand-Finale orbits shows a
surprisingly powerful and dynamic
interaction of plasma waves moving from
Saturn to its rings and its moon
Enceladus. The observations show for the
first time that the waves travel on
magnetic field lines connecting Saturn
directly to Enceladus. The field lines
are like an electrical circuit between
the two bodies, with energy flowing back
and forth." Planetary scientist Ali
Sulaiman says of the findings, "Enceladus
is this little generator going around
Saturn, and we know it is a continuous
source of energy. Now we find that Saturn
responds by launching signals in the
form of plasma waves, through the circuit
of magnetic field lines connecting it to
Enceladus hundreds of thousands of miles
away."
It remains the position of planetary
scientists that cryo-volcanic activity
on Enceladus releases the spectacular
filamentary plumes which then become
ionized. However, when we consider the
latest scientific data and juxtapose
the respective predictions and
interpretations of standard theory
versus those of the Electric Universe, we
see a consistent and stunning victory
for the electrical viewpoint. Consider
first a scientific paper published
earlier this year based on data from the
Cassini Langmuir probe which suggests
that negatively charged dust grains have
previously "blocked the signal of
the powerful electric currents in the
Enceladus jets." For a number of years
Standard Theory has proposed that
electrically neutral water molecules are
ejected from the moon's surface where UV
rays from the Sun and interactions with
plasma in Saturn's magnetosphere strips
electrons from the water molecules
forming positively charged water ions. In
theory, these ions are then free to be
"picked up" and merged with
co-rotating plasma, supposedly generating
an electric current. Cassini scientists
had estimated the strength of the jets'
electric currents based on disturbances
to Cassini's magnetometer instrument. But
as noted in the summary of a scientific
paper in the Journal of Geophysical
Research, "...when Cassini flew through the
icy plume, its instruments sent back
vastly different readings. According to
the craft's Langmuir probe, which measures
particle density, there were enough ions
present to generate a current of 10
million amps. The magnetometer indicated
a current more than 20 times weaker." The
authors provide experimental evidence
that ions like those in the Enceladus
plume are, "attracted and trapped
within the sheaths of negatively charged
dust grains." They conclude that,
"Cassini's Langmuir probe is measuring
the entire ion population
(free and trapped ions), while the Cassini
magnetometer detects the magnetic
perturbations associated with pickup
currents from the smaller population of
free ions, with this distinction possibly
reconciling the ongoing debate in the
literature on the ion density in the
plume." Simply put, these results are
anomalous for the standard "pick up
ions model" but they are expected if the
surface of Enceladus is being etched by
electrical discharge machining. As
physicist Wal Thornhill has always
proposed, "Electrical discharge machining
works by stripping electrons from high
points on a surface. In this process on
Enceladus, positive ions generated on the
surface are heated by electric discharge
and electrostatically attracted to
follow the electrons into space. This
does in fact explain the high loading of
positive ions that the Langmuir probe
measured. Let us also consider the
hypothetical processes that planetary
scientists must invoke to try to explain
the explosive plumes generation. Given
the icy cold temperatures of the moon at
its vast distance, nearly 900 million
miles from the Sun, it seems preposterous
to suggest that solar warming could
produce the plumes. So it's believed that
Saturn's gravitational influence
produces tidal heating within the moon
creating the explosive outbursts.
However, science discovery continues to
challenge the tidal heating explanation
both for Enceladus as well as for the
so-called volcanism on Jupiter's moon Io.
In 2013, scientists reported that the
locations of the so-called volcanic
plumes on Io are completely incompatible
with the moon's internal heat signatures.
The lead author of a study on the
finding stated that it "...can't be
reconciled with any existing solid body
tidal heating models." Likewise, on
Enceladus, in 2016 scientists were amazed
to discover that when the so-called
geysers on the moon are producing the
most water and dust the accompanying gas
output was anomalously low. As reported
by space.com in 2016, "The researchers
expected quite a lot more gas expelled
at the far part of Enceladus's orbit, to
help explain the outpouring of dust, but
they found the gas output had bumped up
by just 20%,
far less than expected." The leader of the
study said of the findings, "We had
thought the amount of water vapor in the
overall plume, across the whole south
polar area, was being strongly affected
by tidal forces from Saturn. Instead, we
find that the small-scale jets are
what's changing." A recent article by
Thunderbolts Picture Of the Day managing
editor Stephen Smith succinctly
summarizes perhaps the most obvious
objection to the tidal heating model,
"Although the South Pole of Enceladus is
warmer than 'it should be' it is
still 261 below zero Celsius... So-called
'tidal kneading' from Saturn fails because
the theory has no explanation for why
the effect is limited to the southern
hemisphere." A fundamental challenge to
conventional theory is the belief that
celestial bodies cannot carry net
electrical charge separation. The
Electric Universe however, recognizes
charged bodies that are connected via
electrical circuits across the vastest
cosmic distances. The electrical
connection of the sun to the planets is
one of the great and ongoing surprises
of the Space Age. It is a concept that
was proposed well over a century ago by
the electrical pioneer Kristian
Birkeland, a concept that was confirmed
by the discovery of Birkeland currents in
the Earth's upper atmosphere which
power the earthly Auroras. More
recently, over a decade ago, while
investigating the Northern Lights,
NASA's THEMIS spacecraft made the
completely unexpected discovery of
so-called magnetic ropes which rapidly
form and unravel and are connected to
intense auroral displays on Earth. Nearly
a decade later, in 2016,
scientists reported their first-ever
observation of similar magnetic ropes
traversing the 880 million miles between
the Sun and Saturn and connecting the
two bodies. The lead author of a paper in
the Geophysical Research Letters said of
the findings, "Contrary to previous ideas
about Saturn's magnetosphere being
unlike its terrestrial counterpart, these
findings reveal that Saturn at times
behaves and interacts with the sun in
much the same way as Earth." The term
'magnetic ropes' is used
to describe twisted filamentary pathways
traversed by charged particles. We have
suggested many times that such
terminology is misleading and
inappropriate. The so-called 'magnetic
ropes' stretching from the Sun to Saturn
are electrical Birkeland currents. The
rope-like form is the structure taken by
current flow due to the long-range
attraction and short-range repulsion
between current filaments. As outlined in
numerous episodes, in recent years
professor Donald Scott has developed an
original mathematical modeling of a
Birkeland current whose structure is
identified visually as counter-rotating
coaxial cylinders of current filaments.
It is then not a coincidence that this
counter-rotation is clearly seen at the
north poles of both Saturn and Jupiter.
The electrical interaction between
Saturn and Enceladus may be comparable
to that between a comet and the sun.
Comet jets, like the plumes on Enceladus,
are electrical discharge phenomena that
heat and eject surface material. In fact,
over a decade ago scientists were
astonished to discover a
"comet-like chemistry" to the material in
the Enceladus plumes. As Cassini
investigator Hunter Waite stated,
"A completely unexpected surprise is that
the chemistry of Enceladus, what's coming
out from inside, resembles that of a
comet." But like the jets of comets, the
matter is coming from the surface and
not the interior. It has always been the
position of the Electric Universe that
water molecules detected in cometary
comas is the result of electrochemical
processes. A fact which resolves how
desiccated rocky comet nuclei can still
produce prodigious amounts of water,
sometimes even at great distances from
the sun. We note again the recent NASA press
release which states, "...plasma waves
travel on magnetic field lines
connecting Saturn directly to Enceladus.
The field lines are like an electrical
circuit between the two bodies, with
energy flowing back and forth." Electric
currents in filamentary jets exploding
from Enceladus's surface, electric circuits
connecting
Saturn and Enceladus, electric currents
over hundreds of millions of miles
connecting Saturn and the sun. Such
dynamic electrical interactions between
the sun, the planets and the planets'
moons were never anticipated in gravity-
centric cosmology but they are only to
be expected in our Electric Universe.

What follows is a look back at the
progress of The Thunderbolts Project as
of the 2018 year end. Since the inception
of The Thunderbolts Project in 2012,
we've experienced substantial and
continuous growth, emerging as the
leading voice of the Electric Universe
movement. The many testaments to our
growth would include five full-length
documentaries all emphasizing the
extraordinary role of the electric force
in the natural world. Well over three
hundred episodes of the highly rated
video series Space News from the
Electric Universe. The popular
Thunderbolts Picture Of the Day or TPOD
under the guidance of editor Stephen
Smith offering wide-ranging factual and
visual support of the Electric Universe.
39 episodes of the series Discourses on
an Alien Sky exploring the extraordinary
natural events from which the ancient
myth-making epoch arose. And several
international conferences sponsored by
The Thunderbolts Project to bring
together leading innovators in both the
sciences and in the study of the ancient
cultures. Also of interest to followers
of The Thunderbolts Project, we should
note the independently organized ongoing
experiment called the SAFIRE project
exploring the electric discharge
patterns in the laboratory as possible
corollaries to enigmatic features of the
Sun and other bodies in space. As we
settle into the new year, this is also a
good time to reflect on the great
surprises in space, as one discovery
after another reinforces the core tenets
of the electrical paradigm. Consider for
example the recent findings in our own
solar system where new discoveries have
overturned long-standing beliefs about
planetary origins and about
comets, meteors and asteroids, even
throwing into doubt many popular
teachings about the Sun at the center of
the system. According to electrical
theorist Wal Thornhill and others,
comets are not the assumed leftovers of
a solar system formed from gravitational
collapse and accretion billions of years
ago.
Comets, along with great multitudes of
asteroids, meteoroids and other cosmic
debris, were torn from planetary surfaces
by powerful electric discharge in a
prior more violent phase of solar system
history. With a broad field of evidence
now in front of us, the
comet provides ideal opportunities to
test key tenets of the Electric Universe
paradigm. The truth is that close-up
images of comet nuclei have revealed
rocky desiccated surfaces, exactly as
anticipated by electrical theorists. We
now know that these bodies bear no
resemblance at all to the dirty
snowballs of traditional comet theory. In
fact, the recently published scientific
papers on the Rosetta mission to comet
67P, continue to confirm the predictions
of the electric comet model. As we
reported last year, comet specialists now
acknowledge that 67P cannot be billions
of years old as was commonly believed. It
also seems clear that the double lobes
and rocky terrain of 67P not only
present insurmountable problems for a
theoretical model once considered
unassailable. Tellingly, many astronomers
now suggest a remarkable collision of
two such minuscule bodies across
millions of miles, placing an exclamation
point on the improbability of the
underlying claim. If Electric Universe
proponents are correct, the most
fundamental scientific mistake in our
time has been the exclusion of the
electric force from events in space. In
the 19th and 20th centuries, the blind
assumption of cosmic neutrality affected
the field of
view within all of the space sciences.
According to Thornhill and others, it was
this intellectual confinement that
prevented space scientists from seeing
the electric force at work in the
discharge activity of comets. And yet, as
telescopes have expanded our view to
thousands of exoplanetary systems of
planets outside the solar system, nothing
we have found is consistent with today's
popular theory of cometary origins. The
traditional nebular hypothesis suggests
that comets were born billions of years
ago in an imagined diffuse cloud of gas
and dust, the very cloud from which stars
are claimed to have been born. It was from
that ideological foundation, the nebular
hypothesis, that not only comet science
but all of the planetary sciences
emerged over the past century. More
recently however, the entire ideological
framework has been shattered by the
surprising discovery of abundant
planetary systems with so called 'Hot
Jupiters' or gas giants bizarrely located
in seemingly impossible proximity to
their parent stars. In response to this
surprise, astronomers now routinely point
to evidence for large-scale planetary
migration -- a radical departure from
traditional theory. In the scenario most
recently offered, theorists suggest that
the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn
formerly acted as so-called
'wrecking balls' plowing through the inner
solar system to destroy the planetary
order in its earlier evolutionary phase.
Of course this conjecture, if accurate,
could only add support to the radical
claim of today's electrical theorists
that chaos formerly reigned in the solar
system. Not just billions of years ago,
as now proposed, but extending into much
more recent times to powerfully affect
all of humanity. The result of such
developments in the theoretical science
has been a remarkable convergence
of the Electric Universe movement with
new perspectives on the origins of
ancient thought. We are confident that
those who investigate this convergence
will find the doors opening to an
unprecedented synthesis of ancient
experience and modern science with a
host of wonders and surprises along
the way.

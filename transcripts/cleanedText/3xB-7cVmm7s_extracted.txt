As I explained in the first episode of
this story arc “Playing with New Thinking”,
scientific activity doesn't begin with
observation, as commonly thought.
It begins with expectations of making
sense of selected observations with
particular general presumptions or world-
views. I'll call these presumptions ‘Key
Presumptions’ after James Hutton's 18th century
proposal that the present is the key to the past.
Traditionally these expectations
of making sense have been called
metaphysics. Meta meaning beyond, or 
after physics, because it's concerned with a
critical evaluation of physics.
Metaphysical keys set the cognitive
framing which selects observations,
and constrains one's thinking about the
possible interpretations of them, to a manageable 
size. The selected observations are then
considered to be evidence. With a different
presumption, a different metaphysical key,
the set of possible interpretations
for observations will be different.
The evidence will be different with each 
key. The possibility of different keys is
what allows for what is called, in popular
discussions after Thomas Kuhn, paradigm shifts.
In this episode we'll be playing with Key Thinking.
An awareness of plasma behavior reveals
Hutton's Key to be temporal provincialism.
How long a time span will demarcate the present.
Plasma events appear to follow a power
law distribution. Many small, lower energy
events that happen often, and a few large
higher energy events that happen rarely.
A global event, say an ultra-energetic solar flare with
catastrophic consequences that occurs only once in a
thousand years, will not be included in a
mere century-long definition of the present.
That temporal provincialism will be
especially emphasized if there are
political and psychological incentives to
preserve, or to rebel against a domineering
organization, or a tradition that justifies itself
with myths that have no representations in the present.
A present that includes rare high energy
processes will raise doubts about the
accepted interpretations of observations.
The accepted theories, the expansion of
the worldview that underlies the
theories to include larger, faster and
more intricate possibilities, will overturn 
them. The geological record, a key
interpretation of otherwise ambiguous
observations, will be shredded by
processes that disrupt atomic decay
rates, and that may deposit geological
strata in multiple distorted layers at once.
The collapse of long time, a related key
interpretation will open up evolutionary thinking
to such ideas as fast, stepwise speciation.
A present that includes high energy
plasma events, will also provide
naturalist interpretations for a large
quantity of evidence from prehistory
that heretofore has been dismissed as unintelligible.
For example, petroglyphs around the world
depict 80 some similar forms. If they
depicted sunrises and hunting and
thunderstorms, they would be explained by
our present theories and we would think
no more about them. But they depict alien
things: squatter figures, duck-headed
humanoid figures, strange geometric figures, and 
so on. A common speculation for their origin is
that the ancient artists were hallucinating.
But why would ancient artists around the
world have similar hallucinations, and
only during a similar era of prehistory?
Whatever forms the petroglyphs represent
haven't been seen since. Until today.
They appear as instabilities and pulse
power discharges in plasma laboratories.
When the photographs of the
instabilities are enlarged to a similar
size, they overlay the petroglyph image almost 
exactly. With our new instruments we know that
the magnetospheres, sheaths in plasma
terms, of Earth and the other planets are
laced with electrical circuits.
Many are connected to the Sun.
Flares can bump up the power in them to
cause magnetic storms and auroras and
power grid blackouts. Infrequent flares with an
order or more greater magnitude of power, which have
been observed on other Sun-like stars,
could cause breakdown discharges similar
to the pulse power ones in labs, but on a planet-
sized scale. The instabilities would appear in the
sky and last for days. The collateral
damage to the planet and its creatures
would discourage artists from
documenting the events with texts or
paintings, and suggests the more permanent
technique of pecking the images into rocks.
But Hutton's key doesn't allow such
possibilities, so the evidence is
excluded from allowable selections of 
observations. Here's another example.
Myths around the world tell similar
stories with similar themes and
characters. If they told of sunrises and
hunting and thunderstorms, they would be
explained by our present theories and we would think no more about them.
But they tell alien stories. Sky gods waging wars,
warrior heroes hurling thunderbolts, dragons.
A common speculation for their origin is
that the ancient storytellers were
hallucinating, but why would ancient
storytellers around the world have
similar hallucinations, and only during a similar era
of prehistory? Whatever events the stories are telling
haven't been seen since. Until today.
They appear as instabilities in pulse
power discharges in plasma laboratories.
The twisting and pulsing plasma
discharges that last only several
nanoseconds at a laboratory scale, could
last for days or weeks at a planetary scale.
The evolving forms would be dramatic for
small soft creatures like humans caught up 
in them. If the witnesses had no scientific
discursive prose with which to 
describe their experiences, but only
anthropomorphic, dramatic poetry, they would
make mythic poems to memorialize the events.
Before Irving Langmuir began experimenting 
with plasma, it was called radiant matter.
Langmuir borrowed the term ‘plasma’ because
the behavior of radiant matter reminded
him of living processes. Scaled up to auroral
dimensions, plasma discharges would appear as giant
luminous living creatures, fighting
dragons and each other in the sky.
The events among the sky gods would
be especially impressive if they were
accompanied by thunderbolts hurled to
the ground, and by upheavals in the earth.
But Hutton’s key doesn't allow such
possibilities, so the evidence is excluded
from allowable selections of observations.
There are many similarities between
petroglyph images and mythic themes:
Axis Mundi figures and myths, columnar
forms and ladders to heaven, concentric wheels
and so on. The similarities of images suggest a
similarity of phenomena. Plasma discharge 
instabilities. This opens the possibilities of the past
to the idea that prehistoric people in
the age of myth-making, may have
experienced upheavals of the earth.
Entire cities may have been destroyed by
blasts from heaven; plasma discharges from
space, as the ancient people testified. They may
have witnessed mountains, melting like
wax; and rivers of fire, carving valleys;
and seas overflowing entire regions.
That's what the ancient writings say
they witnessed. We should respect what people say
about their origins, even if we don't understand it.
With the key of plasma behavior, the range of
allowable evidence is larger and more inclusive.
Petroglyphs and myths become explainable
as manifestations of a physical phenomenon:
planetary scale plasma discharges.
But caution is warranted. We think in
metaphors by noticing similarities among
experiences, and carrying the logic of
the source experiences over to the similar 
experiences. However, metaphors not only
highlight similarities, they also hide
dissimilarities. It's easy to overlook
the dissimilarities, to mistake the
similarities for identities, and to
conclude that we know it all. This applies not only
to myth and plasma, but also to gravity and planets.
That gap in the metaphor between similar
and identical, constitutes an essential
epistemic uncertainty in what we call 
knowledge. If that uncertainty is imbued with
trauma-induced terror, it will generate a
compulsion to believe, or to disbelieve,
that we know more, or don't, and with
greater confidence than is justified.
We tend to turn our attention away from
the question of how we know, with its
essential uncertainty and often
unconscious metaphysical keys,
and to place an unquestioning belief in what we
claim to know. A more appropriate criterion for
metaphors than truth with its implication of
universality and absoluteness, is aptness.
The similarities must be tested and 
the domains of aptness discovered.
For example, the metaphor of gravity
theory, carried over from Newton's
alleged experience of a falling apple, becomes 
inapt when used to explain galactic motions.
On the other hand, the metaphor of plasma
instabilities may be apt for explaining
hitherto unexplainable commonalities
between petroglyphs and myths.
Awareness of plasma behavior not only
reconfigures what we think we know about
today's events, but also illuminates a
prehistory that has been shrouded by the
inertia of our prior beliefs and blind spots. This 
turns the uniformitarian metaphysics on its head:
the past may be the key to the present.
Ancient glyphs and myths may be a key to
unlocking a presentist prejudice.
A criterion of aptness for science,
instead of truth, recognizes its provisionality and
counteracts the tendency to believe in theories as if
they were religious dogmas. My interest here is not so
much in what those events, memorialized in petroglyphs
and myths, might have been or on how they
might be explained, but in how we think about
them. We perceive orderly patterns
that suggest the possibility of
intelligibility, of composing a coherent
narrative that will make sense of them.
How could those patterns of evidence 
be interpreted so as to fit in with, or
modify, as many of other observations 
as possible? How many of the other
observations could be, or should be, re-selected
and reinterpreted with different metaphysical keys?
Could the new interpretations enable us
to do things; to invent new processes and
to build new gadgets; and to create 
new values that would improve our lives?
The next and final episode will bring
this entire story arc to bear on our
daily lives today. We should never think
that we've arrived at a final thought. We
should never stop asking, ‘what else could it
be?’ We should never take ourselves and our
thinking too seriously. We should 
never stop playing with thinking.

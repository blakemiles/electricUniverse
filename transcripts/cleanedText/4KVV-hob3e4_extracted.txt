Welcome to Space News from
the Electric Universe,

In the previous Space News, we
discussed the electrical nature
of dramatic dust-raising
events on the planet Mars.
Today, we review one of the great ongoing
mysteries in the history of Mars exploration.
In January of 2004,
the Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity arrived
at the Red Planet about three weeks apart.
Due to the extreme dustiness
of the Martian environment,
it was believed that the rovers would
be hindered by dust accumulation
of their solar panels and were only given
anticipated lifespans of 90 days each.
Fast forward more
than 11 years to 2015.
For reasons that no planetary
scientist has successfully explained,
the rover Opportunity is still alive and
transmitting data to scientists on Earth.
The rover Spirit survived
for over 6 years until 2010
and only expired after being ensnared
in the soil of a Martian crater.
Let us go back to the beginning of
the rovers' respective journeys.
When their missions began,
the rovers' solar cells
were providing 900 Watt-hours
(Wh) of electricity per day.
Over the months that followed, Spirit's
output dropped to 400 Wh daily
while Opportunity dropped to about 500 Wh
due to dust accumulation on the panels.
But then, to the amazement of mission scientists,
Opportunity's power began to increase
and kept on increasing until the
power peaked at just over 900 Wh.
As reported by newscientist.com,
the Mars rover Opportunity,
"...stumbled into something
akin to a car wash"
which somehow cleaned
its solar panels.
Jim Erickson of NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory
admitted that the cause of the surprise
cleaning could not be explained;
"These exciting and unexplained cleaning events
have kept Opportunity in really great shape."
The remarkable cleaning occurred
in spurts during the Martian night.
The team managing the rover reported that on
at least 4 occasions over a 6 month period,
the rover's power output suddenly
increased by up to 5% in a single night.
The ad hoc explanations
immediately followed.
The first suggestion was
that the Martian winds
might have somehow swept
dust off of the panels.
Others wondered if frost could
have caused the dust to clump,
exposing the panels
to more sunlight.
It was even suggested that the
tilting of the rover while climbing hills
might have caused a portion
of the dust to drop off.
One wonders, does one's
car become cleaner
when one drives uphill on a
windy day in the desert?
With Opportunity
still alive in 2015,
having now lived more than 40 times
longer than its anticipated lifespan,
more than ever the enigma
demands explanation.
The great irony is that
scientists working with NASA
have developed technology that
provides the answer to the mystery.
Self-cleaning solar panels that
rely on electrostatic cleaning
have proven extremely effective at
dust removal. As noted in a 2010 review,
"The technology was developed for
future rover missions to Mars,
but it could work here on Earth to keep
solar panels operating at peak capacity.
It uses electrostatic charge to repel dust
and force it to the edges of the panels.
It can remove 90% of the dust on a
solar panel in a two minute cycle..."
As noted in the previous Space News, the
accepted models of the Martian atmosphere
have never adequately explained the
dramatic dust-raising events on Mars.
A 2006 NASA report of the strong electric
fields in Martian dust storm states:
"Dust particles [could] become
electrified in Martian dust storms
when they rub against each other
as they are carried by the winds,
transferring positive and negative
electric charge in the same way
you build up static electricity
if you shuffle across a carpet."
But the tenuous Martian atmosphere,
less than 1% as dense as Earth's,
and an average of about
75 degrees colder,
is not substantial enough to generate
the mechanical winds required
to generate such huge, sometimes
planet-wide dust storms.
Despite its atmospheric
deficiency,
Martian dust storms are much
larger than any seen on Earth
and the planet's fierce dust devils,
some as tall as Mount Everest,
would dwarf the typical
tornado on Earth.
On Mars, without the ameliorating leakage
by a storm clouds that we see on Earth,
rather than lightning,
we see glow discharges
which occur from the ionosphere to the
ground and drive the so-called dust devils.
In 2005, The Thunderbolts Project made
a highly controversial assertion
about the greatest dust
storm in Martian history.
The article ― When Dust
Storms Engulf Mars ―
asserted that the massive global
dust storm in the summer of 2001,
involved a packed
assembly of dust devils
carrying great volumes of Martian
dust into billowing clouds.
Since its publication, the
assertion has been confirmed
though the concept of compact
dust devil congregations
can only seem absurd to
conventional schools.
In the standard theory,
an atmospheric vortex
requires a vastly larger
circulation of wind,
a condition that precludes
what seems clearly to be seen
in edge-on pictures of
storm fronts on Mars.
In the Electric Universe,
planets, like comets,
are charged bodies that are interacting
with our changing plasma environment.
Laboratory experiments have
demonstrated the ability
of electric fields and electrical
discharges to levitate dust
and to organize dust particles into familiar
planetary features such as sand dunes.
On March 18th of this
year, a new NASA
press release has provided
further confirmation
that this process is indeed
occurring on a large scale on Mars.
The report states:
"NASA's... (MAVEN) spacecraft has observed two
unexpected phenomena in the Martian atmosphere:
an unexplained
high-altitude dust cloud
and aurora that reaches deep
into the Martian atmosphere.
The presence of the dust at orbital
altitudes from about 93 miles
to 190 miles above the
surface was not predicted."
Mission scientist
Laila Andersson states:
"If the dust originates from the
atmosphere, this suggests we are
missing some fundamental process
in the Martian atmosphere."
Also surprising to MAVEN scientists was the
discovery of a highly energetic glowing aurora
that reaches shockingly deep
into the Martian atmosphere.
As one team member states:
"What's especially surprising
about the Aurora we saw
is how deep in the
atmosphere it occurs
- much deeper than at Earth
or elsewhere on Mars...
The electrons producing it
must be really energetic."
The scientists have concluded that the
source of energetic particles is the Sun.
The report states:
"MAVEN's Solar Energetic
Particle instrument detected
a huge surge in energetic electrons
at the onset of the aurora."
These observations are reminiscent
of a 2014 scientific paper
which states that charged particles from the
Sun provoke increased lightning on Earth.
It was the Norwegian
experimentalist Kristian Birkeland
who correctly hypothesized
in the early 20th century,
that electric currents from the
Sun power the Earth's Auroras.
For many decades, the scientific mainstream
largely rejected Birkeland's thesis
favouring instead the idea that Earth's
magnetosphere is an impenetrable envelope
squeezed by the solar wind
to induce auroral activity.
Only when satellites detected
the magnetic signatures
of electric currents
in the aurora, in 1973,
was Birkeland's hypothesis
irrefutably validated.
However, more than a century after
Birkeland's polar expedition
to investigate the
Northern Lights,
mainstream scientists still express
surprise or even astonishment
when they observe the tell-tale
signs of electrical circuitry
connecting the Sun
and the planets.
In recent years, NASA investigators
have observed what they described as
"giant magnetic ropes" that "connect"
Earth's upper atmosphere to the Sun
and explosions in the outskirts
of Earth's magnetic field.
The so-called ropes to which
the investigators refer,
are commonly described in plasma science
as electrical Birkeland currents,
named after Kristian Birkeland.
The rope-like structure
is not just a curiosity.
It's the structure taken by current
flow due to the long-range attraction
and short-range repulsion
between current filaments.
The so-called twisted
magnetic fields
are simply the signature of
the electric current flow.
In plasma cosmology, these entwined plasma
filaments act as transmission lines
carrying field aligned currents across
interplanetary and interstellar space.
As stated in many recent
Space News episodes,
each new discovery brings NASA
scientists closer to finally
inevitably acknowledging the electrical
circuitry throughout the solar system.
Until this reality fully
dawns on space scientists,
the list of surprises
will continue to grow.

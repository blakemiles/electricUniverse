In Part 1 of this presentation,
Thunderbolts contributor Andrew Hall
explored the role of electrical
discharges in earthly volcanism.
Hall compared the physical
characteristics of volcanic fields,
called the Maars of Pinacate, with
strikingly similar features on the moon
and found in both evidence for
high-energy electrical discharges.
In this episode, Hall considers the
evidence to be found in earthly volcanism
for the electrical circuitry
connecting the Earth and the Sun.
[Andrew Hall] In Part 1 of the
Maars of Pinacate [Thunderblog,]
we looked at rim craters and their
resemblance to craters on the moon.
In Part 2, we'll
ask the question:
If lightning can occur in the
sky why not in the ground?
A capacitor stores electrical charge
up to a point and then lets go,
like a dam breaking.
It's called dielectric breakdown,
and sparks are the result.
Sparks are the flood of
current through the dam.
Lightning is one example
of a spark we've all seen,
but there are several types of
electrical discharge to consider.
Each type represents a flow of current,
electrons and/or ions in an electric field.
What primarily differentiates
the type of discharge
are polarity and surface
features of the electrodes,
the voltage and current density, and the
medium the current travels through.
Our atmosphere carries
an electric field.
The atmospheric field varies widely -
from night-to-day and summer-to-winter:
between 100 volts per meter
vertically in clear weather,
to orders of magnitude
stronger during thunderstorms.
Normally the atmosphere carries
a minor fair weather current
of one picoamp per square meter.
This tiny current is thought to be a return
current caused by lightning around the world,
diffused throughout
the atmosphere.
We don't notice what's happening
electrically in our atmosphere normally
because we live on the Earth’s
surface in an equipotential layer.
We don't notice, that is,
until a thunderstorm arrives.
Lightning from a thunderstorm
has no ‘electrode’ in the sky.
It comes from accumulations
of charge in the clouds:
pools of electrons or ions, like the
accumulated charge on a capacitor plate.
Temperature and pressure moved by
shearing winds take the place of plates
in segregating
regions of charge.
A study using interferometer
and Doppler Radar
to correlate lightning with
updraft and downdraft winds,
showed that lightning
avoids the updraft core,
and forms in regions of weaker
winds around the updraft.
As a storm intensifies and
the updraft speeds up,
lightning frequency dramatically
intensifies around the updraft.
James Dye, researcher
on the study
from the National Center for Atmospheric
Research in Boulder, Colorado,
said the findings
were a surprise.
The massive accumulation of charge in
thunderstorms is believed by consensus science
to result from static build-up
caused by ice formation
and collisions in the
fast updraft region,
so they expected to
see lightning there.
Instead they found the lightning
surrounds this updraft.
Consensus science always requires collisions
of some sort to explain electrical phenomena.
Physical processes
such as induction,
don't seem to be included in
their scientific toolkit.
However, fast updraft winds
are likely motivated
by electric current in the
storm in the first place.
So, it is not surprising in an
electric atmosphere that positive ions
in a powerful updraft would collect
negative charge around the updraft column,
which is where they found
lightning to initiate.
The study indicates updraft winds
won’t produce much lightning
until they reach 10 to 20 mph.
Then strike frequency
escalates with updraft speed.
From 20 to 50 mph wind speeds,
the lightning frequency might
be 5 to 20 strikes per minute,
but above 90 mph the flash rate
can exceed one strike per second.
In a consensus scientist’s minds
this can only mean one thing:
the ice is colliding faster!
But back in the real world, the updraft
should be recognized as a current,
with faster winds producing
higher charge density.
In any case, the charged layers in the
cloud, and the thin, flashing filament
we see in common cloud-to-ground
lightning, is only part of the event.
There is also a buildup of
positive charge on the ground.
The ground charge forms as a pool of
positive ions over the surface of the land
and its features, accumulating in the
highest concentration at high points.
The positive ions form when electrons
are stripped away from air
and surface features
by the electric field.
The lightning bolt initiates
when the negative charge
invades the air below with filaments
of charge called leaders.
They zig-zag downward
in stepped segments,
while the ground charge reaches up in a
filament of positive ions called a streamer.
When leader and streamer meet,
the channel is complete
and dumps the negative
cloud charge to ground.
The ionic ground charge follows, ions being
heavy and therefore slower than electrons,
rushing up the channel at 60,000 miles per
second in what is called a return stroke.
It's the return stroke we see emitting light
from particle collisions in the channel.
Return strokes often repeat as
new charge pools and discharges,
producing multiple flashes
until charges equalize.
It all happens very fast.
You can't see these charges moving
around and pooling, but you can feel it.
It's called wind.
Another type of lightning
is positive lightning
from a buildup of layers of positive
ions in the tops of thunderclouds,
which create arcs more
powerful by a factor of 100
than the common lightning between ground
and the negatively charged cloud bottom.
Positive lightning
also travels farther.
A typical lightning bolt
is about 3 miles long.
A storm in Oklahoma produced
a record lightning bolt
that travelled 200 miles
across a blue sky.
The longest-lasting lightning was
recorded in France at 7.7 seconds.
Typically, lightning will
pulse several times,
but the total duration is less
than two-tenths of a second.
These record setters show that lightning
can scale by orders of magnitude.
In fact, we know no limit
to how large it can scale.
So, what does all this
have to do with volcanoes?
Lightning is seen not
only in thunderstorms
but in snow storms, hurricanes, intense
forest fires, surface nuclear detonations
and, you guessed it,
volcanic eruptions.
There are two regions to
consider in electric volcanoes.
Above and below the ground.
Above, they are integral
to the Earth-Sky circuit.
A volcanic plume is a dusty plasma:
pyroclastic ash mixed with ionized gases.
How such a plume might increase the charge
density between Earth and sky is unknown,
but powerful volcanic lightning
is a known occurrence.
Volcanic eruptions throw hot,
pyroclastic material into the sky.
The volume of scorching hot
cloud that erupts upward
is not filled by the
erupting gases alone.
Ground wind necessarily flows inward
to fill the cloud from below.
This is a depiction of how a nuclear airburst
detonation is designed to destroy a city.
The sudden expansion of gases created by the
blast rise up, leaving a rarefied region.
Inward flowing ground winds reach
the speed of an F-5 tornado,
300 mph, filling the vacuum created
beneath the rising fireball,
and leveling anything
in its path.
A very large volcanic plume
can have the same effect,
drawing winds inward
at ground level.
This seems the more likely
explanation for the lopsided rim
and even circular aureole
of Cerro Colorado.
It may also explain why
maar craters in general
have characteristically small amounts of
‘ejecta’ concentrated around their rims.
But beyond the kinetic
effects of the plume,
the rising column
of ionic material
will act in the same fashion as
the updraft in a thunderstorm,
generating lightning
around the column.
At the mouth of the erupting vent
one can imagine the current flow
drawing ionic charge to it
from the surrounding land.
This may be why rim craters
occur where they do,
at the boundary of
the rising plume.
Consensus science has concluded there
are two forms of volcanic lightning.
Researchers led by
Corrado Cimarelli,
a volcanologist at Ludwig Maximilian
University in Munich, Germany,
studied Sakurajima volcano in Japan and
concluded ash particles are responsible
for building static electricity
that discharges near ground level,
as they reported in the journal
Geophysical Research Letters.
A separate study, also published
in Geophysical Research Letters
of the April 2015 eruption
of Calbuco volcano in Chile,
discovered lightning striking 60 miles from
the eruption, from 12 miles above Earth.
The scientists concluded that
thinning ash clouds formed ice
that rubbed together to produce lightning
like they say a thundercloud does.
The consensus narrative always needs a
collision and static buildup of charge.
Why this is so, is
hard to understand.
No doubt rubbing and
static charges do occur,
but there is already an atmosphere
with an electric field to work with,
moving electric charge and oodles
of ionization in these events,
whether volcanic
or thunderstorm.
They occur in the dielectric
atmospheric layer
between ground and the charged
plasma of the ionosphere.
By assuming electrical discharges only
occur due to localized static charge,
is to miss the big picture, that Earth
is just one device in a circuit.
Whether discharge comes only from the
plume, or also within the ground,
is the second part of the
electric volcano story.
We don't know much about the currents
within Earth’s inner regions.
We know the crust
carries current.
Ground current is why we
‘ground’ electrical devices,
so a voltage potential can't build between the
ground and the device and generate spark,
or worse, a dead person whose last act
on earth was to touch the device.
Ground Induced Current, or GIC, is
current in soil, rock and water,
as well as metal fences,
pipelines, and wire.
It’s induced by the atmospheric
current because the two are coupled.
Solar activity is a forcing
influence on atmosphere current,
increasing the dangers of
GIC during solar storms.
The Carrington event of 1859 was a
solar flare that, among other things,
produced especially energetic aurora's
and induced current in telegraph wires.
Many lines burned-up, telegraph operators
were shocked and showered with sparks.
Some reported the telegraph
had so much current,
they continued working without a power source
after the generators were disconnected.
GIC may not be the only source of
electrical current on and under the ground.
After all the rush of lava and gases
through vents in Earth’s crust
would seem to require a lot of
things rubbing and colliding.
It seems necessary that this
would build static charge
and cause discharges deep within the
Earth, even by consensus reasoning.
Even more likely, it’s electrical discharges
deep within the Earth that heats the magma,
vaporizes rock and causes
eruptions in the first place.
It's entirely unknown
what the voltage drop is
across the layers of crust and
mantle to the center of the planet,
but given those huge auroral
currents at the poles
and the puffed-up
magnetosphere around Earth,
one should assume
it is rather large.
Pinacate and other volcanic
fields display features
that the Electric Universe Theory has
ascribed to electrical phenomena
on other planets and moons
in the solar system.
Since they appear
on this planet too,
they need to be interpreted in the
context of an Electric Earth.
One look at the
Delta-Wye configuration
at the bottom of this maar in the
image below, and the question
- Is the Earth Electric?
- is perhaps answered.
In three-phase electrical
transmission, Delta-Wye connections
are used to connect an ungrounded system,
such as an overhead transmission line,
to a grounded system,
such as a transformer.
The Delta configuration is the ungrounded
connection of three phases of current,
whereas the Wye connects the three phases
to ground at the center of the Wye.
A geo botanical feature at the
bottom of a volcanic crater
imitating electrical circuitry may
be an astonishing coincidence.
Or not.
It may be a physical expression of how
sky and ground currents ’couple’,
the same way we couple a
transformer to a power line.
Lest we forget the Moon and the
physics of electrical scarring,
we can look there for hints at how
subtle electrical scarring can be
and since this information comes from
NASA, it’s all the more astonishing.
Deep craters at the polar regions
of the moon never see sunlight.
Within these eternally
dark and frozen craters
cosmic rays are bombarding the surface,
creating a double layer of opposite charge,
because it is theorized, electrons
penetrate to the subsurface,
while positive ions hit and
collect at the surface
– it’s always the
collision thing.
The double-layer discharges
tiny sparks that vaporize dust
and launch them up to float the
thin atmosphere above the surface.
This dust atmosphere was first
noticed by the Apollo crews
and remained a
mystery for decades.
There is more evidence of electrical
influences in the Pinacate volcanic field
and the surrounding Altar Desert
than rim craters on the maars.
Some maars that don't have rim
craters appear as doublets
or multiple craters with
consistent floor depths.
These too are features similar to the
usual shapes seen on the Moon and Mars.
Tuff rings are the volcanic
rims surrounding a maar crater.
Tuff ring forms as hot ejected
tephra falls back to Earth
and lithifies into a
ring of welded tuff.
They are typically low relief, with a gentle
slope of less than 10 degrees on the outside.
Several tuff rings in
Pinacate are exposed,
but the crater that
formed them is buried.
These next four images
show, in order,
lunar like features of tuff
rings in the Pinacate.
The first is a concentric
tuff ring inside a tuff ring,
with rim features
at three o'clock.
The next is a concentric tuff
ring inside a tuff ring,
with rim features
at nine o'clock.
Third is a tuff ring with the
rim crater at five o'clock
and an east-to-west crater
chain at 12 o’clock.
And the final picture is a
polygonal tuff ring doublet.
Chains of raised tuff, craters and cinder cones
can also be found throughout the Pinacate.
The following pictures show
chains of various features,
including tuff rings
and cinder cones.
And then there are unusual erosion patterns
that seem to begin and end without reason.
These are stark patterns of apparent
erosion across playa that are dead flat;
there is not one-foot
elevation change.
They appear to be
lined with black rock
and then the Pinacate is
covered with fractal patterns
and lightning bolt rilles of
feathery ash and tuff deposits.
Fractal patterns appear
everywhere across the Pinacate
from lightning bolt rilles to
feathery ash and tuff deposits.
We’ll look at the electrical nature of
volcanic fields more in future articles.

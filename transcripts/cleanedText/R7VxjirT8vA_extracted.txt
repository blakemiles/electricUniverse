Of all the planets in the inner
solar system, the planet Mars may pose
the most tantalizing mysteries.
In the early 1970s when the Mariner 9
spacecraft captured the most detailed
images of the planet to that time,
scientists' ideas about Mars have needed
constant revision.
A planet that was thought to be
long geologically dead was
engulfed in massive dust storms and its
surface revealed dramatic and unexpected
scarring which remains
mysterious to this day.
For decades, the chief
principals of The Thunderbolts Project
have proposed that extraordinary events
shaped the Martian surface.
Events which they contend were
recorded in the myths
and legends of ancient man.
In part one of this two-part
presentation, physicist
Eugene Bagashov reopens
the Martian mysteries.
In the following material, I'd
like to discuss some of the papers about
Mars that has been released in recent
years in order to see if their results
might be reinterpreted in the light of
the electric universe paradigm.
So the first paper that I want to mention
discusses the peculiar structure in the
Martian equatorial region, called the
Medusae Fossae Formation or MFF.
The purpose of the paper essentially is to
report on the density measurements of
this structure.
To measure it, the team of researchers
utilizes the altimetry data
from Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter
experiment, or MOLA, on board of the Mars
Global Surveyor spacecraft and also some
of the most recent models of the Martian
gravitational field used by NASA Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
The results that they get in
the end are pretty interesting.
In particular, they report
that the density of MFF region should be
quite low, only about 1,700
kilograms per cubic meter.
It is possible, they state, that
such an unusually low density is
the result of mixing
of the rock with
large amounts of ice,
more than 1/2 in volume.
However, the problem with that assumption
is that the previous radar scanning of
the area, performed by MARSIS experiment
on board of the European Mars Express
orbiter, rules out any significant
concentration of ice in the area.
And it would also be hard
to expect much ice in
the equatorial region which on average
receives the most heating from the Sun.
So the conclusion that the authors
arrived at is that the low density of
Medusae Fossae Formation should be
the consequence of it being made of a
highly porous rock.
When compared to some of the
minerals on Earth, it seems that
the porosity of rock in MFF might range
from about 18 to about 51 percent and it
is not entirely clear how such a
peculiar formation might have appeared
in the first place.
The authors suggest that
"the MFF was deposited by
pyroclastic eruptions."
But at the same time they are baffled by its
huge extent and total mass, noting that
it is two orders of magnitude greater
than the largest pyroclastic deposits on
earth which would make it the largest in
the whole solar system.
I should add here that this area
doesn't seem to have any
indications of volcanic activity even in
the past in the first place.
It's quite removed from the hypothetical
volcanically active Tharsis region and
even the hypothetical
volcano Olympus Mons.
But of course, in the Electric
Universe not only volcanism might affect
the geological processes but also the
external electromagnetic influences.
So perhaps the very appearance of the MFF
and its low density and high porosity is
somehow related to the possible
planetary wide catastrophes in the
Martian past.
For now, let's remember that thought and
take a look at some other
recent papers.
In particular, let's examine the
paper released in February of
2019 in the journal Science.
Here the authors report the results of quite
a clever application of Curiosity rover
telemetry data to measure the surface
gravity in the Gale Crater where the
rover is situated.
Curiosity is equipped with accelerometers
and gyroscopes that
are normally used for navigation and
attitude determination
but the researchers have been able to
use the data from these instruments for
the extraction of the
gravitational acceleration.
More than 700 data samples
were used, corrected for the possible
interference from planetary rotation,
altitude and pressure and such.
What they got in the end was the gravitational
gradient, that is the change of
acceleration with height, that was
smaller than expected and they've been
able to infer from that data the most
probable density of rock that Curiosity
was traveling on top of.
Now the most interesting part is
that the density of
this rock was almost exactly the same as
the one reported for the MFF in previous
paper, namely 1,680
kilograms per cubic meter.
And in the very same way they
conclude that the reason for such a low
density should be very high porosity of
the rock in Gale Crater, most likely
around 40%.
Even more so, they hypothesized
that the initial porosity
might have been higher at the time of
the formation of Gale Crater and could
have been as high as 55 to 70 percent.
Now here I wish to mention that the Gale
Crater is supposed to be an impact
feature but what if it
has a different origin?
Electric Universe paradigm brings
into light the possibility that such
formations might occur during extremely
powerful plasma discharges to the
surfaces of planets during hypothetical
cataclysmic events such as extreme solar
flares and CMEs and/or close
planetary encounters.
So in my opinion, it might be
the case that both Medusae Fossae
formation and Gale Crater appeared on
the surface of Mars because of some sort
of electric erosion processes.
The fact that the density
of rock in both of
these formations is almost exactly the
same, indicates on possible similarity of
their origin. Yet the MFF is thought to
be a result of some volcanic activity
where the stuff essentially emerges from
down below and Gale Crater is thought to
be the result of an impact event where
the stuff should have fallen down from
above and it should be evident that the
result wouldn't look the same.
Plus we have the 5.5 kilometer
tall Mount Sharp
sitting right in the center of
Gale Crater, the origins of which are
still the subject of debate.
Both the MFF and Gale Crater
are located near the
equator which is quite peculiar as this
seems to be a special area on most
occasions and might be significant in
any type of plasma discharging events.
In this regard, I keep thinking of similar
equatorial anomalies on other bodies
such as the Earth's equatorial plasma
fountain, Jupiter's equatorial ionic
ribbon, dark equatorial regions on Titan
and Pluto, Iapetus’ equatorial ridge and others.
On Mars, this area is doubly
interesting as it separates the low and
flat northern hemisphere from the high
and bumpy southern.
And here I should mention the
other paper that has been
released in July of 2018.
Here the authors compared data from various
spacecraft and Rovers to study the
chemistry of Martian dust with respect
to the chemistry of the underlying soil.
What they found was that the elemental
composition of Martian dust is somewhat
different from the composition of the
soil, at least on average.
In particular, the dust seems
to have a significantly
higher content of chlorine and sulfur
and not only that but their relative
ratio on the dust all over the planet
is also relatively constant.
In terms of molar content,
the ratio of sulfur to
chlorine seems to be
around 3.7 globally.
What's more important is that the
researchers identified an area on Mars
where the soil itself has the same
sulfur and chlorine content and that
area is--Medusa Fossae Formation.
So their conclusion is that it is the
erosion of this formation that has
filled the Martian atmosphere with most
of its dust and eventually covered most
of the planet with it.
Given what I've noted above
on the potential importance
of equatorial area during any kind of
plasma discharging, in my opinion it is
not impossible that this erosion might
have occurred electrically.
I should note here that
Valles Marineris structure is
also located in the equatorial region
right to the east of Medusae Fossae Formation.
Although I also have a
suspicion that the erosion of
Medusae Fossae formation
might continue to this day in the form
of much weaker discharge but so far I
have no evidence to present
in support of this idea.
I believe, now it's a good
time to remember another item from the
electric universe pool of ideas,
namely the statement that asteroids and
comets might be the fragments of planets
torn away by electrical activity
during catastrophic events in the past
of the solar system.
It has been known for some time
that pieces of Mars might
even land on Earth.
At the moment, there are at least
227 meteorites identified
as originating from Mars.
It is supposed that these
rocks received their initial
velocity from another impactor that
lands on Mars and throws them into
interplanetary space, but what if the
process of initial removal of the
material is electric?
In fact, some of the asteroids themselves
in the solar system
have recently been identified as
originating from Mars, well in line with
the scenarios proposed by
the EU catastrophism.
There is even strong evidence
in favor of the hypothesis that
Martian moons Phobos and Deimos
originate from Mars itself.
Remembering the discussion above about
the low density of Gale Crater and
Medusae Fossae rocks, I cannot miss the
opportunity to speak about the densities
of small bodies in the solar system.
It is generally assumed that the average
density of asteroids should be about
2,000 kilograms per cubic meter which is
noticeably lower than the density of
both Earth's and Mars’ crust and closer
to the density of MFF and Gale Crater.
The density of comets however, is even
couple of times lower than that, about
800 kilograms per cubic meter.
What is interesting however, is that the
Rosetta mission with its brave Philae
lander have been able to determine that
the dust-to-ice ratio in the comet 67P
nucleus, is much higher than was expected
and the low density is the consequence
of very high porosity.
This, kind of, reminds of
something else, right?
My hypothesis with regards to that would be
that perhaps comets are the result of
more violent types of discharges so that
the rock starts to partly boil or being
transformed in some other way and
becomes more porous in the end.
And such more energetic events would
also result in a more irregular orbits
with higher semi-major axis distance,
whereas asteroids might be the result of
milder type of discharges and therefore
don't demonstrate such a high deviation
from the planetary crust in terms of
density and also don't move in such
eccentric orbits as comets do.
So, taking into account the considerations
given above, I would suggest to any
experimenters trying to reproduce
geological formations in the plasma lab
to pay more attention to the density of
the acquired structures and formations.
Perhaps it might be possible to
reproduce some of the more porous
formations such as rock of the Medusae
Fossae formation, or even the more
highly porous cometary rock.
At the same time, I think
that the results of the
ongoing sample return missions from
asteroids such as Hayabusa2 and
OSIRIS-REX, would show more evidence that
the asteroidal rock bears a striking
resemblance to the typical planetary
crust composition.

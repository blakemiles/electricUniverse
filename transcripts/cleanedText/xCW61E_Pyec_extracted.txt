”Although its effects can be measured with
precision, nobody knows what gravity is.
It is also the only force man cannot yet control.
Despite the law it is supposed to follow,
it often simply does not. Even here on Earth, let alone
further out in space, gravity is full of anomalies.” So
said Dwardu Cardona, an old world electrical engineer,
a towering intellect, major author, and good friend.
Globular clusters are a particularly difficult
problem for a gravity-only cosmology.
According to current understanding of gravitational
dynamics, they should not be where we see them, and their
spheroidal configuration defies the expectations of
Standard Theory. Not to mention that they sometimes form
a ring-like crown around the axis on each side of a
galactic plane. Quote, “A globular cluster is a spheroidal
conglomeration of stars. Globular clusters are bound
together by gravity, with a higher concentration of
stars toward their centers. They can contain anywhere
from tens of thousands to many millions of member stars.
The origin of globular clusters and their role
in galactic evolution are unclear.” End quote.
Today cosmologists continue to wrestle with
problems posed by exotic structures in space.
These appear to mock Newton's elementary laws. In their
attempt to account for unexpected galactic motions,
astrophysicists have invoked invisible entities and
agencies: black holes, dark matter, and dark energy,
which are imagined to be far more powerful than anything
actually observed. In stepping out on this lily pad, they
have even speculated that as much as 99
percent of the matter in the universe is dark,
and can be measured only by apparent gravitational 
effects. Because dark matter and dark energy
can't be detected, they are a reusable blank 
check. A blank check that conventional
theorists can use to postpone the bankruptcy
of a thoroughly falsified paradigm.
It was this resort to unknown matter
that caused the notable astronomer Halton
Arp to observe in his book “Seeing Red”
that quote, “... past 90 percent it begins to
make observations irrelevant.” End quote. 
You think? I would posit that, past 50 percent or
less, would be a more realistic intellectual barrier.
Arp: “Please don't tell me the emperor is naked.”
In stark plain language, astronomers and astrophysicists
that believe this, should stop taking money from public
institutions and get a real job making some valid
contribution to society. Flipping burgers would be a major
upgrade in terms of service to mankind. With our own
galaxy, the Milky Way, globular clusters or spheroidal
configurations of stars such as M15, are included as a part
of the difficulty. By what mechanical magic does gravity
hold millions of stars together as a sphere, rather than
the familiar disk of more feasible gravitational orbits and
models? Gravitational spherical configurations
of stars simply ‘hanging in space’ are absurd.
Orbits around a center of mass just
don't work either for a globular cluster.
There would be orbital chaos. Think about it.
The problem is heightened by the fact
that M15 is one of about 150 known globular
clusters associated with the Milky Way.
Strictly speaking, they are not a part 
of our galaxy, as traditionally defined.
Rather they appear close to the core of the galaxy as a
kind of halo above and below the center plane of galactic
rotation. Yet, astrophysicists rarely
acknowledge the dynamical problems this creates.
Theory states that clusters above the
plane must move on orbital paths around
the center of the dynamic system as a whole.
And, in completing an orbit, each will
intersect the galactic plane twice. Such
orbits for a three-dimensional structure
would have orbits crisscrossing and even
in reverse. There would be numerous flyby
interactions that would induce tidal distortions and
disrupt the cluster. Of course, another concern is that the
structure of the halo could neither be formed nor
maintained. The problem was noted by physicist
C. Johnson of the University of Chicago.
Quote, “It is almost like physicists have
been assuming globular clusters just
hover there like a swarm of bees. But
that wouldn't happen. They could NOT 
just follow elliptical orbits above or below
the galactic plane. Basic gravitational
theory insists that their elliptical
paths pass through the Galactic Plane,
because the two halves of any path must
be on opposite sides of that Plane.” End quote.
Johnson suggests that something is
missing and not a small piece of the puzzle.
Quote, “It would appear that either our
understanding of the laws of physics is sadly
lacking, or our understanding of the geometry of
the situation is greatly in error. The commonly accepted
view of a Halo of ancient, stable Globular Clusters
hovering around the core of the Galaxy, like a swarm of
bees, is just not something compatible with our current
understanding of the laws of physics.
Clearly, further research is necessary.” End quote.
And thereby Johnson illustrates the real problem.
It is not more research that is needed,
but an open-minded paradigm shift
to Electric Universe construction.
But heaven save us from that. Anything 
but that. Apparently the favorite prayer of
astrophysicists would be quote “Dear God.
Please don't bring a paradigm shift during my tenure.”
The solution of course is that galaxies
are electrical structures whereby the
various components revolve around the
minor axis, never crossing the central
plane. The same quandary applies to the
relative motions of stars within each
cluster. And while Johnson accurately
describes the gravitational dynamic, the
rule he applies is a formula for chaos.
As any gravitational simulation will
clearly demonstrate, it would quickly
lead to some stars being accelerated out
of the system, while others would lose
energy and fall to an orbit closer in.
Over time, the globular clusters would largely just
evaporate, shrink and condense down to ... what?
But, from the Electric Universe vantage
point, it is not unthinkable that the
stars of globular clusters are just
hanging there with respect to the
cluster's own center of gravity and any
cluster plane that may be derived or defined.
In the Electric Universe model of stellar 
composition and energy, stars are
concentrations of highly positively
charged material. For globular clusters,
such a collection of stars with no other
external distorting forces in play, might
indeed become a stable ‘ball-of-stars’ formation.
In fact, the new view of the universe provides
many examples of star-sized masses, even 
galactic clusters in symmetrical arrangements that
gravitational theorists never dreamt of, including
polar alignments. And as for the spheroidal form of
globular clusters, the cosmic electricians in the
Electric Universe paradigm suggest that the best
analogy may come from something as unfamiliar to
astronomers as ball lightning, whatever enigmatic material
that is composed of. But that is a different
anomaly subject. I offer another analogy: Mainstream
cosmologists are playing in a children's sandbox instead
of on the beach. Our ponderous university and tenure
system is suffering from all but paralyzing arthritic
inertia. I know, I have talked with some of them and they
say they teach what they have been taught and 
cannot teach what they haven't learned or don't know.
I suggest, given the past track record of institutionalized
science, this may border on being a cop-out and being
intellectually irresponsible. There is no independent
global agency that is looking at the big picture and
alerting the university science departments that, given
the nature and history of scientific revolutions (which
are always vigorously opposed and overdue),
it is time to consider a paradigm change.
Time to explore alternate thinking, and
seek and invite serious challengers to
present their arguments. Usually, any 
one professor that might raise the alarm,
gets marginalized. Just like a heretic
in a religious organization. Hmm...
Halton Arp certainly suffered this fate.
Of course institutional science is a
religion, just organized differently from most of
the others. The word ‘religion’ comes from ‘roots’,
meaning to bind together with logic or reason.
Thus I call what we have now, by the term
’scientism’ which is a very powerful force
that, in the pertinent area of origins
and unfolding of the universe, prevails over
those based on sacred writings and mythology.
But this popularly supported 
dominance doesn't make it right.
The solution is, guess what,
intellectual responsibility.

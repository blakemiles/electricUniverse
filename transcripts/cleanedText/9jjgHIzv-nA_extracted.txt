Breaking News: EU Update
Well, they say that if you have
a dream, the universe provides.
And I must say, the universe
has provided us here tonight
because of the Rosetta mission
and the things that have been
broadcast in the last day or so.
So some of the material
here was actually,
I copied off the web
yesterday morning.
So this is really breaking news.
And it's not your usual breaking news
because it is critical of the news.
Before I give you
those news headlines
which you can see flagged by the
image here of the comet 67P,
I'll give you a little
bit of introduction.
As all of you know now, Dave Talbott,
Don Scott, Ev Cochrane and I
got our initial inspiration
from Velikovsky's thesis
that the solar system has
a recent dramatic history.
And that unimaginably
powerful electrical events
were observed in the heavens
by modern prehistoric humans.
The evidence for this
is now overwhelming.
My own passion since reading
'Worlds in Collision' in the 50's,
has been to understand the
science needed to explain
the mytho-historical evidence assembled
by Dave, Ev and Dwardu Cardona.
Dwardu is not with
us at this workshop
but his voluminous research and
treatment of evidence is a must-read.
It's difficult these days to keep
up with the pace of new discoveries
across all the sciences
but it's necessary due to the Electric
Universe's interdisciplinary foundation.
And the fact that
a real cosmology
must be more than mere astronomy
and mathematical speculation.
So it's satisfying to see
increasing numbers of scholars,
engineers and volunteers willing
to join the Thunderbolts Project.
The principal aim of this Electric Universe
workshop is to inspire and encourage
those who may become future
leaders in this great adventure.
Some say it is perhaps the
greatest adventure in history
because by recovering the
real history of mankind,
we gain a clearer view of ourselves
and our place in the universe.
And that clearer vision shows the powerful
role of electricity throughout the universe.
I can't stress enough how important that is
for our future in this Electric Universe.
So welcome all to the adventure
of the Electric Universe.

Robert Stirniman says, "Of all the forces we
know there is none stronger than a paradigm."
And now we have the
power of supercomputers
to reinforce a paradigm
through virtual reality
to the extent that it enshrines established
myth and blinds us to other possibilities.
Nowhere in science is this
more evident than in astronomy
where a modern creation
myth has been forged.
Science has made the fundamental error of
discarding myths only to produce new ones.
The fact is that science can
learn a great deal from myths
and mythologists can learn
a great deal from science.
That has been the foundation
for the Thunderbolts Project.
Here's a topical example of
computer generated mythology
on behalf of the European Space Agency
for the Rosetta mission to comet 67P
Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
It shows that the aim is to
confirm what we already believe.
It is not testing a hypothesis, it
isn't considering any alternative
so the data will have to be
force-fitted into the myth.
That isn't science!
Once upon a time...
- Really?
This is a good one, I promise.
What is the key
to life on Earth?
- Water.
Water.
For a long time, the
origins of water
and indeed life on our home planet
have been an absolute mystery.
We began searching for
answers beyond Earth.
Where could all this
water have come from?
In time we turned to comets.
One trillion celestial balls of
ice, dust, complex molecules,
left over from the birth
of our solar system.
Once thought of as messengers of doom
and destruction and yet so enchanting,
we were to catch one.
So there's the myth.
Of course, the Electric Universe version
is wildly different and more interesting
as you will learn
over this weekend.
And the Electric Universe story has been
able to predict surprise after surprise
from space probes,
particularly comet probes.
This is crucial to verify the insights
of the pioneers of the Electric Universe,
Ralph Juergens and Dr.
Earl Milton
who proposed the basic model of electrical
interactions between a comet and the Sun
back in the 70's.
Now, what follows is a brief
statement from Jean-Pierre Bibring
who is the lead scientist
for the Rosetta lander.
Which shows the overwhelming
attachment to the myth of icy comets,
in the face of images of a comet
that looks like solid rock.
Oops, sorry, wrong way.
There is no ice at the top, so it's
covered by a mantle that we consider
is essentially made of organic
material. That's why it's very dark.
And this material is one of the key things
we would like to explore and analyze.
There is no ice on top
so it must be buried
under a thin crust.
Have you noticed how many astronomical
mysteries are buried out of sight
inside stars, planets,
moons, black holes?
Where you can speculate all you like
and postulate anything you like.
But I have some sympathy
for Jean-Pierre
because he has been misled by his
teachers and colleagues into thinking
that the mass of the comet equates
to the amount of matter in it.
Of course, because the measured,
so-called, mass of the comet,
suggests that it has only about a tenth to
maybe 0.25 the density of water.
But mass does not equate
to the amount of matter
as I'll discuss in
a later session.
Eyesight is our most important
sensory input in science.
If the comet looks
like a tortured rock
then that should be the first
assumption to act upon.
We've had plenty of prior warning
from looking at earlier comet nuclei.
But such is the power
of the paradigm
that we are incapable of seeing
what is right before our eyes.
It's a case of; it's not the things you
don't know that caused the problems,
it's the things you don't
know you don't know.
Before dealing with comet 67P...
Where are we?
Here, done that one, sorry.
Here we go.
Let's just go back and see what was found in the very
first comet samples from the Stardust mission.
It was full of
surprises, as usual.
In the "Science" journal of
the 25th of January, 2008,
Richard A. Kerr reported that
first, "Not a single speck of unaltered pre-solar
material was found by the Stardust mission."
Two, "Wild 2 seems more related
to asteroids than comets",
said cosmochemist Larry Nittler.
Three, "It's changing the
way we think about comets",
said John Bradley of Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratories (LLNL).
But it hasn't changed at all, as you
can see from the earlier material.
Stardust chief scientist
Don Brownlee said,
"Rather than preserving the
original ingredients of planets,
Wild 2 seems to be
loaded with materials
first altered by the great
heat near the young Sun."
It doesn't seem to occur
to these people that
they've always thought the
planets were built from comets.
It never occurs to them that comets
may have been built from planets.
Comet theory hasn't
changed one bit.
It hangs on to the
solar nebula model
but now with an ad hoc mysteriously
modified composition to match the data.
Because here, they shoveled the
hot material from near the Sun
out into the outer reaches where it
could be incorporated into comets.
This is a pretty messy
kind of theory.
But comet 67P here, from
10 kilometers distance,
looks nothing like an
ice and dust aggregate.
It looks like a piece
of a rocky planet!
Which is what I said some weeks ago on the
Space News on the Thunderbolts website.
And note the bright
spots up here,
towards the center
and upwards a bit.
The Electric Universe model of
comets says that comets are
complex bits of planets,
as you saw in that graphic
from Dave Talbott earlier.
The conjunction of two planets,
if they come close enough,
the electrical effects are to strip
part of the surface into space.
The talking of bright spots.
Here's comet Hartley 2 in 2010,
the comet rotates
every 18 hours.
It was reported... or before I do that,
I'll go through this list here.
This is some of the
things that were found.
The jet seemed to be issuing
from those bright spots.
The bright spots seem to be atop boulders
or surface projections ― not fissures.
The bright spots are generally featureless
― not just high albedo surfaces.
And the jets issue orthogonally,
that is vertically from the surface.
Some jets on this comet you
can see on the dark side.
And one jet there where the arrow is,
seems to start and stop abruptly.
All of these are simple effects that you
would expect from an electrical discharge
but not from material issuing
from inside the comet
through odd-shaped
vents and fissures.
It was reported also, the amount of water
changed dramatically night by night
and even within a single night in
some cases, doubling in that time.
What surprised the
researchers was this;
As the amount of water went up so
did the amount of the other gases
and as the amount of water
went down the others did too.
The fact that the gases all varied
together is somewhat puzzling
because a large variation was found in the
release of carbon dioxide relative to water,
said the head of the science
team, Michael A'hern.
Researchers think that chunks
of water ice are glued together
in the Comet's core by the
frozen carbon dioxide
which evaporates
before the water ice.
The carbon dioxide gas drags,
with it, chunks of ice
which would later evaporate to provide
much of the water vapor in the coma.
This is an extremely
complex model, and ad hoc.
In the Electric Universe
model, the gases in the jets
are produced by spark machining
of surface materials,
surface minerals rather.
So the gases all vary together.
The variation in carbon
dioxide, relative to water,
could be expected from the movement
of discharge points or jets
on a non-homogeneous
comet nucleus.
And it is that same
surface electrochemistry
that may account for the
extremely blackened surface.
It may be hydrocarbons
or even carbon itself,
but it doesn't have to be.
This is an opportunity for
garage experiment as to test,
using clay and rock as the
target for a discharge.
So here are some of the very
preliminary findings about comet 67P
that were announced early yesterday
morning at a press briefing
at the landing of the...
...the craft that was supposed to
fix itself to the comet's surface.
Hi, Eric Hand,
Science Magazine.
I was hoping to ask a question, I guess
maybe for Jean-Pierre or maybe Holger.
A geology question. We are getting
slightly conflicting information.
We were told, upon landing, that
we landed in very soft stuff.
And, you know, we see from
the rover's picture
you know, this very soft stuff with mobilized
dust right in the middle of site J.
But then we see these Shiva
pictures, maybe near a cliff wall,
and things that really
do look like rocks.
So I was hoping, one of you could
explain what these materials are
and how they can be explained by being
made by comet processes, thanks.
OK, what you are asking for is to try
to be ahead, one year ahead of us
because we made this mission essentially
to answer the question you're asking now.
So it's normal that we
don't have the answers
and probably the answer will demonstrate that
the question is not really well formulated.
When you say a cliff for example,
it has some resonance in our head
that the cliff is terrestrial
sort of cliff analog.
We don't think that we
have that sort of cliff
because the material is
very low density anywhere.
The density is 0.,
less than 0.5 globally.
So the idea of having a very porous
material at the very top came from that
to the idea that there is no reason to believe
that the crust is really a strong crust,
as we thought in the past, on a
very low density material there.
So that's why we thought that finally
with the first images we had
plus the Cosima measurement showing that the
floating grains were very fluffy, very porous
that we might have
that when we land it.
We are not saying that actually it's not
the case, it might still be the case.
You might still have some really
fluffy powder out of which
you were, after rebouncing, again, the
ejection velocity is very low there.
So I will not be more
accurate, that's what I said.
What we have found has not
demonstrated that we don't have a crust,
it has not demonstrated
that it's a crust.
Are you satisfied?
Thank you.
I am very happy when you
seem not satisfied.
So I would follow you on that thought
that the rebounds of the lander
is an indication of a higher strength
material that was a surprise to us.
So with this picture of dust falling back
to the surface, building high porosity layers,
I would think we fail to
explain the rebounds.
So, but we have seen the variety of
surfaces there, this snowfield soft stuff,
and we have seen this rocky-
like but no rock stuff which,
which is perhaps a
higher strength material,
we also see stuff shining
through a dust layer
where the dust is wiped away
or following the gravity field
and exposing a higher
strength material
and this is something that we could
consider be the reason for the rebound.
So bounce in there, find a
higher strength material
and then get going for
the next landing.
So there you go.
It was low density everywhere,
this is the big hang-up.
There are two things about that. One
is that gravity is not understood.
I'll be dealing with that
later in the weekend.
All we have is a mathematical description
which is no help in understanding.
Also, there is the possibility that
the comet may have a hollow center.
Also the floating grains
were very fluffy.
Well, electrical ablation of
surface minerals can cause that.
A higher-strength material
that was a surprise to us,
based on this erroneous assumption that
mass equals the quantity of matter.
With this picture of dust
falling back to the surface,
forming high porosity layers, we
fail to explain the rebounds.
Well, dust is being removed from the
comet and moved around electrostatically
as it is on the moon.
It's probably superficial
in most areas.
It's rocky-like
stuff, but not rock!
Because it's impossible, according
to the very low density estimate.
This aspect is central to the Electric
Universe explanation of gravity.
Mass is not equal to the amount of
matter, a fundamental error in physics.
The electrical model as I said,
even suggests hollowness.
And then there was this
interesting thing that was said,
we also see this stuff shining through
where the dust layer is wiped away
or fallen off following
the gravitational field.
And exposing a higher
strength material.
And this is something we could consider
could be the reason for the rebound.
Well, the shining stuff may be the
coronal discharges from the comet.
If so, they would be featureless
glows like St. Elmo's fire,
perhaps with bright points
at the active cathode spots,
leaving behind a darker, blackened surface
that had been modified electrochemically.
Anyway, congratulations to the Rosetta
mission team for a fantastic effort,
shame about the
science mythology.
It was interesting, the
following morning
there was an ESA blog where geologists
posted the following comment,
and since it was an ESA
blog we had to log in.
I assume, he was
somewhat of an expert.
He said: "It looks like the shrinkage
patterns of clay on the surface..."
And this is the image from the lander
looking at the surface nearby.
"It is quite possible that clay is
among the most abundant minerals
on the panoramic
landscape of the comet."
Well, this is pretty
outrageous thing to say
because clay includes
pyroxene and olivine
which are high-
temperature minerals.
Also, to make clay you require water and
a, more or less, planetary environment.
He says it is, this form of clay is
quite common in nature here on Earth.
He said, weathering causes erosion of topographic
highs and their deposition in basins,
shallow seas and oceans.
The effect of heat and
pressure changes the minerals
like olivine into
clay and even cement
and in the process captures and
sequesters atmospheric carbon dioxide.
This last point is interesting
too because they could be
the source of carbon dioxide as well
as the water in the comet coma.
So we switch to the
Mars MAVEN mission
which ducked out of the way
when that comet shot past.
Just recently, comet
Siding Spring's flyby,
which was 87,000 miles above the
planet or about 140,000 kilometers.
Debris from the comet added a temporary and
very strong layer of ions to the ionosphere,
the electrically charged layer high
above Mars, this was the report.
Such an electrical disturbance is
expected from an electrified comet
with a different potential
to that of the planet
and the closer the approach, the
more severe the electrical effects
up to a Tunguska-type
event, or worse.
In more recent news, it
calls into question
our beliefs about how
planetary systems form.
The caption for this
artist's rendition says:
"Astronomers have discovered an exoplanet
that is 10 times as heavy as Jupiter
but orbits its star
in less than a day."
However, such a sighting should
be a relatively rare occurrence
suggesting that physicists may have
to reconsider their understanding
of how stars interact
with their planets.
The existence of huge, Jupiter-sized
planets so near to their stars
is a long-standing puzzle, since they cannot
form near to the star where it is far too hot.
So the standard response is to say
they must form much further out,
where it is cool enough for ices to
freeze out of the proto-planetary disk.
This hypothetical protoplanetary
disk circling the young star,
hence forming the
core of a new planet.
And then, something then must move
the planet into a close orbit,
and one likely mechanism is an
interaction with another planet or star.
Well, it was the astronomer
Tom Van Flandern
who showed how unlikely these
kind of occurrences are.
So this is a highly speculative
and unlikely scenario.
And given the number of hot Jupiters
discovered, this last point seemed strained.
What's worse, exoplanets have
been found orbiting backwards
and over the poles of the star.
The Electric Universe model
of star and planet formation
follows the plasma cosmologists',
which is all
peer-reviewed material,
whose theory has been supported by
recent infrared images of stars
formed along glowing Birkeland current
filaments in molecular clouds.
As Hannes Alfvén wrote:
"Gravitational systems are the
ashes of electrical systems."
But the Electric Universe
models adds an...
[a model, sorry]
...adds an electrical fissioning mechanism
for forming hot Jupiters like this one
that results from a new understanding
of the electrical nature of stars.
This planet may be recently born,
instead of facing annihilation
by crashing into the star, as
the article later suggests.
And this recent report shows the
dogged application of the myth
about planet formation
from a dusty nebula.
It says,
"These dusty disks, likely
created by collisions
between leftover objects
from planet formation,
were imaged around stars as
young as ten million years old
and as mature as more
than 1 billion years old.
It's like looking back in time to
see the kinds of destructive events
that once routinely happened in our
solar system after the planets formed.
This is the kind of response you
get from one of the scientists.
Here we see the myth of solar
system history stated as fact.
But no two "disks" of material
surrounding stars, look the same.
The report says the features
around the star HD 181327,
which is the one on the
right top corner there,
resemble the ejection of a huge spray of
debris into the outer part of the system
from the recent collision
of two bodies.
But when all you have is
gravity and explosions,
your options are
extremely limited.
The disks look far more
like corona discharges,
which I've, you can
see below there.
Which makes sense if we're looking
down the barrel of a stellar z-pinch
which is something that we'll
be discussing in more detail,
especially after Don Scott
has given his presentation.
Also we only hear of accretion disks,
yet stars regularly expel matter.
So the notion of expulsion disks
should be considered also.
And here we have problems
with stellar evolution theory.
And it's a recurring theme in science
reports over the previous months.
But here's the latest one about
stars in globular clusters.
It's generally believed that all stars belonging
to the same globular cluster were born together,
from the same interstellar
cloud and at the same time.
Strangely, however,
this is not the case.
It appears that the more information astronomers
acquire about the stars in Omega Centauri,
the less they seem to understand
the origin of these stars.
The evidence discounts the
stellar evolution model.
Globular clusters have
multiple main sequences.
This is pretty odd.
Two groups of stars with, either, an
age difference of 1 to 2 Giga years
or a significant difference in their
carbon-nitrogen-oxygen content
and a difference in
helium abundance.
Astronomers found that the bluest
stars contain more heavy elements
than those of the
redder population.
And these are all supposed
to be the same age.
This was exactly opposite to the
expectation and they led to the conclusion
that bluest stars have an overabundance
of the light element helium.
They are in fact the most
helium-rich stars ever found.
But why is this so?
The team suggests that this puzzle may
be explained in the following way;
First, a great burst of
star formation took place
during which all the stars of the
red population were produced.
These stars transform their hydrogen
into helium by nuclear burning.
This is a standard story.
Some of them with masses of 10
to 12 times the mass of the Sun,
soon thereafter exploded as supernovae
thereby enriching the interstellar medium
with blasting it everywhere
in the globular cluster.
Next, the blue population stars
formed from this helium-rich medium.
This is really a crackpot
theory, when you look at it.
It's incredibly
unlikely and complex.
It's not been shown that the dispersal
of heavy elements by supernovae
can be enough to form second-generation
stars in significant numbers.
The EU says, the
Electric Universe model,
there's a tight alignment of the normal
vector to the disk of globular clusters
with that of the disk of
satellite dwarf galaxies.
So they're tied together
in some interesting way.
They seem to have had the same birth process
by ejection from the core of the galaxy,
based on Halton Arp's observations of
ejection of quasars or nascent star clusters
from the galactic core in
the plane of the galaxy.
And this meets neatly with plasma
cosmology models of spiral galaxies.
So globular clusters appear to be a
form of nuclei of dwarf galaxies.
I won't go on about the
stellar ages and composition.
The Electric Universe model of stars shows
it to be incredibly complex and untestable,
and it is invalid.
When I got the news on April
23rd, earlier this year,
that a flare had been detected
by Swift and it was coming from
a nearby flare star called DGCVN,
I was initially very surprised.
Swift doesn't normally detect
flares from nearby flare stars
and DGCVN is a
relatively unknown star.
There are a few things
we know about DGCVN.
It is an M-class star,
also called a red dwarf,
and is located only about
60 light-years away.
It's a dim little red star.
It has a luminosity that's about one
thousandth the luminosity of the Sun.
It has a mass that's about
1/3 the mass of the Sun
and a radius that's about
1/3 the radius of the Sun.
The largest solar flare ever recorded,
happened on November 4th, 2003.
It was so powerful that it
overloaded the sensors measuring it
but later calculations
put it at an X45.
Flares are classified
according to their strength,
the smallest ones are B-class,
followed by C, M and X, the largest.
And X45 flare is a
very powerful flare.
DGCVN's flare, however,
was much larger.
We can estimate how big the flare on DGCVN
was with respect to this solar scale.
It would have been an X100,000.
So this is several orders
of magnitude larger
than the biggest solar
flare we've ever seen.
The flare that Swift
triggered on from DGCVN,
was only the beginning of what turned out
to be a fairly extended series of flares.
A flare event, if you will,
that lasted almost 20 days.
This was a very different
star than the Sun
so we don't really have to worry about
this happening in the present day Sun.
The young Sun, such large
events may have occurred.
In the present day Sun, the
activity levels are much lower.
The fundamental reason that
DGCVN is more active than the Sun
is, it's a very young
star, 30 million years,
it's rapidly rotating, young
stars are born that way.
And rapid rotation is one of the key
ingredients which powers activity.
The faster the rotation,
the greater the activity.
While not a threat to us, the
massive flares of red dwarf stars
can help us better understand the
flares produced by our own Sun.
They are also of interest because red
dwarf stars are often orbited by planets.
Some data suggest that 40% of red
dwarfs have super-Earth-type planets
orbiting in a habitable zone,
where liquid water is possible.
If this is true, then they are good
candidates for supporting life.
However, the habitable zone around
a cool dim star like DGCVN
is much closer to the star
than the Earth is to the Sun.
When planets are
closer to their star,
they're more susceptible
to anything the star does.
For instance, if the star flares, the
planet is much closer to the star
and it can be hit by the radiation
or the particles that get ejected
from the star when this
flare process happens.
If you happened to be on a
planet around an M dwarf
when one of these
large flares went off,
you'd be having a very bad day.
I wanted to finish on this slide
because this has significance
for what we will be talking about
when we discuss Proto-Saturn,
later on the weekend.
Because all of the story about the ages
of these stars and how they behave
and that the, our own, Sun is not
likely to do this kind of thing,
is based on erroneous science.
None of it is valid.
However, there are certain aspects
that I just want to point out
before my time is
completely gone.
The light curve that you saw there
showed rapid onset and slow decay
followed by lesser
pulses gradually falling.
And that's typical of lightning
or an electrical discharge.
Red stars don't have the photospheric
granulation to regulate their discharge
so this is the only way they can respond
to changes in their environment.
And they do so by changing in
size and by expelling matter.
And I would suggest that that red dwarf
was actually giving birth to a satellite.
It may have been of planet size.
I think this is the way in the Electric
Universe that these things happen
and it has significance for the story of
Proto-Saturn which we'll discuss later.
Thank you.

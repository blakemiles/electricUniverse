On January 24th 2016 NASA scientists
celebrated the 12th anniversary
of the arrival of the rover
Opportunity on the planet Mars.
The celebration was marked by
scientists' continued expression
of amazement over the Rover's
astonishing long liveness.
In 2004 the rovers
Spirit and Opportunity
were each given expected
lifespans of about 90 days
and were projected to drive
a total of 600 metres.
However, both Mars Exploration Rovers
defied both expectation and explanation.
The rover Spirit
survived until 2010
when it became stuck in the
rugged soil of Gusev Crater
and today in 2016 Opportunity
is still going strong
with mission scientists still unable to offer
real answers for the Rover's endurance.
On February 5th 2016 the website
planetary.org published a blog on the
"unparalleled achievement" of the
Mars Exploration Rover team.
The article states:
"12 years is a long time for Rovers designed
and dispatched for 3-month tours...
so far beyond the imagination,
it's almost unbelievable.
The fact that Opportunity is still
roving is beyond remarkable even,
truth told, for those
who built her."
One Scientist quoted
in the article states:
"While Opportunity is a bit worse for
wear, I have to admit that once again
our ability to understand the lifetime
of our own designs is really poor.
With their rather constant temperature
environment and with fewer moving parts
it makes some sense to me that the Voyager
spacecraft would live for decades.
It is harder for me to believe that a
highly mechanical solar-powered Mars rover,
that must suffer rather
impressive daily
and yearly temperature
extremes and dust storms,
will be capable of lasting
more than a few years."
Unfortunately the article does
nothing to eliminate the mystery
of how the Rover has
been able to survive
around 50 times longer than
its projected lifespan.
Rather, the Rover's quote
"unbelievable endurance"
is attributed to equally
unbelievable factors
namely that occasional gusts of wind cleared
dust from the solar panels for some reason.
To get a sense of just how
profound the enigma is
let us look back all the way to 2004,
when the mysteries began to accumulate.
The Rovers' original
projected 90 day lifespans
were largely based on the extreme
dustiness of the martian environment
as well as other weather
and geological factors.
Of course scientists knew
at the time that Mars,
whose tenuous atmosphere is less
than 1% as dense as Earth's,
has occasional winds and
intense dust storms
but since mechanical wind is
obviously not a reliable means
to remove dust from any vehicle it was
believed that the rover solar panels
would inevitably be buried in dust
and eventually lose all power.
Yet in 2004, mission
scientists reported the first
of a series of unexplained
cleanings of the Rovers.
According to a news scientists'
report, the rover Opportunity,
whose power had been steadily
declining due to dust accumulation,
experienced a dramatic
increase in power after it
"stumbled into something
akin to a car wash".
Jim Erickson of NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory stated at the time:
"These exciting an
unexplained cleaning events
have kept Opportunity
in really great shape."
While the Rovers' cleanings and
endurance remain unexplained by NASA
a clue to the puzzle is provided by the
Agency's own news release dated July 14 2005.
"When humans visit Mars they'll have to watch
out for towering electrified dust devils."
With these words NASA gave official
sanction to an idea that had already
been percolating from separately funded
research projects in recent years.
This research has explored the electrical
component to dust devils in the Arizona desert.
Investigators were surprised to find that
these vortices are electrically charged.
According to a news
item entitled:
"Electrics sand findings could
lead to better climate models",
one investigator has
speculated that:
"Electric fields get so large on the Red
Planet they produce ground-level sparks."
In fact, in the Electric Universe,
the martian wind is indeed connected
to the cleaning of the Rovers' solar
panels and thus its long liveness.
In previous episodes we've discussed
the astonishing global dust storms
composed of giant towering vortices that have
sometimes enveloped the entire Red Planet.
Also mysterious are the vast fields of Martian
sand dunes and other wind driven features.
However, what if the electric fields
associated with the dust devils
are not generated by sand
particles rubbing together?
In the past we have suggested that the
martian wind is analogous to an ionic wind,
such as that seen here and repeatedly
shown in Space News episodes,
produced in laboratory
experiments by Billy Yelverton.
Mars, like a comet, is a charged
body moving on an elliptical orbit
through the Sun's weak electric
field and like the planet Mars,
the comet 67P has
revealed sand dunes
that could not have reasonably
been formed by mechanical winds.
The discovery of fast moving
electrons and electric fields
near the nucleus of comet 67 P explain
both the filamentary comet jets
and the configuration of surface
dust in dune-like features.
We suggest that it is not a coincidence
that the largest dust storms on Mars
tend to occur when the Sun, Earth
and Mars are in alignment.
Indeed when the greatest global dust storm,
ever observed on Mars, began in 2001,
Mars had reached opposition and was the closest
it had been to Earth in about 12 years.
This suggests that the electrical tickling
of Mars by Earth's cometary plasma sheet
or magneto tail may be responsible for much
of the tornado activity on the Red Planet.
Is the occasional electrostatic removal
of dust from the Mars rover Opportunity
responsible for its
extraordinary long liveness?
The irony is that scientists working
with NASA have developed technology
that may provide the
answer to this question.
Self-cleaning solar panels that
rely on electrostatic cleaning
have proven extremely
effective at dust removal.
As noted in a 2010 review,
"The technology was developed for
future rover missions to Mars,
but it could work here on Earth to keep
solar panels working at peak capacity.
It uses electrostatic charge to repel dust
and force it to the edges of the panels.
It can remove 90% of the dust on a
solar panel in a two-minute cycle..."
For how many additional years
will this mystery endure
with NASA scientists continuing
to acknowledge their amazement,
yet failing to consider any
new theoretical possibilities
which all real mysteries demand.

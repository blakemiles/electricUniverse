Have you ever seen a carpenter
try to cut a 2x4 with a hammer?
Probably not. Carpenters usually carry a
saw as well as a hammer in their tool
boxes, and they know to use the proper
tool for the task at hand. If they didn't
have a saw they could likely flail away
with the hammer and eventually produce a
splintered length of wood that more or
less fit their need. But it wouldn't be
pretty.
Astrophysicists have only one tool in
their kit -- the hammer of gravitational
theory. When called upon to build an
explanation for the phenomena of a
universe filled with plasma, they can't
cut it. They're forced to flail. An
oscillation in a plasma discharge that
produces a thousand pulses of
electromagnetic radiation per second -- a
pulsar -- will be splintered into ad-hoc
kindling by the hammer of gravity.
Several stars' worth of matter must be
pounded into a tiny volume and spun
around at a thousand r.p.s. Then a hotspot
must be tacked on to produce the pulses
of radiation. The self-constraining
filaments of plasma spiraling out from
the poles of active galaxies -- galactic
jets -- require even more gravitational
hammering. An astronomical quantity of
matter must be pounded into such a tiny
volume that it loses most of its
recognizable properties and becomes a
black hole. The black hole then pulls in
all the surrounding matter and squeezes
it. Next, gravity has to poke tiny holes
in the squeezed matter to squirt it back
out. Finally, emergency aid for magnetic
forces has to be called in to keep the
streams of hot gas from evaporating into
the empty space around them.
The spiraling filaments of a plasma 'rope'
can pinch down into a small 'hot spot'. If
the current density is high enough, the
pinch and the tubular or conical volume
around it can glow revealing the
filamentary structure in visible light. To
explain these planetary nebulae with
gravity, a catastrophic imbalance between
radiation and gravitational pressures
must be generated in the core of a star.
The resulting explosion blows off a
spherical shell of hot gas. That shell
must then be molded into the observed
bipolar shapes (the tubes and the cones) by
way of asymmetric interactions with
previous gaseous emissions and
interstellar gas. Sometimes a little help
from currentless magnetic fields is
thrown in. As far as is known, with the
possible exception of bar magnets, an
electric current is the only way to
produce a magnetic field. But
"electric current" is an alias for a
plasma. These examples of gravitational
flailing illustrate a fundamental
incommensurability in viewpoint. A
carpenter chooses a saw or a hammer
according to whether he's working with
wood or with steel. Identifying the
material at hand is one of those
cognitive activities that's so basic
it's taken for granted. It's often
unconscious. It surprises us when it's
forced into our awareness by being
mistaken, when what we assumed was a nail
turns out to be a splinter of wood. This
vacuum of sensory deprivation tends to
suck in material from the nearest source
of cognitive substance which is
preconceived ideas. To a man with a
hammer, everything looks like a nail. And
to a physicist with a theory of
gravity, everything looks like mass. When
the mass he imputes to the source of
the thin stream of photons doesn't nail
down the explanation he needs, he
imagines more mass, invisible mass, mass
compressed into black holes and expanded
into dark halos, until his universe is
90% imaginary. A physicist with a theory
of plasma is much better off. At least
she can perform laboratory experiments
on her alternatives to black holes and
dark matter.
She has more sources of information
about her material than the thin stream
of photons from the sky. She can test
the ideas she imagines with the sparks
she can manipulate. She can hammer on the
wood; she can saw on the nail; she can see
that doesn't work and go back to try the
reverse. She can be scientific, can use
concepts as tools and can avoid
transubstantiating them into pseudo-
religious icons.

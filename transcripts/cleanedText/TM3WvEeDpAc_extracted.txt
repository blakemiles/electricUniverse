Welcome to Space News from

New scientific reports may provide
insights into catastrophic events
that once occurred
on the planet Mars.
Scientists at an observatory
in Northern Ireland
have conducted analysis of nine asteroids
that orbit Mars, called Trojans,
and they've come to the conclusion that the
asteroids are the remains of a former planet.
The team discovered that the so-called Trojans
appear to be composed of the same material
including the mineral olivine which only
forms at extremely high temperatures
and is thought to be associated
with planetary collisions.
The team has concluded that the asteroids
orbiting Mars are pieces of a former mini planet
or planetesimal which was
destroyed eons ago by collisions.
Those who have followed The
Thunderbolts Project may understand
why neither mechanical collisions
nor a hypothetical former planet
are necessary to explain
the asteroids formation.
For decades, the chief principals
of The Thunderbolts Project,
Dave Talbott and Wal Thornhill, have
proposed a very different history for Mars
and all of the planets in
the inner solar system.
In ancient myth, Mars was
identified as both the warrior hero
and as his own weapon,
the cosmic thunderbolt.
Thornhill and Talbott state that Mars
was devastated by electrical discharges
in an epoch of planetary instability
in the relatively recent past,
perhaps several thousand
years ago in prehistory.
As "radical as a
theory may seem"
it explains and in fact continues to
successfully predict countless discoveries
that only prove puzzling
to planetary scientists.
More than six miles
of crustal depth
was mysteriously removed from the
Martian northern hemisphere.
Consider also the many millions of
cubic kilometers excavated from Mars
in the formation of the stupendous
feature known as Valles Marineris.
Material from Mars still
occasionally strikes the earth
in the form of
mysterious meteorites.
Indeed, the discovery of Martian meteorites
was treated with great initial skepticism
since astronomers could not
envision the escaped material
reaching the necessary velocities
to bring the material to Earth.
If electrical discharges did in fact
devastate the Red Planet from pole to pole,
both the, so called,
Trojan asteroids
and the presence of the mineral
olivine are to be expected.
No collisions with former
planets are necessary.
The mineral olivine
presented a puzzle
when it was discovered, completely
unexpectedly, on a comet.
Such was the case with the Stardust's
next mission to the comet Wild 2 in 2004.
NASA investigators were
amazed to discover olivine,
and other minerals that only
form at super hot temperatures,
and dust samples from a
so-called "dirty snowball."
As NASA curator Michael
Zolensky said at the time,
"That's a big surprise. People thought comets
would just be cold stuff that formed out ...
where things are very cold.
It was kind of a shock to not just
find one but several of these,
which implies they are
pretty common in the comet."
In fact, in the Electric Universe hypothesis,
comets, asteroids and meteoroids
did not accrete billions of years
ago in the solar system's infancy
but they were in fact torn from planetary
surfaces by electrical discharges.
NASA scientists were also amazed to
discover the mineral tridymite, on Mars,
which only forms at
extremely high temperatures
and is thought to result from a kind
of volcanism never suspected on Mars.
As NASA geochemist Richard
Morris said of the discovery,
"It's really nifty, but
we were shocked ...
There is no evidence for
plate tectonics on Mars.
That's why it's such a surprise
to find this tridymite."
However, as noted in a
recent Space News report,
tridymite has been reported to form as a
product of lightning in a roofing slate,
as documented in the book
The Data Of Geochemistry.
In the feature-length documentary film,
The Lightning Scarred Planet Mars,
detailed analysis is given of
countless geological features on Mars
that find ideal analogs in laboratory
experiments with electrical discharges.
One such example is the towering Olympus
Mons, a nearly 22 kilometer high,
so-called, shield volcano and the tallest
mountain of any planet in the solar system.
As noted in the film, this shield
volcano interpretation of Olympus Mons
presents far more
enigmas than answers.
The defining feature
of a shield volcano
is a gentle extrusion of
fluid or low viscosity lava.
Shield volcanoes on Earth
do not present a scarp
whereas the scarp of Olympus Mons
towers a nearly four miles high.
A NASA report freely
acknowledges,
"The scarp is of unknown origin..." And...
"The steep cliff around Olympus Mons
is peculiar and not characteristic
of terrestrial shield volcanoes."
But perhaps most striking of all may
be the blanket of incredibly fine
filamentary ridges and ravines
within the terrain of Olympus Mons.
In fact, the continuing discovery of
perplexing dendritic patterns on Mars
is a key prediction of the
Electrical Scarring hypothesis.
New images taken by NASA's
Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter
reveal precisely the kinds of features
expected from electrical discharges.
Consider this recently
released image of the terrain
within the 10-kilometer
Zunil crater on Mars.
Scientists insist that the
crater was produced by an impact
but they have no real explanation
for the raised dendritic features
associated with secondary
craters within the crater.
NASA's description of the
image reads as follows,
"Secondary craters form from rocks ejected
at high speed from the primary crater,
which then impact the ground
at sufficiently high speed
to make huge numbers of much smaller
craters over a large region....
In this scene, however, the
secondary crater ejecta
has an unusual raised-relief appearance,
like bas-relief sculpture."
The best guess that NASA can offer
is that the so-called impact crater
has been mysteriously
weathered over eons of time.
The agency states,
"One idea is that the region was covered
with a layer of fine-grained materials
like dust or pyroclastics
about 1 to 2 meters thick
when the Zunil impact occurred
(about a million years ago),
and the ejecta served to
harden or otherwise protect
the fine-grained layer from
later erosion by the wind."
But experimental research within
the Electric Universe community
provides far more
promising possibilities.
One such experiment, conducted
by Billy Yelverton,
produced raised dendritic ridges simply
by applying intense vibrations to soil.
Consider also this experiment,
performed by YouTube user diveflyfish,
subjecting aluminum foil
to electrical discharge.
Indeed we have called the Martian
environment a "laboratory in space,
ideal for testing the concepts
of electric universe geology."
It was well over a decade ago that physicist
dr. C.J. Ransom of Vemasat laboratories
was able to reproduce the mysterious,
so-called, Martian blueberries
by blasting quantities of
hematite with an electric arc.
Only one of many such
pathways of investigation,
as repeatedly outlined
on this series
as well as many dozens of The Picture Of
the Day articles on Thunderbolts.info.
Electrical discharges produce
effects that could account
for much of the consistently
bizarre Martian geology.
Space discovery today routinely
provides surprising discoveries
about the Martian environment.
As human exploration brings
Mars into ever finer focus,
we confidently predict that the evidence will
continue to mount for catastrophic events
that left their indelible
imprint on the Red Planet.

Welcome to Space News from
the Electric Universe,
brought to you by The
Thunderbolts Projectâ„¢
at Thunderbolts.info
We have created this
special Top 10 series
to highlight the most compelling evidences
for the dominant role of electromagnetism
at all scales
throughout the cosmos.
Thanks to ever finer
technological data
the existence of electric currents
traveling through space is now undeniable
and is more and more routinely acknowledged
by astronomers and astrophysicists.
Yet the ramifications of this
revelation have been slow
in affecting any meaningful change
in consensus scientific theory.
A major obstacle is
a lingering belief
that science discovery has
emphatically contradicted
that celestial objects cannot
have any net charge separation.
It is then not a coincidence that objects
in space (are) behaving like charged bodies
from the mysterious
collimated jets of comets
to the spectacular sprites and elves
seen on our own planet's upper atmosphere,
to the catastrophic electrical discharges
focused on stars producing supernova explosions,
to extra-galactic jets traveling at nearly the
speed of light over a million light years or more.
Today, we will explore why the high-energy
electrical scarring of bodies in our solar system
is the 8th of ten reasons why
the universe is electric.
The Electrical Scarring
of Planets and Moons
The myth of a solar system
that has remained unchanged
since its hypothetical formation
4.5 billion years ago, has now crumbled.
As we've reported in many
episodes in recent years,
the standard theory of planets and
stars forming in a nebular cloud
from gravitational
collapse and accretion
finds no support in the thousands of
exoplanetary systems discovered to date.
As astronomer Gregory Laughlin
told the journal Nature in 2014;
using our solar
system as a model has,
"...led to no success in
extrapolating what's out there."
So different as our solar
system seems to be
that astronomers now increasingly entertain
the notion of planetary migration.
As noted in a recent
phys.org report,
"...in our solar system the inner planets have
surprisingly large spacing and diverse sizes.
Abundant evidence in the
solar system suggests
that Jupiter and Saturn disrupted
our system's early structure,
resulting in the four widely-spaced
terrestrial planets we have today."
Some astronomers
today now suggest
that these gas giants acted
as so-called wrecking balls
migrating toward the inner solar system
destroying an early generation of planets
and robbing the planet Mars
of its lighter elements.
The gas giants may have indeed
acted as "wrecking balls"
though not through mechanical
collisions and tidal forces,
but rather through bodies of different
potentials discharging electrically.
As we will see,
the experimentally proven ability of
high-energy electrical discharges
to produce craters, and countless
other planetary features,
offers an entirely new
perspective on planetary science
and the solar system's history.
The Moon
The most heavily studied rocky body in
the solar system outside of the earth
is of course the moon.
When the first space probes
returned images of the moon
they revealed a surface heavily
pockmarked with craters
and riddled with long sinuous
channels called rills.
Scientists seeking to
interpret these features
were constrained by the
traditional geologic toolkit.
The "debate" over the lunar craters only
included two possible causative agents,
volcanism or impact.
Eventually, a consensus was
reached that meteoritic impacts
were the primary source
of the lunar craters.
The moon and some other bodies in the
solar system are so heavily cratered
that astronomers invented a violent
epoch called 'The Late Heavy Bombardment'
a hypothetical period when
disproportionate numbers of asteroids
supposedly collided with planets
in the inner solar system.
One reason for the hypothesis is
that isotopic dating of moon rocks
seems to imply that the so-called
impacts that caused rocks to melt
appear to have happened over a
relatively short period of time.
But like countless other discoveries, the
simultaneous appearance of many lunar craters
is consistent with the
electric discharge hypothesis.
Far from popular consideration,
well before the first
man walked on the moon,
the amateur astronomer Brian J. Ford
published his laboratory experiments
suggesting that craters on the moon
were carved by cosmic lightning bolts.
In the cited experiments Ford
used a spark machining apparatus
to reproduce in miniature some of
the most puzzling lunar features
including craters
with central peaks,
small craters preferentially perched
on the high rims of larger craters
and craters strung
out in long chains.
Ford also observed that the ratio of
large to small craters on the moon
matched the ratio seen
in electrical arcing.
The craters we observe on the
moon emphasize the need
for radically new theoretical
pathways in planetary science.
One mystery that the impact
hypothesis will never explain
is the extreme circularity of the
vast majority of lunar craters.
Experiments with impacts
have long shown
that in order to produce
a highly circular crater,
an object typically must strike
the surface from directly above.
The aforementioned Brian Ford noted that
over 90% of circular craters on the moon
could not have been produced
by sideswiping impacts.
As on other rocky bodies,
we see countless cleanly cut craters
with no ejecta on the crater floors.
Electrical engineer Ralph Juergens, an early
proponent of electrical planetary scarring
wrote of this phenomenon,
"Explaining a crater
floor of bare,
once molten rock in terms of the conventional
impact theory is a little difficult.
One must resort to ad-hoc theorizing
to the effect that something,
perhaps the shock of the
postulated impact explosion,
melted a considerable volume
of rock at some depth,
and that following the explosion
this material welled up to
engulf the crater floor
and flow around obstructions
encountered there;
otherwise, debris from the explosion itself
could be expected to clutter the crater floor.
Impact theory offers no reason, however,
to expect such a sequence of events,
and nothing in terrestrial experience with
crater producing explosions supports the idea.
Though an electric discharge might
be thought of as taking place
in a very brief span of time,
an interplanetary discharge
must surely be an event
of greater duration than
an impact explosion;
the long-distance flow
of current would persist
beyond the instant of any
initial touchdown explosion,
and ejecta that chance to fall
back into the crater thus produced
could be swept away
or melted in place."
Juergens also published a
groundbreaking analysis
of the sinuous rills
on the lunar surface.
A sinuous rill is a
long winding valley
usually with steep walls and
often emerging from a crater
which could be found on
the moon at many scales.
Prior to the Apollo missions, astronomers'
early hypotheses suggested that the rills
were "cracks" on the
moon's surface.
Later guesses included
flowing water
until scientists settled on
flowing lava as the agent.
Today, the accepted theory is
that the moon's sinuous rills
were created either by lava
flowing across the surface
or beneath the ground
to form a "lava tube"
portions of which
eventually collapsed.
Juergens compared the respective point-by-point
requirements of various competing theories
versus the actual observed
characteristics of the rills.
Unlike planetary scientists,
Juergens included among the possible
agents high-energy electrical discharge.
On every evidentiary point
the electrical discharge hypothesis
is either permissible or predictable
and unlike every
competing hypothesis
in not a single instance does the
evidence preclude electrical discharge
as the cause of the rilles.
Even prior to Juergens'
investigation,
several scientists had noted that
flowing liquids, whether water or lava,
could not have caused the observed
features of the lunar rilles,
including the strings of
craters along the rilles' floors.
These points are dramatically emphasized when
we examine the moon's famous Hadley rille.
Today, planetary scientists agree that
the rille is a "collapsed lava tube".
However, the rille does not match the required
characteristics of lava tubes on numerous points.
Most importantly, the collapsed areas of a
lava tube will be rubble-filled depressions.
High-resolution images of the rille
revealed no rubble and no collapse tubes.
It is simply an empty,
sharply cut channel
which matches the expected characteristics
of a "electrical breakdown channel".
Perhaps the greatest problem for the
volcanic hypothesis of lunar rilles
is their tremendous length.
On our own planet, the longest lava
tube reaches only 65 kilometers.
That is about half the length of
Hadley Rille which is 130 kilometers.
However, the exact
opposite should be true.
On Earth, the atmosphere is insulating,
allowing lava to retain its heat.
In the "vacuum of space" heat will
be much more rapidly radiated away.
On our own planet, as lava flows over
distances no more than tens of kilometers,
the cooling at the surface
causes a "roof" to form.
It may then continue to flow
as a tube beneath the surface.
That is the only way the lava tubes
can achieve even their modest lengths.
Consider then the most prominent
lunar rille called Schroter's Valley;
185 kilometers long and
up to 10 kilometers wide
with its depth at points
reaching up to 1,300 meters.
Flowing lava, eating away surface
material to cut a deep channel
would have to show up somewhere.
We should see either breaches in the deep
walls or evidence of abundant outflow.
Instead, the channel simply
dwindles until it disappears.
Curiously, the flow of rills on the moon and
other worlds isn't limited to downhill
like lava and water
carved channels on Earth.
All fluid erosion theories
for Schroter's Valley
have chosen to ignore that the apparent mouth
of the "stream" is on high ground
and the narrowest part of the
channel is on low ground.
We also note that within Schroter's valley
is a much more narrow, secondary rill
whose defining feature is
a chain of small craters.
As we turn our attention from the moon
to the planets in the inner solar system,
we will see emphatically demonstrated the
failures of standard geological theory
to explain the most dramatic
features on planetary surfaces.
Venus
Many years before the first space probe returned
images of the surface of the planet Venus,
one of the 20th century's great
scientific heretics Immanuel Velikovsky
made several outrageous
claims about Venus.
Velikovsky proposed that just
a few thousand years ago
Venus appeared in the earthly
sky as a terrifying comet.
In stark contrast,
many astronomers,
including the originator of the dirty
snowball hypothesis of comets, Fred Whipple
had proposed that the surface of Venus might
be mostly or entirely covered with oceans.
So the discovery of Venus'
super hot temperatures,
an average surface temperature
of 863 degrees Fahrenheit,
was one of the great surprises
of the early Space Age.
Another surprise is the amazingly
"young appearance" of Venus's surface.
Venus shows an astonishing lack
of so-called impact craters
which most planetary scientists today
believe is due to a "resurfacing process"
that must have
removed the craters,
most likely a recent volcanic overturning
of the entire Venusian crust.
The most striking features on Venus are
the vast networks of filamentary scars
or what experimentalists with electrical
discharge recognize as "Lichtenberg patterns".
In the Electric Universe Theory
some rocky planets are born in the same
glowing electric filaments as stars
which are seen strung like beads on
the necklace in molecular clouds.
Others are born by electrical
fissioning of larger bodies
in the process of adjusting to a suddenly
changing electrical environment.
If Venus was once an
earth-threatening comet
as ancient testimony from around
the world universally claims,
it must have had an eccentric orbit
that brought it close to the earth.
Electrical discharging would
have heated the crust
and created the filamentary scars
stretching across the planet's surface.
Of course, it has long
been shown experimentally
that lightning occurring
in a high-pressure gas
causes this kind of
"Lichtenberg pattern".
At low atmospheric pressures cratering
is more common as seen on the moon
and the planet Mercury.
Intriguingly, in 2013
science reports
described the Venusian ionosphere's
interactions with the solar wind
as being more typical of
a comet than a planet
and like a comet, Venus has a vast tail that
stretches up to millions of kilometers,
sometimes touching the
Earth's magnetosphere.
The planet's super
hot temperatures,
its mysterious super rotation,
and it's extraordinarily
powerful lightning
are all expected in the Electric Universe
reconstruction of Venus's recent cometary origins.
As we continue, we will see overwhelming
evidence for the cataclysmic events
'The Thunderbolts of the Gods'
that ravaged the planets
in the inner solar system.
Mars
Prior to the Space Age, most
astronomers had expected Mars
to be a long geologically
dead and barren rock in space.
But beginning with the arrival
of the first space probes,
the surface features of the Red Planet have
provided endless surprises for planetary scientists.
Mars today is a world with
spectacular weather events
including tremendous wind and dust storms
that sometimes engulf the entire planet.
But nothing we observe today,
accounts for the remarkable and
often bizarre Martian geology,
including features that speak
to events more violent
than anything that has ever
occurred on our own planet.
The most dramatic features on Mars
provide all of the clues to these events.
The stupendous Valles Marineris is a chasm
that stretches for 4,000 kilometers long
and up to seven
kilometers in depth.
For comparison, even though Mars is
only about half the size of Earth,
Valles Marineris is the length
of about 5 Grand Canyons.
It was the aforementioned Ralph
Juergens who proposed in the 1970's
that Valles Marineris was a vast scar,
carved by an interplanetary lightning bolt.
In fact, as weâ€™ve reported
in a 2015 Space News,
the hypothesis of the electrical origin of
Valles Marineris has been tested experimentally.
In a collaboration between the late Michael
Steinbacher and engineer Billy Yelverton,
the experiment attempted
to simulate the conditions
that might have been present
when the trench was formed
with dust being dropped from a
reservoir above a discharge table
as seen on your screen.
The feature that consistently appeared
greatly resembled Valles Marineris.
The two also noticed a pattern
that physicist Wal Thornhill had
previously noted in a 2003 article
entitled 'Spiral Galaxies
and Grand Canyons'.
Valles Marineris' s-shape reproduced
in the electrical discharge experiments
strongly resembles the form
of a barred spiral galaxy.
As Thornhill wrote in 2003,
"The connection lies in
the fact that galaxies
are the largest visible electric
discharge phenomenon in the Universe."
Of course, as we've
detailed many times,
this notion has extraordinary
experimental support
as demonstrated in the images on your
screen of the plasma experiments
by Dr. Anthony Peratt and
Winston Bostick, respectively.
In the feature-length documentary film
â€• The Lightning-Scarred Planet Mars â€•
detailed analysis was offered
of countless Martian features
that find ideal analogs
in electrical discharge.
One such example is the
towering Olympus Mons,
a nearly 22 kilometer high
so-called shield volcano
and the tallest mountain of any
planet in the solar system.
As noted in the film, the shield
volcano interpretation of Olympus Mons
presents far more
enigmas than answers.
The defining feature of any shield
volcano is a gentle extrusion of fluid
or low viscosity lava.
Shield volcanoes on Earth
do not present a scarp
whereas the scarp of Olympus Mons
towers at nearly 4 miles high.
A NASA report acknowledges
this problem as follows,
"The scarp is of
unknown origins..."
"The steep cliff around
Olympus Mons is peculiar
and not characteristic of
terrestrial shield volcanoes."
But perhaps most
significant of all
is the blanket of incredibly fine
filamentary ridges and ravines
within the terrain
of Olympus Mons.
In fact, the continued discovery of
perplexing dendritic patterns on Mars
is a key prediction of the
electrical scarring hypothesis.
A pristine example was
discovered in 2017
when an image was released of the terrain
within the 10 kilometres Zunil Crater on Mars.
Planetary scientists insist that the
crater was produced by an impact.
They have no real explanation for
the raised dendritic features
associated with secondary
craters within the crater.
NASA's attempt to explain
the image reads as follows,
"Secondary craters form from rocks ejected
at high speed from the primary crater,
which then impact the ground
at sufficiently high speed
to make huge numbers of much smaller
craters over a large region...
In this scene, however,
the secondary crater ejecta has an
unusual raised relief appearance
like bas-relief sculpture."
The best guess NASA can offer is
that the so-called impact crater
has been mysteriously
weathered over eons of time.
But experimental research
within the EU community
provides much more
promising possibilities.
One such experiment performed by
the aforementioned Billy Yelverton
produced raised dendritic ridges simply
by applying intense vibrations to soil.
Consider also this experiment performed
by YouTube user Dai fly-fish
subjecting aluminum foil
to electrical discharge
and consider also the side-by-side comparison
of highly mysterious so-called Martian spiders
and an electrical discharge
experiment performed by Zane Parker.
As we've said before, the Martian
environment is a "laboratory in space"
for testing the concepts of
Electric Universe Geology.
As we've detailed many times,
more than a decade ago
Dr. C.J. Ransom performed the
only experiments to date
that have reproduced the
Martian blueberries,
tiny spherules that appear by the
trillions embedded in the Martian soil
and the same spherical forms are seen in
giant mysterious domes inside of craters,
a continuing puzzle for
planetary scientists.
A great testimony to the electrical
catastrophes that ravaged Mars
is the more than six
miles of crustal depth
which was mysteriously removed from
the Martian northern hemisphere.
Where did all this material go?
A clue is found in the completely unexpected
discovery of Martian meteorites on Earth.
Initially, planetary scientists treated
the discovery with great skepticism
since they did not expect
that the escaped material
could reach the necessary
velocities to bring it to Earth.
The massive electrical excavation of
Mars could have also been the source
of the mysterious asteroids that
share Mars's orbit, called Trojans.
In fact a scientific
paper published in 2017
proposed that the asteroids are the
remains of a decimated mini planet
since they are composed of olivine and
other distinctly planetary minerals.
Planetary scientists also
imagined violent collisions
as the likely source of the
Martian moons Phobos and Deimos.
As described in a
Space.com report,
"A large impact or smashing
into the Red Planet
could have sent pieces
flying into the air,
where gravity may have
drawn them together.
An existing moon might
have also been destroyed
creating the rubble that later
formed Phobos and Deimos."
As we look closer at Mars's Phobos
collisions and gravitational accretion,
the only theoretical mechanisms
available for planetary scientists
prove totally inadequate to
explain what we actually see.
Like countless
other rocky bodies,
we see dramatic parallel
channels and crater chains
features not expected at all
from mechanical collisions.
But as we've illustrated
dozens of times,
they are routinely produced in
experiments with electrical discharge
and the most dramatic feature on
Phobos, the astonishing Stickney crater,
underscores a puzzle that is repeated
on countless bodies in the solar system.
The crater is 9 kilometers across, nearly
half the diameter of Phobos itself.
How could any impact capable of producing such
a massive crater fail to shatter the moon?
A similarly improbably huge crater is
seen here on the Saturnian moon, Tethys.
The moon is only 1,000
kilometers in diameter
and yet its giant hexagonal crater is
an incredible 450 kilometers across.
As reported by Universetoday.com,
"...Whatever struck Tethys in the distant past
probably should have shattered it into pieces
...but didn't."
On the famous asteroid Vesta,
the largest so-called impact crater is
an astounding 475 kilometers across.
The diameter of the asteroid
is only 525 kilometres.
Craters much too massive to have been
produced by mechanical collisions
is just one of many enigmas resolved
by the electrical scarring hypothesis.
In the companion
piece to this video
called 'The Craters are Electric'
we outlined numerous types of craters
seen on every type of solid body
that are routinely produced by
electrical discharge in the laboratory
including weird hexagonal
or square craters,
so-called bull's-eye craters,
craters with flat floors
and pinched-up rims,
the extreme circularity
of craters,
and the complete anomaly of smaller craters
appearing on the rims of larger craters.
If we apply these explanations to the
massively cratered surfaces of airless worlds,
as seen on our moon,
on the planet Mercury,
on the dwarf planet Ceres,
and in the outer solar system on the
respective moons of the gas giants,
we find a simple resolution
to endless mysteries
that the impact hypothesis
has never explained.
As the Electric Universe Geology community
continues its inevitable growth,
the closer humankind comes to a reconstruction
of an essential chapter of our history.
A chapter of a drama not
written in science textbooks
yet indelibly imprinted in
every arena of human culture.
A drama waiting
to be remembered.

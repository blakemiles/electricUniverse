Welcome to Space News from
the Electric Universe,

The essentialness of water to life is
self-evident to all inhabitants of our planet.
Wherever liquid water
flows, life is possible,
and thus cosmologists are
on a never-ending quest
to detect watery worlds
similar to Earth.
The human body is said to be
composed of "mostly water"
and of course water is vital
for the body's functioning.
Within the electric
universe community,
water’s electrical properties and their
relationship to the structure of water,
is a subject of great
interest in growing research.
At past Thunderbolts
project meetings,
Dr. Gerald Pollack has presented
his thesis on structured water,
and the apparent relationship
between water’s electrical charge
its inter-molecular structure
and its surrounding environment.
Pollack has proposed what
he describes as "EZ water"
an "Exclusion Zone" of water
which has a negative charge.
A new scientific paper may lend
credence to these notions and if valid,
could have ramifications reaching well
beyond the earth and life sciences,
affecting all of cosmology.
In this episode physicist
Eugene Bagashov
introduces the controversial research
to the Thunderbolts audience
and begins outlining the important
questions the paper may raise.
I would like to discuss a recent
paper published a few months ago
in the World Journal
of Applied Physics.
To be honest, when I first
read it, I was quite shocked
as I believe its contents might have a
wide range of highly important implications
for physics, including astrophysics
and also chemistry and biology,
and maybe other branches
of science as well.
Now before I begin talking
about the paper itself,
I should note that the journal
where this paper was published,
is only a couple of years old,
and it does not look very
credible, at least to my eye.
Of course, in general I am advocating
for more academic freedom
and certanly do not mean that this is
a bad Journal just because it's new,
but I've read the text of the paper carefully
and there are a few hints here and there
that might indicate (on) a certain
lack of a review process.
Just as an example, in the
last section of the paper,
the author provides very important results
of a group of "scientists from Israel,"
but he never gives any actual reference
to their work to verify his words.
And it seems that the author
performed this research alone,
so in the end we're basically left
to rely on his goodwill, if you like,
and to believe that the experiments
that he performed, were done properly
and that his judgement about their
implications is reasonable.
So, in general I would advise a very
careful and skeptical approach
to the results
reported in this paper,
especially given its already
mentioned potential importance.
Well, since I've already
stated my general concerns,
from now on I'm going to proceed
with the description of the results
provided by the author, pretty
much taken at face value.
And after that I'll describe my own vision of
the possible implications of these results,
again implicitly supposing
that they are genuine.
The paper deals with the
properties of charged water.
So essentially, the author has been
performing a series of different experiments,
in comparing the behavior of uncharged versus
positively or negatively charged water.
Uncharged water was stored in
closed aluminum containers
and to charge it positively, the author
was either treating it with gaseous oxygen,
or filtering it through silica gel.
The oxygen was supposed to absorb
some of the electrons from the water
and silica gel absorbs
hydroxyl ions,
thus leaving the water with
excess positive charge.
Negatively charged water was obtained
by either treating the uncharged water
with gaseous hydrogen or by filtering
it through the activated carbon.
The hydrogen was supposed to provide
additional electrons to the water
and carbon absorbs
hydrogen ions from it.
thus leaving the water with
excess negative charge.
By changing the intensity or
duration of any of these procedures,
the researcher was able to control the
resulting electric potential of the water.
Now let's take a look at
the reported findings.
The first result that
the author reports
is the significant change in ultraviolet
absorption spectra of charged water.
One can see that charged water absorbs
much more UV light than uncharged one
and the spectrum itself significantly
depends on the sign of the charge.
In particular, the positively charged
water demonstrates a sharp peak
with the maximum shifted
into the shortwave area,
and the negatively charged one
demonstrates a flatter peak,
shifted slightly into the
longer wave area.
It is interesting that the paper also contains
UV absorption spectra of DNA solutions
in positively and negatively
charged water which also differ.
The second result is a change in
mechanical behavior of charged water,
namely when it is flowing
out of a narrow gap,
the stream of positively charged
water rotates counterclockwise
and the stream of negatively
charged water rotates clockwise.
The author also mentions that the
solutions of surface active substances
demonstrate behavior similar to
the positively charged water
both in their UV absorption
spectra and in flow dynamics.
And the solutions of surface-inactive
substances behave like negatively charged water.
It looks like the solutions themselves
are acquiring different charge,
depending on the interaction of the
dissolved substance with water.
At least that is what
the author suggests.
The third result is a different
behavior of solutions
prepared with the use of water
with different electric potential.
In particular, the evaporation
of solutions of salts
leads to the formation of different crystal
forms, depending on the charge of the water.
One example is the evaporation
of a positively charged solution
which leads to the formation of large cubic
crystals of mono-potassium phosphate,
while the negatively
charged water evaporates,
leaving thin needle-like
crystals of the same substance.
The author also shows that the
copper powder behaves differently
in the water with positive
and negative charge.
In the negatively charged water it forms
typical dendritic Lichtenberg patterns
on the bottom of a container,
while in positively charged water,
it remains a bit more inert.
The fourth result is a significant change
in surface tension of charged water.
The author shows that the
negatively charged water
has much lower surface tension
than the positively charged one.
I'll remind you that surface tension
is the parameter that determines
how hard it is to spread
the liquid, so to speak.
So liquids with high surface tension would
tend to be more lumped as one might say,
concentrating in isolated droplets
and thus having a lower surface area,
while liquids with low surface
tension can be more easily spread
and their droplets are more
likely to join into a continuum.
So the positively charged water, having a
higher surface tension, tends to be more lumped,
while the negatively charged water with lower
surface tension, tends to be more spread.
The author demonstrates
this in a petri dish,
where the negatively charged water
covers its bottom completely,
spreading over all of its area,
while the positively charged water
concentrates in isolated droplets.
Another experiment to demonstrate
this change in surface tension,
is performed with starch powder.
When it is deposited on top of the
negatively charged water in the dish,
it covers all of its surface
in less than two seconds,
and thus is able
to remain afloat.
But when it is deposited on top
of the positively charged water
it accumulates at the deposition site
and quickly sinks because of that.
The author also performs a
pretty staggering experiment,
where he shows that
the steel needles,
when placed on the surface of negatively
charged water, sink immediately.
But on the surface of
positively charged water,
they can remain afloat
for up to 12 hours.
He also mentions that the
same effect can be achieved
with uncharged water
and charged needles.
In this case, a negatively
charged needle would sink
and the positively charged needle
would not, at least for some time.
The fifth result is the change in the
ability of water to hydrate polymers.
In particular positively charged water
hydrates polymers of biological origin
faster than the
negatively charged one.
To demonstrate that, the author puts
some starch powder in two bottles:
one with positively charged water and
the other with negatively charged water.
After half an hour
at room temperature,
the starch swells in the bottle
with positively charged water
and does not swell in the bottle
with negatively charged water.
The author also notes that the bottles
themselves were made of polymer,
polyethylene in particular,
and it seems that the positively charged
water can penetrate through it easier
than the negatively charged,
or uncharged water,
since he noted that the
positively charged water
was able to partially evaporate,
even from a closed bottle.
And the sixth result that
the author describes,
is the change in the freezing temperature
of water, depending on its charge.
Here he does not perform any experiments
but describes some other people's results.
Remember that note I made before
about scientists from Israel.
So it is well known that
perfectly pure uncharged water
can stay liquid up to very low temperatures
something like -42 or even -48ºC,
so called supercooled water.
It does not turn into ice, because there
are no centers of crystallization in it,
which are usually represented
by various impurities.
So the ice crystals in pure water cannot
find any starting point for their growth.
The author adds to this that the
impurities must always be charged,
either initially or because of their
interactions with water itself.
So the lack of these charges
inside the water volume
seems to reduce its
ability to crystallize,
which means it might
be fruitful to study
the freezing of charged
water in the first place.
The researchers that the author mentions,
were studying the freezing of water droplets
deposited on surfaces with
different electric charge,
and they've supposedly found
that the uncharged pure water
froze at the
temperature of -12.5ºC,
while the negatively charged water
froze at lower temperature of -18ºC,
and positively charged water froze at
the higher temperature of only -7ºC.
The author even goes as far as
to state that the charge might
change the heat capacity and
thermal conductivity of water.
So, to sum up all these results,
the paper states that the electric
charge of water influences:
1) its ultraviolet
absorption spectrum;
2) its mechanical behavior (namely the
direction of rotation of the stream);
3) the behavior of
water solutions;
4) its surface tension;
5) its interaction
with polymers,
namely the ability to hydrate
them and penetrate through them;
and 6) its freezing
temperature.
Overall, the author suggests
that the charge of water actually
changes its internal structure,
which in its turn determines
the observed differences.
I'd like to note that, although
I have certain doubts
about some statements that
have been made in this paper,
the good thing about
all of this is that
it all can be quite easily
experimentally verified or falsified,
and I definitely hope to see more research
in this area in the coming months or years.
So even if the author is wrong we
will probably know soon enough.
In our next episode, Eugene will offer
an extensive thought-provoking analysis
on the far-reaching ramifications
of this theoretical pathway,
including its significance for
manufacturing and industry,
for biology, and for all
of the space sciences,
perhaps demanding entirely new
attempts to understand our universe.

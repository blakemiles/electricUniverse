I am talking about “Science Set Free” and what 
science is being set free from, is the science delusion.
The science delusion is the belief that
science has already understood the
nature of reality in principle, leaving only the details
to be filled in. This is very widely believed in our
society. It's one of the reasons for the
dogmatism that all of us encounter, and
which is so annoying, but it's because people think they
already know the truth. They sincerely believe that,
and this is probably one of the most
widespread delusions in our society and
we've now exported it to the rest of the 
world. There's a conflict in the heart of
science between science as a method of
inquiry, about the testing of hypotheses,
looking at the evidence, finding out
what's really going on, open-minded,
subject to correction, and so forth. The
ideal of science which many people think
of as what science is, now it's what
science ought to be and I agree with
that ideal. The reality as many of us
have encountered through better
experience is rather different. For many
people science has become a belief
system, a world view. This is sometimes
called scientism where people take the
dogmas of science to be a kind of religious 
belief system, or quasi-religious belief system.
And it's this dogmatic belief system which I think is now
constricting and holding science back in a very serious
way. In almost every branch of science 
we see the law of diminishing returns. More
expensive research yields fewer and
fewer really new results. And I think the
reason for all that is this dogmatic
belief system. If science can be set free
from it, new experiments and new
possibilities open up in every area.
What I do in my book “Science Set Free”
is take the ten dogmas of institutional
science which are part of the scientific
worldview and turn these dogmas into
questions, treat them not as beliefs or
truths, but as hypotheses that can be
tested against the evidence. I then look
at them scientifically to see how well
they stack up when you take into account
the evidence. None of them do and in
every case new possibilities open up. Sounds would
become regenerated when we undergo this process.
I don't have time to discuss all ten dogmas today,
but what I'll do first is just say what they are.
First and foremost, Dogma One is the belief
that nature is mechanical, or machine-like.
This has been the foundational principle
of science since the beginning of
modern science in the 17th century.
Mechanistic Science is based on the
machine metaphor. Nature is a machine.
Stars are machines. Animals and plants
are machines. That's why you can 
have industrial agriculture, genetic
engineering, factory farming, and so on. And they're
just machines. And we're machines too. Lumbering robots,
in Richard Dawkins vivid phrase, with brains 
that are genetically programmed computers.
The second Dogma is: the total amount of
matter and energy is always the same,
except at the moment of the Big Bang when it
all appeared from nowhere. The third Dogma is
similar to that: the laws of nature are
fixed. The laws and constants of the
world are the same today as they were at
the moment of the Big Bang when they all
suddenly appeared like a kind of cosmic Napoleonic 
Code. As Terence McKenna used to say, modern
science is based on the principle: give
us one free miracle, and we'll explain
the rest. And the one free miracle is the
appearance of all the matter and energy
in the universe, and all the laws that 
govern it, from nothing in a single instant.
The fourth Dogma is that matter is unconscious.
The universe is made up of totally
unconscious matter. Fifth, nature is purposeless.
There are no purposes in nature and the evolutionary
process has no purpose or direction.
Sixth, biological inheritance is material.
It's genetic, in the genetic material DNA,
or possibly in epigenetic modifications
of the DNA which are also chemical, or in cytoplasmic
inheritance. But at any rate it's all material.
Seven, memories are stored as material traces
inside the brain. Everything you remember
is somewhere inside your head as a
stored memory, either in phosphorylated
proteins, modified synapses, or some
material form which has not yet been
fully identified. Although the details
are very vague, attempts to find these
traces have failed over and over again.
But nevertheless it's universally
believed within neuroscience that they're all inside
the brain. Dogma eight. The mind is inside the head.
Mental activity is brain activity. Your mind 
is nothing but what goes on in your brain.
Dogma nine follows from Dogma eight. 
Psychic phenomena are illusory. Things like
telepathy can't really happen, because
they would imply the mind can work at a
distance from the body, and it can't do
that because it's all inside the head.
And Dogma 10, mechanistic medicine is the
only kind that really works. Alternative
and complementary therapies may appear
to work, but that's only because people
would have got better anyway, or it's all
the placebo effect. But the real kind, the
only kind that really works is mechanistic medicine,
which is why in most parts of the world it's the only
kind taught in medical schools. It's the only kind
funded by government funding agencies and so on.
Well, these are the 10 beliefs which are
more or less the default belief system
of most scientists and most educated people today.
Wherever they are in the world, in India
or China or wherever, this is the belief system which
is predominant. Now, within science itself of course,
people at the leading edge of research
in many ways have moved beyond this
belief system. Research scientists are
not necessarily committed to this in
every detail, but they're usually only at
the frontier of one region. A physicist
might be at the frontiers of cosmology
and have gone beyond some of these
dogmas of physics, but they wouldn't
question the dogmas of psychology or
biology. Those would remain more or less
intact. So, there are various people who
question bits of it, but there's very
little that's been done to question the
whole thing. This is essentially the materialist
world view and it became the dominant view of
science in the 19th century. Science was as it were
hijacked by materialist philosophy, and since then
has been a wholly owned subsidiary of
materialism. There's no reason why
science has to be materialistic. It
wasn't materialist before the 19th
century, it was dualist as I'll say soon.
And I think we can go beyond that to a
new, more inclusive, more organic,
organismic paradigm for science.
What I'm going to do first is look at
the dogma that the total amount of
matter and energy is always the same This got built
into the foundations of science in the 17th century.
It was not brought about by incredibly
detailed observations using nanogram
balances and so forth. It came about for purely
philosophical or rather theological reasons.
The founding fathers of modern science were
all Christians who believed that the world
was a machine, that God was a machine
maker, an engineering mathematically-
minded God, who'd created the world machine.
And he'd started off the world machine in the first place
by creating the matter that's in it,
which he created in the form of atoms,
taking the idea from Greek atomism. And
these atoms by definition couldn't be
destroyed, they couldn't be broken up, so once God had
created them the total amount of atoms or matter must
automatically remain the same forever.
And God also endowed the universe with a
certain quantum of movement or force
which started it in motion. And
thereafter, because this God-given force
couldn't be changed by anything else, the
amount remained the same. So, the principles of
conservation of matter and energy were built into
science from the outset. Not on the basis of
detailed measurements. They've served as useful
accountancy principles ever since, but
they were formulated more rigorously in
the mid-19th century in the law of
conservation of matter and energy and in
the first law of thermodynamics.
So, it was assumed that that was the end
of the matter and that they were fixed
forever. And most people take that for
granted today. They've learned it in high
school and they never see any reason
to question it. This was the dogma of
science which I myself didn't question
until quite recently. I'd questioned all
the others but it was only when I was
writing this book that I thought I should look at this
one. I actually rather wanted it to turn out to be true
because I thought if I said that all ten
dogmas of science were false, it might
sound a bit biased, so I thought it'd be
quite nice if one of them held up and I
thought this was the best candidate. But when I
thought about it, it turned out to be a shambles.
First of all, where physicists are above
the law, they've found themselves
quite free to invent or hypothesize forms of matter
and energy which no one had ever thought of before.
One of them is of course dark matter.
Observations of galaxies and the way
that stars moved within them and also
the ways that galaxies interact with
each other, suggested that the galaxies,
if they were to be explained in terms of
gravitation, simply wouldn't work. The
whole thing simply didn't work. So, in
order to make it work they hypothesized
there was extra matter which you can't
see; hence the name dark matter that
accounted for all the phenomena of
galaxies and their interactions. Well, how
much dark matter was there? Well, simple.
Just invent the exact amount you need
to explain the observed phenomena. You
can titrate the amount of dark matter at will to explain
the phenomena you're trying to explain. If you find new
phenomena, peculiar bulges in galaxies or
something that one-size-fits-all dark
matter won't explain, then you add a bit
more where it's needed. The system works
perfectly and you can explain everything with complete
accuracy because you can change the amount at will.
The only trouble is no one knows what it
is and there's no independent evidence
for it. People have been speculating about
its nature ever since it was first postulated.
Having created all this extra matter in the universe,
then this meant there should be more gravitation.
Physicists expected in the 1990s that
the universal expansion from the Big
Bang would slow down. The universe would
stop expanding, then begin to contract
under the influence of all this
gravitational matter, until it ended in
tears in the reverse of a Big Bang known in the
trade as the Big Crunch. So, when in the late 1990s
people observed that the universe appeared to be
accelerating, because of red shifts in distant quasars
and galaxies, then there was the problem how
do you explain this acceleration? Well, the
answer was ready to hand: a new form of
energy no one had known about before
which caused the universe to expand. How
much is that, well just the right amount
to explain the facts. So, we now have dark
matter and dark energy as a huge amount of
the universe. They currently make up
about 96 percent of reality.
Look, physicists have invented something
like 20 times more energy and mass than
anyone had ever heard of till the 1980s.
And no one's said, oh you can't do that
it's defying the law of conservation of
matter and energy. And if you ask is all
this matter and energy conserved? Is the
total amount always the same? Well for
dark matter nobody knows. For dark energy
the most usual theory is that actually
the amount is increasing. As the universe
expands there's more dark energy. The
universe is now a perpetual motion machine.
So the idea it's all rigorously conserved doesn't
really make much sense in those terms.
Within quantum physics there’s also
Zero-point Energy, a form of energy
which is supposed to be there underlying
the world we live in, which is like waves on an
ocean of energy. And there's huge amounts of it. The
amount in a teaspoon would be enough
to power the United States for years.
Not surprisingly, some people claim that they
can tap this energy and have devices which tap
unconventional or unknown forms of
energy, including Zero-point Energy.
If you go online, you'll find there are
many people who claim to have above-
unity devices, machines that produce
more energy than you put into them.
Well, these are immediately banned from
regular science because they violate the
first of science's taboos established by
Galileo in the early 17th century, the
taboo against perpetual motion machines.
This taboo long predated the laws of
thermodynamics and it's one of the
most deep-seated taboos in science.
So, things like Cold Fusion, or above-
unity devices or free energy devices,
whether they're based on Zero-point
Energy or peculiar electromagnetic
effects, or parametric resonance, or the
various other theories that are used to
explain them, are totally beyond the pale. Nevertheless,
people claim they've got them and they exist.
If they do exist of course it would totally transform
the world economy and the world energy situation.
So, do they really work? Well, right now it's very,
very hard to find out because there's claims that may
or may not be substantiated. There's 
a universal rejection within orthodox
science of this; a few people within the
Department of Defense, a few people who
are kind of maverick investors are
interested in this. The Japanese
government is interested, but basically they're
not part of the normal discourse of science.
I myself think the best way forward here
would be to have a prize, say a million
dollar prize for the best above-unity
device. And those who claim to have them,
could then have them tested. This is 
not an attempt to debunk them, it's an
attempt to see what really works. They'd
be tested under fair, agreed conditions.
And if any of them do indeed produce
more energy than is put into them and
that which can't be explained in terms of any known energy
source, they'd win the prize. If several do, then the
best one would win the prize. I think this would be
the best way of bringing this whole thing out into the
open and finding out what's really 
going on. And I think that
commercial betting companies could open
a book on this as well and people could
bet on whether the prize will be awarded.
Then all those skeptics who say it's
impossible could put their money where
their mouth is and bet a million dollars
that no one would win the prize. How much
would they actually be prepared to bet?
That would be a very interesting
question. I'd be prepared to bet at least
a thousand dollars that someone would 
win it. So, I think this would put the thing
totally into the public domain. The media
would love it, everyone would be
discussing it, and if someone won it, I
think it would completely change the
climate. I think investors would get
interested, governments, how it works and
the situation could move on. Right now we've
been at a stalemate for years with these things.
It turns out that in biology the whole
question of energy conservation is much,
much more questionable than most people
assume. We all assume that the total
amount of energy that we produce can be
explained by the food we take in and
this was assumed in the 1850s by Hermann
Von Helmholtz who was eager to prove
that living organisms were nothing but machines.
He didn't prove it, he assumed it and
since then it's been a basic dogma of biology.
It wasn't tested in humans until 1899 by
two American researchers called Atwater
and Benedict and they were determined to
prove that we're nothing but machines.
They were mechanists and they started
from the assumption this was true and
they did the experiments not to find out
if it was true or not, but as they put it,
to demonstrate it in order to further
the cause of science. They had people in
calorimeters and measured all the heat
produced, the carbon dioxide, the oxygen
taken in, feces, urine, food consumed and
so on, did a complete energy balance
sheet. When they did it, the results came
out wrong. So, they changed the correction
factors for the value of food until they
got the expected result, and this then became built
into the foundations of biology as a certain fact.
It wasn't re-examined until an
independent-minded American nutritionist,
Paul Webb, redid their experiments in the
1970s. He found huge discrepancies. People
who were overweight, overeating and doing
very little exercise seemed to have 25
percent or so of the energy just vanish.
People who are not eating and doing
exercise gained about 25 percent. Too
much energy. Where was it coming from?
Nobody knows. He called it X, the
unexplained amount of energy that could
either disappear or appear. He then
re-examined Atwater and Benedict's
results and found that they'd got similar
discrepancies, but they'd made sure
there were just as many people who had
too much and too little so that, when
they averaged them, it canceled out to give the
expected result. There are people who claim there are
other forms of energy: Chi, Prana, vital
energies, and so on. These are usually
treated as metaphoric, but they may be
much more literal than we usually think.
And this is a huge unexplored area. It's
not as if nutrition science is the most
successful branch of modern biology.
And I think that this is something which
bears re-examination. In my book, 
I suggest several quite radical
experiments that could be done quite
simply and cheaply, to look at this.
Well, now let me turn briefly to the idea that
the laws and constants of nature are fixed.
The idea that the laws are fixed is a
hangover from Greek philosophy. Plato and
Pythagoras thought that the world was
governed by mathematical principles
beyond space and time, eternal ideas. In
the 17th century people thought these
were ideas in the mind of a mathematical
God and that God had these mathematical
ideas and that scientists were actually
finding out about the mind of God by
finding out the math of nature. People
thought Newton's laws of gravitation
were not just human hypotheses, mere
guessses or mere working principles. They
thought this was a direct insight into
the divine mind, superior to that of
religion, much more precise, much less
disputable. And this was really the basis
for enlightenment ideology of science and reason.
They thought science and reason transcended
religion in giving a direct insight into the divine
nature. Now, you don't hear much about that today,
but there's still the strong enlightenment
tradition and the idea of the laws of nature
are fixed is a hangover from that point of view.
But in a radically evolutionary universe
which the Big Bang postulates, why
shouldn't the laws of nature themselves
evolve? In fact, why should there be laws
at all? Law is a very human metaphor, only
humans have laws and only civilized 
societies. Why should we project this
anthropocentric metaphor onto the whole of 
nature? I myself think that the idea of habits
of nature makes much better sense.
This is the basis of my own idea of
morphic resonance which is a memory
principle in nature, but I'm not the
first to propose habits. The American
philosopher C.S. Purse, at the beginning
of the 20th century suggested that in an
evolutionary universe the regularities
could be thought of as evolving habits.
I think it's a much better way to
think of it and it's a testable hypothesis.
The theory of morphic resonance predicts
for example that if you crystallize a new 
chemical compound for the first time,
it may be very difficult to crystallize
because it hasn't yet got a habit to
crystallize with a particular lattice 
structure. But if you crystallize it again
somewhere else, there'll be a resonance
from the first crystals across space and
time - morphic resonance - that will make it
easier to crystallize. And the third time
it'll be easier still because of resonance from the first
and the second crystals. It'll get easier and easier to
crystallize all around the world. There's a lot of
evidence that that really happens. Chemists explain it by
saying that fragments of previous crystals
must have been wafted around the world as dust
particles. But I'm predicting the same will happen
even if you filtered dust particles out of the air.
The theory also predicts that if you
train an animal, say rats, to learn a new
trick. If you train rats in Albuquerque
to learn a new trick, then all over the
world rats in New York and London
and Tokyo should learn the same trick
quicker, just because the rats have
learned it here. Surprisingly there's
already evidence from experiments, a
long series of experiments with rats
done at Harvard, at the University of
Edinburgh at the University of Melbourne in
Australia that this actually happens. The
same applies to people. It should be
getting easier to learn things
that others have already learned.
Well, I'm not going to go into detail on
this because this is the theme of my own
theory of morphic resonance. And my
purpose in this lecture and in my book
is not really so much to push my own
ideas, as to show how questionable the
standard ones are, and how much the
field is open for different answers.
But I'll turn just briefly to the
constants of nature because this affects
the Electric Universe, or indeed any model of
the universe. It's assumed that the constants of
nature are constant. The fundamental
constants like Newton's gravitational
constant, big G, or the speed of light c.
Well, I began to wonder whether they
really were constant, when I got into the Habit
view of nature. And so I tried to find out what the
actual values were. I started off by
getting handbooks of physical constants
and looking at old editions. Most people
only look at the latest edition and they
usually throw the old ones away. But
in the patent office library in London
I found they kept them all. And so, 
I got them all out of the reserve stock
at 10-year intervals. They wheeled
in a trolley of handbooks of physical
constants, dusting them off and I looked
through these things to see how they
changed. To my amazement I found that 
the speed of light dropped by 20 kilometers
per second between 1928 and 1945. I then
looked up the data in more detail and
found that all over the world people
have been getting this much lower figure
with very small error bars. The original
thing was up there with little error
bars and it goes down much lower with 
little error bars. It wasn't as if the error
bars were 20 kilometers per second. No they were
point/decimal places of kilometers per second.
I checked in the primary literature
and found this indeed seemed to be the
case and then they went up again after 1945.
I couldn't understand what was going on
so I asked the head of the Metrology
Department (metrologists are people
who measure constants) at the British
National Physical Laboratory if I could
go and see him and I went to visit him.
He was very friendly and I said to him
Dr. Petley, I'd like to know how you
explain this drop in the speed of light
between 1928 and 1945. And he said, 
“Oh dear”. I said “...What”? He said,
”You've uncovered one of the most embarrassing
incidents in the history of our country.”
So, I said, “Well, could it mean that the
speed of light really did drop, at least
as measured on Earth during that period?”
He said, “Of course not,” and I said, “Why not?”
He said, “Because it's a constant.”
So, I said, “Well then, I can't see any
other explanation than that people all
around the world were sort of fudging
their results to get what they thought
everyone else would expect them to get,
and then discarding outliers and stuff and
coming up with these very narrow error bars
that agreed with everyone else. And so, it
then it must have been produced by some
kind of fudging process”. He said, 
“We don't like to use the word ‘fudge’.
So I said, “What do you prefer?” He said,
“We prefer to call it intellectual phase locking.”
So, I said to him, “Well, if it was happening
then, how do we know it's not happening now?”
He said, “Oh, we know it's not happening
now” and I said, “Why?” “He said, because we
fixed the speed of light by definition in
1972.” So I said, “Well, it might still vary.”
And he leaned back, looking very smug and
said, “Well, if it did, no one would ever find
out, because we've defined the 
meter in terms of the speed of light,
so the units would vary with it.” So,
I said “Well okay, you fixed that one,
but what about the gravitational constant, that's 
been varying wildly and even actually in the last
three or four years, it's varied by more than 1.3
percent as measured in different Laboratories. The usual
assumption is this is just error,
it's experimental error, it's hard to
measure, its error, so labs all over the
world get quite different results. And
the International Committee on Metrology
fixes the results every few years by
averaging ones from different Labs
weigting ones they think are more
reliable, discarding ones they think are
not. And indeed, when I left Dr. Petley,
thanking him for his time, he reached
down to a cardboard box beside his desk,
full of pamphlets and said, “By the way,
these have just come from the printers.
You might like one.” He handed me this pamphlet,
the latest values of the physical constants. so, I
looked at these data from different labs 
on G, Big G. And the question that I
was wondering, there's all these big
errors, could it be that they're actually
changing together in different labs, as
the earth rotates around the Sun, as it
rotates during the day, and as the whole solar system
moves through different astronomical environments.
To find that out, one would look at
the day-by-day measurements from
different labs and see if the errors,
or so-called errors, are correlated.
I've spent more than 10 years trying to
persuade metrologists to do this. And
they simply will not, because they say
it's a constant, so there's no point
looking for variations. But I say, you've
got these huge differences and they say
oh they're just errors it's hard to
measure but they simply won't do it. An
exercise in open science would be if they put their
raw data with the dates online. And then anyone
could try and look for patterns, and
there could be a website where they're
discussed. It would cost nothing, and 
we might find something out. We'll
find out nothing by pretending it's fixed.
There are in fact already papers that
suggest diurnal variations in accordance
with the sidereal day. A group
at MIT recently found a daily variation,
and some evidence of annual variations.
But there may be other, wilder
fluctuations that happen in concert. I
myself think the so-called physical
constants may vary from time to time and
possibly even chaotically within certain
limits. I think the day may come when
in scientific periodicals like Nature
there’ll be a page, a bit like the stock
market reports. You know this week's value of the
constants. This week the G was slightly up; the
charge on the electron held steady;
there was a drop in the fine structure
constant, you know and if that were
the case then it would give varying
qualities of time when different things
could happen. The idea they're all
rigidly fixed is a hangover from an old platonic point
way of thinking. So there, right in the heart of physics,
is I think a really open and interesting 
question. The key revolution in the Scientific
Revolution of the 17th century was the
shift from an organic view of nature to
a machine view of nature. It was a
revolution because it rejected what
people thought before. And what people
thought before was a philosophy of
nature taught in the medieval
universities of Europe based on
Aristotle as refined by Saint Thomas Aquinas
in the 12th century. And it was a very
sophisticated philosophy of nature.
According to Aristotle and Saint Thomas
all living beings had souls and the
soul of a living being was not some
metaphysical thing to do with life after
death, it was what gave it its form, its
structure. The body was in the soul, the
soul was not in the body. And the soul
gave each kind of plant its form, its
leaves, its flowers, its roots, its shape.
And the soul worked by attraction. As
the tree grew, it was attracted towards
the mature form by the soul of the plant. It was
like the form. In addition, animals had, as well as
the vegetative soul that shaped their
embryos and growth of the body and
maintained its health, there was the
animal soul which was concerned with
instinct, sensations and movements. And of course the
word animal comes from the Latin word for soul, anima.
Human beings had a vegetative soul that
shaped the body, an animal soul that gave
us our animal nature, our senses and
instincts and so on, are very similar to
those of animals. But in addition, the
rational or intellectual soul to do with
reason, language, the mind, consciousness.
But nobody thought that the human mind
was totally separate from the rest of
nature. It was embedded in a psychic
system which connected us to animals and
plants. And the whole world was alive, the
earth was alive, the planets were alive.
We still call them by the names of the
Roman gods and goddesses, and the stars
were alive. They were intelligent beings.
Each star in the sky as people looked up,
it was filled with an intelligence. One
of the levels of angels, the dominations,
virtues and powers, the third three
levels of angels in the hierarchy of the
nine-fold hierarchy of angels were the
spirits or intelligences of the stars. So
when a medieval person looked at the sky,
they looked at a living universe filled with the presence
of God. Every star was a living intelligent being.
Now, the mechanistic revolution replaced
that with the idea that everything's a
machine. A machine is a bit like an
organism, except it no longer has its own
design or purpose. Those are put into the
machine from the human designer or maker.
And this metaphor meant God was the intelligent
designer of the machinery and through divine
intervention that the whole world
had been made in the first place.
The organic view of the Middle Ages
was really a form of Christian animism.
Plants and animals had their own
purposes, their own desires, the soul gave
them their motivation and their goal. The
whole of nature had a purpose. It was
striving towards the being of God,
striving towards perfection. God was the
prime mover of the universe not by pushing it from
behind, but by attracting it from the future.
That view was destroyed and replaced by
a machine view. The heavens became dead
matter, the solar system became a
mechanical clockwork-like system. Animals
and plants became mere machines with no
feelings so it was all right to vivisect
them or treat them appallingly in
factory farms. The only thing that was
left that wasn't mechanical in the world was the human
rational mind, that was the only thing left, except
for angels and God which were immaterial spirits like
the human mind. This was Descartes’ view and it created
an extreme dualism of body and soul, matter 
and spirit. So for Descartes, the whole world was
mechanical, made of unconscious matter.
Consciousness existed only in humans,
angels and God, and were separate from the rest of
nature by being immaterial, not in space and time.
This created a radical dualism between
people and animals, mind and body, and
between religion and science because science got
the realm of spirit: human minds, angels and God.
Religion got that and science got the whole of the
physical universe, including the stars and the heavens,
which now became dead, unconscious and inanimate.
Well that was the revolution, and matter in
this view was defined as unconscious. They did experiments
accurate to many places of decimals. It was simply
defined as unconscious by Descartes
and it’s remained so ever since in the
view of scientists, without further 
discussion. Now Cartesian dualism was
unsatisfactory for many people. By the
19th century a lot of people didn't want
to have two fundamental principles. They thought
two was too many. They wanted to have just one.
And dualism, this view that it's too many
meant that they tried to collapse it into one
of these two principles. The idealist
said everything is consciousness. Matter is
just a kind of dulled-down spirit or consciousness,
or mind. But the more popular view was the
materialist view. Everything's matter,
there's no such thing as this mysterious
non-material spirit of the human mind,
and certainly not angels and God. So, at
one stroke the materialists wiped out
angels and God and said the human mind
is nothing but the activity of the brain.
They collapsed it down in into the brain.
And that is the view that took over
science by the late 19th century and
it's been the standard paradigm ever since.
Of course, it creates appalling problems and one of
them is that it makes human
consciousness inexplicable. If matter is
unconscious, how come we are conscious?
Well, some philosophers of mind,
materialists philosophers, say well
there's a simple solution to that. We're
not conscious, the mind is just an
illusion, we're just machines. That's
called ‘eliminative materialism’ and in the 
United States throughout much of the
20th century the official doctrine of
academic psychology was behaviorism,
which denied the existence of
consciousness. It said, the only thing you
can measure objectively and scientifically are muscular
movements and glandular secretions and that's what
scientific psychology should study,
ignoring the folk belief in consciousness.
Others take the view that consciousness
is nothing but an epi-phenomenon, a bit
like a shadow of the activity of the brain that
does nothing. And others take the view that
consciousness is an illusion produced by
the brain to make us feel good and get
out of bed in the morning, because it doesn't
actually do anything. None of these views say that
consciousness does anything. We don't
have free will, it doesn't actually do
anything useful, it might just well not
be there, we might just as well be
zombies or robots and it's irrelevant to
science because it doesn't really exist.
The trouble is that this isn't a very
convincing view, even for materialists. I
mean they'll argue it at work, but as
soon as they get home in the evening
they don't treat their spouses, their
children and their dogs as if they're
inanimate machines, and they themselves
don't believe that they're materialist
because their brain makes them believe it, they'd like
to think they're materialists because they believe in
science, reason and evidence.
And yet their entire philosophical
position undermines their belief in materialism.
It's incoherent. That doesn't stop it
being the dominant philosophy in 
all our universities and in almost all
philosophy departments, it's the dominant 
view. But it's so incoherent and so difficult
to square with observable facts, that
within consciousness studies this is now
very, very much disputed. There's been 
a breaking away from materialism by
leading philosophers. One of the first
breakaways was Galen Strawson, a British
philosopher who lives in America, who
wrote a key paper a few years ago called
”Does Materialism Imply Pan-psychism”, to which he
answered yes. Pan-psychism is the idea that there's
a kind of mental aspect to all kinds of nature,
even electrons. And although he didn't give any
details, he said this was the only coherent way we
could explain the emergence of consciousness in humans.
Because if you try and conjure it out of
totally unconscious matter, it's really
just reinventing dualism on a kind of evolutionary 
basis. More interestingly and I think more
coherently, the American philosopher
Thomas Nagel wrote a book a few months
ago which I think is a breakthrough in
modern philosophy. Nagel is a leading
philosopher of mind in New York, and 
his book is called “Mind and Cosmos -
why the materialist near-Darwinian 
conception of nature is almost certainly false”
His book was hated by the materialist militant
atheist crowd. He was denounced as going off the
rails and that kind of thing, but it's a
deeply thoughtful and fascinating book.
But of course pan-psychism is not new as
a philosophy. It's what people thought in
the Middle Ages basically and in the
17th century, soon after Descartes, in the
next generation of philosophers people
were already exploring this possibility.
One of them was Leibniz and Leibniz
argued that the universe is made up of
monads, units of organization including
us, but also including atoms and that
every monad, as well as having a body,
has a mind and each monad reflects the
universe from its own point of view. So every monad has
a completely different point of view because it's in a
different place, like everyone in this
room has a different point of view.
Because we're all in different places, we
can't all be in the same place at the
same time because bodies are impenetrable.
So, that was one pan-psychist’s view.
Another was Spinoza who said that the
whole of nature is the body of God and
it has a consciousness or mind (the whole of nature),
it's God or nature it was a kind of pantheistic view.
The most important philosopher in this tradition
in the 20th century was Alfred North Whitehead,
and Whitehead argued that all physical systems
that are self-organizing have a mental aspect.
Self-organizing is a key here. This
doesn't apply to chairs, tables motorcars
and so on. They're not organized,
they're put together by an external
force – humans. But things that organize
themselves include atoms, molecules crystals,
cells, animals, plants, ecosystems, planets
solar systems and galaxies. Those are
self-organizing systems and Whitehead
argued that all self-organizing systems
are processes in time. There's no such thing as enduring
matter like little billiard balls. He was the first
philosopher to appreciate the importance of quantum
theory. And what quantum theory shows is that
even electrons are waves. They're wave-like
patterns of activity, they're processes, not things.
And if they're processes, they take time. You can't have
a wave at an instant. That's the fundamental reason for
quantum uncertainty. You can't have an
instantaneous wave at an exact moment of
time because a wave takes time. That 
means a wave has a future pole and
a past pole, it's a process. And this
philosophy is called process philosophy.
And so, even an electron has a future and 
a past pole. And Whitehead's most original
contribution, in my view, was the way he
understood the relation of mind and body.
Usually people think of it in terms of
spatial metaphors. The mind is the inner
life, the body is the outer world, or the
outer part. It's the inner and outer.
He thought the relationship was a
temporal relationship. The mind is the
future pole, the body's the past pole.
In an electron the Schrodinger wave
equation describes all the possible
things that electron could do. Those
possibilities coexist. They're not
physical, material, measurable realities,
because they're possibilities. It’s a
different kind of thing. But as soon as
the electron interacts with something or
is measured, then these possibilities
collapse down to one physical observable
fact. That's now in the past. The physical
pole is in the past and now a whole new realm of
possibilities develop. The same with our conscious minds.
They're filled with coexisting possibilities. Our 
minds are realms of possibility. Mental reality is
a realm of possibility, about potential
futures, virtual futures, things we could
do. And our minds are involved in
choosing among these possibilities. As
soon as we choose to do something and do
it, it becomes an observable physical
fact, objectively measurable. But before
that, it's a possibility and this gives a
view of causation, a two-fold form of causation. The
possibility-mental causation working from virtual futures
towards the past and regular-physical
causation working from the past towards
the future and they overlap in the present.
I think this is the best way of thinking
of the relation of mind and body, the
most fruitful. It has many implications
and I don't have time to go into them for
now, at this moment. What I do want to do
is just explore what this pan-psychist
view might mean when we look at big
things. Most discussions of it are about
atoms and electrons, but since we're here
at the Electric Universe conference, what 
about thinking about the Sun and the galaxy.
The Sun is a self-organizing system. Indeed the whole
solar system is a self-organizing system. It's not put
together in a factory, it organizes itself and
the entire galaxy is a self-organizing system.
From that point of view, they're
organisms and from Whitehead's point of
view that would mean they would have a
mental pole which did would be to do
with potential futures, and a physical
pole depending on the decisions or
choices made among those possible futures.
What we observe is the physical pole.
But they have a great deal of indeterminate activity
going on in them, particularly electrical activity.
Electromagnetic activity, we know there's
no dispute that the Sun is highly active
electromagnetically, however one interprets the
source of its energy, everybody agrees that highly
complex electromagnetic patterns are going 
on there. People also think that the interface
between our brains and our minds are the complex
electromagnetic patterns going on inside our brains.
So, what if these electrical patterns in the Sun are an
interface with the Sun's mind? What if the Sun thinks?
Now, as soon as you raise that question you realize this
is utterly taboo subject. You're not allowed to ask that
question. Matter is unconscious. Since the 17th century,
materialists have assumed and dualists had assumed that
matter is unconscious. It's simply off- limits.
However, all traditional cultures have
treated the Sun as alive and indeed the planets and
the stars. Children when they draw the Sun draw it
with a smiley face. And so, this in itself is
taken as evidence against the fact that the Sun
can be alive or conscious, because if
children see it that way, it shows it's a
primitive or childish way of looking at
things. And the fact that people all over
the world say it that way until science
comes along again proves it's primitive
and superstitious. We've risen above it.
I don't think we've risen above it at all.
I think we sunk below it to a level of
dogmatism which simply closes off a
whole area of questions for no reason other than the fact
that a French philosopher in the 17th century chose to
divide up the world in such a way that
he defined matter as unconscious. It's
become a habit of thought with us. About
ten years ago, with a few other people I organized
a small Invitational conference in England
held at Overby at the summer solstice in the
countryside called, “Is the Sun conscious?” We spent
several days discussing the consciousness of the Sun.
Well, of course none of us could really prove
the Sun was conscious, and you might say,
well, if it's conscious, prove it. Well, my
answer to that is, well you can't prove
it's unconscious. It's actually an open
question, but once we got beyond
discussing what it might mean, we then
got onto the question of if the Sun does
think what does it think about? Well, 
one obvious thing would be its body,
which is the solar system right out to the 
heliopause. And it knows what's going
on in the solar system. It's pervaded 
by the Sun's electromagnetic field.
Everything in this room is within the
Sun's electromagnetic field. The
electromagnetic activity in your brain
is within the Sun's electromagnetic
field. So, the Sun in a sense, just through
the electromagnetic field alone, would be
able to sense what's going on in the
entire solar system and beyond.
Its decisions might involve when to send out
coronal mass ejections, the timing of solar
flares, whether to point them towards
the earth or not. You know there's all
sorts of things, and also the variable cycles of
the Sun may be reflections of its psychic activity.
So part of its concern may be with its body.
Part of it may also be with its peer
group, the other stars and the
galaxy as a whole you see may have a
mind. I'd love that talk yesterday by Michael
Claridge where he conjured out this wonderful image of
variable currents moving through the arms of the
galaxy with more activity in some places than others,
changing from time to time, like MRI
scans of the brain change when you're
thinking about one thing or about another 
thing. The entire galaxy is a living organism.
with a mind as well as a body. The
Electric Universe aspect of this is the
perfect interface between the physical activity
of the galaxy and its possible mental life.
Of course, if we start thinking and
say, why stop at galaxies, you've got
galactic clusters and then you've got
the entire universe. What if there's a
cosmic mind? Well, this is by no means a
new idea, but I think that science itself
can open up something. We're not talking
now about supernaturalism, or blind faith.
We're talking about a way of thinking
about nature which gives us an organic
coherent view of nature and opens
up completely new forms of dialogue
with spiritual and religious traditions.
I want to end by just reflecting for a
few moments on the location of our own 
minds. The normal view is that the activity of
the brain is inside the head. But this leaves a
great many things unexplained, including vision.
What's going on when you see something?
What's going on when you see me now?
Well, light moves from me through the
electromagnetic field, enters the eyes,
inverted images on the retinas, changes
in the cone cells, impulses up the optic
nerves, and changes in various regions
of the brain which can be illuminated
through brain scanning. We know more about 
them than ever before. Does this explain vision?
Well, no, it just describes changes in the 
brain. The first thing about vision that isn't
explained is the fact you're conscious
of what you see. That's an example of the
’hard problem’ in consciousness studies or
philosophy of mind. The very existence of
consciousness is unexplained. But 
then is the question of where are
the images you're seeing? You're seeing 
a three-dimensional colored world.
The conventional view is that all that's
inside your brain. You've got a
virtual reality display somewhere inside
your head, which includes me and the rest
of this room and everybody else here.
It's all in your head. If you look at the
sky at night, or in the day, the sky
you're seeing is inside your head.
A key paper recently in one of the
consciousness journals by a philosopher
of mind was called, “Is your skull beyond the
sky?” And the author of the article answered,
Yes. He's a materialist, so he said the
minds and the brain, everything you
experience, is inside your head. Your
skull is beyond the sky. This is only a
virtual skull, but your real skull is
beyond the sky. Everything you're
experiencing is inside your head. Your whole
conscious, subjective life is inside your head.
I propose a much simpler view which takes into account
our indirect experiences. So simple, it's hard to grasp,
and that's that your image of things is
in your mind, but not inside your head.
Your image of me is exactly where it
seems to me to be, outside your head where
I'm standing. Visions are two-way processes.
You project out images which coincide
normally with what you're looking at. This means 
that there's a kind of outward movement of
the mind. The mind is not confined to the
inside of the head. It's extended out
through attention and intention,
and that means we should be able to
affect things just by looking at them.
And that means, for example, that if I look
at you from behind, and you don't know
I'm there, you might be able to feel my
gaze. Now could that possibly be true?
Well, as soon as you ask that question,
you realize it's a common experience.
More than 90 percent of people have
experienced being stared at from behind.
You turn around, there's someone looking
at you or, staring at someone and making them 
turn around. There was an almost complete taboo on
this in science until the 1980s because it simply ought
not to happen. So, skeptics dismissed it. It doesn't
happen, it's an illusion, it's just folk
belief, superstition, it's coincidence,
selective memory. Experiments however,
show that it does seem to happen. There's
now a lot of experimental evidence,
people can really tell when they're
being looked at from behind that can't
be explained just in terms of signs or
smells. It works through glass, it works through
one-way mirrors, even works through CCTV.
Now, this means that our minds reach out to touch what
we're looking at. And I just want to leave you with this
thought, as when we're talking about the
extended mind. When we look at the stars,
it means that our minds from this point
of view are reaching out over literally
astronomical distances, contacting those stars.
Now the question then arises. The light
takes, say ten light years to get from a
star to our mind when we project out our
image of the star, is it just stretching
out in time and reaching the star ten
light years after it was emitted? Or is
our conscious mind working backwards in
time and contacting it ten light years in the
 past? I think it's contacting it when the
light was emitted ten light years in the
past. I think our minds are stretching
out in time as well as space and I think our
conscious minds work backwards in time as it were.
So, this means that when we look at the
universe, the Electric Universe, the stars,
the planets, not only may we be looking
at a living organism, the whole universe
is a living organism with the galaxies and the solar
systems within it as living organisms. Our minds are
stretching out to contact it. It's not
just something inside our heads of these
ideas when we look at the stars directly
or indirectly through telescopes, our
minds are reaching out into the cosmos
and may be interacting with it in ways
we can barely begin to imagine. Not just
with potential Little Green Men on other
planets, but with the stars themselves, with the
galaxy itself. So, I think that the Electric Universe
which gives us an organic view of
galaxies and solar systems as organisms
held together by electric activities and
plasma is completely consistent with the
emerging view of nature, the
post-mechanistic view of nature, as the
universe as a living organism, made up of
many levels of organism within it, each
organism containing smaller ones. The
galaxies contain solar systems. They
contain planets, ecosystems, species,
social groups. Organisms contain organs
cells, molecules, crystals. A living
universe with habits evolving in time
and one of which we're living parts. I
think is a few much more consistent
with our experience of nature, a much
healthier view of nature, one that breaks
down that artificial division between
mind and body, humans and nature, which
the mechanistic theory gives us and
contacts us with the traditional wisdom
of all traditional societies which have
all seen the universe as alive and
organic. And I think we're rediscovering
that at a higher turn of the spiral.
I think as we move beyond the dogmas of materialism,
science can be set free in almost every area.
In medicine, in astronomy, in cosmology,
in biology, in psychology, in chemistry, in
our understanding of evolution. So, I think, instead 
of knowing almost everything which is the common
assumption, we know very little indeed.
And the dogmatism we all encounter comes
from a belief system, a worldview which
has long outlived its usefulness. It long
passed its ‘sell by date’ and as we move on from
it, science will be set free in all sorts of ways.
And I think we'll see a scientific renaissance,
and I think this gathering is part of it. Thank You.

Hi, this is Andy Hall with Space News.
I'm presenting part nine of my series
Eye of the Storm, where we look at
electrical scarring on the Colorado Plateau.
In the past few chapters of Eye of the
Storm, we looked at surface conductive
discharge in the landforms it creates.
Ground-to-ground surface conductive
discharges formed river channels, fractured 
the land with arc blasts, built mountains,
ripped them apart, and induced electric
winds that competed in a global plasma
storm on our ancient planet. We've 
discussed how surface conductive
discharges match the description of 
dragons in myth; how they must be
discharges from an alternating current,
superimposed with the direct current
bias that forces its path across
Earth's surface electric field, blasting
its way in fits and starts, as resonant
frequencies built and relaxed,
bifurcating the current reactive power 
surges. The electric field is from a buildup of
charge on continental surfaces, due to
capacitance in the continental plates.
We've discussed how such discharges
emanate from beneath Earth's crust
through a continental fringing field.
Capacitance dictates there must also be
charge built on the opposite side of a plate,
which creates that potential difference.
This doesn't mean one side of the continental
plate is all positive and one side negative.
Ionization of native materials generates
plasma, which by definition is a mixture of
positive and negative charge; but plasma
self-organizes, producing regions of high intensity
positive or negative bias,
surrounded by shells of weaker plasmas.
Coherent structures evolve, as waves of
energy pass through at varying frequency,
forming patterns of compression and
rarefaction in the fashion that sonic
vibrations produce cymatics. Potentials
oscillate between regions of high intensity,
sometimes spiking to extreme levels from
harmonic feedback and constructive interference
in the manner of circuits, commonly 
referred to as RLC circuits in electronics.
It's the spiky surges that send sparks 
flying. We will now discuss the underbelly of
North America from where these sparks originated
and what we can infer about its features.
In keeping with the ionic storm 
protocol, we'll use Earth's geology,
the planet Jupiter and the fractal self-
similarities of charge diffusion as our living
laboratory for evidence. As 
discussed in the previous chapters,
river channels align with faults that are
cracks in the earth caused by the intense
heat, pressure, and charge depletion of an
arc blast from surface-conductive discharges.
They are literally the dragon's footprint;
but not all dragon prints result in
river channels. In some places, surface-
conductive discharges created faults that were
later buried, or somehow isolated from
the watershed, so no river resulted.
The San Andreas Fault is one such beast.
It was created in the same discharge
event that created the Colorado River.
A resonant-frequency reactive discharge
sent a filament of induced current
northwest, while the mainline current of
the Colorado filament turned 90 degrees
east to the Colorado plateau. This
filament is the San Andreas Fault system,
extending from the Gulf of California
along the western fringe of the
continent, to the Juan de Fuca plate.
The fault follows precisely a portion
of continental plate boundaries,
surrounding the Pacific known as the Ring of Fire.
What this means is that the San Andreas
Fault is the result of a surface-conductive
branch filament of the Colorado discharge,
induced along the plate boundary.
This branch formed a parallel circuit
with the Colorado River branch,
thus forming a parallel RLC circuit.
The parallel RLC circuit has a
characteristic ability to amplify
frequency, to the point of producing
resonant frequency reactive power discharges,
which is what we see along the Colorado River.
Not all dragons are necessarily parallel
circuits. So the Colorado San Andreas
system has some exceptional features
and may be unique, at least on Earth. The fact
that the San Andreas is a filament of current
discharging along this path, can be demonstrated
by looking at a real-life dragon in action.
Of course, this means looking to Jupiter,
where a similar circuit is in action
right now. Capacitance forces a mere
response to subsurface charge
accumulation on the continental surface
and in the atmosphere. So, the landscape
and atmosphere reflect the ground currents.
This image of a long oval storm system
on Jupiter has been presented before,
in chapter 7 as an analog for the storm
that created the san Joaquin Valley in
California, and its ring of mountains,
including the Sierra Nevada range. The red 
line traces the San Andreas Fault analog
that exists beneath Jupiter's clouds in the
same geometry. It rides next to long, thin, dark
filaments making French curves in the clouds.
These dark filaments are where low-level winds dive
beneath higher shelf clouds, to feed the jet stream
that follows the discharge, creating the fault.
Where it meets the branching Garlock Fault,
it created a triangle of Venturi winds.
Similar faults, or currents, are embedded in the
Sierra Range where you can see dark filaments in the
cloud. In other words, you're seeing a dragon from
above, the jet stream being a charged plasma wind
generated by induction along the path of the ground
current, which takes an identical path through
the storm system that the San Andreas does,
due to the fractal symmetry of charge diffusion
in similar circuits. Two 
similar circuits will create
similar patterns of charge 
diffusion; never exact, but
similar, like fingerprints and snowflakes.
Both circuits create paths of current
with capacitance and inductance that
form self-similar diffusion patterns in
the form of weather and discharge. The difference
in size between Earth and Jupiter doesn't matter.
The processes are all scalable, and 
the difference in chemistry matters
little, because the patterns are formed by charge
diffusion, which is regulated by the circuit.
The circuit dictates the plasma behavior
and arranges the chemistry to suit.
One could say the circuit creates itself, like
Escher's hand that draws a hand that draws itself.
That's a big insight, by the 
way. I hope you noticed.
As far as Jupiter is concerned, what 
this means is there are crustal ground
currents on Jupiter that form
circuits geometrically similar to
certain ground currents on Earth.
We don't have any direct evidence for
what constitutes ground on Jupiter,
but the evidence that ground currents
are there, is in the shape and actions of the 
clouds. Capacitance between ground and
atmosphere dictates the presence of ground
currents, producing self-similar storms in
feedback with currents in the atmosphere. Why
Earth and Jupiter should have geometrically similar
electrical circuits within their 
crusts, may seem a ridiculous
coincidence, if you accept the
consensus view on planetary formation.
So don't. Planets are formed as drops and
bubbles, spit out at bigger planets or stars.
Drops and bubbles are fractal entities shaped
by electrical bonding, surface tension that is.
Or as I like to say, spherical capacitance.
It should be no surprise that complex
fractal bubbles will also have
complex fractal surface features.
Fractals, being fractal, self-similar that is,
and planets everywhere being drops and bubbles,
they should all display similar features.
But you will not see the similarities, if
you categorize and analyze them
as solid or gaseous structures,
or as thermodynamic or chemical entities, or as
gravitational bodies caused by wiggly space-time.
They only make sense if you analyze them as
circuits. Then it not only makes sense, it yields
real useful knowledge, to see Earth and
Jupiter with nearly exact fractal symmetries.
The presence of the San Andreas Fault also
betrays that the plate boundary hides a telluric,
or subsurface current, formed by 
charge accumulation beneath the plate
in the fringing field along the plate's edge.
We'll now look at the evidence for this
subsurface current. We can't see what's beneath
the crust, but we can make some assumptions,
based on surface features.
We know subsurface currents
must generate heat, given 
resistance in the ground. So, we cannot
expect to find volcanoes and seismic activities
concentrated on these currents. And so we do.
Charge collapses within and beneath the
continental plates, because they present
a sheet of dielectric matter to
energy flowing in and out of the earth.
As charge connects beneath the plates,
it migrates and concentrates at the plate
boundaries. The fringing field at
the plate boundary is the reason.
The transition from thick continental plate to
thinner oceanic plate, or any cracks in the plate,
creates a fringing field that provides better
connection for the pent-up charge beneath the plates
to escape. But the potential still has to be
large enough to make a spark to close the gap
across the fringing field. And in the meantime
the fringing field accumulates charge.
Filaments of current are induced along the length
of the fringing fields at the plate boundaries
by earth's magnetic and electric fields,
forming circuits. You should notice that the plate
boundaries connect in continuous, looping 
circuits around the earth. To illustrate,
one of the better examples is the Caribbean plate, or
more precisely, what I call the Caribbean current loop.

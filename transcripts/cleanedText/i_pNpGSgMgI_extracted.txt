Comet science stands
at a crossroads
with enormous implications
for the future of astronomy,
institutional science as a whole,
and perhaps the entire culture,
in more ways than
might be imagined.
In our last episode, we explored
recent comet discoveries
that provide the final,
definitive refutation
of the more than a half-century old
”Dirty Snowball” comet hypothesis.
Since the mid-20th century institutional
science has subscribed to the belief
that comets are fluffy
aggregates of ice and dust
that formed through condensation or
accretion in the solar system's infancy,
four and a half
billion years ago.
But for decades the chief principals
of the Thunderbolts Project
have proposed a radically
different theory of comets.
Comets are not
billions of years old,
nor are they snowballs
of ice and dust.
Rather, comets as well as
asteroids and meteoroids,
were excavated from planets and moons
through high-energy electrical discharges
or interplanetary Thunderbolts.
This theory has always predicted
dry and rocky comet nuclei
which should be burnt black, covered
with extremely fine dust and rubble,
and displaying distinctly
planetary features.
Every space mission to date
that has imaged a comet nucleus,
has dramatically affirmed
the Electric Comet theory.
Scientists have marveled over comet nuclei
that appear indistinguishable from asteroids
and have, without exception, displayed a
stunning lack of the abundant surface ice
that Standard Theory predicted.
For three years on this series, we have
reported on the amazing revelations
from the ESA Rosetta
mission to the comet 67P.
Despite insurmountable preexisting
evidence to the contrary,
mission scientists had
expected the comet nucleus
to resemble a snowball
of ice and dust.
As we showed in the
previous episode,
recently released close-up
images of the nucleus
could not more dramatically
refute this expectation.
Numerous forms of stratified rock
appear stunningly obvious on the comet.
Again, we compare them to planetary
examples such as those on our own Earth.
Of course, comet scientists
never predicted the feature
and how could they?
Stratification is thought to result
from planetary geological processes
such as wind and water erosion shaping
sedimentary rocks over millions of years,
or volcanic magma or lava
producing igneous rocks.
In standard comet theory, as
a comet approaches the Sun,
comet activity, including the production
of the familiar coma and tail,
is thought to result from sublimating surface
and near surface volatiles and outgassing.
Sublimating snowballs
do not produce features
indistinguishable from the
desert regions of rocky planets.
As we reported many times
previously on this series,
other uniquely planetary features
on the comet include sand dunes,
wind-streaked rocks
mesas.
And of course we see
the sharp-edged cliffs,
giant boulders
and endless fields of rubble
that we must find if a comet
was in fact torn from a planet.
In the previous episode,
we also reported
on another devastating discovery
for standard comet theory:
scientists’ observation of a
comet that has become active
at the incredible distance of one
and-a-half billion miles from the Sun,
or 16 astronomical units (AU).
Comet ice is not supposed to sublimate
at distances beyond just 3 AU,
yet in the official NASA
Hubble press release
we see that neither this discovery,
nor the vast library of evidence,
disconfirming the dirty
snowball hypothesis
have had any effect at all
on NASA's view of comets.
The press release states,
"A solitary frozen traveler has been
journeying for millions of years
toward the heart of
our planetary system.
The wayward vagabond, a city-sized
snowball of ice and dust called a comet,
was gravitationally
kicked out of the Oort cloud,
it's frigid home at the outskirts
of the solar system..."
As we also noted previously,
it's a bizarre paradox that a lead Rosetta
scientist, Dr. Nicolas Thomas said in 2015,
"Rosetta has blown the dirty
snowball idea out of the water."
And yet the Rosetta team has
collectively held steadfastly
to the standard fiction of icy comets that
formed four and a half billion years ago.
Of course, the required surface ice
was never observed on the comet.
In January of 2016 the team
summarized their findings as follows,
"...the great majority of ice is believed
to come from under the comet's crust,
and very few examples of exposed water
ice have been found on the surface."
Here, as in the
aforementioned Hubble report,
we see an inexplicable
devotion to falsified theory.
It seems fitting
that the language
in an official scientific report
includes the word  “believed “.
To describe the small patches of
water ice on the comet as "exposed",
implies a faith that an
invisible reservoir of ice
exists underneath the comet’s
desiccated rocky exterior.
This was the logic that scientists employed,
who have taken to referring to comets as
"deep-fried ice cream".
Yet, how one gets stratified
rock in ice cream
be it deep-fried or not,
remains mysterious
and here we see again a disturbing
disconnect between science theory
and science discovery.
Recent discoveries in planetary science
affirm the continued conjectures
about subsurface comet
ice are not necessary.
Scientists today are attempting
to explain why the planet Mercury
has a surprising abundance
of ice in craters at its North Pole.
One theory that
scientists are proposing
was summarized in the September 19th, 2017
blog of the American Geophysical Union.
It states,
"...Mercury's exposure to solar
winds containing protons,
could have combined with oxygen and
hydrogen on the planet to form water."
For several years, scientists
have employed the same reasoning
to explain the discovery
of water on our own moon.
We suggest that a similar
process may be responsible
for the scant ice seen on
desiccated rocky comet nuclei,
yet another reason to end speculation
about invisible subsurface ice.
Other obstacles remain before institutional
science will likely entertain
any real alternative theories
of comets and comet origins.
One is the detection of the signature
of water molecules in cometary coma,
which comet scientists have always
interpreted as proof of sublimating ices.
But long before the discovery
of an active comet
at a billion and a half
miles from the Sun,
ample reason existed for scientists
to question such an interpretation.
Comet 67P was not the first
comet to puzzle scientists
with its ironically
overactive "water output",
In June of 2014, the ESA reported the
surprisingly early detection of water
"sweating" off of
the dry rocky comet.
They wrote,
"ESA's Rosetta spacecraft
has found that comet 67P
is releasing the equivalent of two small
glasses of water into space every second,
even at a cold 583 million
kilometers from the Sun."
the principal investigator of Rosetta's
microwave instruments stated
"We always knew we would see water
vapor outgassing from the comet,
but we were surprised at
how early we detected it."
But on a body that is covered
with stratified rock,
where is the water coming from?
A theoretical path that comet
scientists have yet to explore
is complex cometary
electrochemistry.
In recent years, Thunderbolts
colleague Dr. Franklin Anariba,
a specialist in electrochemistry,
has been presenting his thesis on comet
water production by electrochemical means.
In a five-part Space News
presentation in 2015,
Dr. Anariba proposed that a process
of electrons stripping releases O₂, OH,
and other chemical species
into the cometary coma.
The discovery of an electron
density in the vicinity of the 67P nucleus
is therefore important.
It could mean that the chemical O₂ can absorb
a negative charge through charge exchange,
which is then followed by a process called
protonation via solar wind at the comet.
Water formation can then be
explained via a series of pathways,
as Dr. Anariba has outlined.
Electrochemistry may also be the cause
of the production of rich gases
that comets have produced at a great
variety of distances from the Sun,
as Dr. Anariba has
also discussed.
And it can account for the
completely unexpected detection
of molecular oxygen at comet 67P,
yet another reason
why no basis remains
to suggest that comets are four
and a half billion years old.
As reported in India's
national magazine Frontline,
"The detection of O2 was unexpected...
all the primordial oxygen molecules,
which would have been there in a comet's
evolution around 4.6 billion years ago,
should have
disappeared by now...
the Rosetta discovery of O₂ in
67P is an astrophysical enigma."
In fact, in March of this year,
in a scientific paper published in
the journal Nature Communications,
the authors essentially proposed that
water molecules, coming off a comet,
become electrically charged.
Then the solar wind accelerates the charged
molecules back to the comet’s surface.
There they pick up an oxygen atom from
the surface from materials such as sand,
forming the detected O₂.
The electrical theory of comets is
based on sound scientific foundations
and nothing in the theory
is at odds with discovery.
In the Electric Universe,
most comet activity
results from comets moving through
regions of changing electrical potential.
Comets that spend most of their time in
the outer reaches of the solar system
develop a "negative charge" with
respect to their environment.
As they move toward the Sun's
more positively charged domain,
they can experience voltage spikes
in their dynamic plasma environment
and begin to discharge
electrically.
The Sun's electromagnetic influence is now
being shown, through science discovery,
to be far more vast throughout the solar
system than Standard Theory has ever imagined.
In 2016, the Cassini spacecraft
made the surprising discovery
of so-called magnetic ropes that stretch
nearly 900 million miles from the Sun
to the gas giant Saturn
and interact with the planet in a
manner similar to the Birkeland currents
that are now known to
produce Earth's auroras.
Comets can also become active
when passing through any more
positively charged region of space,
including when encountering the
vast magnetotail of a planet.
This theory can explain
much comet activity
which has only proved baffling
to mainstream theorists,
including comets that have
disintegrated or exploded
at impossibly vast
distances from the Sun
and the astonishing
electrical energies
measured when comets have
closely approached planets,
including Shoemaker-Levy 9 at Jupiter
and comet Siding Spring at Mars.
This, of course, explains why comet activity
can occur at distances from the Sun
where invisible hypothetical
ices cannot sublimate.
Another obstacle for
comet scientists
is a faith in their measurements
of a comet's density.
After all, said measurements in 67P would
suggest that the images do in fact lie
and underneath the obviously rocky
surface is a more fluffy, icy interior.
However, investigators might
have been given pause
shortly after the landing of the
Philae probe on the comet nucleus.
After the lander bounced and rolled into
the shade of a towering rocky cliff,
the team attempted to hammer
the probe into the comet’s soil
but the hammer was bested by the
comet’s obviously rocky composition.
The ESA describes the
event as follows,
"The probe then started to hammer
itself into the subsurface,
but was unable to make more than
a few millimeters of progress,
even at the highest power
level of the motor."
Similar surprises awaited
NASA's Stardust-Next team
when they reimaged the
surface of comet Tempel 1
after the Deep Impact mission fired a
copper projectile into the comet nucleus.
The team found that the
projectile’s impact crater
was nowhere near as
dramatic as expected,
indicating a much
tougher surface
than the comet’s density
measurements would seem to indicate.
But incredibly, the team proposed the
projectile did in fact leave a dramatic crater
which somehow achieved a
miraculous self-healing.
They hypothesized that material exploded
off of the comet at tremendous velocities
and then somehow fell back down in the comet’s
near-zero gravity to refill the crater.
As Space.com reported in 2011,
"Temple 1’s man-made crater
partially healed itself
as the ejecta settled and
refilled part of the depression."
The ramifications of this problem
reach far beyond comet science
and affect all of cosmology.
For decades, the chief science advisor to
The Thunderbolts Project Wal Thornhill,
has argued that measurements of an
object's density cannot be accurate
if one fails to account for the
electromagnetic stresses on the body.
In 2004, when NASA's Stardust mission
imaged another comet Wild 2,
which also appears indistinguishable
from an asteroid, Thornhill wrote
"Density calculations based on gravitational
perturbation theory are worthless.
Gravity is a weak dipole electric
force between subatomic particles.
So, the charge distribution in a
body affects gravity strongly.
Comets are highly charged bodies and
will exhibit anomalous gravity.
Newton's gravitational ‘constant’,
G, is a dependent variable.
It is dependent on the
electrical state of a body.”
Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson
is famously quoted as saying,
"The good thing about science is that it's
true, whether or not you believe in it."
Those who have followed this series
will surely recognize the amazing irony
of deGrasse Tyson's statement.
In our previous episode we
concluded with the question,
”Is science self-corrective?”
Apply the question to comet science
today and the answer is self-evident.
Yet deGrasse Tyson is correct.
A thing is either true or not
and Nature has no regard
for human beliefs.
The repetition of the conjecture of our solar
system’s four and a half billion year history
does not make it true.
The repetition of the conjecture of comets
as dirty snowballs does not make it true.
The consensus nature of any
belief does not make it true.
What is the truth about comets?
As Galileo Galilei stated,
"All truths are easy to understand
once they are discovered;
the point is to discover them."
We again implore viewers to
simply look at the pictures.
An easy path of discovery awaits,
leading one further into
our electric universe.

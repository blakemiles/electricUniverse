In 2014,
astronomers puzzled over the
unprecedented discovery of an asteroid
with its own ring system. The asteroid
Chariklo, which is 250 kilometers in
diameter, and orbits between Saturn and
Uranus, displays two rings that are said
to be similar in nature to those of
Saturn. The leader of a 2014 study said
of the discovery, "We weren't looking for
a ring and didn't think small bodies
like Chariklo had them at all, so the
discovery -- and the amazing amount of
detail we saw in the system -- came as a
complete surprise!" Today, scientists
performing computer simulations are
suggesting that only two possibilities
can account for the continued existence
of Chariklo's perplexing rings. They
say that either the particles, composing
the rings, are much smaller than models
have predicted or that a hypothetical
shepherd satellite around the asteroid
must be gravitationally stabilizing the
rings. In fact, the scientists are
surprised that the rings haven't already
disintegrated since their simulations
suggest a much shorter life. A Phys.org
report on the team's research states, "...the
density of the ring particles must be
less than half the density of Chariklo
itself. Their results also showed that a
striped pattern, known as 'self-
-gravity wakes,' forms in the inner ring
due to interactions between the
particles. These self-gravity wakes
accelerate the breakup of the ring. The
team recalculated the expected lifetime
of Chariklo's rings, based on their
results, and found it to be only 1 to 100
years, much shorter than previous
estimates. This is so short that it's
surprising the ring is still there."
Chariklo is a member of a family of
asteroids, between the orbits of Saturn
and Uranus, called the Centaurs. In the
past, the Centaurs have occasionally
surprised scientists with their
comet-like behaviors and created some
confusion as to their classification
as either asteroids or comets. The
Electric Universe theory has always
stated that the only real difference
between comets and asteroids are their
respective orbits and both can discharge
electrically when moving through regions
of changing electric potential. This
theory, as proposed by the chief
principals of The Thunderbolts Project,
also states that comets, asteroids and
meteoroids were recently electrically
torn from planetary surfaces. The late
astronomer Tom Van Flandern proposed his
own theory of the birth of comets and
asteroids suggesting they are the
remains of an exploded planet. Van
Flandern argued that the characteristics
of the orbits of asteroids, particularly
those between Mars and Jupiter in the
Asteroid Belt, show all of the features of
material having been recently ejected
into space. Van Flandern made the
seemingly outrageous prediction that
asteroids would tend to have natural
satellites. It was almost universally
dismissed by astronomers. However, in more
recent years, many asteroids have been
found to have their own moons. In the
case of Chariklo, physicist Wal
Thornhill has agreed with the notion
that the asteroid likely has shepherd
satellites maintaining the rings.
Astronomers have assumed that the
material, composing the rings, was removed
from the asteroid by a violent collision.
But the kind of fine dust in the rings
is not what one would expect from a
mechanical collision. Indeed, as reported
in this series, in more recent years
scientists have increasingly
acknowledged electrostatic dust-raising
events on both comets and asteroids.
Nevertheless, the cometary behavior of
some asteroids continues to pose a great
mystery for astronomers. In 2013 the
asteroid P/2013 P5 astonished
investigators when it suddenly sprouted
six comet-like tails, forcing scientists
to eventually reclassify the asteroid as
a main-belt comet. Researchers suggested
that the force of sunlight, hitting the
asteroid, may have caused a mysterious
and sudden increase in its spin rate,
causing dust material to fly off into
space.
It was then suggested that radiation was
able to "stretch and confine the
removed material into tale-like
forms." However, both
the machining of the dust from the
asteroid and its confinement into comet
tails could more easily be explained as
electrical discharge phenomena. Chariklo's
ring system has led to the reinforcement
of the idea that the dust material in
the rings might eventually coalesce into
a small moon. But the notion, of colliding
particles accreting into planetary sized
bodies, has never been shown to work. In
fact, experiments on earth suggest that
collisions will tend to disintegrate
material exceeding mere centimeters.
Indeed, among the many problems with the
collisional theory of the formation of
moons;
if the satellites in our solar system
were formed by collisions, one would
expect to find a neat gradation of their
properties. However, the respective
satellites of the gas giants Saturn and
Jupiter are so different that it seems
doubtful they were formed in the same
way and by the same body. It is surely
telling that the consensus story of the
origins and behaviors of asteroids and
comets continues to be challenged by
science discovery. The evidence simply
does not support the notion that these
bodies are billions of years old, tracing
back to the solar system's infancy. But
how many asteroid and comet mysteries
will be resolved if scientists will
finally entertain a recent catastrophic
history of our solar system?

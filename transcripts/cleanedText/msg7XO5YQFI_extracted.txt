In early September of 2017,
dramatic weather and seismic events
reminded human beings around the world
of the awesome power of nature.
On September 7th, an 8.1 point earthquake
struck off of the Pacific coast,
the largest quake in
Mexico in a century.
Just one day previous, hurricane
Irma, a tremendously powerful storm,
that originated near the
Capo Verde islands,
reached its peak intensity with
winds of 185 miles per hour.
The hurricanes Katia and Jose
followed on Irma's heels
and less than two weeks
after the Mexico quake,
a second tremor, this one 7.1
magnitude, struck the region.
Only two days after the
second Mexico quake,
additional significant earthquakes
occured at the pacific island of Vanuatu
and just off the north east
coast of Japan, respectively.
Are such cliusters of natural disasters
on our planet merely a coincidence?
The key to answering
the question
is an understanding of the dynamic
electromagnetic relationship
between the earth and the sun.
Increasingly mainstream scientific
research has shown a dramatic connection,
completely unexpected
in standard reasoning,
between intense solar activity and
atmospheric and weather events on Earth.
For instance, in 2014, we reported
on a scientific study which
showed intense and sustained increased
lightning on Earth, following solar storms.
Is it then a coincidence
that in early September
the sun erupted with its largest
solar flare in 12 years.
For the past several years,
Thunderbolts colleague Ben Davidson,
the founder of Suspicious Observers,
has produced voluminous
research on space weather
and its link to numerous
geophysical phenomena.
More recently, Ben and
scientific colleagues
have worked to develop models
of disaster prediction.
And in 2015, Ben and coauthors Kongpop
U-Yen and Christopher Holloman
coauthored a peer-reviewed
scientific paper on the connection
between solar activity and
very large earthquakes.
In the first of this
two-part presentation,
Ben begins discussing the evolution
of its own investigation
and the growing body of
evidence of the sun's effect
on climate, weather
and earthquakes.
[Ben Davidson] It was really
quite the start of September,
a bit of a bitter-sweet one which
is not something we're not used to
when it comes to forecasting natural disasters
when every time you have a success,
it is also a somber reality
of what has just happened.
Back in 2011, 2012,
2013 and 2014,
a number of patterns between
solar and other cosmic phenomena
and eathly phenomena, both
meteorogical and seismic,
began to come together in a way that
was not just obviousto a few people
but obvious to tens of
thousands of people
who happened to be watching
someone who got lucky enough
to pick 3 interesting things they
wanted to show every day and that is;
what the sun was doing, what
the earthquakes were doing
and what the weather was doing.
And sort of by accident, all of these
patterns started to just show up.
In 2015, a few papers were published, and
we are doing continued research still,
but we are finding that things
are moving along and progressing
in the understanding of how the sun
is, for lack of a better phrase,
electromagnetically forcing short-term
weather events and seismic activity
in a number of different ways.
It's progressing so fast that really
the only way we could think of
to share and get this out there for
people to understand and improve,
is just to continue reporting
on the stuff every day
and letting people know what the
patterns are that we think they see
and that we think that
we have seen as well..
Back in 2015, we were able to really
bring this to the forefront because
after the sun had been
relatively quiet,
for quite a long time and it
was to say somewhat lackluster
start to the tropical season.
We had really an incredble uptake in solar
activity in a span of just about a week.
It caused level 4, which is the
second highest you can have,
level 4 out of 5
geomagnetic storms,
they actually shut down the airspace
over New Zealand at that time
and for only the second time in
recorded meteorological history,
6 tropical cyclones
spun in the Pacific.
Really just, you know, to the
world it was a great coincidence
but when it continued
happening, you know
throughout the rest of the year into
September and then again in November
and then in January as well, we
began to look back in time and say,
hey this actually holds true!
And it's not just that the sun
is having really grand activity,
it's that there is a change in the solar
activity and so during solar maximum,
which happens every
11 years or so,
the sun is producing a lot of
sunspots and a lot of solar flares
and if you are in the middle of that, maybe
a drastic run of solar flares is normal
for that month or
that year in time.
But when you look back to these
periods where you have, you know,
these unexpected uptakes
in solar activity,
or you are in a period where you
expect to have high activity
and you have low activity for a
while and then it picks back up.
It's that sort of ramping back up
of that distribution of energy,
not only from the solar flare X-ray
emission throughout the solar system
but from those, you know,
charged particle plasma cloud
shockwaves that I mentioned earlier,
that travel throughout the
solar system that are
powerful enough to create those
incredible displays, take out satellites,
affect telecommunications,
internet, things like that, and so
you have to really look
at the energetic change
that is taking place throughout
the solar system and
that is precisely what we had happen
again, just at the beginning of September.
It actually began in the middle of
August, when after literally weeks,
I would say maybe months without too much
going on in terms of sunspot production
and definitely not much going
on in terms of the solar flares
and the big blasts that go
throughout the solar system.
We had a flurry of
sunspots being produced
and the solar flares began to come back in the
middle of August, right around that period.
It was not long after that Harvey, sort
of, formed and took that run at Houston.
And then we had a little
break in solar activity
and then we had a little break in
the tropical systems but then,
just as fast as the break came, we had another
sunspot that was born out of nowhere,
and it was born on the Sun on the Earth-facing
disk while a very large and mature sunspot
sat very calmly and quietly and
silently in the northern hemisphere.
This thing was born on the south, and it
turned into a monster very very quickly,
fired a number of solar flares including
the fourteenth largest, officially,
that has ever been seen and this
is one of the largest upticks
that I have ever
reported to be sure
and the last time we had a solar
flare this large was 12 years ago.
We had another level 4 geomagnetic storm
event, these things are quite rare
to be honest, and
wouldn't you know it,
on the heels of that we have 3
systems spinning in the Atlantic.
Now I know that that's not comparable
to the 6 systems we had in the Pacific
but you have to realize how small
the Atlantic is by comparison
and in that you cannot
have 6 systems lined up
at tropical cyclone strength in
the Atlantic ocean at one time.
And so, here we see
something interesting,
the sunspots really getting produced
back in the middle of August,
when they started flaring, those
sunspots disappeared out of view,
the day that hurricane Harvey shut north
and the solar flare making sunspot
that was on the southern hemisphere
during this triple hurricane,
set up what we had in the Atlantic
basin, just at the start of September.
When it disappeared out of view, hurricane
Irma ran north that day at Florida.
Now we got very, very lucky because
it appears that about 24 hours later,
as the sunspot was out of view, it released
a solar flare that was so powerful,
we were actually able to detect it from Earth
even though the sunspot was not visible.
It had turned over to the back
side, the far-side half of the sun
where, you know, Earth can't
see from our perspective.
And as far as I know, this is the first time
actually that one of the shockwave clouds,
blasted out via solar flare on the
far side of the sun, has hit Earth.
It wasn't much, you
know, terrible
because as I said the sunspot
blasted it out on the far side
but the shockwave was so
broad that it had effects
basically all throughout
the solar system.
[Michael Goodspeed] In the following
episode, we will discuss in greater detail
how and why it may be possible
to predict earthquakes,
particularly the largest quakes, major storms
and other dramatic environmental effects
based on a new understanding of the
Sun-Earth electromagnetic connection.

New scientific reports are again
confirming the electrical nature
of one of the most mysterious
phenomena in the cosmos ― the comet.
For more than a decade
scientists have puzzled over the
spectacular display of Comet McNaught.
In the winter of 2007, the object
dazzled observers on Earth
when it became the brightest
comet in over 40 years
and the second
brightest since 1935.
The more scientists have
learned about Comet McNaught,
the more it has confounded
conventional comet theory.
In 2007, as the comet
was passing near Mars,
the Ulysses spacecraft made the
completely unexpected discovery
that the solar wind velocity
dramatically decelerated
as it encountered the
comet's ion tail.
At that distance from the Sun the solar
wind is typically about 700 km/sec,
but inside the ion tail of the
comet it was only 350 km/sec.
Space science professor Michael
Combi said of the discovery,
"This was very surprising to me.
Way past the orbit of Mars, the solar wind
felt a disturbance of this little comet.
It will be a serious challenge for us
theoreticians and computer modelers
to figure out the physics."
And today, scientists continuing to study comet
McNaught have reported another discovery
that stunningly confirms
the electric comet theory,
that is that the material in the comet's
dust tail is "electrically charged".
The team was attempting to learn
about the extraordinary dust tail,
specifically the structured
bands of dust or striations
which did not disperse
in the "vacuum of space"
but stretched for over 100
million miles behind the comet.
Previously, the great comet of 1744 was said to
have presented the same mystery in its time
when it produced six tails which
were observed from Earth.
Today, almost three
centuries later,
scientists utilizing a new
image processing technique
are able to study the formation of the
striations in McNaught's dust tail.
What they have found was
completely unexpected.
Planetary scientist Oliver Price who developed
the technique said of the investigation,
"My supervisor and I noticed weird goings-on
in the images of these striations,
a disruption in the
otherwise clean lines.
I set out to investigate what might have
happened to create this weird effect."
As reported on phys.org, these
so-called weird effects were,
"Located at the heliospheric current sheet,
a boundary where the magnetic orientation,
or polarity, of the electrified
solar wind changes directions.
This puzzled scientists because while
they have long known the comet's ion tail
is affected by the solar wind,
they had never seen the solar
wind impact dust tails before."
"Dust in McNaught's tail ― roughly
the size of cigarette smoke ―
is too heavy, the scientists thought,
for the solar wind to push around."
This electrical interaction between
the heliospheric current sheet
and the comet's dust tail is summarized
by planetary scientist Geraint Jones,
"It's like the striation's feathers are
ruffled when it crosses the current sheet.
If you picture a wing with lots of
feathers, as the wing crosses the sheet,
lighter ends of the feathers
get bent out of shape.
For us, this is strong evidence that
the dust is electrically charged,
and that the solar wind is affecting
the motion of that dust."
The Phys.org report concludes
of the team's findings,
"... it was a surprise for
them to see the solar wind
affect larger dust grains
like those in McNaught's tail--
about 100 times bigger than the dust seen
ejected from around Jupiter and Saturn--
because they're that much heavier
for the solar wind to push around."
It has always been the Electric Universe
position that most comet activity
is the result of the comet moving through
regions of changing electric potential.
The reason comet activity tends to
increase as it moves closer to the Sun
is not due to sublimation of
invisible hypothetical water ice.
Indeed, every comet nucleus imaged to
date has appeared rocky and desiccated.
Comets spend most of their time in the
farther reaches of the solar system
where plasma charge density
is low. The comet moves slowly
and its charge will normally easily
come into balance with that region.
But as it approaches the Sun,
the nucleus moves at a furious speed through
regions of increasing charge density
and varying electrical characteristics.
The comet's surface charge and internal
polarization developed in deep space
respond to the new environment
by forming cathode jets
and a visible plasma
sheath or coma.
The jets flare up and the comet may
shed and grow anew several tails.
In fact, the negative charge
in Comet McNaught's ion tail
would have attracted
solar wind protons,
the obvious explanation for the deceleration
of the solar wind as it met the comet.
Comets can also suddenly brighten
when moving away from the Sun
or even explode when moving through any sudden
dramatic change of electrical potential
such as when encountering a CME from the
Sun or even the magnetosphere of a planet.
In fact, on two occasions
in modern times,
when astronomers have been able to anticipate
a comet's close encounter with a planet,
Shoemaker Levy 9 at Jupiter in 1994
and Siding Spring at Mars in 2014,
the electromagnetic effects produced by
the encounters were vastly more energetic
than anything comet scientists
had thought possible.
Comet jets may be the clearest example of
electrical discharge we've observed on a comet.
Standard comet theory has failed
completely to predict or explain
the actual form and behaviors of the
collimated jets of dust and gas
seen exploding off of comets.
This problem confronted scientists
on NASA's Stardust mission
when its spacecraft
approached the comet Wild 2.
An official NASA report describes
the conundrum as follows,
"The team predicted the jets would
shoot up for a short distance,
and then be dispersed into
a halo around Wild 2.
Instead, some super-speedy
jets remained intact,
like blasts of water from
a powerful garden hose."
An obvious problem is, the comparison of
comet jets to the blasts of a garden hose
is completely inappropriate.
In the so called vacuum of space,
what mechanism collimates the jets
causing them to not disperse as
comet scientists had predicted?
An ad hoc theory some comet
scientists have proposed
is that so-called apertures or
nozzles on the comet nucleus
act as the "hose" through which the
jet passes preventing its dispersal.
However, such features
remain elusive.
This is acknowledged in the
2012 scientific paper
'Cometary Jet Collimation
Without Physical Confinement'
which states,
"Contemporary models postulate
that these jets collimate
when the expanding gases and dust pass
through a physical aperture or nozzle.
However, recent high-resolution
spacecraft observations
fail to detect such apertures
on cometary surfaces.
Recent high-resolution images of comet
nuclei revealed that the gas and dust
expelled by the comet is organized
into narrow plumes or jets..."
"Furthermore, these models do
not explain why cometary jets
appear to be directed normal to the
local gravitational potential.
This is especially puzzling
because the jet velocity,
typically 300 m/sec
far from the comet,
greatly exceeds the escape
velocity of only about 1 m/sec."
In stark contrast, more
than a century ago,
one of the pioneers of
electrical experimentalism,
the Norwegian physicist
Kristian Birkeland
successfully emulated cometary jets
from a cathode in a vacuum tube.
Birkeland wrote,
"From a cathode of graphite there
came long, steady pencils of light,
which greatly resembled the so-called
eruptions or jets in comets."
And today, the experimental approach
to the Electric Universe continues,
as we see in this home experiment by
Thunderbolts colleague Jacob Gable
who stunningly emulates
cometary jets of gas and dust
through simple electrical discharge
in a makeshift vacuum chamber.
The comet remains one of the most significant
celestial objects for scientific investigation
and it remains one of
the clearest evidences
that we live in an
Electric Universe.

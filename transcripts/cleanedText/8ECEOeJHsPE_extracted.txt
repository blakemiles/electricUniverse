Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought

Today, to an unprecedented degree,
technological advances are bringing the
nature of our solar system's Sun into
clearer focus. With ever finer data, the
ability to test competing theoretical
models, and hopefully to resolve
mysteries, becomes greater and greater.
One such mystery is the unexpectedly hot
temperature of the solar wind as it
extends away from the Sun. Recently, a
team of scientists from the
University of Wisconsin-Madison
performed a study to try to find an
answer to the puzzle, and their search
led them to the field of plasma physics.
A phys.org report describes the
standard interpretation of the hot solar
wind conundrum: “With more negatively
charged electrons streaming away, the Sun
takes on a positive charge. This makes it
harder for the electrons to escape the
Sun's pull. Some electrons have a lot of
energy and keep traveling for infinite
distances. Those with less energy can't
escape the Sun's positive charge and are
attracted back to the Sun. As they do,
some of those electrons can be knocked
off their tracks ever-so-slightly by
collisions with surrounding plasma.” The
lead author of the aforementioned study
states: “There is a fundamental dynamical
phenomenon that says that particles
whose velocity is not well aligned with
the magnetic field lines, are not able to
move into a region of a strong magnetic
field. Such returning electrons are
reflected so that they stream away from
the Sun, but again they cannot escape
because of the attractive electric force
of the Sun. So, their destiny is to bounce
back and forth, creating a large
population of so-called trapped
electrons.” At first glance, such language
might seem resonant with the Electric
Sun model first proposed
by engineer Ralph Juergens
and later developed, and in some
respects modified by Dr. Donald Scott and
physicist Wal Thornhill. However, the
University of Wisconsin-Madison
scientists propose that a theoretical
magnetic process is the mechanism behind
the mysterious solar wind heating.
We asked retired Professor of Electrical
Engineering, Dr. Donald Scott for
an Electric Sun explanation of the
aforementioned phenomenon. As time goes
on, we here in the Electric Universe, are
hearing more and more often about these
”new astronomical discoveries” that
are not really new at all. What is new is
there's the recent increase in the
inclusion of electrical ideas in these
astronomical press releases. And a good
example is what you just quoted from the
University of Wisconsin's press release.
But, although more references are presently
being made by astronomers, electrical
topics like electrons and positive ions
and their flows and movements and then
separation, astronomers never used to
admit that electrons and positive ions can
be separated. But charge separation in space?
No, that can’t be. But I still would remind
everybody that the words “current”, ”electric
current” and “electric fields”, are
almost always completely absent. And a
case in point is on our Electric Sun model,
which has been around a long,
long time now, we do have in the model,
inherently, there is charge separation.
And I thought, when I read what
you just read, I whimsically went back in
my mind and said, well how did all this
Electric Sun thing get started? These
guys never heard of it obviously.
Actually it got started back in 1908,
when Kristian Birkeland hypothesized
that our auroras were caused by streams
of electrically charged particles coming
from the Sun. And everybody, certainly
at least in the EU I think, knows that
ad nauseam by now. He was
adamantly opposed and ridiculed by
astronomers for these ideas. This went on
for decades, even after the poor man had
died. But Birkeland was not forgotten, at
least not by us. But this press release
says that the solar wind was
”discovered” in 1959. Now, that got my
attention. I wouldn't mind if they'd said
its existence was verified in ’59, when we
sent some Rockets up and saw that, yes there
indeed were charges floating around up
there and coming into the North Pole of
the earth. But they act as though
Birkeland had never proposed it. They
almost act as though Birkeland had never
existed and nobody ever knew about it,
and I kind of resent that. Our present
Electric Sun model is the direct result
of Birkeland's original insight, that the
auroras are caused by cosmic flows of
electricity. But this model is the result
of the work of many researchers from
Kristian Birkeland to Hannes Alfvén, and
I humbly add my own name at the end of
that as well. The prime organizer
of these ideas about the Sun,
was the late civil
engineer Ralph Juergens;
and he had carefully studied the earlier
plasma research of the Scottish
mathematician and physicist whose name
is C.E.R. Bruce. Bruce had made the first
major change in the theory of how
lightning paths function, since their
description by Benjamin Franklin, way
back in the dim distant past. And this
work and then Bruce's attendance at
Sydney Chapman’s 1941 Kelvin lecture on
the Sun, led Bruce to apply these ideas
to cosmic phenomena, and to a new
electric vision of the universe. And that
has eventually developed into the
Electric Sun model. In 1970, I read a
paper by Juergens about the electrical
properties of the Sun's photosphere and
it was published, would you believe, in a
chemical engineering journal by Juergens,
who was a civil engineer, about an
electrical phenomenon. Everything Juergens
said there, in that paper, was completely
consistent with what I had been taught
earlier as a student, and then taught
myself as a professor, about electrical
engineering having to do with
plasmas, a good portion of electrical
engineers, at least in those days, were into
plasma research. Anyway, reading that
paper, I was hooked. I worked for several
years, studying and adding, and
trying my best to add to Juergens
basic ideas, and the point being that the
Electric Sun model is the product of the
dedicated work of a long,
long string of many people for many
years. And these people, like the ones
who wrote this memo, never heard of it, I
guess. Anyway, it turns out our present
Electric Sun model inherently explains
many, if not all, the solar phenomena that
astronomers cannot explain. And they
continue to absolutely ignore its
existence. We often hear the phrase
”That process is not completely
understood”. Actually, what they
mean is, what they should have said
is, “We have no idea why this is going on,
but send us more money and we'll invent
another invisible mechanism, or force, to
explain it”. A prime example of these
processes that they don't know too much
about, is the solar wind, which they do
mention in this press release. But
Birkeland suggested its existence and the
Electric Sun models gives us a clear
explanation of the structure and exactly where
it comes from, and why it behaves as it
does. And, for example, the article does
not mention the fact that the solar wind
comes in - and it’s well-known - two different
varieties. There's the fast solar wind
and the slow solar wind, and they're two
different manifestations, two different
varieties of the same animal, the solar
wind itself. The fast solar wind is a
flow of ions and electrons that has high
velocity, but it's not very dense, there are
very few ions in it.
And it comes out of the tops of the
photospheric tufts, which make up the
surface of the photosphere, which are
highly charged regions that hold back
the flood of ions that would otherwise
result. In other words, you've got this bunch
of things that are positively charged. They
repel other positive charges and these
positive charges within the Sun are
trying to escape. These tufts line
up, almost like a bunch of soldiers, and
prevent the escape of these other inside
ions. Ions that do get over the top of
the tufts though, then fall through the
energy drop of the voltage of the tufts,
pretty much like the water that falls
over the top of an overfilled dam. There’re
not too many of them that manage to
do it. to get over there, but the ones
that do, fall the whole distance, all the
way down the face of the dam. And this
is what gives them their high velocity.
But relatively few of them can make the
trip, and so that's why the fast solar
solar wind is very low density. On the
other hand, the slow solar wind, has
only about half the velocity of the fast
wind, but it's quite dense; many more
particles per unit volume. And it comes
from sunspots and other disturbed
regions on the Sun's surface, where there
are no tufts to hold them back. So it's
like somebody poked a hole in the dam,
and therefore this flow is very dense,
many ions per unit volume, nothing to
really prevent their escape. But, since
they're not accelerated by falling
through a large voltage drop, their
maximum velocities are only about half
of that of the fast wind particles.
Anyway, this explanation of the two
varieties of the solar wind is inherent
in the in the Electric Sun model. It
mimics the operation of a PNP transistor.
I'm an electrical engineer and I
understand that. It's no wonder astronomers
shun our Electric Universe ideas and
they find that the explanation of this
mechanism is not well understood, because
they don't know anything about
electrical engineering. Anyway, I hope
that everybody knows that the SAFIRE
project, which most people, I think are
beginning to have heard about, was
organized, funded and manned through the
kind generosity of the patrons who
support the Electric Universe, for one
major purpose. The purpose of SAFIRE
was to test the validity of the Electric
Sun model in every possible way.
Montgomery Childs, the director of SAFIRE
and chief investigator, has
publicly announced that this has been
done and that the Electric Sun model has
passed each and every test they could
throw at it. Yet it is
ignored by astrophysicists.
Also, some peripheral results from
SAFIRE are interesting to note.
For example, many astrophysicists have
claimed for years, that there cannot be
any strong electric fields within cosmic
plasma. That they would be shorted out by
the near-perfect conductivity of the
plasma. Plasma is very highly conductive
in certain directions. But one day, the
SAFIRE team measured electric field
strengths in the SAFIRE
chamber of over 8,000
volts per meter; and they
maintained it, it was were static, and it
lived happily inside the plasma, held in
the SAFIRE project. Anyway, this shows that
the observed acceleration of the fast
solar wind particles, which cannot be
explained by any other mechanism, can
easily be explained by an electrically
charged Sun. And I make reference to that
first sentence in that quote of the
press release. It says, “With more
negatively charged electrons streaming
away, the Sun takes on a positive charge.” Yes,
yes, they got that right: it does take on
a positive charge, not for the reasons
they suggest, but that positively charged
Sun is responsible for the acceleration
of the solar wind, which they didn't
really mention. The strength of the required
electric field to accelerate the fast
solar wind, has been calculated - I did it,
and other people have done it - to not be
greater than about seven tenths of a
microvolt per meter. Seven tenths of a
millionth of a volt per meter and this
only requires the solar voltage to be
around 2,700 volts. So Juergens, in his first
paper, was thinking about 10 to the 10th
volts or some monstrous voltage on the Sun.
From our observations, at least other than
observations of the solar wind
acceleration, it doesn't have to be
anything even close to that. So, the
Electric Universe ideas, of which the
Electric Sun model is one of the most
important, I submit, is getting to be like
the elephant in the room. They know about
it, they don't want to see it, and they
don't want to discuss it. I hope that
soon they will have to.

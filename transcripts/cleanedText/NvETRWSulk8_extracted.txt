This week I received the news like
many of you of Wal Thornhill's passing.
I wish to pay tribute with this article.
Wal was a mentor to us all in the most
important field of all - the true nature of our 
universe. Wal’s many theories and predictions
succeeded because he sought the truth.
Not for credentials, funding, accolades, or
power; he sought the truth for the sake
of knowing - as we all should. It's the
true intent of science. It’s a true source of joy.
I began this article weeks ago, to discuss the truth.
It was never intended to be about Wal. It was, and
still is, about truth seekers in the Electric Universe.
The title “Shine on, you crazy diamond” is
an ode to garage experimenters, theorists,
scientists, and deep-thinkers everywhere who are
grounded and harmonized with natural frequencies.
But Wal was the epitome of such people.
No BS got passed Wal - believe me, I tested him.
So, the title now takes added meaning - 
as things always do in a fractal universe.
How do you know the truth when you see
it? It's because you recognize a pattern.
You trust yourself to know what you're
seeing, hearing or feeling. You know
because it resonates within you. A
pattern from memory, like a mother's face,
is a pattern that harmonizes heart and
soul, and you know. There is no doubt the
instant you recognize Mom's face, or
whoever is your closest, “every bone in
your body” knows it. It's something
everyone does. But it isn't the work of a
conscious mind. It's the work of an
observant state of being. It involves
every sense, conscious and unconscious,
mind and body; the whole antenna resonates.
Like riding a bicycle, your mind doesn't
tell your body how to keep balance. It
just does - as long as you stop thinking and just
pay attention. When I first stumbled into the
Thunderbolts project, I didn't have a
clue what I was going to write about. I
just knew I found the right place. In the
first weeks I binged on Thunderbolts
videos, especially Michael Steinbacher.
I watched all of his. As an engineer with
a smattering of geology experience,
it made sense to look for electrical
evidence on the Earth. After all, it's
accessible, more so than telescopes,
particle beams and buzzy, high voltage labs.
Michael's videos led me to an addiction:
Google Earth. I've always had a thing
for maps. There are patterns, always
patterns, whether looking at highways
cities, airline routes, or topography -
there is a wealth of information in the 
patterns. Earth's Topography is patterned.
I couldn't put a finger to how, or why,
but I could see patterns that stretched for
thousands of miles that had no ‘reasonable’ 
explanation. There were repeating patterns,
geometric patterns. Some patterns were similar
to other planets, yet others were unique.
There had to be a reason. I had already
dismissed conventional thinking at this
point, of course, and reasoned these
features must be electric. We see, plainly,
electric scarring on planets and moons,
and the electric atmospheres of the gas
giants. So it must be on Earth - but why does Earth look
so complex? I stumbled again, always stumbling, into
evidence of shockwaves on hillsides. It
came about because I searched “craters”
and found a blog by a guy who was a
demolitions expert. He was writing about
shockwave features on hillsides near his
home and proposing they were crater rims.
He recognized harmonic tetrahedral
patterning caused by sonic shock because
he'd spent a career in the military
analyzing the blast zones of heavy
ordnance. He was a man who knew
shockwaves when he saw them.
As a mechanical engineer, I have a good
amount of experience with such things
myself. Shock waves – yes, but more
importantly, I’d learned to listen to
technicians like this guy. The operators,
the mechanics, the people who are hands-on.
If you want to know the process don't
ask the people who manage it, ask the
people who operate it. Beyond already
knowing something about “shock
diamonds”, I innately trusted this guy
knew his patterns, even though he had no
academic credentials. I began searching
for these patterns. Lo and behold, they
are everywhere. Not only did I find
harmonic tetrahedrons, created by
compression zones called “separation
bubbles”, formed where a supersonic wave
impinges on the surface. I found multiple features
of fine detail distinct to shock waves embedded in
rocks, mountains and entire mountain
chains. Scalable, harmonic, self-similarity
plastered across the globe landscape everywhere I looked
could only be from one cause: sustained plasma storms.
I finally had evidence, from personal
investigation - from a position of knowing -
what caused patterns, at least many that I saw on
Earth and that we indeed live in an Electric Universe.
Only a charged environment could develop
supersonic winds that could freeze rock
in-situ in the precise form of a shock
wave. Coulomb force and recombination is
the only process that makes physical sense.
A dusty plasma environment would
accelerate winds to supersonic speeds,
rippling the landscape wherever shock
waves reflected and segregating 
winds by step voltage and ionic density.
To produce what I witness on Earth's
crust, Earth's atmosphere had to be a
rainbow-banded chemical soup, like
Jupiter's atmosphere. There had to be
several global storms to produce the
layers of geology and episodic fossil
evidence of extinctions - a recurring nightmare.
And since I've written several articles
showing the shock features in detail,
showing self-similarity between
Jupiter's storms and landforms on Earth,
and exploring many other geologic
examples of electrical formation and
scarring, I know what I'm showing you is
the truth. The patterns speak for themselves.
My explanations may suck. I may not
describe the electric circuit properly,
or organize my streams of conscience
well, but the geology is there, Jupiter is
there, winds, storms, rocks - it's all out
there to go look at for yourself. The
data I use is open source, available to
anyone with an internet connection. One
can research shockwave patterns, standing
waves, separation bubbles and anything else
I write about with a few clicks of a mouse.
You can see the patterns for yourself.
It's the only thing that will invoke
faith, because that is what knowing the
truth comes down to: faith. This brings me
to the point. Faith is how you know the truth.
Faith in yourself. Do you believe your lying eyes?
I'm not speaking about faith in God,
although that is the ultimate faith. I'm
using a small “f” faith to mean conviction
in any particular realm, such as the
faith one has they can unerringly find
their mother's face in a crowd, or ride a
bike. It's a reliance on all your senses,
conscious and unconscious. You recognize
the pattern and your gut, heart and soul
resonate. It feels right. It's common
sense. When you know, you know.
How else can one know they are objective
unless they know and trust themselves?
It's an internal thing, to be confident
in oneself, and the only way to satisfy 
that is to see, hear and feel for yourself.
Relying on someone else's word makes one a 
parrot. Now this brings to question how can I
have faith I know what I'm seeing when pretty much
the entire world of academia ’knows’ I'm wrong
and that tectonic forces like subduction,
expansion and uplift created mountains,
plus billions and billions of years, blah,
blah, blah. Because they don't show you
anything but drawings and models. They
can't explain or even try the fractal forms;
the harmonic repetitions; the phase-
angled vectors of frequency interference.
Their explanations don't explain; they
describe processes that no one has ever
seen. The one thing they never talk 
about is electricity in circuits, which is like
explaining life without mentioning breathing.
And if you dig down to their fundamental
assumptions that underlie the whole
house of cards, you'll find it's based on
unfalsifiable billions and billions of
years, dark energy-type dreamed up
concepts force-fed by whatever humpty- dumps 
were in charge. In other words, to believe them is to
trust them rather than yourself. And, they're 
idiots. I also know, because I worked in the
energy industry, that much of science is
political, not truthful. It's marketing -
it's meant to persuade you, not inform you.
This corruption is pervasive throughout quakademia.
If you seek the truth without fear,
or bias, you'll know when you find it
because you'll find confirmation. It will 
present itself - you just need to be aware.
A week ago I camped on flat “alluvial” plane
covered in gravel near the Colorado River.
I knew the plane to be a windblown feature
created in the arc-blast of a discharge event.
It had nothing to do with an ancient riverbed
as consensus theory would have you believe.
So, I began examining the gravel. It was
predominantly typical river rock, rounded
by water erosion as consensus theory goes.
But as I picked up rock after rock, a specific
pattern became evident. Many, if not 
most of the rocks I looked at had a flat side.
One side was rounded and polished as if
washed by sand and water, but the other
side was flat. Which entirely confirmed
my expectation, because I suspected such
gravel to be the result of rock rain.
These “river rocks” fell like rain after
being blasted into the sky as molten
glass and reconstituted as drops and
hailstones. The ones that were still
hot and molten inside but had a cooled
crust, landed like pudding drops, making
the flat bottom. And the top, exposed to
winds, still screaming, made elongated and
rounded streamlined tops to the drops.
You know these rocks. They're the 
best ones to skip across the lake.
The flat bottom is the tell. Water
erosion does not explain that. The rock
rain was a pleasant surprise. I wasn't
looking for it - it was just there where I
camped. This happens almost continuously from things as
mundane as gravel, because the entire planet is evidence.
One will also find along the way people
like the demolitions expert whose blog
and identity is somewhere in the way-back machine.
I'd like to thank and credit him. I just lost his identity.
Obscure blogs and videos arrive in my
streams weekly that either Inspire new
insight, or confirm a prior postulation. Seek and
you will find, because that's part of the pattern.
I watch YouTube channels with less than 500
subscribers who know better than professors;
people with no academic background but
with curious minds who examine magnetism
and electricity with products from eBay.
I listen to people with spiritual
connections whose faith comes from
experiences scoffed at by consensus science.
I read random articles in the news... find rocks 
here and there. I live a continuous stream of
synchronicities. Information specific to
my questions arrives at my doorstep, as if
asking the right question is all the invitation
Nature needs. The universe wants to show itself to
those who want the truth. The evidence is everywhere.
Personal observations led us to know that the
Universe is electric. We all recognize the obvious:
plasma nebula, swirling galaxies and everywhere
the blaze of electro-magnetic balls of discharge
called stars. We can see what a crater really is, and
therefore lose no sleep wondering why so many are
hexagonal. We know, thanks to Halton Arp, that
redshift isn’t a measuring stick and his
evidence alone makes the whole Big Bang
thing nonsense. We know weather 
and climate is the Earth's circuitry in
action, and therefore aren't shamed by our carbon
footprint. What binds us all is truly electric. The
ether flows through us, as the light and
warmth that generates the hologram, so
there must be a common carrier wave at its frequency 
we all receive. Wouldn't any creature evolve the ability
to ‘hear’ it, given its all-encompassing preeminence?
Notwithstanding the uniquely human inability to listen,
it seems a natural thing for life to feel that energy.
Think of the mysterious animal behaviors,
like foreknowledge of severe weather and earth-
quakes. A pet knowing when a master is on the
way home. Telepathic signals are real in
my humble opinion and they have a physics.
But one must acknowledge an ether 
and look inward to find how to tune in.
In this regard, we are all scientists, by my 
definition. We each took a look and said that's
electric, because it so obviously is.
Recognizing the obvious is critical
thinking. Manipulating math to invent
invisible forces, energies and matter is,
of course the ultimate woo. One 
can make math simulate anything if
you're the one making the rules. Truth 
comes about due to intent. Truth is
accessible to anyone with the
unflinching intent to find it and speak
it because it's out there waiting for you.
As more people become tired of the BS,
they will look for new answers. I expect many will 
find us. I expressed this expectation to Wal late
last year in a few brief email exchanges.
He agreed the future will be amazing.
He also said keep finding the patterns.
Why I think this is a fitting testimony
for Wal, is because he and Dave created
this environment to explore truth.
And that is Wal's Legacy. Cheers to anyone 
who follows it. Shine on, you crazy diamond!

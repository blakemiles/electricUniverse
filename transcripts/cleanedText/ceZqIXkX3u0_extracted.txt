Rosetta Mission Update
Jets of Comet 67P â€• Failed "Explanations" Continue
It seems that the puzzle of cometary
jets continues to haunt comet science.
The mystery has been stated
and restated for decades.
But it's possible that a
resolution is now within reach
through the Rosetta mission to
comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
As a comet moves into
the inner solar system,
surface activity creates a cloud of gas and
dust to form a roughly spherical coma.
With a closer look, we see radial
jets erupting from the surface
at remarkable velocities to feed
gas and dust into the coma.
What is acting on the
surface to create the jets?
And what is holding the accelerated
gas and dust in its collimated form,
a persistently narrow and
filamentary structure
in the vacuum of
interplanetary space.
Rosetta investigators have calculated the
speed of the 67P jets at their source.
They give the figure as
700 meters per second.
That means gas and dust
departing the comet nucleus
at a speed of 7,5 football
fields in one second.
Theorists have offered an
explanation of a comet's jets.
Uneven warming of an
irregular surface
creates pockets of sublimating
gases beneath the surface.
These pockets of gas become the
reservoirs of geyser-like activity.
"Gas and dust bursts
forth like a geyser...
An area below the surface warms up
and punches through the surface
with explosive force due
to its gas content.
In comets, the emerging gas carries
a stream of dust along with it."
But the theory offered cannot be
reconciled with data now in hand.
The speed of 67P's jets is significantly
greater than the speed of gas
escaping through a small hole
in a high-pressure gas line.
But the shallow surface
layer of dry dust on 67P,
offers nothing like the resistance
necessary to build up such pressure.
And if the jets do indeed
point to subsurface pockets
of gas breaking through
a dusty surface,
it seems quite clear that the signature of
such activity would be readily apparent.
An energy curve suggestive of an
explosive release of gas pressure.
And an explosive expansion and
dissipation of the released gas
across a short distance
in the vacuum of space.
And of course, we would also
expect immediate exposure
of the supposedly sublimating
ice beneath the dry surface.
Do we see any sign of these expected
signatures of jet chambers below the surface?
It's fair to say that to date nothing
of the sort has been observed.
And yet, the creation of comet jets, the
acceleration away from the nucleus
and the structure maintained
across vast distances,
must have a reasonable
explanation
even if we have to look beyond
standard theory to find it.
It was just a few years ago that the
spectacular jets of comet Hartley 2
placed a huge exclamation point
on the need for new perspectives.
Powerful jets were seen not just
from the sunlit side of the comet
but from the region in shadow
and the persistent energies of
the jets offered no support
for the standard idea of
exploding pockets of gas.
All we've actually seen at
the source of comet jets,
is evidence of electrical
activity on the surface,
extending valleys by eroding
away cliffs, mesas and ridges.
We saw this on comet Tempel 1
where such activity had eroded
a mesa cliff some 35 meters.
Considering the simplicity of the
standard model of cometary jet activity,
one wonders why no experimental
verification has ever been produced.
One of the simplest experiments conceivable
would simply use a laboratory vacuum chamber,
place into the chamber the ideal
concoction of ice and dust
just to see if remote warming would produce
anything like the jet activity imagined.
We unhesitatingly predict that when the
obvious required experiment is performed,
it will leave every comet investigator
in a state of profound disillusionment.
Cometary jets are not
driven by thermodynamics.
They are electrical phenomena naturally
occurring in the transaction
between a charged body, a comet, and
the electric field of the Sun.

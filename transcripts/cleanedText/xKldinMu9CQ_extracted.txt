There are many names associated with the
development of the electric and plasma
universe. Some get more recognition than
others. In this episode, I want to cover
someone who is often cited by the late
Wal Thornhill, but probably is a name
that you are not familiar with. Charles
Edward Rose Bruce was a quite remarkable
man who saw a deep connection between sparks,
discharges, lightning and the cosmos at large.
Who was he and what remarkable insights did 
he provide? He was born the son of a tailor and
graduated from the University of
Edinburgh with first class honors in
mathematics and natural philosophy.
He then joined the Electrical Research
Association in Leatherhead, England.
Bruce's early years at the Electrical
Research Association was spent working
on the analysis of oil-based circuit
breakers. He published a sequence of
papers on the subject, including one that
won The Institution of Electrical
Engineers’ Kelvin premium award. This
helped keep the ERA at the leading edge of the
rapidly growing circuit breaker technology.
Then in 1939, he shifted his attention to
lightning. Two years later, he would
publish a paper simply titled, “The
Lightning Discharge” which would end up
being heavily cited and once more
win him the Kelvin premium award. His
contributions to the subject include
the significant strengthening of the
electrical gradient, known to occur in lightning strikes, 
as well as a demonstration that the grounding of
transmission lines would be counter-
productive. After attending a lecture
on astrophysics at the Edinburgh University in 1941, he
became very interested in exploring this, together with his
understanding of electricity. During this lecture,
the lecturer referred to a solar prominence which
reached a height of 1 million kilometers in an 
hour. Charles Bruce quickly deduced that its
velocity of propagation was almost exactly that of a
lightning leader stroke and that, since it moved like
lightning it probably was lightning of some 
form. Soon after this, he developed a theory
that solar prominences consisted of electrical discharges
in plasma, rather than that of moving solar matter.
He would go on to publish over a hundred
papers concerning the electrical basis
of various cosmological phenomena.
In 1946 and 1947 he was elected as a
fellow of The Institute of Physics and
The Institute of Electrical Engineers.
Despite this, his work would be largely ignored by
mainstream science. In 1944, he produced a privately
published monograph titled, “A New
Approach in Astrophysics and Cosmogony”.
It was spurred on by a lack of success
in mainstream science at the time, to
explain the major phenomena in astrophysics.
He saw that gravitational masses, like stars,
were centers of energy liberation and also the origin 
of high-speed electrically charged particles, which
over time, results in the formation of huge 
charged atmospheres, so that masses
beyond a certain size become centers
of extensive and mainly radial electric
fields. These naturally give rise to conduction
processes tending to neutralize the currents. It is the
resulting electrical discharges which determine
the nature and direction of universal evolution.
He still viewed stars as being composed
of material that at the heart is powered
by nuclear reactions. This engine would provide the
separation of charge and lead to the discharge events.
This would then be the start of a new
sequence, the atmosphere condensing on a
reduced scale of aggregation which in turn would 
become the center of an extensive radial electric field.
He saw the same mechanism happening in nebulae,
stars, and planets. Now this is very different in some
respects from the Electric Sun model we have
today, but you will recognize many similarities.
He points out that it is no coincidence
that the photosphere has the appearance,
temperature, and spectrum of an electric arc. A large
number of arcs occur in parallel. These quickly result in
neutralization of the accumulated space charge in their
neighborhood and go out. These are therefore not stable
discharges, but are more like a transient
spark. In his view it is the coming and
going of these discharges which accounts for
the observed granulation of the solar surface.
In his model, sunspots are explained because those huge
discharges drain away the current from the neighboring
photospheric arc channels and extinguish those 
arcs. He saw that there was much evidence in
support of his model. This included
solar flares which, at the time, had been
shown to have circular magnetic fields
surrounding them. He estimated that the
current of these was about 10 to the 14
amps. These give rise to a broadening of
the hydrogen alpha lines due to the
Zeeman effect. The variation of these
line widths follows the rapid rise of
the current in the flare to a maximum,
followed by the slower fall, analogous to what is
observed in terrestrial lightning current waves.
The Crab Nebula’s filamentary structure
provides striking visual evidence of the
origin of this structure in electrical discharges. The 
light from the Crab Nebula also shows substantial
polarization which has allowed them to
partially map the magnetic fields in the Nebula.
The result of this mapping is that the field is such
as would be observed if the filaments carried currents.
Novae show light curves that have
a sudden onset followed by a slower
decline. This is characteristic of an
electrical discharge. The rapid increase
in emission line width in the Nova
spectrum is generally believed to be a
Doppler broadening but is also readily
explained as Zeeman broadening.
In 1958, Bruce presented one of his
papers at the second USAF conference on
atmospheric electricity. In it he pointed
out that there should exist galaxies
which are radiating an inordinate amount
of energy, which should correspond to the
naked-eye phase of a Nova outburst.
And this peak-current phase of a galactic
discharge should last for millions of years.
Four years later, the first quasar was
discovered, and in due course their lifetimes were
recognized to be millions to tens of millions of years.
Much of this work was driven by his
desire to understand lightning. Based on
his extensive studies of atmospheric
electrostatic field building and
electrical discharge characteristics, he
developed a new theory of discharge
propagation for the breakdown of
electrostatic fields in cosmological
atmospheres, which is different 
from normal long spark or terrestrial
lightning discharges. The main difference
is categorized by the temperature in the
leader stroke, which for cosmological atmospheres,
would be of the order of eight million degrees.
In long cosmical electric discharges,
a point is reached at which a radical
change will occur in the whole propagation 
process. In the discharge channel, a jet of gas
will be generated, which will flow along
the axis of the channel towards its
advancing head. As the temperature of 
the channel rises, so also will the velocity
of the jet. At a certain point, the velocity of the hot
gas will exceed that of the normal process of voltage
breakdown in a hydrogen atmosphere.
From that point onwards, the propagation
will depend on the jet of hot gas. And the
 velocity will depend on its temperature.
These velocities could exceed 4,000 kilometers 
per second. In this paper on the extension of
atmospheric to space electricity, he points out that 
there are two thermometers which can be used to
estimate the temperature of the electrical discharges,
whether in a laboratory, atmospheric or cosmic.
The first derives from an effect which
was first emphasized by Velaski in 1937.
The pressure in the actual regions of
an electric discharge is increased by an
amount proportional to the product of
the current and the current density as a
result of the movement of the conducting particles in 
the discharge's own magnetic field. In an electric arc the
current density increases at and towards
the electrode spots. Therefore, pressure
gradients are set up which give rise to the anode and
cathode jets. Their velocity will be that of the sound
in the gas. If it can be determined, we 
will have a measure of the temperature.
Applied to the lightning discharge, the theory explains
the existence of metallic lines in the spectrum of the
discharge up to the heights of two meters above the ground.
And applied to an arc weld, it explains the physical
basis of arc welding. The second thermometer derives
from an observed relationship between the level
of excitation and the discharge temperature. If, for
example, the level of excitation observed is nine electron-
volts, then the discharge temperature will be 10,000
times more in Kelvin, so in this case 9,000 Kelvin.
Based on this, he outlined that discharges in cosmic
sources should be characterized by the following: rate of
propagation; the speed of breakdown is
proportional to the breakdown field and
the mean free path; the limiting field is
proportional to the gas pressure; and the
mean free path is inversely proportional
to it. So, there is no resultant dependence
on the rate of propagation on the pressure.
It may be possible for the discharge to
generate a plasma jet with a velocity higher than the
rate of voltage breakdown. In this case, the discharge may
then propagate at the plasma velocity. Magnetic fields
will be associated with a flow of current in a discharge.
The fields are circular around the axis of the discharge.
This can be recognized by the polarization and Zeeman
broadening of the radiation emitted from within 
them. Pinch effect. The conducting particles in
an electric discharge are within the
discharge's own magnetic field which
exert upon them a centripetal force
proportional to the current and the
current density. This results in an increase of
the pressure towards the axis of the discharge.
Plasma jets. If either the current or the
current density varies along the channel
of a discharge, there will be a corresponding gradient
of the axial pressure. This creates a jet of hot gas,
or plasma, which will be accelerated
along the discharge. This is the origin
of the anode- and cathode-jets observed
in the laboratory discharges. The speed
of the jet is limited to the speed of sound
in the medium of which it is composed.
In ionized hydrogen, the sonic speed is
12 kilometers per second at 10,000 Kelvin.
It varies as the square root of the
absolute temperature. The velocities
observed in the discharge plasmas may be interpreted
in terms of the temperature of the discharge.
Current waveform. The current in an
electrical discharge builds up rapidly
to a peak value and then decays on a slower time 
scale. Anomalous waveforms, sometimes shown by
high current lightning strokes, arise from 
the self-extinction by the pinch effect.
Radiation of atmospherics. A lightning flash or other
discharge radiates atmospherics of a characteristic
waveform. Parallel discharges will attract one 
another. Balls of hot plasma escape at sudden
bends in the discharge. The bends
constitute holes in the magnetic field
of the discharge through which the gas compressed by
the field, can escape. His many years of research on
atmospheric astrophysics convinced him
that not only was the Sun dominated by
electrical discharge, but the universe
was so to speak, all electric. And that
the electric fields and their breakdown
in electrical discharges account for the
observed phenomena, and accelerate 
the process of universal evolution from the
universe to galaxies, from galaxies to 
stars, and from stars to planets. He viewed
atmospheric astrophysics as merely 
an extension of atmospheric electricity.
In his view, these would be a far 
better explanation for the existence of
magnetic fields, relativistic electrons, gas jets,
the formation of spiral arms, stellar nova, etc.
He noted that many phenomena seen
above the surface of stars, can be
explained as analogues, but on a much
larger scale, of lightning discharges
observed in the atmosphere of Earth.
Although Bruce felt that the charging
mechanism for each process was contained
locally, he thought that it was not a vital
precondition of the recognition of
electrical discharges as observed
phenomena. As Professor Birch remarked,
to deny the existence of what cannot be
explained would leave very little work
to do. He felt it very probable that the
charging mechanism for each phenomenon
was the same: a collision between solid
particles. The asymmetrical interaction of particles
of similar materials leads to charge segregation.

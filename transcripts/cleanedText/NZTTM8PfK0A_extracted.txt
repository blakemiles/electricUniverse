Where exactly is cosmology headed?
Can it change without actually changing?
Can you save a house with a crumbling
foundation by adding a new roof, or might
it be time to look for a new home?
The Standard Model of cosmology is in a
state of crisis and inevitably heading
towards revolution. Let's delve deeper
into Thomas Kuhn's criteria for
revolution and explore if there are
currently any cosmological models that meet 
his criteria. When a scientific model is in crisis,
i.e. plagued by mounting anomalies and
contradictions that the model cannot resolve,
then it can no longer be considered a
reliable guide to problem solving and
will eventually be replaced by a different 
model. This is the model revolution stage of
the paradigm shift cycle. it begins with the
emergence of a new model, or models, that speak a
fundamentally different language, making the old
and new models irreconcilable and incompatible.
Which means that they cannot co-exist. Simply 
put, the main criteria for model revolution
is a new model that speaks a
fundamentally different language and is
incompatible with the existing model.
For the purpose of this analysis,
I use the word ‘language’ to refer to
’paradigmatic language’ by which I mean
how a paradigm talks about and describes
the things it observes in nature.
A change in paradigm is ultimately a change of
world view. So, are there presently any cosmological
models that speak a fundamentally different
paradigmatic language with a different worldview?
In order to explore this question, we
must first establish the lexicon of the
Standard Model. To put a complex subject
in admittedly reduced terms, I have
distilled from the Standard Model lexicon
the following three foundational
concepts and assumptions in order of significance.
Gravity, as the principal cosmological force;
General Relativity, as defining and/or in relation
to gravity; and the Big Bang, meaning an expanding
Universe , birthed by a Big Bang.
These concepts are complementary and
interdependent, while also engendering the
majority of other concepts and hypotheses
contained within the Standard Model.
So, are there presently any models
that deviate from one or more of these
foundational concepts and assumptions?
Let's look at what the mainstream has
to say about alternative cosmologies.
In mainstream science, alternatives are sometimes
described as physics beyond the Standard Model or BSN,
which quote, “...refers to the theoretical
developments needed to explain the
deficiencies of the Standard Model” - end 
quote. According to mainstream scientists,
theories that lie beyond the Standard
Model include various extensions of the
Standard Model, as well as what they
describe as ‘entirely novel explanations’
such as string theory, M theory, and extra dimensions.
Examples of extensions include ‘eternal
inflation’ theory and the ‘oscillating’
model of the Universe. I will leave it to
cosmologists and astrophysicists to explain
and explore the details of these hypotheses.
For the purpose of my analysis, what matters is that
both of these theories rely on the Standard Model's
foundational assumption and lexicon about a Big
Bang and are therefore not sufficiently different.
Even early Big Bang rivals, such as
Steady State theory, rely on foundational
assumptions and concepts such as
gravity, is the driving force of the
Universe as well as expansion. Another mainstream
alternative is Modified Newtonian Dynamics or MOND.
MOND quote, “...proposes a modification of
Newton's law of universal gravitation to
account for observed properties of
galaxies....It is an alternative to the
hypothesis of Dark Matter in terms of
explaining why galaxies do not appear to
obey the currently understood laws of physics.” end
quote. In other words, MOND and its variants, are
an attempt to address one of the many
anomalies and crises of the Standard Model.
While it is touted as an alternative
that can eliminate the problems created
by the hypothesis of Dark Matter,
MOND is still gravity-centric and
actually increases the galactic effects
of gravity. It also relies on many of the
main assumptions and concepts of the Standard
Model with the obvious exception of Dark Matter.
Thus, as is the case with the other
extensions, MOND is also not a viable
alternative in the Kuhnian sense.
Overall, an extension to the Standard
Model by its very definition could never
be seen as containing a fundamentally
different paradigmatic language.
While these extensions arose to address
problems and deficiencies in the
Standard Model by further contributing
to the complexity of the model, they ultimately
exacerbate the crisis in contemporary cosmology.
Let us recall that increasing
complexity is an indication of crisis.
Moving on to the so-called entirely
novel explanations such as string theory
M theory and extra dimensions, the main
thing worth noting for our purposes is
that these still treat gravity as the
main driving force in the Universe.
They too cannot be seen as speaking a
fundamentally different paradigmatic
language and do not qualify as serious
theoretical considerations for a new model.
These are but a few examples of the
mainstream alternatives that exist. Again,
I leave it to those more versed in
the hard sciences, to sift through or
evaluate all of the possible add-ons and
extensions to the Standard Model. As a
critical discourse analyst, working
within the Kuhnian framework, I am
interested in identifying alternative models
that meet the criteria for model revolution.
Ones that self-consciously and directly
espouse a fundamentally different
language with a different view of the cosmos.
One model that I'm familiar with and
that also stands out for speaking
a radically different paradigmatic
language is the Electric Universe model
of cosmology, or EU model for short.
Proponents of this model subconsciously espouse
a completely different language and world view.
Let's look at some examples in the words of its
advocates. In an introduction to an essay in The
Secular Heretic by EU physicist and
pioneer Wal Thornhill, the magazine's
editors describe the EU model as the science
of the 21st century, telling its readers quote,
”Set aside everything you think you know
about all things great and small because
the ideas presented in the Electric
Universe  overturn it all.” End quote.
Referring to the EU model's take on the suppositions
of standard cosmology, they note the following.
Quote, “Was there a Big Bang? Not likely.
Einstein's Relativity? Doesn't hold up.
Is the Sun a thermonuclear fusion reactor which
will eventually run out of fuel and burn out? Nope.
Are there black holes? No such thing.
What about dark matter and dark energy?
Forget about that nonsense and start learning
about the science of the 21st century.” End quote.
Implied in this statement is the idea
that the EU calls into question most
of the foundational concepts and assumptions
of standard cosmology. So what about gravity?
This is arguably the most important point of 
departure. For the EU model the Universe's nature
cannot be explained by gravity alone.
Moreover, according to Thornhill quote,
”Unlike the Standard Model, the EU model
has a physical model for gravity as a
manifestation of the electric dipole
force.” End quote. In the Standard Model,
gravity is the fundamental organizing force in
the cosmos. On the macro scale the Universe is
dominated by gravity, but in the Electric Universe
model the electric force is the fundamental
organizing force at all scales.
According to EU advocates,
quote, “...the gravitational theorem does
not single-handedly provide all the answers
required by physical science, particularly in
deep space.... gravitational theory struggles to
explain many anomalies in observation....
Today's most vexing scientific anomalies
point to an unexpected - at times dominating
- role of the electric force.” End quote.
The EU model does not deny the role of gravity in
the Universe. On the contrary, as the model explains,
quote, ”The Electric Universe concept
emerged from the principles of empirical
physical science as expressed by such
pioneers as Galileo, Kepler and Newton...
However, there's an important corollary
to the gravitational theorem and that is
the electrical force.” End quote.
Due to the hierarchical structure of the
gravity - relativity - Big Bang lexicon that
I identified at the beginning, if the first
foundational concept, i.e. gravity is the
organizing force in the Universe,  is
compromised, then it stands to reason
that the other two would also be called
into question. if the Standard Model’s
views on gravity as organizing force are
wrong, then General Relativity would be
rendered irrelevant, and the Big Bang
improbable. For instance, based on what
the EU model has to say about gravity,
the question of a Big Bang becomes moot.
According to Wal Thornhill, quote, “There
was no Big Bang and we do not know 
the origin of the Universe.” End quote.
What about theories such as dark matter,
dark energy, black holes, gravitational
waves, etc.? While they are presented
as declarative truths or foregone
conclusions by mainstream science, EU
advocates would caution that these
concepts are physically undefined and remain ad hoc
hypotheses. This is because paradigmatic lexicons
can trap scientists in a discursive
prison that limits the way they can talk
about, or even think about, what is observed.
In a paradigm shift, the new paradigm
typically understands the language of the old or
existing model, but does not agree with it. The old
paradigm, however, is restricted in its
ability to understand, or even consider
the language of the new model. For
example, because the Standard Model does
not allow for cohesive electrical effects in
space, they are limited to describing much of
the interstellar medium as gas, whereas 
the EU model describes it as plasma.
Not least because over 99% of the known Universe
is made up of electrically charged plasma.
Standard Model scientists know what
plasma is, but given their paradigmatic
assumptions, they default to language and
therefore, the physical properties of gas.
In exploring some of the most important
differences between the two models, I do
not claim to assert whether or not
the EU model is poised to replace the
Standard Model. As Mel Acheson has
noted, the EU model is still evolving and
remains a work in progress. However, 
looking at the paradigm shift framework,
one could not ask for a better example
of a model that meets all of the
requirements of the model revolution stage,
embodying what it means for a model to
speak a fundamentally different language, and be
incompatible with the dominant, or existing model.
Moreover, as I have discussed elsewhere,
the EU model is also arguably less
complex, thereby satisfying part of
Kuhn's requirement for paradigm change.
In this respect the Electric Universe model cannot be
seen as an add-on or extension to the Standard Model.
It is by the aforementioned measures a
fundamentally different cosmological paradigm.

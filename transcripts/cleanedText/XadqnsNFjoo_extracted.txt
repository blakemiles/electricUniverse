The Electric Universe
The Electric Universe
-- Predictions & Surprises --
The space sciences today face
a quandary that won't go away.
Why have the greatest discoveries
come as a shock to astronomers?
Since the beginning
of the space age,
these surprises have occurred
at all scales of observation,
from remote galaxies down to our
own neighborhood in the Milky Way,
where planets and
moons circle the Sun.
We've seen this story a
hundred times and more
as new data sent theorists
back to the drawing board.
Contrast this quandary to the
record of the Electric Universe.
This new paradigm is in its
early phase of emergence
but its core prediction
is crystal clear.
When we examine energetic events
in space, we will always find
electromagnetic intensities far beyond the
ability of prior theory to explain them.
The impressive record of this
prediction arises from a singular fact:
that electricity, not just gravity,
is highly active across the cosmos.
Science advances through the
predictive ability of new ideas.
Ideas that connect observed facts
to causes that can be named.
Things already known and
things yet to be discovered
become predictable when seen in
the light of a new interpretation.
And so, the Electric Universe
predicts and explains
the spectacular jets emitted
from galactic cores,
the remarkable hourglass
forms of stellar nebulae,
and the acceleration of the solar
wind out past the planets.
Dozens of surprises follow logically and
inescapably from the proposed cause
but this is something you
have to see for yourself.
The great discoveries are no
longer surprises as year by year
the space sciences look more and
more like the Electric Universe.

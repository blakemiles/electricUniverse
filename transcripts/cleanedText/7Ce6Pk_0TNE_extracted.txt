On February 15th 2013, a large
meteor exploded violently
in the sky over the
Urals region Russia.
Thousands of homes and buildings were
damaged and more than 1,400 were injured
by the explosion which
produced as much energy
as two dozen Hiroshima
sized atomic bombs.
The object was the largest to
strike the Earth in over a century
since the Tunguska
meteor of 1908.
Astronomers tell us that meteors
are electrically neutral rocks
that sometimes explode due to heating
and pressure in Earth's atmosphere.
But when we examine the Russian meteor,
does this explanation fit with the facts?
Well, it was big, they say it was the biggest
thing to hit the Earth in 100 years.
It didn't really hit the
surface of the Earth
because it exploded
high in the atmosphere
and this itself raises
an important question
because it's not actually
understood how all this happened.
Ironically the event was caught on many
cameras because Russian drivers,
in order to defend
themselves in court
or to collect insurance, had
installed dashboard cameras.
So many were driving eastward in the
vicinity of Chelyabinsk, Russia,
February 15th, and suddenly
they and their cameras
had a perfect view of
an incredible spectacle
as this cosmic intruder
lit up the dawn sky.
Based on infrasound data from around
the world, NASA scientists now say
that the meteorite was more than 1,000
times larger than originally believed
this modified conclusion reveals
the difficulty for astronomers
in explaining the extraordinary
energies of the exploding meteor.
The evolving scientific interpretations
during the day are interesting
particularly the interpretations
of size based on visual data.
Initial estimates, coming from
the Russian Academy of Sciences
implied a small body
weighing perhaps 10 tons
but just a bit later in the morning
astonishing infrasound data
from stations as far
away as Greenland and Africa came in
at the low frequencies of infrasound
well below human hearing
the event was heard
around the world.
NASA then released new
estimates of size,
not 10 tons, but 10,000 tons!
The implied energies were
incomparably greater
than the visual trail in the
sky had initially suggested.
In fact, that trail alone made
it look as if the bolide
was fully degraded before
reaching the ground.
Complicating this question of size is the
fact that the envisioned 10,000 ton body
failed to create any
impact site on Earth.
But if the picture
is left in confusion
that's because no one has addressed the
evident electrical component of the event.
Infrasound is the efficient vehicle for
sound transmission from electrical blasts
such as lightning from
the upper atmosphere.
It's electrical energy that fills in
the missing pieces of the story.
Scientists loosely concluded that the
rock was perhaps 55 feet in diameter
arriving at 40,000 miles per hour,
producing a trail some 125 miles long.
A huge explosion high in the atmosphere
produced a shockwave injuring 1,400 people,
largely from flying glass.
That explosion makes this an
unprecedented event in modern times.
This entire display
occurred in just 30 seconds,
and it's been assumed that
the explosion occurred
because of internal
heat and pressure.
But how likely is it that in just
30 seconds the center of the rock
could be heated to the temperatures
required for it to explode?
When larger meteorites
have landed on the Earth
very quickly, they became stone-cold due
to the freezing internal temperatures.
If you're wondering about this
you might try an experiment.
Take an acetylene torch to a
good-sized rock for 30 seconds,
you'll create a surface temperature
over 1,600 degree Celsius,
more than 3,000
degrees Fahrenheit,
you'll see that the heat from melting
rock has not been transferred
more than a few inches at most.
But somehow due to energies
inside the Russian fireball,
it exploded so violently
and so completely
that only tiny gravelly
pieces could be found.
And incidentally it was
briefly thought that
a 20 foot hole in the ice of
a lake west of Chelyabinsk
was caused by residual
chunk of the bolide,
so divers investigated,
they could find nothing.
Disintegration began some
30 miles above the Earth
then in just half a minute
it released the energy
of some 20 or more Hiroshima
sized atomic bombs
including a blinding flash that was described
by one observer as bright as 10 Suns.
Onlookers had to turn
away from the glare.
It's hard to see how the common
picture could even work.
Heat the leading edge of the rock
just to a melting temperature
and every bit of melted rock would
continually be blown off the object
by the winds at thousands
of miles per hour.
How could this spectacular blaster of light
by this object be produced in such a way?
The blinding flare-up
saturated the cameras,
a perfect analogy to the electric glare
of an arc furnace or an arc welder.
One video in particular
requires closer examination,
because it's suggestive of exploding
material much like you see in arc welding
projected in the direction
of the objects flight.
We can't vouch for the authenticity of
this video, nor should we ignore it.
We can only hope it will be scrutinized
up to the level it deserves.
What is certain is that
the meteor did explode
and in the manner expected
of a charged body
disintegrating under
electrical stresses.
You see this in an
exploding capacitor
as non conductive material
violently breaks down,
that's the electrical interpretation
of this Russian meteor explosion.
Another example in the
electrical viewpoint
would be the sudden flaring and
disintegration of negatively charged comets,
as occurred in the cases
of the comet Elenin,
comet Holmes,
comet Schwassmann-Wachmann,
comet LINEAR and others
the demise of the comets occured
not due to warming from the Sun,
but in response to charged
particles from the Sun.
Astronomers now suggest that the Russian
meteor should serve as a catalyst
for developing anti-asteroid
and meteor defense systems.
But to proponents at the Electric Universe,
the Russian meteor validates the notion
that the Earth possesses a natural
defense against impacting bodies.
Celestial intruders such
as asteroids and meteors
are more likely to produce catastrophe,
not from the kinetic forces of impact
but rather from electrical
discharge explosions.
Not to be forgotten in this connection
is the famous predecessor event,
the Tunguska explosion in 1908,
when a cometary or asteroidial
body exploded above Siberia
leveling 800 square miles of
forest, some 80 million trees,
breaking windows more than 100 miles away,
but leaving no appreciable impact crater.
Both the recent event and the Tunguska event
remind us of Wal Thornhill's suggestion,
that the Earth has a natural
electrical defense system,
one that would cause a larger
bodies to disintegrate
on entering the charged region
of Earth's upper atmosphere.
This wouldn't eliminate
the catastrophic effects,
but it would surely displace
the most popular image
of asteroidal catastrophe
on the Internet today.
So perhaps one fact is more significant
than has been acknowledged:
despite hundreds injuries, not a
single individual died in this event.
Something far more devastating
would surely have occurred
if the object had released the
energy of its explosive blast
by striking the
surface of the Earth.

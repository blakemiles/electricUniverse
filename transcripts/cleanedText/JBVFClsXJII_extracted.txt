Welcome to the Thunderbolts.info
podcast for july 15, 2016.
In the last two episodes, David Talbott,
the director of the Thunderbolts project,
has outlined the foundations
of his working relationship
with one of the world's leading
plasma physicists, Dr. Anthony Peratt
and the impact that this relationship
had on Peratt's life work and career.
As David described, Peratt's research proves
undeniably that high energy plasma events
occurred in the earthly sky within human
memory and were recorded in rock art
and cave drawings in various locations
including the American Southwest.
In this episode, David
explorers, in greater depth,
one of the most remarkable
rock art motifs
which has an explicit counterpart in
laboratory experiments with plasma
and that is the Stickman figure,
carved on stone around the world.
Evidence gathered from around the
world has made abundantly clear
that in ancient times intense electrical
activity above observers on earth
was the subject of massive collective
endeavors to record the forms on stone.
Especially compelling is the rock
art theme called the Stickman.
The illustrations shown here
compare a well documented
electric discharge form
in the laboratory
to the remarkably similar rock art carvings
from different parts of the world.
These rock art Stick-men are taken
from Tony Peratt's 2003 paper
in "Transactions on
Plasma Science",
published by the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
Peratt states his
conclusion forthrightly.
The recurring petroglyph patterns are
reproductions of plasma phenomena in space.
Of course the majority
of rock art authorities,
particularly those with primary
interest in Native American sources,
argue that only images of the Sun, Moon and
stars reflect actual celestial phenomena.
Apart from such associations most authorities
claim that global patterns do not exist.
Rather, they tell us, the ancient
artists projected onto stone
the subjective content
of shamanistic trances.
Peratt's investigation
say the opposite,
that the most fundamental patterns of rock
art occur globally through massive labors,
some apparently taking whole
lifetimes, according to Peratt.
The artists carved onto stone, observed
electric discharge phenomena in the heavens.
The stickman configuration occurs
when a disc or donut like torus,
around a linear
discharge column,
is bent by magnetic fields
induced by intense current flow.
From the viewpoint of the observer, the edges
of the upper disk may appear to point up
forming arms and those of the lower torus
may appear to point down forming legs.
The underlying hourglass pattern
with many subtle variations
not only occurs around the world, it
is among the most fundamental forms
appearing in highest energy electric
discharge in the laboratory.
To appreciate the evolution of
the discharge configuration,
these graphics must be
visualized three-dimensionally.
Illustrations show the structure
of a translucent plasma discharge
whose 3d configuration would not be self
evident in a rendition carved on rock.
Here is a key consideration, rotating
the configuration on its axis
would not change the basic form
or appearance to the observer.
Our idealization here of the dynamic
geometry show slight variations
between the upward pointing
and downward pointing components,
consistent with common variations
in the laboratory and in rock art.
The upper champagne glass form
results from a distortion of a disk
as the edges curve upward.
In the warping of the disk below, the
downward curvature is interrupted
at the extremity which bends outward
to create a squashed Bell appearance.
The rock art images we've
noted in this series
are all characteristic of intense
electric discharge in the laboratory.
In the case at hand, the idealization
of the hourglass discharge form,
accents the visual relationship of
the two symmetrical dots or circles
to a transparent donut like
torus - viewed edge on.
But many other nuances of such discharge
configurations must be taken into account
since the warping of the upward and
downward extremities of the hourglass form
can occur in almost
limitless variations.
If Peratt's conclusions are correct,
then several thousand years ago
the terrestrial sky was ablaze
with the electrical activity.
The ramifications of this
possibility will directly affect
our understanding of cultural
roots the world over.
What was the impact of the recorded
events on the early civilizations,
what was the relationship to the
origins of world mythology,
to the birth of the
early religions
or to the massive ancient investments
in monumental construction?
Both the rock artists and the mythmakers
had true perils on their minds.
The rock artists recorded and the mythmakers
interpreted electrical events in the sky
as plasma discharge sequences
moved through discreet phases,
some of celestial beauty, others
intensely violent and terrifying.
The most essential issues
concern the connectedness
between seemingly different
rock art themes.
For example was there relationship between
the Kayenta pictograph previously noted
and the global Stickman image?
Why is the Kayenta form more sparsely recorded
than the worldwide Stickman archetype?
There is good reason for
this, according to Peratt.
The Kayenta pictograph
signifies a critical moment,
just prior to a collapse of that more complex
form into the simpler Stickman form.
The synchrotron radiation proceeding
that transition would have been deadly,
making it close to impossible for humans to
record the form while standing in the open.
This means that the
relationship between the two,
never mentioned in Prior
rock art studies,
is crucial to an understanding
of both global themes.

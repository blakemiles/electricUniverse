Welcome to Space News. This is Andy Hall
and over the course of the past year
I've been presenting a multi-part
series called Eye of the Storm.
In chapter 5, we looked at coronal storms. We 
looked at the San Rafael Swell and Capital Reef,
as well as Monument Valley and the San Juan
River basin as sets of dome and crater piers,
produced in the eye of the great primordial
storm that created the Colorado plateau.
The weather that produced these
domes and craters essentially
consisted of a thunderstorm producing updraft
winds, paired with a cyclone producing a
downdraft at its core. Electrically, it 
formed a ring current between them,
with its lower half being currents in the 
ground. Its upper half consisted of the
mesocyclone and cyclone connected
by a jet stream wind from
updraft to downdraft, forming an arch of condensate.
This loop is what would be under calmer
circumstances the thunderstorm
anvil cloud, a layer of positive charge
forming the top half of the mesocyclone.
But when mesocyclone and cyclone come
together in a turbulent intensely charged
climate, the anvil is swept into a filament that
feeds the downdraft of the cyclone. The 
cyclone and mesocyclone then becomes one
circuit. This is how fractals grow. Circuits
connect together and pairings become groupings
and groupings become networks.
And that is what we see on
Jupiter. The Great Red Spot is a 
network circuit of coronal storm loops.
We also looked at direct visual
evidence of coronal loops on Jupiter
and they happen to be in almost the
exact same pattern in the Great Red Spot
as the dome and crater appears on the Colorado
Plateau, because the storm systems are fractal
and driven by similar circuitry. Also, like the
ground current loops discussed in chapter 9,
these ring currents had DC input from lightning
and plasma winds and current junctions with ground.
So they could act as op-amps, using the 
DC current to amplify the ring current.
That realization was a pretty good egg. But it gets
better. The big Easter egg was finding this type
of storm system depicted in ancient art. In fact
it's depicted on the oldest most controversial
and mysterious megalith ever discovered,
the Vulture Stone at Gobekli Tepe.
The stone T-pillar depicts arch clouds across
the sky, or upper portion of the pillar. Yes,
the mysterious Handbag of the Gods. And this is
just my theory of course, but the handbag depicts
the box-like shape of mesocyclone seen at a
distance, with the arch receding from center to
behind, where it downdrafts into an
unseen cyclone. A distant viewer
would only see a squall line of
thunderstorms surrounding the cyclone
with instead of an anvil cloud, the jet
stream to the cyclone arching away
just as it's depicted on the pillars. Note 
the odd figures above the clouds. I
believe these represent the type of 
thunderstorm discharge we call sprites and gnomes.
In a coronal storm, plasma 
discharges from the cloud tops
would not be as rare as they are today
and not that they are all that rare today.
But in this past environment, they 
would have been lit up like Christmas.
Above and below the clouds is space patterned in
triangles, cut across by a thin layer of rectangles.
This represents the triangular pattern of
rarefaction and compression in supersonic winds,
the narrow layer being a faster jet stream or
lenticular layer between conflicting winds,
with interference patterns making 
the box-like segregations.
The vulture or thunderbird is a stylized
representation of the Peratt instability,
also known as squatter man, which in rock
art is often depicted with a bird's head.
It would have presaged the storm,
appearing in the sky as an aurora
bringing the portent of doom to
come. The legless birds also depict
aurorae that are fractal repetitions, at least
in partial image of the central plasma column.
Below the birds in the base of the T are depictions
of a wolf, representing the howling wind, a
salamander, representing the
tidal floods and a scorpion,
meaning ground-to-ground discharge,
depicted as a dragon in other myths.
Arrow-headed snakes appear here 
and there, representing lightning
or currents. The T-pillar itself represents
Earth in heaven: as above so below.
A popular theory about this stone is that it
actually depicts a comet or meteor strike.
And that's because the bird is holding a ball.
Go figure. I like my interpretation better.
Gobekli Tepe is dated earlier than 9000 BC, 
or the time of the Younger Dryas. It is
also when Plato said Atlantis 
disappeared. And it correlates well,
all things considered, with the time we recall
as Noah's flood, or Gilgamesh, if you prefer. So,
is this a shrine made by survivors? Or 
did it have utility in surviving the storms?
They must have hid underground to survive.
Even if they are in a region of calmer winds,
radiation, lightning and fouled water would have
surely killed them if they were unprotected.
The implication is clear however. At Gobekle
Tepe, as in every ancient myth, there was an
electrical storm the likes of which do not
appear today, caused by some solar system event.
Now the final Easter egg. These handbags are
depicted all over the world in ancient stone work.
The earliest known depictions are in
petroglyphs that can't all be dated, but
are believed to be from before 9,000 BC.
The following is an example from Australia.
If you read this petroglyph, right to left, like a
storyboard, it first shows a small coronal storm on
the right, the rightmost handbag apparently 
forming. Next to it is a larger one, above
streamers rising from the ground.
These would be plasma streamers, like
what forms in a lightning 
connection, only visible in glow mode.
Next, the cloud forms something 
below, while something else
rises to meet it. They look
like hoops or semi-circles.
These would be plasma clouds, reaching 
to meet, also visible in glow mode.
And then there's some kind of squiggly
figure, after which the clouds appear again.
Never mind the kangaroo. The squiggly figure
is the plasma afterglow of a super-sized
lightning bolt. What I believe this
depicts, is the cloud. The entire
mesocyclone of a thunderstorm, collapsed in a
Z-pinch, and then reforming. That would be like a
hydrogen bomb going off. But I'm 
pretty sure that's what we're seeing.
I wonder if there isn't a large crater 
a few miles in front of this rock.
The entire colloquy is represented in stylized
form in the Anunnaki figures in ancient Sumeria;
the handbag and the vine of “pomegranate” 
that looks like the Australian squiggly figure.
They are often holding pine cones, and 
that's I think represents the supersonic winds
thrusting forward at the head of the storm and
the fractal pattern of rarefaction and compression
they would display. In fact, the entire 
figure represents aspects of the storms,
from the bird's head of aurora discharge
to the legs flat-footed on the ground -
one uncovered and billowing muscle, like
the winding up draft to a mesocyclone
and the other covered, unable to 
be seen, like the returning airflow
down a cyclone. It's as if the gods - the winged
anthropomorphized aurora that presaged this storm -
are delivering the storm, 
presenting handbags of terror,
pine cones of destruction, and 
massive thunderbolts of lightning.
It even displays a sense of hierarchy
between heavenly and earthly phenomena,
as in the gods and demigods 
endemic to all ancient religions.
I know people will disagree because
everyone has a theory about the “handbags.”
Some think they are for a drug stash as if
the ancient gods munched psilocybin all day.
And others say they carried pollen,
but who collects pollen, and why?
It makes more sense to me that these
figures symbolically commemorate
the most Earth-shattering event known to man.
Whether you agree, or not, I want you to understand.
The events I describe are in our history.
They influence us today. We are just
confused by liars and lazy thinkers in our
midst, from academia to media, to politics,
science, to culture, to power. Break the bonds of
the brainwash they feed us and think for yourself.
Do it and you will find answers. Nature
makes itself known. It's up to us
to raise our consciousness to its level.
Once done, truth is self-evident.
At least this is my experience. I have no special
talent I'm just keenly aware of what's around
me and eternally curious as to how it got there. Ask 
the right questions and nature shows the answer.
I refer to this feedback circuit as God. I present 
these conclusions for your consideration.
I won't deny other possible answers
exist, and we need to consider
everything. But there is a bit of urgency
in the message I get from all this, which
I'm compelled to share. Earth's 
internal circuits are warming up.
Volcanic and seismic activity is
increasing all along plate boundaries
that define the sub-surface currents. Weather
has become a bit strange and at the same time
the Sun is entering a minimum period of energy
output. Solar minimums have direct correlation
with colder weather on Earth,
but also higher seismic activity.
The Earth has to respond to the change in solar
energy by releasing some of its stored energy
in order to maintain its balance.
A reduction in solar wind means a
reduction in energy-induced 
by Earth’s magnetic field.
With less input energy, internal [currents] wane 
and the magnetic field weakens and expands.
But as the magnetic field expands, it captures
more solar wind, creating an increased induction.
This tug-of-war plays out as Earth 
tries to keep pace with the Sun,
but it oscillates Earth’s circuitry as currents ebb
and flow creating resistance and heat that has to
release. This happens in the transient phases,
shifting from maximum to minimum and vice versa.
It's the rate of change that matters.
We may see dramatic increase in the
frequency of earthquakes and volcanoes and severe
weather as we go down into the minimum and rise
back out. We are also experiencing a 
magnetic pole shift. The magnetic pole shift is
related to changing crustal 
currents. I don't know how yet,
but I know there's feedback between 
them, because there has to be. It's
physics and it is happening. If 
there is one thing that should be
evident from reading Eye of the Storm,
it's that Earth is an electric circuit
driven by whatever is in its core.
We don't know what the “core”
is. It's not a spinning ball of iron.
The surface effects we experience
outside of the crust are driven from
within as a result of how the core
reacts with the solar system. The 
surface effects are a capacitive
reaction to changing energy levels in the
core because Earth is a spherical capacitor.
Crustal boundaries surround the Indian Ocean,
and above segments of these currents are
some of the most active volcanic regions,
including the indonesian islands and Madagascar.
They are very active right now.
These are likely the largest currents on
Earth and the closest together producing magnetic
flux between them. There is already a large
gyre in the ocean, deep off the coast of
Madagascar circulating between these currents. Does
this mean there are catastrophic storms in
our future? Damned if I know. Check what the
ancients say. All I know is we 
better get off the dime and
understand this Earth as it really is
and stop listening to the academics.
Thank you all for reading.

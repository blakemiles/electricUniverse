Proponents of Electric Universe theory face 
one seemingly infinite wall of resistance.
The false preconceptions cemented in
people's minds by consensus science.
We simply do not see the cosmos the same way 
materials do. Fundamentally, I think the cosmos is energy.
Energy is kinetic motion or potential
motion of matter over a distance, but
matter itself is potential energy.
So it's all just one thing, energy. An
Electric Universe is one of energy
transformed from kinetic to potential by
standing waves of constructive interference.
Matter particles consist of holographic,
plasmoidal interference patterns. Standing 
waves, in other words, that form the ether.
Each standing wave is itself a circuit
of energy, shaped by its frequency.
The shape of matter conforms to the shape 
of energy flow. And the shape of matter
forms circuitry that anchors the 
shape of energy. It's a feedback loop.
From our perspective, plasmoids are
electromagnetic bubbles of potential
energy, and hence the perception 
of a particle. On the inside there are
whirlwinds of trapped energy,
patterned into an infinite cyclic circuit.
This circuit creates polarity, angular
momentum, exchanges energy with its
environment by induction, and maintains structural
Integrity with the membrane of capacitance.
Its internal potential maintains
resonant balance, and therefore is in
constant feedback with its environment. It is 
an RLC circuit. This circuit pattern repeats in
self-similar scalar harmonies from the
subatomic scale to the super-galactic.
Therefore, an Electric Universe is luminous bubbles
within bubbles; circuits within circuits; harmonies within
harmonies, vibrating at constant energy from
within, in resonance with everything without.
Electric Universe. I see the cosmos is circuitry
that patterns energy, frequency and vibration.
Circuitry is life. The feedback loop is
universal. Entropy is energy, dropping an
octave. Infinity means as big as it needs
to be. Gravity is an emergent consequence,
worthy of study, not worship. And we don't divide 
by zero. Minds that imagine energy as chunks of stuff,
bouncing around, are unlikely to
consider repeating scalable fractal
interference patterns as evidence for
anything but the mysteries of nature.
They've been groomed all their 
lives to think what matters is matter.
They will remain befuddled by ‘duality’
and hunted by ‘entanglement’. They will
disavow longitudinal waves and ether.
It's why consensus science cannot explain
ubiquitous patterns at every scale in the cosmos,
like the Fibonacci sequence or the Mandelbrot set.
It's just physics, but they try to sweep
such evidence of circuitry in nature
under the rug by calling it a ‘mystery’,
as if it's something beyond science.
It is they who have gone beyond science,
beyond falsifiability with dark stuff,
wormholes and multiverses. Breaking out of the mold 
that poisons quackademia and hence the greater
population, requires more than waiting on its
internal decay. Although that is happening at an
accelerating pace, there is still a need
to reorient people's minds to reality.
They need new physical models they can visualize.
Fortunately, great minds have already blazed a path.
Their message has just been suppressed.
I'm talking about people like Faraday and
Maxwell, Heaviside and Steinmetz.
These are names that need no
introduction in the Electric Universe. But 
let's add one more today: Hans G. Schantz.
Hans G. Schantz is with Q-Track
Corporation of Huntsville Alabama,
and he has written a paper titled,
“On Energy Flow in Standing Waves.”
In this paper Hans re-discovers the
enlightenment of our electric pioneers.
This paper examines the underpinnings 
of electromagnetism appropriately, in the
context of wavelengths, frequencies
amplitudes, harmonics and the patterns
that emerge as originally studied by The luminaries
mentioned. In particular this paper explores the
Poynting-Heaviside interpretation of
energy flow in electric circuits, which
basically says the energy isn't in the
copper wires of a circuit, but flows
through the electromagnetic lines of force 
around the wires. This is quite different from the
conventional concept of electrons channeling through
wires. This paper demonstrates however, that the
Poynting-Heaviside interpretation is correct. This 
conclusion should be no surprise in the EU community.
However, it's critically important to understand
the motions of a dusty plasma in free space.
It's critically important for people whose concept of
electricity is confined to the wires they plug into their
appliances. The convention in science
and engineering is to model electric
circuits from a far-field perspective;
that is to measure voltage, current, and
resistance, from point to point and
ignore how the electrons travel between.
The scientists mentioned in particular
developed methods to approximate with
simple math what otherwise was too complex to 
be useful. But there was fidelity lost about the
pattern of actual energy flow in the
equations and hence the very perception
of it, even for engineers and scientists.
The paper illustrates the flow of energy
and impedance, in concert with voltage
and current as a result of standing
waves formed in the electromagnetic
field in a simulated two-phase system.
Although this is a very simple model,
the patterns of energy flow are similar
to patterns found in geology
created by electromagnetic waves.
It illustrates how energy flows like
water, changing direction in zigzag
patterns, and circulating in whirlpools. These intricate
turbulent motions are ignored by the convention,
and we can't afford to ignore them if we
want to model weather and geology, or
anything else for that matter, in nature.
As we've shown in previous articles,
plasma storms pattern the face of the
Earth by raising a global dust cloud and
reapplying the constituents in patterns
formed by electromagnetic forces.
In other words, Earth is an electroplated planet.
We've shown and discussed significant
evidence that supersonic winds molded
mountains, leaving distinctive, in fact
unambiguous patterns of shock waves.
We've shown and discussed evidence of
canyons formed by sputtering discharge.
And we've shown and discussed river
channels formed by ground-to-ground,
arc mode discharge, and the evidence of
resonant frequencies, Hall effect, stray
capacitance, line-to-line phase vectors,
and other identifiable geometric effects in the
discharge patterns. These are all near-field effects
that are not captured in conventional far-field 
analysis. Wind effects in particular are patterned
by energy and power flow, and hence
conventional far-field methods won't work.
A quick dimensional analysis says, wind
is mass forced to move over distance,
which is energy over time, which is power.
To model the patterns of dusty plasma
winds, requires the methods of Messrs.
Poynting, Heaviside and Schantz.
Before you click to this paper and die
a small death at the sight of all the
equations, scroll past the illustrations.
Anyone who can see the pattern, sees the
result of electromagnetic forces, regardless 
of whether the equations are understood.
Energy flows a more tortuous path than
conventional models imply. It makes right-
angle turns and eddies around pools of impedance
into Z-pattern flows, like water in a rocky stream.
Just like shock waves reflect off of
shock waves, EM waves reflect off of EM
waves, creating interference, standing
waves in odd places, harmonics and
traveling waves, transient standing waves.
Geologic evidence of wind patterns left
by supersonic shock waves and many other
features, confirms that plasma winds,
filamented into linear Z-pattern, right
angle and circulating cyclones patterned
by electromagnetic fields as well.
Examine the interference patterns in
these illustrations and take special note of the
total energy and the impedance diagrams shown.
The same type of energy flow molded the
Laramie Mountains around the spectacular
X-discharge pattern at the heart of the range.
Although the patterns are not identical
to the examples in the paper, the angular
relationships patterned in the landscape,
are the same, because it was also created by an
orthogonal electromagnetic field interference pattern.
The patterns are more complex in the
mountains than the simple two-phase
simulation, but so is the electromagnetic field
of the plasma storm that created these mountains.
The storm generated an electric field
between the sky and ground at this
particular location on the Continental
Divide, because of tension between
circuit domains forming the Mississippi,
Colorado and Snake River watersheds.
It was this hot spot in the ground that drew a
response in the atmosphere by building a thunderstorm,
one of Zeus's finest. Wind patterns, indicated in blue,
show the path of energy flow along lines of force,
which we now know are interference patterns
in a multi-phase electromagnetic field.
The wind energy traveled in straight
line filaments at angles roughly 30 to
45 degrees offset to the orthogonal
cross, just like the impedance is offset
from the total energy in Figure 5 and for the same 
reason. The ground discharge pattern that made the
orthogonal cross presents the ground
phase. And the tropical layer of the
storm cell above it presented the
opposite end of the electric field. Or
the other plate of charge density in the
capacitor, and the other phase in the
electromagnetic field for this circuit.
The cross itself is a discharge between
the three ground domains and is
anchoring the location and establishing
the frequency of the circuit. As a
discharge cycle from peak to trough, it
presented a standing wave of maximum
impedance, minimum voltage to the plasma winds.
Plasma winds were biased positive and the ground 
negative. Winds were drawn by reactive energy
flows of electric field inductance, which is also
known as capacitance, and magnetic field inductance,
both leading and lagging the pulsing
arc mode discharges on the ground.
Magnetic field inductance, through
filamentary jet streams toward the
center of the cross and then up into the
storm center, these jet streams followed
magnetic waves, vectored in the direction of the
wave motion, perpendicular to the lines of force.
Electric induction drew winds in curving paths,
field-aligned with magnetic lines of force,
and these winds deposited dust where ground
charge attracted it in the act of electroplating.
The patterns formed by a dusty plasma
are also influenced by the dust itself.
The difference in ionic mix, and the
influence of magnetic or diamagnetic
particles, might make the difference
between a clockwise or counterclockwise
turn; or a fast or slow wind; or whether
it sticks to ground charge densities, at
a shock wave; or blows right through.
So, to summarize, the orthogonal
relationship of alternating electric and
magnetic fields yields an X-shaped
constructive interference pattern of
maximum reactive energy flow, and a
vertical cross-shaped minimum energy
pattern of maximum impedance.
This pattern is repeatable, scalable and expressions
of it are identifiable throughout nature.
The takeaway of this paper and what it
illustrates about Earth, is the phased
interplay of reactive power in the
electromagnetic field between sky and ground.
The sky is reactive, lagging in phase to charge
concentrations first established in the ground.
Lightning tornadoes and storm cells are phase-to-phase
discharges in a multi-phase circuit, not DC dielectric
breakdowns, nor anything to do with CO2. That is 
why consensus science can't understand weather.
On Earth, like everything else in the cosmos,
is a pattern of energy storage and flow.
Follow the energy to any answer. That's how it's
done, with or without math. One can feel energy.
When you add the complexities of
spherical geometry and how waves
propagate and interfere on a spherical
capacitor that inducts energy from the
poles, definable patterns appear. Take 
for instance these images of Iapetus.
Iapetus has no atmosphere or internal geoelectric 
dynamic. What happened here was a direct current
event. However, it serves to illustrate ground 
currents. What is obvious is a meridian of raised
rock, called a dike, running from one pole to the
 other. A quarter turn, or 90 degrees around the
moon, is a similar pole-to-pole meridian
of aligned craters and it's highlighted
right at that limb where the light shines from the 
Sun. Another, smaller meridian of craters runs
roughly between the larger craters and the 
dike. It's about 30 degrees above the dike.
Each of these lines of craters and the
dike itself, is an expression of charge
densities formed by filaments of current.
Immediately, when you notice the
quadrangle formed by interference,
here from a polar aspect, look at the
dike and major crater meridians and how
they parallel a quarter rotation apart
from one another, around the pole from pole to
pole, with a minor meridian of craters between.
It's a similar three-dimensional
quadrangle of power flow as the paper
depicts in two dimensions, where the
quadrangle is formed by constructive
interference, and then divided into eight
sections by destructive interference.
Each section forms its own pattern of
charge densities, because each section
acquires a different ratio and vector of
electric and magnetic field inductance
due to phase and frequency differences.
The craters formed on radial currents,
emanating from the moon's interior and aligned along
these meridians as they pass through the crust,
they form destructive interference or
cathode spots on the spherical field of
the crust where the energy deconstructed matter.
The dike, on the other hand, is a meridian
filament of constructive interference on the crustal
surface that ran like a wire from pole to pole.
Constructive interference means energy
aggregates matter where positive and
negative ions came together and recombined.
The energy was entering one pole and
leaving the other, but reflecting its internal flow
into multi-phase interference which pattern standing
waves of voltage, current, and impedance
from within, to create these distinct
geometrically-aligned filaments, as a rise in
internal energy exceeded the capacity of the body.
Atmospheric planets especially show
consistent patterns of energy flow in
their weather, due to multi-phase reactive 
energy. The V-pattern winds on Venus,
the magnetic shadow on the Sun, and the
continental formation of North America,
are all the consequence of energy flows from a body 
that is inducing energy, storing it in layers of spherical
capacity, and expelling the excess energy
through its own dynamic electromagnetic
fields, forming these predictable interference 
patterns. Ground charge densities, called shield
volcanoes to lay the continents’ foundations on
Earth, and weather-layered sediments on top.
But they were both shaped by the same reactive
energy flows and interference patterns,
because the plasmoidal circuitry in
Earth, Venus and the Sun are very similar.
These patterns come and go. Other patterns 
emerge. Nothing is constant, but the patterns recur.
They are interference patterns 
from internal circuitry that has its own
cyclically-operating switching mechanism.
It's obvious, if you think about it,
assuming you accept electrical formation
in the first place, that Earth's land
masses must be patterned by forces from 
within. If they were not, how would diffuse
energy from space create the complex geography 
we see. By applying the same physics described
in this paper, one can determine the 
fine detail about geology on Earth.
The cycles of catastrophe in Earth's
past left patterns of plasma winds,
sputtering and arc-mode discharges, shock
waves and fringe-effect-currents around
the continental plates, all patterned by Earth's own
energy flow. Each episode laid a new layer on the old.
Each layer, if properly interpreted, will
yield a clear picture of what happened.
Were there comets and asteroids colliding with
the Earth in cyclic patterns of recurrence?
Or did Earth switch its circuit patterns
periodically, perhaps due to solar influence?
These are answerable questions. In the same way one
can interpret prevailing wind patterns from the shape
of a sand dune, one can interpret
virtually any hill or dale on the planet.
A record is retained in Earth's geology like a hologram, 
because it was formed by standing waves. Now, thanks
to the work of engineers and scientists like Hans G.
Schantz who are brave enough to challenge the consensus,
we have the beginnings of models to reinterpret 
our world. We can go to work rewriting science.

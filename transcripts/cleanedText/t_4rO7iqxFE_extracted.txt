The Electric Universe paradigm has an
unparalleled record of successful predictions
in the space age. In stark contrast, as
telescopes have improved and covered
more of the electromagnetic spectrum, astronomers
have become more perplexed by exoplanets,
stars and galaxies that shouldn't exist. A few
brave souls have declared cosmology to be in crisis,
but at no time has the belief been shaken
in Einstein's gravitational cosmology
and its meaningless Big Bang expanding universe.
Now, 21st century technology has built
and prepares to launch the
James Webb Space Telescope,
also known as the JWST or Webb
Space Telescope. It is described by
NASA as “the largest, most powerful
and complex space telescope
ever built and launched into
space, it will fundamentally
alter our understanding of the universe.”
But fundamental changes in understanding
are subject to the dead hand of academic peer
review, which is governed by a coterie of top
experts who have a great deal to lose if
they don't control the consensus narrative.
So, there has been no substantial change
in our understanding of the universe
since the middle of the 20th century. Instead,
the narrative has simply become more and
more complicated as barnacles of ad-hoc
theory have encrusted the Titanic of
institutionalized science. Fundamental
changes break the consensus.
They're the icebergs awaiting sciences’ Titanic.
So, fundamental changes almost always come from
individuals on the fringe. The field
is wide open for the successfully
predictive Electric Universe cosmology to be
critically tested by the new Webb Space Telescope.
NASA states, “The Webb Space Telescope is
an orbiting infrared observatory that will
complement and extend the discoveries
of the Hubble Space Telescope
with longer wavelength coverage
and greatly improved sensitivity.
The longer wavelengths enable Webb to
look much closer to the beginning of time
and to hunt for the unobserved formation of
the first galaxies, as well as to look inside dust
clouds where stars and planetary systems
are forming today.” Observe this aim is
unscientific and therefore unlikely to fundamentally
alter our understanding of the universe,
since it presumes only the consensus Big
Bang gravitational paradigm for study.
We've seen that to maintain this narrative,
there has been an endless introduction of ad-hoc
forces, particles and impossible objects
like neutron stars and black holes.
Meanwhile in the 1960’s plasma
cosmology was introduced by Hannes Alfven,
a plasma scientist who won the 1970
Nobel prize in physics for his research.
Plasma cosmology is a model of the universe
in which plasma and electromagnetic forces
play a dominant role on the galactic scale. It's
based heavily on observation and experiment,
but due to specialism in the
20th century, it's studiously
ignored by astrophysicists. They
ignore Alfven's Nobel speech warning
that their treatment of space plasma
as a mysteriously magnetized fluid,
is fundamentally flawed. Meanwhile,
plasma cosmologists produced the spiral
shape and non-gravitational rotation of
a classic spiral galaxy experimentally,
and with supercomputer models. When
they included the weak force of gravity in
the computer models, it had no
appreciable effect. Such experimentation
and simplification are
hallmarks of classical physics.
Galaxies are governed by electromagnetic
forces, not by gravity. Well-organized galactic
magnetic fields have more recently been
mapped and conform to plasma cosmology.
Such fields are unexpected and
unexplained in gravitational theory.
This alone knocks out the gravitational
foundation of Big Bang cosmology.
Imaginary black holes and dark matter are not
required. All we know about the force of gravity
is that Newton's law operates within
the present orderly solar system.
We can't presume peacefulness in the
solar system for most of Earth's history.
That's merely wishful thinking and flies
in the face of geological evidence of
past global paroxysms. And the notion that Newton's
law of gravity and the gravitational constant
as measured on the Earth, applies
universally, is characteristically
geocentric and myopic, when you consider our
short history and the discovery that gravity theory
doesn't work at the galactic scale. So,
let's first get Big Bang history right.
The Belgian priest-astronomer Georges
Lemaitre is usually identified as the
first to theorize that the recession of
nearby galaxies can be explained by an
expanding universe. Einstein is
supposed to have said and I quote,
”This is the most beautiful and
satisfactory explanation of creation to
which I have ever listened.” End
quote. But we can forget Einstein.
He did away with the force of gravity
and try telling someone who has just
fallen over that it was the Earth’s warping
of space-time that told him to hit the ground.
Two years after Lemaitre's epiphany, Edwin Hubble
provided evidence that the velocity of a galaxy
away from us, increases with its distance from
us, a property now known as Hubble's law.
The Hubble law implies that the universe is
expanding. But that simply assumes the redshift of
faint galaxies is due almost entirely to the Doppler
effect, which is the increase in wavelength and
consequent lowering of frequency of
the light from a fast receding object.
Mathematicians jumped on Hubble's law
for their new creation myth by retro-
calculating to a point origin in a
magical Big Bang. They now tell us
with religious fervor how the
universe began and how it may end.
What we are not told is that Edwin
Hubble termed his famous discovery a
”...redshift versus apparent-distance
relationship.” Wisely, Hubble didn't accept his
discovery as proof the universe is expanding.
Rather than signifying that some faint
galaxies are accelerating away from us
at a good fraction of the speed of light,
Hubble maintained that it was likely
some new physics was involved.
This was later proved by the astronomer Dr.
Halton Arp, who became known by his followers,
including some leading astronomers, as the
modern-day Galileo, following his banishment by the
mathematical priesthood of Big Bang cosmology.
Like Galileo and Hubble, Arp worked
directly from telescopic observations.
He studied the photographic plates and
lined his office walls with images of galaxies.
He produced the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies.
By careful observation he found physical
links between high-redshift quasars and
low-redshift active galaxies, which
proved Hubble was right. High
redshift is not evidence for an expanding
universe. Arp's research into high-redshift
quasars shows they are local. The
universe is of unknown age and extent
and is essentially static. A Big Bang never
happened. The origin of the universe,
if that has any real meaning, is well
beyond our present deeply flawed science.
Let me explain quasars. When
discovered in the early 1960’s,
quasars were utterly mysterious. In 1963
the Dutch astronomer Maarten Schmidt
solved the mystery of quasar spectral
lines when he discovered they were
highly redshifted. This placed the brightest
one, 3C 273 about 1.5 billion lightyears away.
The radio astronomer Gerrit Verschuur wrote
quote, ”What could possibly look like a star,
produce tremendously strong radio waves,
resemble double radio galaxies and yet
produce so much energy? The full
mystery of the quasar becomes
more profound when all the information is considered
together. They are very far away and the luminous
cores are very small. At the distances inferred
by the redshift, quasars emit the energy
equivalent of 100 billion stars like the
Sun, all the energy being generated in a
volume of space not much larger than the solar
system.” End quote. To make matters worse, it was
found that quasar 3C 273 underwent
sudden changes in brightness
over a period of 80 years. Verschuur notes
“This incredible discovery was also completely
unexpected.” The sudden changes in brightness
were found to be associated with blobs of
matter being blasted out in jets at irregular
intervals. At the assumed redshift distance of the
quasars, those blobs were
apparently moving faster than light.
Halton Arp published a paper in 2007,
’Quasars and the Hubble relation’,
in which he states “...a continuity
exists in redshift from the highest
redshift quasars to low redshift Seyferts,
active galaxies and allied galaxies.
Evidence is discussed for this sequence
to be an evolutionary track with objects
evolving from high to low intrinsic redshift with
time. At the end of this evolution the objects
are nearly the same age as our own
galaxy...” In the case of quasar 3C273
the odds are 100 trillion to 1 against Arp being
wrong. Remarkably, Arp found the quasar's
redshift decreases discontinuously, in
quantized steps, and their mass and brightness
increase as they move away from their parent,
slowing down to eventually form companion galaxies.
Quantization of redshift verifies that it
is intrinsic to the matter in the quasar,
rather than anything to do with the
light on its journey to the Earth,
which solves most of the quasar mysteries at a
stroke. They are not at the edge of the visible
universe. They are local, small and
faint, and not moving faster than light.
Arp's evolutionary sequence adds a pleasing
biological nuance to plasma cosmology
which, instead of a black hole, has a
doughnut-shaped electromagnetic plasmoid
at the galactic center. The plasmoid is formed
by electric current fed radially into the galactic
center in the case of a spiral
galaxy along the spiral arms.
The current produces the ordered galactic
magnetic field. A similar plasmoid, produced in a
laboratory, is the most extremely
compact and complex form of electrical
energy storage known. The
lab plasmoid is formed by a radial
plasma discharge between a central conductor,
and a concentric outer conductor, which mimics
plasma cosmology's galactic circuit.
Laboratory plasmoids are observed to
emit intense beams of neutrons axially
as they lose energy. The Electric
Universe model proposes that when the
energy density inside the surface of the
plasmoid nearest the axis is sufficient to
form neutrons from protons and electrons,
the neutrons escape axially from
the plasmoid's intense magnetic field
to subsequently decay into a beam of electrons and
protons. On leaving the active galactic plasmoid,
the light electrons spiral in the galactic
magnetic field, more than the heavier protons.
The result is an electron-deficient
smaller plasmoid, or quasar,
jetted along the active
galactic plasmoid's umbilical
intergalactic Birkeland current. The
coaxial galactic Birkeland current,
identified by its magnetic field structure,
acts like a cosmic dense plasma focus.
Mapping the magnetic field in a jet
along one of these intergalactic
Birkeland currents, has shown the
current to be on the order of 10
billion billion amps. The knots seen in
galactic jets are embryonic galaxies.
The Electric Universe further explains
Arp's quantized redshift and increasing
mass and brightness of quasars.
The umbilical galactic Birkeland current
has an axial current surrounded by a more
negative current cylinder, rather like a
cosmic coaxial cable. It effectively imitates
the dense plasma focus device’s structure.
Electrons from the cylinder flow
radially into the axial quasar,
powering its embryonic plasmoid and, quickly
at first, increasing the charge polarization of
its subatomic particles and consequently,
its particles’ energies and masses
in quantized jumps. That gives rise
to its increasing brightness and the
quantized decreases in redshift,
and slowing of the quasar due to
conservation of momentum. Arp's
discovery demonstrates a galactic- scale
quantum effect. In summary, the active
galactic nucleus is the plasmoid womb
and origin of the jets and the matter forming
quasars, or embryonic galactic plasmoids.
This simply explains the phenomenal
jets and radio-lobes of both parent
and child. Halton Arp’s research
showed sensibly the universe
is of unknown age and extent. It is not collapsing
under gravity, or mysteriously expanding.
As nature repeatedly demonstrates, it is in balance.
Arp realized this raised a serious issue, because it
implies that gravity between
celestial bodies, must be repulsive.
Otherwise, balance is impossible.
Of course this is completely counter-
intuitive, because we experience gravity
only as an attractive force. But there
are historical precedents for a theory of repulsive
gravity, which was first proposed in the 1690’s by
Ncolas Fatio de Duillier and considered
at the time by Sir Isaac Newton.
Arp studied a later theory known as Le Sage’s
theory of gravity. Theoretically it works
by a shadowing effect under bombard-
ment from all directions by strange
high-speed particles, but no plausible
particle impact mechanism could be found.
However, as I've argued in the past,
gravity is a subatomic dipolar electric force
which for all celestial bodies has one pole
facing outwards and the other inwards.
It's equivalent to having spherical
magnets with the same surface polarity.
This side-steps the problems with Le Sage’s theory.
We experience gravity as an attractive
force, simply because we are as much
a part of the Earth as are the air,
rocks and water. We are polarized within the
Earth's gravitational sphere of influence,
like iron filing stuck to a magnet The
James Webb Telescope has the power
to see fainter red-shifted quasars,
more clearly than before.
So, my first prediction is that the
James Webb Telescope will support
Halton Arp’s research, which shows
plainly that high-redshift quasars are
born in pairs and emitted in oppositely directed
jets, along the spin axis of a low redshift
active galaxy. They are not at
the edge of the visible universe.
They are in the neighborhood of their parent
galaxy. Therefore they are not incredibly
distant, bright and large. There is no superluminal
motion. They are nearby and youthfully faint.
By carefully tracking quasar redshift evolution,
we will see the transformation from a naked,
high-velocity and low-mass plasmoid, to a
low-velocity high-mass companion galaxy.
Experimental tests of active galactic
nucleus behavior by plasma cosmologists
should be possible using the
dense plasma focus device.
In other words, a return to real physics.
Theoretical physicists on the other hand
have failed to self-correct their theories for
a century. It is time for plasma and Electric
Universe cosmology to
explain Halton Arp’s universe.

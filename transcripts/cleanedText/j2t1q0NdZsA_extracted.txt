'Plasma versus Gravity'.

Kuhn’s 1962 essay (The Structure
of Scientific Revolutions)
exploring the nature of
changes in scientific theories,
and a plethora of
commentaries since,
have made it out to be a Big Deal
and to be also somewhat mysterious:
“revolution”, “incommensurability of paradigms”,
“new world”, etc.
It seems to me the essence of it
is simply different viewpoints.
Just as the landscape looks different
when viewed from different locations,
the facts and theories of
the sciences appear different
when understood from different conceptual
locations in the intellectual landscape.
Ptolemy drew a picture of what the
universe looked like from the Earth.
Copernicus described how
it looked from the Sun.
Newton depicted the
view from gravity.
Notice that the terms “Earth”, “Sun”,
and “gravity” are not “something out there”
but are concepts that make sense of or create
meaning from a selection of observations.
Gravity, for example, made sense of
falling apples and revolving planets.
The other viewpoints “saw” no
connection between apples and planets.
Definitions changed:
The observations once considered
important in the term “planet”
were replaced with
other observations.
New mathematical
techniques were developed
which would have seemed nonsensical to
people occupying the old viewpoints.
The resulting view of the “gravity universe”
was that of isolated “billiard balls”
occasionally
perturbing each other.
This replaced the old views
of a system of nested spheres
or an assembly of epicycles.
Now the “Electric Universe”
is a different viewpoint.
Notice, for example,
that its definition of “plasma”
is not the conventional
one of “ionized gas”.
That latter definition
jumps to the conclusion
that you can understand
something about plasma
by falling back on what you know about
ideal gasses and thermal ionization.
The ideal gas law is an important
insight in the conventional view,
but it becomes a blindfold
in the electric view,
preventing you from seeing
what’s before your eyes.
Rather, “plasma” is an emergent
(i.e., higher-level or statistical-level)
orderliness of complex electrical forces:
such properties
as filamentation,
long-range attraction and short-range repulsion,
braiding, characteristic velocities,
formation and decay
of plasmoids,
and identity of properties
at different scales.
The mathematical shorthand that was
developed for articulating the gravity view
and for using the technologies based
on it doesn’t work for the plasma view.
A new mathematics - and new
technologies - will need to be invented.
The view of the universe
from a plasma vantage point
is one of persistently
interacting aggregates
with wide-spread
resonance effects:
a “driven” universe rather
than one rolling to a stop.
So the definitions
are different,
the facts are different,
the math is different,
the theories are different:
The universe looks different because
the plasma physicist is standing in
a different conceptual location
from the gravity physicist.
And although the content of each paradigm
can’t be compared with the other,
the respective viewpoints
can be compared.
B. J. F. Lonergan’s 1957 work (Insight)
on the nature of understanding
provides one ground upon which
different viewpoints can be compared.
Theories come and go,
but the underlying function,
purpose, and construction of theories
arise from the
nature of cognition.
As one of the ways in which
people relate to the universe,
cognition fashions intellectual
tools-theories-to accomplish particular goals.
Hence, from a
selection of theories,
one can be preferred on the
basis of its utility value
- the one which seems most
likely to achieve the goal
with the greatest
efficiency and least effort.
One criterion for the efficient achievement
of the goal of understanding the universe
is comprehensiveness.
Again comparing the intellectual
landscape with the physical,
the higher the viewpoint
the greater the purview.
In this sense, Kuhn’s process of periods of
cumulation of knowledge within a paradigm
separated by episodes
of paradigm shifts
can be understood as the progressive
achievement of higher viewpoints
affording greater purviews.
Notice that from
this understanding
the often-used (and abused when
applied outside a paradigm)
judgements of “right/wrong”,
“correct/incorrect”,
even “true/false”,
are meaningless.
Upon this ground for
comparing viewpoints,
the case can be made that the plasma
paradigm is “higher” than the gravity one
in that it encompasses a
larger domain of evidence.
Not only does it
explain more phenomena,
it explains those phenomena with a
comprehensive and unitary theory.
It “sees” more landscape,
more features of
that landscape,
and more relationships
among those features.
Gravity, in contrast,
“sees” fewer features
and “sees” them as
disparate events,
each requiring a separate
ad hoc explanation.
For example, every feature on
every planet has its own theory:
impact craters,
volcanoes,
tidal cracks,
floods of disappearing water,
lava that runs uphill,
runaway greenhouses, etc.
The generality of gravity is
obscured with ad hoc inventions,
and those inventions fail to account for
details intrinsic in the plasma view.
Gravity fails to account
for entire new observations,
extrapolating itself beyond
reality and into denial:
Super-massive stars spinning super-fast,
exploding stars whose shock-waves
create intricate structures,
cannibalistic galaxies,
dark matter that
overwhelms observed matter,
photos cropped between
galaxies and connected quasars,
silence in the face of the
quantization of redshifts, etc.
More and more evidence
is being ignored.
Newton was unaware of plasma.
Today his disciples
spend years in training
learning when and how to
shut their eyes to it.
It’s not just the Big
Bang, General Relativity,
and Quantum Mechanics
that are in trouble
but the foundation of them all:
Gravity is an exhausted
and bankrupt concept.
A higher, more comprehensive
foundation is needed.
The technologies of gravity have lifted us
to a viewpoint that’s bigger than gravity,
and we need new ideas and new tools
to make sense of the new vistas.

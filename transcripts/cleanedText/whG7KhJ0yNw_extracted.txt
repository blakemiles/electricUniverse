New evidence from the Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory near Chicago
seems to point to a subatomic particle, called
a muon, behaving in a way that it should not. It
is believed that every particle has
what is called a magnetic moment;
and this is essentially a sort of wobble.
Each type of particle has a very precise
value for this magnetic moment.
When they ran their experiments, they
discovered something rather curious.
The muon seemed to be wobbling a lot
more than the theory predicted.
The scientists who discovered this think
that the best explanation for this,
is that the muon is being pushed around
by types of matter and energy
completely unknown to physics. The
current model has remained largely
unchanged in the last 50 years,
and this small discovery could well shake
the entire foundation that this is built on.
Muons can be thought of as fat electrons as
they are similar to a regular electron, but are
200 times heavier and are also radioactively
unstable, decaying in a mere millionth of a second
into electrons and the elusive neutrino.
In the experiments they sent the muons
into a superconducting ring and this
seemed to show that it was wobbling
far more than it should. The wobble, they
think, is related to the spin of the particle.
The idea of spin was first discovered 
in the 1920’s by Otto Stern
and Walter Gerlach. They shot silver
atoms through a varying magnetic field,
and saw something that they couldn't
explain. The silver atoms were neutral, so
had an equal number of protons and electrons.
They had expected to find one of two
possible results. Number 1: the
neutrality of the atoms would nullify
any interactions with the magnetic field,
and they would travel in a straight line.
Number 2: if the atoms behaved like
spheres that could also spin on their axes,
then this angular momentum would interact
with the surrounding magnetic field,
producing a torque. Since each 
atom would have a random spin,
and hence torque, it would scatter 
the atoms in all directions.
What they discovered was actually none of these.
When they examined the results, what they
actually saw was, that there were two very
distinct trajectories from the silver atoms.
One group heading upwards and
the other heading downwards.
The experiment revealed that 
particles that make up the atom,
had previously unknown properties that
were only revealed by the magnetic field.
Since the atoms sort of behave like spinning balls
of electric charge, this property was dubbed spin.
From this point onwards particles would have
three properties: mass, charge and spin.
Through experiments it was determined that the spin
property is a fixed quantity. The problem was that
Schrodinger's equations did not take account of
any spin and it would be Dirac who would come up
with a mathematics that would bridge the
gap and allow quantum mechanics to work with
special relativity. The behavior of
these particles is far more complex
than a simple spinning sphere. In fact, it
is fair to say that there is no useful
metaphor for this property at all.
In classical physics, the magnetic spin
moment would be equal to a half multiplied
by the ratio of its electric charge,
to its mass, multiplied by its spin angular
momentum. However, in quantum mechanics it all gets
multiplied by a pre-factor which is called g. If the
universe were purely quantum mechanical in nature
g would equal 2 and this is exactly
what Dirac had predicted.
As you might be able to guess, g does not 
equal 2. Scientists claim that this means that
the universe is not just quantum mechanical.
Instead, there are also fields that
permeate the universe which are responsible
for carrying the forces. So, these fields
also interact with all the particles, meaning 
g cannot be equal to 2. This value has
been observed for electrons for a long period
of time. As they have very little mass, they
predominantly interact with the electromagnetic
force. This in turn means that the g2 effects
are dominated by the electromagnetic force
and we can calculate the magnetic moment
to 13 decimal places for the electron.
The muon is a different case. It is unstable,
but has over 200 times the mass of an electron.
This makes its magnetic moment much
smaller than the electron, and 
this also means that they believe it
interacts with the strong force much 
more compared to the electron. It is
here that the scientists have found a
difference with what their equations predicted,
and what is actually being measured. A
rival team however would like to pour
cold water on their findings and 
are rushing to publish a paper that
would in fact allow for this greater
wobble to exist within the existing models,
and no new models would be required. Their
calculations also follow the rules of the Standard
Model but they relied upon a totally different
calculation with very different assumptions.
This shows that the physicists cannot
agree on exactly how the 17 existing
standard model particles interact with muons,
allowing for the different interpretations.
At this stage it is important to take a little
step back, and just examine the experiment, to
understand what might be going on. Firstly,
they generate muons by firing protons at a target.
The collision is thought to release
energy which gets turned into matter.
It creates something called a pion, which
almost immediately decays, forming a muon.
This muon lasts for a short period,
before decaying into an electron
and some neutrino particles. We cannot see or
measure pions. They are a theoretical particle.
The same can be said for the neutrino.
We can only detect the neutrinos by their
interaction with other particles. If 
we examine the muon, it presents a
rather interesting case that seems to
highlight many of the problems with
particle physics today. It is essentially an
electron which is thought to have more mass.
This particle can only be made through
collisions with other particles
and more specifically, atoms. The Standard
Model holds that there are protons and
neutrons in the nucleus, held together by
a force called the strong nuclear force.
This stops the protons from flying away from each
other and binds them into the nucleus. There is
no order to their nucleus, and protons 
and neutrons occupy random locations.
And yet, radioactive decay will
always result in the production
of certain smaller components,
irrespective of this randomness.
The Structured Atom Model shows 
us a different way of looking at this.
Instead, there are no neutrons, 
and there is no strong nuclear force.
Protons are held in the nucleus by electrons.
An electron and a proton pair is what we
see as a neutron. If we add into this the idea of
platonic solids and use a simple densest packing
rule, we can now create complex atomic
nuclei following a very simple set of rules.
Even more remarkable is that this structure,
and its instabilities in certain parts,
perfectly matches and explains 
why certain elements are unstable,
and why they decay into specific products.
So why is this relevant to muons?
In the mainstream model electrons
do not exist within the nucleus.
The muon is produced by colliding a particle with
an atom. We know that a neutron decays into an
electron and a proton and an
antineutrino, within about 15 minutes.
Another clue comes from the fact that
they are able to create muon atoms.
Muonic hydrogen has the muon
orbiting much closer to the hydrogen
than a normal atom. There is also 
a process called muon capture.
Here a proton and a negative muon join,
resulting in the production of a neutron
and a neutrino and sometimes a gamma ray.
The muon can be drawn in from the atomic
orbital to form a neutron inside 
the nucleus. This is actually
being investigated for the application
in radioactive waste disposal and this
would allow them to transmute the radioactive
element into something else. We must also
consider what exactly mass is.
If we examine the famous E=mc2
equation, we understand from this
that as particles travel at relativistic
speeds, their mass will increase.
Wal Thornhill pointed out that this
is simply an interpretation of the observations
from particle accelerators. Here they
accelerate protons and electrons in an
electric field and notice that they become less
responsive to this field. If, as Wal 
suggests, these particles are
made up of smaller sub particles
which also orbit around a central charge,
then as the particles accelerate,
their orbits will become more and more
elliptical as more and more force is applied.
This is used in the distortion of this
orbit, rather than in the
acceleration of the particle itself.
So in the case of a muon, might 
this still simply be an electron
but in a different excited state? Meaning
it does not respond to the electric
field in the same way as an electron.
Did the initial collision cause one of
the internal electrons inside the nucleus,
to be liberated in this excited state?
This state is unstable and this energy is eventually
released, and all that remains is the electron.
Again, we must come back to the concept that there
is something fundamentally wrong with particle
physics. This is the tip of the iceberg, and the 
fact that they see a discrepancy from their
theoretical models with their observations,
may indeed open up the avenue for them
to explore an alternative to this
particle zoo that they have created.
Although, I wouldn't be surprised if they
simply invent another member of this zoo
to fix the problem. That being 
said, there is still much work
to do in finding a working alternative
to all the phenomena we see.
SAM is an excellent step in the right
direction, but understandably their efforts are
focused on the known atoms and
explaining all the phenomena,
before they then tackle the more exotic
phenomena we see. They have already shown that in
radioactive decay, there is no need
for the neutrino, and a positron
can be explained as an electron 
moving into the nucleus of the atom.
When you strip away what is actually
observed in these experiments,
there is room for a totally different
interpretation of the data.
Which may suggest a much simpler, more logical
way in which mother nature works, and would
remove Feynman's classical quote where he said,
“The theory of quantum Electrodynamics describes
nature as absurd from the point of view of common
sense. And it fully agrees with experiment. So I
hope you can accept nature as she is – Absurd.” 
Instead, we should view mother nature
in a logical hierarchical fashion
where everything has a purpose,
where less is more and in this case,
the removal of the strong nuclear force,
once more points to the electrical
nature of mother nature.

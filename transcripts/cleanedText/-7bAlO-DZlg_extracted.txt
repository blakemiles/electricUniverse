As bees drink sugary nectar and collect
pollen for its nutrients and fat,
these interactions between
pollinator and plant
include evolutionary adaptations
to electrical science.
A high school student
from the future
would surely mention at least
two electrical interactions
when describing how bees
interact with flowers.
As a bee flies it
sheds electrons,
accumulating a positive charge
or electron receiving state.
A voltage gradient in the air of
about 100 volts for every meter up
causes the petals of many flowers
to accumulate a negative charge
in relation to the
air around them.
In a manner familiar to any human who has
felt static electricity on their hair,
the tiny hairs on a bees' body
bend slightly towards the flower.
These body hairs on bees
are connected to neurons
especially sensitive
to this interaction.
When bees land, this static
effect from their hairs
also attracts pollen
like a swiffer pad.
The bee will comb her body to
store this pollen more securely
on regions of the back legs called
the corbicula or pollen basket.
The flower will still have a lower
charge of electrons after this visit,
for about 100 seconds
for example.
This decreased charge may
serve as another indicator
that bees use to determine which
flowers have just been visited.
On a different note, these tiny
creatures see our shared world
painted with a slightly different
range of colors than we do.
The vibration we perceive as red
is simply too slow and wide of a
waveform for their eyes to perceive.
Meanwhile, they can see much faster
and tighter wavelengths of vibration
than most humans, which
we call ultraviolet.
Consider this when you see flowers that
appear to our eyes to look rather simple.
They may have additional features
that our eyes simply do not see.
Some flowers are more predominantly red
because evolutionary relationships
have led them to
become more adapted
to attracting hummingbirds
or butterflies for instance.
Bees are likely just
one of many insects
which use electrically sensitive
hairs for different purposes.
We simply may not allocate money and time
towards the scientific study of such things.
Thanks for watching.
And next time you see bees in your
garden or among wild flowers,
consider how these creatures see the world
and how they feel the electricity of life.

[Music] [Music] I like this cartoon it was from the Rolling Stone and it shows Velikovsky as introducing a touch of the Wild West into celestial dynamics and that was really my the magnet that drew me to Velikovsky Velikovsky's astrophysics started in his best-selling worlds in collision where he threw down a gauntlet to astronomers which in earlier centuries as my friend dr. Irving Wolfe said would have had him burned at the stake his proposal of recent payoffs in the planetary system exposed our worst fear doomsday the end of the earth the end of us astronomers who would have happily thrown fuel on the flames boasted that they hadn't read his book because it disobeyed Newton's law of gravity this was religious dogmatism not science however many scholars did take Velikovsky seriously I'm pleased to say and some of those who took him most seriously or at this conference so this is a kind of a trip down memory lane where I trace my path to where I am now which may help some of you understand some of the weird stuff that I come out with I was born in during the Second World War and my father ended up an invalid I'm afraid and so he was in and out of a military hospital now while I was in high school in the sort of midway through he came home from one of his visits to hospital with the book in his hand and he said I think you might be interested in this it was that red book their worlds in collision well as a in primary school I've been interested in astronomy to the point where I would memorize facts out of the encyclopedia draw pictures and go to cool and do a show-and-tell until the kids in my class decided they'd had enough of me and and told me in no uncertain terms but the thing that impressed me with this book was I'd never seen the scientific method applied so broadly he made leaps from one topic one discipline to another that I had never seen before and as it says here his work crossed over and stimulated new directions of thought in a vast number of academic fields which alone is no mean feat but he also showed us as the Washington evening star put it to not be afraid to stake out new intellectual territory in defiance of fashionable thought this is from Henry Zeca he challenged the mysteries of the universe he sought answers to our most perplexing questions discovered many and inspired inquisitive minds to search for more that alone will mark him as one of the most profoundly influential scholars of the century perhaps of all time now I read this book as I said at high school and I tried to interest friends there and other students and I was surprised at how disinterested they seemed to be so and also had this difficulty how can all of these teachers and people that I've looked up to and all of these encyclopedias I've read to be wrong so wrong so I kind of let it drift for a few years and then just before going to university I read the book again and I decided great the University is the place to ask questions and get answers well my university education disabuse me of that idea because what I found was either the answer I got back was not related to the question I asked or else I got actual hostility and that surprised me it finally meant that I got out of academia I began postgraduate research yeah upper atmosphere research but found that I was being sort of used the slave labor and decided to leave halfway through the first post-grad year and joined IBM in those years it was the Wild West of computing really and I got to learn everything because I never liked being presented with a black box I had to know how it worked that was part of my psyche I think and so with IBM I learnt the hardware the software the operating system the compilers and so on which eventually led me to being used as the systems engineer for the National University which when I looked back was an incredible piece of luck because this was at the time of the moon landings and I had access to the professors the libraries everything in those days they didn't have combination locks and electronic locks on everything so I could walk freely and ask questions and it actually had some friends amongst the academic staff so that's a bit of that background but after that book was published of course there was a funeral and I bought every book that came out I was impatient to get Velikovsky's next book and then some of the warriors came into the fore after the triple is ambushed and wrote books which I also got CJ ransom who spoke yesterday his age at Velikovsky which was published in 1976 and also Alfred de gracia compiled a book the Velikovsky affair which is well worth reading and that was published in 1966 now one of the tests of a good hypothesis because there's another theory until it's being tested experimentally or observational ii is the more outrageous yet correct prediction is the more weight it should carry in favor of that hypothesis and Velikovsky predicted that Venus had been incandescent only a few thousand years ago he said Venus is hot and this is a small excerpt from a 1964 interview with Eric Larrabee who was largely responsible as dr. Wolfe said for the publication of the worlds in collision in the face of a lot of opposition now you understand well that I had no personal means to send a Madrid Metro if I may be a devil's advocate just momentarily I know what many of your critics have said is that a prediction like this is a matter of chance and they imply that you were pointing things out of the air well obviously you could have said a great many other things about penis you could have said Venus has two moons or is made out of cottage cheese or something other than saying that it is hot what what led you in particular to say quite contrary to to the belief of the time the penis was a hot point well first I will see what they said at the end of my book is the very last two sections before the section the end I put two claims so the position which I selected for them in my book by itself proves the importance I gave to them this were first venus must be very hot Nastya must be very hot is very hot I called the chapter thermal balance of Venus and I said views gives off heat not as usually supposed to be a planet gets so much heat from the Sun and reflects on much heat in the space it leaves its own heat of course if it is a body like other bodies in the solar system of six million years or longer order of course on you wouldn't expect that it would give still give off heat he now I said also that that it was observed by contemporaries of those events and after as a an incandescent body at the same time still in 1959 it was calculated and accepted that the surface temperature of Venus is 17 degrees Celsius only about three degrees above the temperature of the earth very similar the world to earth in 1961 it was founded by radio signals arriving from Venus that it is very hot actually 600 Fahrenheit and your your reason for believing this was that your theory required that it be a new planet a young planet in geological astronomical time yes it was the cause of the needle heat but also the result of the short but we're storming history all this money and let me also say that 600 degree of 1959 was one of the reason to send the marina probe to find that it is not so I heard a man scientists from Jefferson Lab who speaking before the triple a convention in Philadelphia meet another expressed his hope that it will be found the temperature much lower what was found it was still higher not 600 800 degrees hmm now there is an outrageous yet correct prediction that alone should have galvanized really curious scientists to investigate his work further dr. Irving Wolfe talked about what happened in 1974 the triple a s San Francisco meeting in in that meeting which was organized as a symposium Velikovsky's challenge to science it was organized by professors Donald Goldsmith Owen Gingerich Ivan King and attended by Immanuel Velikovsky and professors Donald W Goldsmith Norman W stone Cal sagen J Darrell Mulholland and Peter Huber Fred gen'l'men who was one of the inner circle described as an ill planned didactic ambush that failed to discredit Velikovsky and actually had an unexpected backlash on his detractors that was written in an article called a kick in the ass and David stove is an Australian philosopher and also one of the people who doesn't conform said we all grizzle about specialization professionalization departmental empire-building etc but unless and until you read the details of this case you can have no idea of the pitiless ferocity or the organizational muscle that organized science can display that was in an article called the Velikovsky story the scientific mafia that other book that's on there this is to the scientists confront Velikovsky and the other one is callously again in the manual villa cough ski which is quite a detailed piece of work by Charles Gyllenhaal who is one of Velikovsky's warriors now Cal say again did say something about Velikovsky on the program cosmos and let me have a look here it shows a double standard I think and also the fact that science is only trivially self-correcting today or other words during normal or settled science you can see that the herding instinct in science is very strong and this has only been made worse by the global internet type of groupthink amongst them and the double standard in evidence in scrutiny one side has chosen evidence is another's anathema extraordinary claims require only ordinary evidence settle science requires a bomb under it to move it experts in my opinion are the last to know when a fundamental change arrives the electric universe for example but when you look back all big changes even the idea of sending rockets to the moon which said to be impossible by experts heavier than air flight was to be impossible so the last thing you do is ask a gray-haired expert what the future holds because they will be the last to know so I show this now just to get an impression I think so again at this point felt some guilt for what he'd done there are many hypotheses in science which are wrong that's perfectly right it's the aperture to finding out what's right science is a self-correcting process to be accepted new ideas must survive the most rigorous standards of evidence and scrutiny the worst aspect of the Velikovsky affair is not that many of his ideas were wrong or silly or in gross contradiction to the facts rather the worst aspect is that some scientists attempted to suppress Velikovsky's ideas the suppression of uncomfortable ideas may be common in religion or in politics but it is not the path to knowledge and there's no place for it in the endeavor of science we do not know beforehand where fundamental insights will arise from about our mysterious and lovely solar system and the history of our study of the solar system shows clearly that accepted and conventional ideas are often wrong and that fundamental insights can arise from the most unexpected sources yet as I said say again is disingenuous and should have taken his own advice he was a key suppressor at the 1974 triple a s meeting here's an example of what I mean about experts being the last to know when a paradigm shift has begun in the Scientific American it says we are all impoverished by the selective rejection ism of modern science all of the taboos in science in this excerpt Velikovsky is troubled by the way ponse reports the San Francisco meeting and this was shown at the Portland sorry the meeting in at McMaster University in 1974 I had some information secondhand from Milton who had some inside information he said Villa cops he was assured by the editors of ponse that Ralph juergen's would oversee the final report usually Velikovsky lectures without notes at the San Francisco meeting he set to read his paper because he was fearful of omitting important points he was asked from the floor if any of his predictions had been disproved he answers he knows of none Velikovsky is angered that ponse did not print his response to Sagan's challenge to name which organic organic compound has a refractive index of one point four four and has infrared absorption features at three point four micrometers and eleven point two micrometers at the meeting Velikovsky did answer both questions at length these are important scientific bits of scientific evidence now this film shot there in June 1974 at the McMaster meeting is something that I did on a brand new codec 400-foot cartridge sound camera it was something that codec had finally done that was to introduce sound super 8 cameras I had taken my own I'd built my own radio microphone but it unfortunately suffered a lot of interference various times during the meeting and this is the only one that has good sound so this has never been seen before right would we create a gap of ourselves I'll see will repay them too so of course who have no admittance to answer publication are welcome to pass a high hopes of fancy will come to its beginning can be again a small is a beginning but regime as now the end of the world and was all the instrument in bringing you today here and thank you once more and I will probably save you as for Joe's continue what I could not see here in at the buffer to see once more thank you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so that was my first meeting with Velikovsky and you saw the reference to me by coming from the ends of the world [Laughter] and I have here some photographs taken at that meeting on the left is Velikovsky standing to answer a question from in the audience he his daughter wrote to me and asked for a copy of that photo and I sent it to him and received they a thank you from him you can see some of the crowd there I can just pick out my wife up the back there somewhere and but there are a lot of the the Warriors visible in some of these photographs and on the riders Steve Talbert now it's interesting that my connection with the talbert's started with Steve because I had written to him once I knew that this conference was on and stating what I had done and my interest and so on and he invited me to sit on one of the panels so I got to meet people there and it was the there of course that I also met bill Mellon and was very impressed by his opening address another shot of the McMaster meeting there's one of our Scottish scholars sitting in the middle there he did a lot of work with the Society for interdisciplinary studies which was the UK of the Velikovsky and movement if you like to put it that way there's many people I can pick out of that but it gives you some idea of the crowd also speaking at that meeting and somebody who had also had inspired me I put him there's a leftenant of Velikovsky really on scientific side Ralph juergen's I've tried everything I can think of to get more photos of Ralph but that one was taken at the Grand Canyon and I've been in touch with a good friend of his was dr. Earl Milton the physicist from Lethbridge Alberta and I've been in touch with earl milton's son and he's looked through all of the material that he has of his father's but i've not been able to get another photograph of him which is a great pity bill Milton wrote about him in 1973 and 1974 Jurgens did yeoman service in preparing Velikovsky for San Francisco or serving as Ponce's physical science gatekeeper Jurgens served as Velikovsky's research advisor providing invaluable interpretation which avoided many pitfalls within the sea of commentaries now being made about the state of planet Venus Ralph also coached the manual about how to present himself when he faces his opponents at San Francisco this is one of the inspirational things that I got from Ralph juergen's if the Sun and the stars indeed succeed in fusing lighter elements to form heavier ones other relevant activities carried out more or less in plain sight in their atmospheres having asked this question though Jergens nevertheless went on to estimate the electrical energy and voltages based on no input from the nuclear process in other words if there is nuclear processes going on in the photosphere he merely calculated the electrical energy in required to provide the radiant energy output of course to say this flies in the face of particle physics because the conditions in that 5000 degree or so photos is not sufficient of course to even begin to talk about nuclear fusion according to standard thinking he says here and this was a key to his model and one which is now being tested by Sapphire the electric Sun hypothesis assigns the solar body the role of an anode that of the higher potential electrode in a cosmic electric discharge that's the simplicity of the model and also the the genius of Ralph was to identify the fact that all of the detailed features that we actually observe to be seen in an anode discharge and of course the most confronting thing he said was the modern Astrophysical concept that describes the sun's energy to thermonuclear reactions deep inside in the solar interior is contradicted by nearly every observable aspect of the Sun that should have been a huge warning bell in the halls of the academia but as they say when you're woken by a loud noise you get very annoyed it was in a few years later in 1979 I was working for the Australian government of briefly in Washington DC and while there I took the opportunity my family was with me I rang Velikovsky at his home and mentioned our meeting in 1974 and I asked whether it be possible to visit and talk to him about the work that I was interested in he and his wife graciously had us there on the 29th of April 1979 and it was there that he in answer to my question what is that we don't understand about gravity he gave me this small pamphlet cosmos without gravitation it was a synopsis of a more comprehensive document written from 1941 to 1943 so here I'll give you some of the chapter headings to give you the flavor of what's inside first of all and this is fundamental gravitation is an electromagnetic phenomenon so now you can see where I got it from this is where it all started he gave a list of phenomena not in accord with the theory of gravitation he looked at the attraction between two atoms and this is something that had occurred to chemists the molecular attraction between atoms can sometimes be down to dipole forces the fact that the atoms are distorted in a molecule gives them one side of the molecule are slightly more positively charged than the other and this of course is a feature of j'arrive Pollock's work where the water molecule is distorted so that one side is more positive than the other you have a positive and a negative dipole he covers the attraction of bodies toward the earth the time of a saint and descent of a pendulum because he thought they should be different and the effective charge on the weight of the body if I get a chance I'll talk about why that idea really doesn't work but that took a long while to figure out and of course his statement that attraction repulsion you'll notice he's talking about repulsion between bodies as well because the dipole can repel as well as attract and electromagnetic circumduction act in the solar system that was his claim he also covered the anomaly of mercury and other phenomena where he tries to explain them these are some of the phenomena not in accord with the theory of gravitation according to Velikovsky water is 800 times heavier than air but millions of tons of water droplets are held miles above the ground in clouds and Jerry Pollock I think has shown the way to under stand that mountains don't exert the pool expected by gravity that massive rock should attract a plumb-bob slightly towards it it doesn't so that gave rise to the theory of isostasy where you have to have a mountain underneath the earth to kind of balance out the forces so the pendulum actually points towards the center of the earth this is the kind of extremes you have to go to when your theory doesn't really work gravity is stronger over oceans than land the spinning gaseous son should be oblate it's almost a perfect sphere gravity can't restore orbital perturbations there is nothing to restore a slight departure from your orbit caused by another body so that over time the whole thing becomes chaotic in fact it has been calculated I think by the orbital dynamicists that the solar system should not remain stable for more than a few million years beyond that time it should be destroyed by chaotic behavior the sweep of a comet's tail around the Sun that's not a gravitation it's not explained by our gravitational effects and Laplace he notes calculated the speed of gravity must be in excess of 50 million times the speed of light so these are all the keys that I had given to me by Velikovsky in particular this his idea this is his idea here each atom is made up of positive and negative electricity and though neutral as a whole and these are his words may form an electric dipole when subject to an external electric force attraction is not due to inherent gravitational properties of matter I wouldn't say mass but instead to the well-known electrical properties of attraction two dipoles arrange themselves like bar magnets on a slippery surface if you just throw them on the surface they'll try and attach north-south north-south and daisy-chain and there they will always swing to try and attract one another however if grab and this is the arguments against that simple model and Velikovsky gave me that document on the basis that it was a preliminary thinking it certainly had a lot of questions left if gravity were that simple an electric field across a polarizable dielectric that is like in a capacitor shouldn't modify gravity markedly because they are you're distorting the atoms in an electric field but it doesn't it does slightly in the by field Brown effect where you capacitor tends to move in the direction of one of the charge plates but that doesn't explain gravity and it should be shielded by a metal conductor because this is we're dealing with a bulk electrical field it isn't also the atomic dipole force is too strong it's the force that holds molecules together one of the forces and if we were held to the earth like a molecule we'd be you know maybe a few centimeters thick on the surface so having been given in 1979 the keys I had what they call the prepared mind I was on the lookout for a classical physics approach the kind of approach that got us to the beginning of the 20th century and has given us all of the technology we see now very little of the 20th century beyond about the 1920s has contributed much at all to modern technology it came in a tiny advertisement in the Scientific American in December 1981 and it advertised the Journal of classical physics and the first issue by Ralph Sainsbury who was the originator of this journal was called electron structure now Velikovsky had shown that it was the structure of matter which may give rise to the electric force and if the electron has structure that's important so this was one of the keys he what he did was to repeat the atomic orbital model of smaller charge particles inside the electron and proton so imagine them as tiny atoms it's a repeated pattern the kind of fractal approach to looking at science and by assuming the electrons have this simple structure ralph explained magnetism he was able to derive amperes law just by based on this simple model most importantly this model requires for an electron to remain stable that the electric force operates between all of the bits that make up that electron instantly if there's any delay then the particles don't know where each other are and the whole thing flies apart in fact he calculated that the particles if they were free to move outside the electron would travel from here to the far side of the Andromeda galaxy in one second now this gives you an idea of the speed of the electric force and that gives you the idea of the speed of gravity it also simplified things here we have the electric force explains magnetism and gravity and classical physics was all about simplification not inventing more and more forces and particles to get a Nobel Prize it was to try and find out the real nature of matter and the thing about or one of the principles I've worked on ever since getting all of these ideas is that the simple of the model the more likely it is to be correct and also this model provides a real basis for quantum behavior cause-and-effect re-instated quantum theory got rid of cause and effect Einstein got rid of any means of measuring things because he removed any standards between them here the two of them they got rid of physics of just R it also discards the wave-particle duality of life rough did some experiments at great cost to himself which I didn't prove his view of it but I think it it helped me to understand light as a wave motion only I don't think I'll miss around with this understands equivalence where you know gravitational mass in an inertial mass are said to be equivalent they're not in fact even the picture there shows that the guy standing on the earth is being attracted to all the atoms in the earth which means he's being attracted out to the horizon and the others from the other side of the earth it's nothing like being pushed in or up in a lift or in a rocket the equivalence in that diagram is not there Velikovsky said that the Equality of inertial and gravitational mass is a remarkable accidental coincidence in Newton's system and he's right it's impossible to adopt Einsteins equivalence principle of inertia and gravity because an outside observer cannot observe the earth with all the lifts traveling in different directions once again you've lost is your measurement standard of your place in the universe through Einsteins work everything is relative it suggests the equivalence is the same because subatomic electric dipoles are responsible for both the attractive force of gravity and the repulsive force of inertia exactly the same process so you can expect them to be equivalent once you understand it Velikovsky said it is probable that besides carrying a charge the ground turns all of its atoms as dipoles towards the ionosphere and that's what I've been showing the last few years in my presentations like this and the result is that you have the positive heavy nuclei drawn towards the center of mass and the other pole the negative poles facing outwards and this changes our view of celestial dynamics immediately but this is Velikovsky didn't take this step in fact it took me decades to take this step because it raises all sorts of other issues I'm pleased to say that I mean this infers that the insides of celestial bodies are hollow because you've got a repulsive force pushing outwards and a repulsive force from the rest of the matter in the universe pushing inwards and the most stable form in that case is a thick spherical shell which means that we know nothing about what's inside the earth or the Sun or any other body or the moon I was on well to say at various times in my journey in the electric universe I've come to a point where I've said oh my god how am I ever going to tell anyone about this because you know it's really confronting I mean it's like going from the Flat Earth to a spherical earth and it takes time to get over that until I find enough evidence that I feel I can actually give a story which is convincing and I knew that I had to look for seismic evidence to show that it's a shell and not a solid sphere or even a solid and liquid sphere part of the evidence came from the Apollo moon landings the first ones where they crashed the one of the the Lunar Module back into the moon having placed a seismometer on the moon so this was the first seismic experiment on any other body than the earth and what was the result the moon rang like a bill for almost an hour well that one set the geologists back on their heels because the most obvious answer is that the moon is hollow but of course they couldn't accept that so they've made a really complicated story to try and get around it but then I came across that somebody sent me a link to work by a South African he was also in I tears I had been from all of my career and he'd come to look at deep earthquakes because he was interested in this the old stories of Hollow Earth and theories because they gave back hundreds of years and he found that the best answer to the seismic evidence was that the earth is a shell a hollow shell and when I looked at his evidence he'd done a very good job of analyzing and I realized here we have sufficient evidence to really investigate further you'll notice too that the outside of every celestial body will have a negative pole facing outwards it's like having the same pole of a magnet in a shape of a sphere and if you have two of those bodies you try and push them together you all know what it's like trying to push like poles of a magnet magnets together so all stars and planets in the universe repel each other with an inverse square law this answered a question that troubled Helton up because his research which I think is outstanding showed that the universe is balanced it's not collapsing it's not expanding it seems to be just hanging there and you can't do that if gravity is pulling everything together so this answered that question to gravity on the cosmic scale is repelled if Newton's attractive force has a very limited sphere of influence there is an internal gravitational field that is repulsive and the interiors of all celestial bodies are not what we think the solar system Velikovsky said attraction repulsion and electromagnetic circumduction act in the solar system but of course Velikovsky was unaware that the plasma shields electric fields so is much more complex than that there was no mention of either of how you establish feedback to have settled the solar system down from the chaotic state just a few thousand years ago to the present clockwork order the Sun had made planets and satellites comets are all charged bodies and are injured interdependent this is Velikovsky once again the Sun is charged negatively with respect to the earth now this statement is incorrect because J of Jergens later work the Sun is a magnet the form of the corona suggests a strong magnetic field well Villa cops key was the first one to talk about magnetism on other bodies really in it with any coherent hypothesis the bacon but he said the sun's charge and rotation must produce a stronger magnetic field because a rotating charged body must produce a dipole magnetic field that's been dismissed because when they calculate how much charge you need there so it's impossible that they're using plain electrostatics that forget plasma the charged planets move as charged bodies at right angles to the sun's magnetic field that's what he thought in other words it was more like electric motor than and this is the point pardon me gravity exists and gravity is a special form of the electric force almost identical to magnetism it's just that those two forces are created under different circumstances one of the free subatomic level and the other one trapped in an atom but they're identical to that extent now the big journey came when the Saturn story came up because I read Dave Taylor's book published in 1980 as soon as it came out and writer Cardona had been an inspiration to me ever since the Chronos and ponse articles began to be published and it was in the fall of 1977 in Chronos three number one do i do published the sun of night which referred to saturn which caught my attention of course and Radha's research was sufficiently well documented and thought through that I used his findings as a basis for trying to understand the history of the solar system the recent history because I wanted to know you know where did Venus come from where did the earth come from where did Mars come from what had happened and could it be explained in in proper classical physics so he and I corresponded quite a lot and he published many of my articles in Chronos so the two of us this is where myth can become science instead of as we have now science becoming myth and the resulting cosmological picture that emerged had to be simple and coherent but as it turns out the story that unfolded would make 2001 a Space Odyssey look like child's play I'd love to see this work in an IMAX theater dr. L Milton was a good friend and visited us at the time of Halley's Comet appearance and stayed with us in Canberra I took this photo in 1983 I had been posted by the government to London twice which was very unusual in the 80s and I had invited to speak to the SAS group over there it was with the SAS group that I began my first writing of articles and having them published in 1980 he and Jergens independently concluded that a comet nucleus would be scarred and the this is a direct quote like an electrode in an arc over time the cometary nucleus should become cratered and pitted when a spacecraft finally achieves a rendezvous with one of the Comets scientists are going to be surprised to find a surface pitted like that of the moon Mars or mercury and that was written at the time when scientists had never seen a comet surface the first flyby took place six years later in England I caught up with Eric crew who was a disciple of Charles Bruce and you'd be surprised this is one of the things that continues to surprise me is that there seems to be no new ideas under the Sun because you find that people in the past have had the same ideas but they've only gone so far and not put the whole picture together which I see as my job is putting the big picture together dr. Bruce is lightning research with the electrical research Association and the attendance at Sydney Chapman's 1941 Kelvin lecture on the Sun led to the application of these ideas to cosmic phenomena and to a new all-electric universe Charles Bruce wrote the surfaces of stars can be explained as lightning discharges which are observed in the atmosphere of the earth in 1944 that was only a toddler then wrote in fact it may well be that both Jupiter and Saturn were at one time - stars and that their satellite systems were formed as the result of minor or planetary Nova outburst I couldn't have said it better myself Eric did a lot of work trying to get Bruce acknowledged for his work and I only missed him seeing him on one of my occasions in England I realized before he died which was unfortunate I've managed to meet most of the people I wanted to see because the job took me around the world very often now 1994 and this is 20 years after the Portland making sorry after the McMaster meeting Dave Talbert put on a international conference called Villa Kowski ancient myth and modern science and this is where I saw Dave's presentation he missed mine I was talking about Velikovsky and the evidence for having been recent recently born and I said to him I think we should join forces because our combined story is far more powerful than either one of us alone I've severed a little together with a film that might be of interest if that's a good time okay Mel and Amy Aitchison were amongst the first people I met when I went back in 1996 December and camped on Dave's office floor for a month and then we put on a meeting in Portland in 1997 Mel and Amy introduced me to help nap and there was an inspiration another inspiration and then in May 2000 help nap spoke at our conference along with Tony Pratt whom you've heard a lot about and it was a historic event more important I would say than the Solvay conference all that those decades earlier Alton Hobbs views on cosmology published in seeing red set the goal posts for electric universe cosmology are done a lot of work on the Sun and the solar system this painted the the bigger picture and the whole thing became a more coherent cosmology this is Tony paraffin I the quest to understand Velikovsky's electrified cosmos led to plasma cosmology a subject ignored by astrophysicists despite its engineering heritage and successful predictions here was a critical juncture when Anthony when Tony joined us at the request of Dave Talbot for a conference in May 2000 Tony's research gave us the opportunity to verify the convergence of the myth a historical record with high-energy electrical discharges in space plasma and this is some film of the historic Portland meeting one of the gas giants and then two of orbits and they circularized within so so like we're anyway we see the our objects the galaxies with ejections long line and we see all their galaxies along any line the way around the problem is that if they come out this way without a and component they only go up and down and they stay along so that I think we have perfectly good impairments for objects being formula on the line and staying along the data creates patterns that have to be explained I mean this configuration as it has been reconstructed after this point has some incredibly specific components and interact between them and it is in fact actually at that level of greater deal that the power of the model itself just begins to flower and it becomes extremely compelling because it's so specific the relationships are so specific and it's so ludicrous how could it possibly be confirmed but you know exactly what needs to be firmed because it's defined by these relationships you go and you and there it is and it's a puzzle for the I mean we have proved this a thousand times Deb and I were having and we would have these incredible experiences just the things we look for once we can identify what should be found well be found I have one more little clip to show and this was a science meeting in London where Tony and I were speaking I was talking on the electric universe and the certain configuration or how to explain the impossible I was followed by tony peratt on the origins of icons from antiquity it was very refreshing to to to listen to wall stock on the universe and guess I play a rose some someone over role in establishing what is called the defies me and verse mention about the same thing a very refreshing to see that uh feel that I've worked in for gosh two-and-a-half decades or so and right now I'm working in something very closely related but it is but it's different it's petroglyphs okay it's not galaxies or rotation that getting fields in galaxy switch which websites are any number of publications but it's carvings on rock by man in prehistory now why why are these important this is a picture that I took on the Navajo Reservation and which is absolutely typical of Federalists that one will find around the world as I'm going to show petroglyphs have a definite orientation they also change in morphology and shape depending on the latitude that they're found on earth and this is

Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info A newly discovered star has astonished a team of scientists who say that nothing at this moment can explain what is happening. The star is called pulsar, which is a star that appears to pulse with intense radio wave emissions. However, the star in question switches unpredictably between radio and X-ray emissions, leaving astronomers openly baffled. According to lead author Wim Hermsen, "The people creating models will have to rethink what we are discovering here... When we look now to what is so far published in papers, nothing at this moment can explain what is happening." Why is this discovery so astonishing to astronomers? Pulsars were discovered back in 1967, they discovered that there was this string of radio pulses with a periodicity of 1.3 seconds coming out of the constellation of Vulpecula. So they didn't know what that was, they called it pulsars and there was a big puzzlement and about a year later the famous astronomer Tommy Gold postulated that the reason that these pulses were being created is that there was a rapidly rotating star acting very much like a lighthouse rotating a light beam and as it passed in the direction of Earth, we'd see this blink, we could see this emission of radio waves and then it would go off for a while while this star swung the rest of the way around those 360º and then blink, it would come back again 1.3 seconds later. And Gold was the one who postulated that that star must be a rotating neutron star because the darn thing was spinning around so quickly, imagine a star spinning and making it once around in 1.3 seconds. Now they've discovered this one, it has two different modes of operation. For a while it throws off pulses of X-rays and then changes its mind and then throws off pulses of high-frequency radio at very very different frequencies in a very very different mechanism. And so, they don't want to hear about two different mechanisms because there's only one mechanism, the rotating 'whatsis' is up there. The lighthouse analogy for the pulsars' flashes is attractively simple but because the flashes themselves are so complex there's been no way of explaining them currently. Now it is, when you look at it from an electrical point of view, the pulsar flashes have more in common with the complex radio signals induced in the ionosphere of the Earth by powerful lightning and this may be the key to this particular pulsar because lightning can also generate X-rays. Astronomers suggest that the pulsar's varying between radio wave and X-ray emissions may be caused by changes in the star's magnetosphere. This suggestion brings them closer to the electrical theorists' interpretation. I just looked up a copy of Healy and Peratt's paper, their paper on pulsars back in 1995, it was called 'Radiation Properties of Pulsar Magnetospheres: Observation, Theory and Experiment'. Healy was at the VLA, the Very Large Array of national radio astronomy in Socorro, New Mexico and Peratt, of course, was at Los Alamos Lab and they did a very in-depth study of all of the known properties of pulsars. If you stop and think about Healy and Peratt's ideas, if this is an electrical oscillation, there are all sorts of circuits that man uses now and (that) have been developed in electrical engineering laboratories, that put out different signals at different frequencies and switch back and forth between one mode of operation and another mode of operation. So it's (a) strong strong strong suggestion that what we are observing is an electrical oscillation that has a couple of different modes of operation. We see it in the lab everyday. The Healy and Peratt model of the pulsing signals from a star doesn't require a rotating object or the lighthouse effect. What it says in effect is that there is a discharge that occurs close to the star which then travels along the magnetic field lines outwards from the star where it meets a disk of matter surrounding the star. Where it meets that more dense matter disk, there is a kind of short circuit (that) occurs and the signal is reflected. It's just like a transmission line in electrical engineering theory. And in fact, the signal does reverse phase which is what you'd expect in that condition. So in other words, it's a kind of confirmation of their model, if you like. Now this particular pulsar is switching between radio, strong radio signals and strong X-ray signals, for reasons that are unknown. It suggests to me that where the short circuit occurs in this signal regime, in a less dense atmosphere you're getting radio signals, radio pulses. In a more dense atmosphere it forms more like a lightning discharge and X-rays are being generated. So that would be my view of this particular pulsar. What Healy and Peratt have done is to provide a model which is amenable to experiment and to verification on Earth in the laboratory; as distinct from a model which invokes an unknown form of matter, a neutron star, and an object rotating faster than a dentist's drill in some cases. It seems to me that until we get the concepts right, we will never get a correct answer. For continuous updates on Space News from the Electric Universe, stay tuned to Thunderbolts.info 
[Music] The world of science is in the midst of an accelerated changing of paradigms. What I mean by paradigm is a set of metaphysical assumptions, or a worldview, by which all subsequent observations and reasoning are interpreted. Physics is what we think about. Metaphysics is how we think about it. For example, for the past two centuries, scientists have assumed that the present is the key to the past. Before that, they assumed that the past was the key to the present. The assumptions are a free choice; the consequences are not. We're mostly unaware of the paradigms that shape the way we think, and when they change we become confused. We  begin to doubt values and ideas that we've taken for granted. We begin  to recognize falsifying evidence. We begin to consider alternative explanatory  ideas. Familiar relationships fall apart. We no longer know what to think. Metaphysics overshadows physics. With the previous worldview in doubt, we have few benchmarks to judge new ideas. As with beginning to assemble a jigsaw puzzle from a pile of pieces, we must push pieces around to find what  fits. We need to play with them. I'll use as an example the differences between the Electric Universe - EU model of cosmology, and the Standard Model. The EU model assumes that electricity and plasma ideas are the most important for explanatory purposes. The Standard Model assumes that gravity and gas ideas are the most important. Discussions of the differences between the models often seem confused by lack of clarity and how we think about the ideas. Some of it seems to arise from imprecision in the use of such words as observations, data, evidence, facts, and theories. People tend to use those words interchangeably, but they can be applied more carefully to mark distinctions in the process of knowing. I think of observations as groups of nerve activations, and data as strings of electrical on-off signals without interpretation by some theory. They are the immediate responses of detectors, whether biological or electronic, to stimuli. Noting the colors of a traffic light and holiday lights, or the number a meter needle points to, are all observations. Evidence is a group of observations or data selected to be relevant to a preconceived, but evolving idea of the phenomenon that's of interest. Evidence is ambiguous; it can be relevant to several different phenomena and its meaning will be different with each one. Observations of red light are relevant both to traffic signals and to holiday lights, but you won't get a ticket for not stopping at a Christmas tree. Still, evidence isn't arbitrary; a light is red and not green. A meter needle points to three, and not to eight. Facts are evidence interpreted by a theory. The theory provides the meaning. For the theory of traffic signals, red means stop. With a theory of circuits, a meter reading of 3 means 3 Volts. Evidence tells you that something is, theory tells you what something is. Facts make sense of evidence. A  theory is a set of interrelated ideas that are constrained and shaped by facts, but that also define and determine what facts are. Theories and facts are inter- related. Facts can't exist apart from the theory that they support, and it also gives them meaning. This is what is meant by the phrase, ’facts are theory-laden’. Conversely, theories are fact-laden. These are not independent processes, but different emphases on a single, evolving process of making sense that's circular, iterative and reflexive. ’Making’ is a creative act that involves imaginative interpretation; it's an intrinsic aspect. ’Making sense’ is not simply seeing what's naively there. A successful ‘making’ results in a narrative or story that is coherent, consistent, and corresponds with the theory's interpretation of the selected  evidence. These definitions are soft; they add clarity to the usual vagueness, but  don't entirely eliminate it. Additional confusion arises from thinking that Electric Universe ideas are simply added on to accepted ideas, of what's called the Standard Model. This has been called the inertia of prior belief. Rather, EU ideas are founded on different selections of observations and data - different evidence - and the different interpretations of evidence - different facts. We observe lights. We select for our evidence the ones in the sky that appear to move around the Earth. We call them stars. Before  Newton, the interpretation that made sense of this evidence was that  the stars moved in perfect circles, in the perfect heavens by their intrinsic nature. After Newton, the idea of gravitational force replaced that geometric idea. With gravity, things have an intrinsic property of mass, whose nature is  to attract other mass with an inverse square of the distance relationship. With ideas of electrically active plasma, things have an inherent property of charge, whose nature is to attract opposite charge and to repel  like charge, while inducing spin. Mixing these ideas, is like mixing  water and dirt - you get mud. The EU model has a different cognitive framework from Newtonian and relativistic mechanics. We must unlearn several assumptions that we usually take for granted without being aware of them. We presume that space is dark and empty, or practically so. It's empty because it's dark. We don't sense anything, so there must not be anything there. But now that scientists have invented sensors that detect stimuli outside our biologically limited ranges, radio, infrared, ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma ray telescopes and so on, we know that space is full and bright. It's full of radiating plasma. The inertia of prior belief leads us to think that the few atoms and particles in space behave as a familiar gas. We take it for granted that mass and velocity are the important parameters and movements are determined by collisions. But a century of experimentation with plasma has shown that the primary characteristics are electromagnetic - Birkeland Currents, double layers, cell formation, pinch effects, sorting of constituents, multiple velocities, evolving instabilities, electrically versus thermally generated radiation. We never question that the weak force of gravity dominates. But again, both lab experiments and observations in space have shown that plasma forces can be many orders of magnitude greater than those of gravity and gas. For example, the arms of spiral galaxies should show that the stars move more slowly with distance from the center if they are orbiting a central gravitating mass. Doppler evidence shows them to have about the same velocity, as if the galaxy were being stirred from the edge. One EU model speculation is that a galaxy is a transverse pinch in a giant intergalactic Birkeland Current with multiple filaments. The filaments twist around the axis and their location around the periphery of the galaxy drives its rotation. It's more like an electric motor than a mechanical clock. Marklund Convection builds up quasi-neutral plasma that spirals away from the peripheral filaments. The increased ion and current densities push the plasma into glow mode and generate stars and secondary pinches. Think of a ring galaxy with somewhat evenly spaced hot spots, hydrogen-2 regions near the edge. The hot spots would be where the filaments cross the intergalactic pinch plane. Keep in mind that this is a simplistic illustration for the purpose of contrasting an idea of electrically- driven, far from equilibrium resonant motion, with the unquestioned idea of inertial gravitational rotation at energy equilibrium. Real galaxies are surely more complex. We also take for granted that equilibrium conditions prevail, fully specifiable and represented mathematically with continuous functions. In contrast, plasma conditions are often far from equilibrium and discontinuous. An excess of energy flows through active plasma, and some of it is dissipated in the evolving instabilities and radiation. Conditions are better represented by the mathematics of complexity, with discontinuities, bifurcations, resonance states and emergent orders. The EU model is not the Standard Model of a four-dimensional non-linear geometry, relativity, or a differential calculus of continuous variables, Newtonian mechanics and ideal gas theory. It's not the hypothetical and metaphorical abstractions of mathematical model making. It's observed behavior, putting the empirical back in empirical method. And it's not a finished theory. Only a handful of experimenters have been looking into the nature of plasma for scarcely a century and their investigations are also permeated with the vagueness I'm describing. The unconscious assumptions of familiar gravity and gas thinking prejudice everyone's judgment and often can only be corrected over time by trial and error  processes. The EU model is a work in progress. [Music] [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info A recently released video clip provides stunning support for the Electric Universe interpretation of  one of the most dramatic atmospheric phenomena on Earth -- above-clouds lightning. On October 15th, 2019, a pilot named Chris Holmes was flying about 35,000 feet above the Gulf of Mexico when he noticed multiple forms of powerful electrical discharge called sprites and jets erupting from a thunderhead. The still image seen here is a "gigantic jet", a towering form of electrical discharge reaching all the way to the ionosphere, which is now known to sometimes occur above powerful thunderstorms. This exceedingly rare video clip reveals the top of the cloud from which the jet emerged, affording a groundbreaking opportunity for insights into the phenomenon. Investigator Oscar van der Velde, of the Lightning Research Group, split the video footage into individual frames and described the observed sequence for the website spaceweather.com He states, "First, relatively cool  blue filaments spring up. These are streamers akin to St. Elmo's fire. Next, after the jet reaches its maximum height, another feature crawls more slowly out of the cloud top -- a white-hot 'lightning leader'." The Space Weather article notes why this is a surprise for conventional meteorology, "For years, some researchers thought that gigantic jets could reach such extreme heights only if their streamers got a boost from the lightning leader. Holmes's video shows just the opposite: the gigantic jet reaches the ionosphere before the lightning leader even leaves the cloud." Oscar van der Velde concludes on the images, "This suggests that there may be a much more powerful electric configuration inside the thunderstorm than was previously thought--perhaps as much as 200 million volts." To understand the significance of these insights for the Electric Universe predictions and interpretations of extreme above-clouds electrical discharge, let us first consider a surprising historical background on the question of so-called lightning in Earth's upper atmosphere. Although numerous eyewitness accounts of the phenomena including the testimony of airline pilots trace back many decades, it was only in the late 1980s that the first photographic evidence was obtained of an above-clouds discharge called a sprite. However, as early as the 1920s, the Scottish physicist C.T.R. Wilson predicted the existence of brief flashes of light above large thunderstorms. A fundamental question that must be asked is, do scientists today really understand lightning? As those who follow this series are aware, what we observe in nature, as well as recent scientific discoveries demonstrate that the answer is no. These points are illustrated when we consider the research into lightning by Professor Edgar Bering of the University of Houston. In 2001, when Bering flew a high-altitude balloon above a thunderstorm, he made the unexpected discovery that when lightning strikes occur both above and below the clouds, the electrical charge was already present and did not take time to build up between lightning strikes. This contradicts the standard notion that lightning is the generator of the clear air electric field measured at about 100 volts per meter between the Earth and a clear sky. In standard theory, lightning's generation of power requires water droplets to separate charge in clouds, a process that remains mysterious and unverified. The Electric Universe theory, however, sees lightning and the cloud activity as a "load" that is being driven by electric currents from the Sun. It is the electrical circuitry between the Sun and the Earth that drives all lightning. And scientific research provides support for the role of the electric Sun-Earth connection in lightning. As we reported previously, in 2014, scientists in the UK discovered a dramatic increase in lightning strikes for up to 40 days after a major solar storm. Simply put, the reason the aforementioned observation of the gigantic jet is "surprising" is that the electrical charge that created the jet was already sitting at the cloud tops, which is not surprising at all from the Electric Universe  perspective. As physicist Wal Thornhill has proposed, the highest clouds essentially act like one plate of a capacitor which responds to the build-up of charge in the ionosphere above, which is where the above- clouds lightning terminates. Thornhill explains, the gigantic jets and other forms of above-clouds electrical discharge are electrical breakdown channels in the Earth's "leaky  atmospheric capacitor." The discharge channel of Birkeland filaments narrows and forms the bright jets as it reaches into the more dense lower atmosphere. On our planet, we benefit from having clouds to distribute lightning more widely than on other planets. For instance, Venus does not have water clouds, yet the early Russian Venera space probes discovered evidence for Venusian lightning which is both vastly more frequent and powerful than Earthly lightning. And on the planet Mars, where the rarefied atmosphere is about 1/2 of 1% as dense as Earth's, the clearest evidence for powerful lightning-like discharges is in its towering dust tornados and global dust storms which are electrically driven phenomena, and just as Earthly lightning appears to increase in direct response to increased solar activity, we now have evidence that dramatic dust-raising events on Mars may be linked to outbursts from the Sun. For several years, scientists have puzzled over dramatic dust plumes which occasionally erupt up to hundreds of kilometers above the surface of Mars. As we reported in 2016, investigators studying data from the Mars Express spacecraft found that, immediately before the observation of a dramatic plume, the planet was hit by a powerful CME from the Sun. As one investigator noted, "It's very surprising that was affecting Mars right before the plume was first observed." So it seems that an understanding of high-energy electrical discharge phenomena on planets, including Earth, will demand a new understanding of the electrical nature of the Sun and of all stars. It was well over a century ago that physicist Kristian Birkeland proposed that the earthly Aurorae were produced by electric currents from the Sun. Astronomers almost universally rejected the idea for many decades, until it was finally confirmed by discovery. Likewise, all forms of lightning, as well as the most powerful gigantic jets in our upper atmosphere, testify to the electrical circuitry that connects all celestial bodies in our solar system and indeed pervades the entire universe. 
[Music] Gareth Samuel is a science educator and frequent contributor to the Thunderbolts Project. He also produces an outstanding video series on Electric Universe Theory that aims at the very heart of science. He chose the perfect title for his YouTube channel and you should check it  out. It's called “See the Pattern”. If a repeating pattern emerges from  nature we should recognize it as significant. To truly understand it, we should be able to explain its cause and effect and reproduce it. Seeing the pattern and discovering its  cause and effect is what science is all about. The proof is in recreating the pattern. Not by subjectively programmed and data- fixed mathematical models, but by physical demonstration of the physics involved. This essay presents a challenge for those with a knack for playing with electricity. I'm going to show you a pattern - call it the ‘keystone pattern’, because it's a pattern of key significance  and its effect can be found in geology, so it's written in stone. It's  a pattern that results from electrical discharge. I'll show you this pattern and explain it in the best plain language I can, and then it'll be up to you to reproduce it. It  shouldn't be hard, in fact it's been done before. You may know the pattern as the “crooked smile” if you followed the Electric Universe for several years. Michael  Steinbacher and Billy Yelverton produced the pattern in the image shown. I believe it was Michael who called it the crooked smile. I'm giving it a new name,  the keystone name, because the smile is only part of the pattern. Michael intuitively understood this pattern was the result of a multi-phase discharge. He was trying to reproduce the shape of Valles Marineris on Mars. He assumed  correctly that by creating a discharge in Billy's laboratory with the proper setup, they could reproduce Valles Marineris and they did. Unfortunately they didn't explain their experimental setup so we'll have to guess. My guess is they laid a metal plate on a table to form one electrode. They covered the metal plate with  a dielectric plate, probably glass or plastic to add resistance and enhance the reactive power. Then they hung another electrode a few inches above the plate and covered the plate  and sand. I believe they then took two leads from a three-phase power source, stepped into high voltage, and connected one lead to the plate and one lead to the hanging electrode, creating a point-to-plane electric field between two out-of-phase  circuits. The pattern is caused by electrical induction currents spread out in the horizontal plane from the vertically oriented, multi-phase discharge between the  electrodes. These type of induction currents are called ‘reactive power’ currents. You can think of it like aiming a fire hose at the floor. The stream of water from the nozzle is an analogy for the vertical discharge current. In terms of electricity, we call that ’real power’ because it's going where we want it. The water that splashes from the floor are ‘reactive currents’ or ‘reactive power currents’ in the case of electricity. There is splashing across the electrode plate. The stream of water hitting the floor is like electric current hitting resistance. Reactive power is the energy of currents that gets redirected by the resistance. The splash pattern that reactive power makes is peculiar and very specific to electromagnetism. Unlike water that splashes away vectored by kinetic energy and gravity, an electric current generates moving electric and magnetic fields that vector its reactive energy. So it generates a repeating fractal pattern. Reproducing in the lab is as compelling as scientific evidence can get. It's  also compelling when you can find it in nature. over and over again. We're going to use it to identify several electrical craters here on Earth, and doing so dispel the silly notion that Earth has been bombarded by asteroids and  comets. This image shows the keystone pattern again. Only this time I've annotated certain features over the Billy Yelverton/ Michael Steinbacher experiment. The pattern occurs over the duration of the discharge while it is in contact with the ground and making a complete circuit. Over time the voltage vector of reactive power, shooting out from the focal point, rotates around the pattern like the second hand of a clock, pointing to all points on the compass. Only it sweeps around counterclockwise instead  of clockwise. The current that follows this voltage vector lags behind it, like the minute hand of the clock chasing the second hand, but never catching up. At  the same time, magnetic fields are pulsing outward in concentric waves from the focal point and inducing current to follow it. This sets up an interference pattern of positively and negatively charged regions around the circle formed by the induced currents, where the sand grains which also carry charge, are either attracted or  repelled. It's much like a cymatic pattern created by a particular frequency of vibration. Only this is caused by induced out-of- phase currents, where the charge on the plate is the same as the sand. The sand is levitated away which is technically called ‘sputtering’. And it's levitated to a region of opposite charge where it sticks to form a  mountain. Within the image, the red cross represents primary reactive currents that splash at particular vectors from the discharge focused at the center of  the X. C is a filament of electrical induction or capacitive reactive current, and the one marked L is a filament of magnetic conduction reactive current. The  green dashed circle that surrounds the formation represents stray capacitance generated in concentric rings around the focus of the discharge made by magnetic fields. These are rings of step potentials that are expressed as hills and valleys, mountains or crater rims in geologic form- ations. The blue lines shown are the crooked smile that portray induction currents that follow the electric or magnetic fields, or both. On the left-hand quadrant, formed  by the red X, the electric field induction dominates, and the current flows straight to the encircling ring and makes a 90- degree turn to follow parallel to the ring, because the capacitor ring is a standing potential wave in the electric  field. The quadrant on the right is the magnetic induction-dominated region, so the current streams out perpendicular to magnetic field lines induced by the magnetic field. These lines intersect the green rings at 90 degrees. In the center through the top quadrant are bars of blue. The bars are unipolar winds that drag straight across the focal point of the discharge. They probably aren't truly unipolar winds; they're plasma winds, but they're heavily ionized and so they move extremely fast across the center of the discharge. They're probably the easiest feature to identify from reactive power currents. The crooked smile is a fractal circuit pattern of capacitive and inductive eddy currents in these particular quadrants of reactive power. The direction of current flow can go either way depending on polarity, so I don't usually show arrows in the diagrams. In the  top and bottom quadrants formed by the red X are where reactive currents form updrafts and downdrafts. The yellow star shown in the top quadrant is a downdraft current and the pale green swirl in the bottom quadrant is an updraft. These would be tornadoes and down- bursts of plasma, wind and lightning. They generally leave circular patterns of depressions or hills. The next image shows the same features more fully annotated. Note how the right- side magnetic induction currents marked Il, meet the encircling capacitance at 90 degrees, while on the left capacitive induction currents marked Ic bend 90 degrees to parallel the encircling capacitance. Note also that the upper half of the right and left quadrants are more inductive with tendrils crossing perpendicular to the encirclement, and the lower halves are more capacitive with parallel flows. The upper half also has currents flowing upward towards the top of the circle, whereas in the bottom half the current is parallel and flow downward towards the bottom of the circle. The difference is leading and lagging currents that are either following or leading the electric field. The left or capacitive quadrant will sometimes also develop z-shaped currents with current alternating its vector between magnetic and electric fields. The top and bottom quadrants produce up- and down-currents that circle the crux of the discharge in a ring- or toroidal current. The yellow star and green swirl are the face and footprint of this current. For those interested in math and fractals, phasors are calculated with complex  numbers. The complex numbers have a rational number of multipliers in the equations that apply to these top and bottom quadrants. The action of eddy currents is better understood with the following gif illustration that portrays the magnetic flux generated by the discharging current. The left hand side of this ‘compare’ image shows the field lines of magnetism created along the ground plane at 90 degrees to the discharge. The right-hand side has black lines indicating the path of induced reactive eddy currents that are created by this moving magnetic flux. I first discovered the pattern while examining the Laramie mountains in  Wyoming. The pattern can be a crater or a mountain, depending on polarity. I published  two articles on these mountains last year. It wasn't until this year that I recognized the pattern I found, was the same as Michael's crooked smile. The Laramie pattern was caused by a plasma mesocyclone with its central updraft representing the real power dis- charge, the firehose current in other words; a positive ion current, flowing up from the ground into the storm. The ground was negatively charged and so positive ionic matter from the winds collected there by static attraction, adhering to form the mountains. The mountains retain the shape of the winds, like a sand dune does, except for the influence of electromagnetism that form the keystone pattern. The pattern can be quantified and mapped with something called a phasor diagram. Phasors are 3D graphs of vectors. For electrical circuits they're used to determine the amplitude and direction of energy flow or power at a given time. In an alternating-current multiphase system there are two or more waves out of phase with each other. Phasors are used to determine the resultant vector for the flow of power, voltage, and current, when there are multiple  waves. Man-made circuits work fast when the energy sent down the wires is aimed straight and doesn't splash. Although some reactive power is needed, unwanted splashing is inefficient. It shows up as heat loss, signal noise and can even create plasma streamers from high voltage power connections. We  manage this with physical things like insulation, capacitors, transformers and generators to control frequency and amplitude and maximize what is called the real power, the fire hose power, as opposed to the reactive power or splashing. Nature lets energy splash all over the place and it results in plasma winds, storms and tornadoes. It also results in rock and mountain formation. The next  image you'll recognize is the Richat structure. The ‘compare’ image shows the basic keystone pattern features. The wind direction is verified, where possible, by the triangular faces of tetrahedral hills formed by supersonic shockwaves and rock dikes, that are not marked on this image, caused by wind and shock- waves. The Richat was created by a plasma tornado, spinning like a buzz saw, between two opposing jet streams. Tornadoes have a down-streaming core  wind inside the spinning updraft. A tornado electrically is called a Marklund current, and  it has a central core downdraft of ionic wind. That's why tornado genesis begins with a descending column of condensate meeting a rising swirl of dust. It's a connection being made - a down coming leader meeting our upcoming riser from the ground, to complete a circuit of opposing positive and negative current flows. The keystone pattern in the case of the Richat was caused by induction winds that hug the ground being fed by the pour downdraft that blew out beneath the up-drafting whirlwind. The next images show the wind pattern of the whirlwind, and the shock waves that resulted from the induction winds, crossing under the whirlwinds. The winds cross orthogonally and leave cross-hatched shock features. The Shoemaker crater in Australia provides another example of the keystone pattern. The crater doesn't show signs of rotation on the ground, like the Richat does, but the red cross of induced  ground currents formed a rock dike that is fairly pronounced, as are wind pattern mountains at the green encircling ring of capacitance forming the crater rim. Induction features can be either anodic or cathodic. If the ground is charged negative, and a windfall of positive ionic matter blows over, a mountain of adhering matter will form. If the negative ground is exposed to a ground-to-ground discharge it will sputter, or blast earth away and leave a de- pression. If the ground has positive matter in it, that will suck to the discharge, and fuse to form a rock dike. Examples of rock dikes formed by ground currents are shown in the next images. Anode and cathode features will appear alternately, as current passes through the encircling rings of capacitance, making interference patterns in the hills and crater rims. If you're wondering, do you find these patterns on the moon? No. Lunar  craters are from direct current - DC charges, because the moon is not alive with the geomagnetic field like Earth is. Earth is a multi-phase circuit and these patterns result from multi-phase, alternating current interactions. There are several craters that exhibit the fast unipolar winds crossing the crater rims caused by induction across the blue bar. Here are three in the next collage of images. The striations cross in each of these images show that winds crossed right across the center top of each of these craters. No one crater exhibits every feature perfectly. Some features are covered by sand, water, farms and cities; some have eroded, and some simply don't develop in every condition. The patterns develop from reactive currents in both the air and ground. There is, however, pattern consistency, when several features are evident in the correct position with respect to the quadrants of the phasor. Here are several craters from around the Earth most of them falsely attributed to meteors. They are the result of a discharge current flowing between Earth and sky; all exhibit aspects of the keystone  pattern. Note the ‘Q’ in each ring. At roughly the five o'clock position, each crater exhibits a hook-shaped slash or other anomaly through the ring. Of  course I've oriented the pictures so they are consistent. But note that  there is also similarity in the pattern of river channels connecting to the ring to either side of the Q mark. So there is a quick and dirty way to identify the keystone pattern. Just look  for the Q with a lightning bolt through it. Truth is always holistic. We've been trained to think our consciousness is constrained to the brain. It's not. [Music] 
[Music] While walking and talking with a friend who was a mechanical engineer, he asked me, what is science? Great question, which eventually led us to talking about what is lacking in today's science. I proposed that when an astronomer looks at a beautiful nebula, the first question should be what is the function of that? But of course, that is not the first question most astronomers ask. This is the crux of why astronomy is currently broken. Our first question should be, what function is that serving? And yet that is never even asked. Hence, modern astronomy can never understand anything it is looking at. With a surprised smile he said, give me an example [of] cosmological things having a function. I replied, did you know that the atmosphere above our heads has seven or eight distinct layers before it meets the magnetosphere? And the magnetosphere itself has seven or eight layers and structures which complete the connection to the solar wind? It takes all these layers and structures to connect the solar wind to the Earth. That is the function of those layers. If those layers were not present, then the solar wind would crash into the surface of the Earth creating a mix of ceramic and molten glass. These layers are not an accident. One of their purposes is to allow organic life to exist on Earth. The presence of plants and animals is a vital importance to the Earth, and hence to the solar system as a whole. To say that all of life on Earth is an accident, typifies how out of touch modern scientists are with reality. I feel the need to say that again: to say that all of life on Earth is an accident, typifies how out-of-touch modern scientists are with reality. Why would a planet have a magnetic body, and a plasma body, and a monoatomic body and a gaseous body? Why would the electric currents from the Sun go into and out of the poles of the Earth? Answer. The energy of the Sun must be digested by the Earth. Outside our Earth is a world of almost inconceivable fire, rarified beyond our understanding, so energetic, most atoms cannot exist. One must come down into the sphere of a planet before the electron and the proton can settle down enough, to come together into even the first molecules. And yet, here on the surface of the Earth, everything lives in a cool, wet world with rain and wood, and ice, and fish, rivers and fields. This is an enormous stepping down. This is a condensation, more extreme than liquid into ice. The matter itself must be carefully brought, through stage after stage of cooling and solidifying. These functional layers are what is needed to convert the solar wind energy to be usable here on Earth. My engineering friend said, that's a very poetic way to describe things. I thought about it and responded. Yes, but it's also the solution to an engineering problem. Where else have we seen the union of engineering solutions with beauty? Oh, that's right. We see it everywhere here on Earth. Every butterfly wing, every spider web, every musical instrument, every flower, every perfectly tuned car engine, all built to solve a very practical problem and all beautiful. The Victorian idiot warmongers who have forfeited their sex and the Darwin school flunkies, have somehow convinced many of us that life is ugly and brutish and somehow makes sense, only if profits are kept up, and new territories are conquered. Nature always makes a profit, but not at the expense of itself, and somehow does it by maintaining a very high standard of beauty. If our current scientists are not trained in beauty, they will forever miss the mark. Tell me your explanation of things; if it lacks beauty, then I will know you are on the wrong track. The Electric Universe position helps with all this. I am still at a bit of a loss how this is so. In 2010 I came across Wal Thornhill's work on how supernovae make much more sense as an electrical phenomenon and that began my journey of seeing that including electricity in the models naturally paints the correct picture of a hierarchical universe. Maybe it's because electricity naturally travels between larger and smaller worlds. Maybe it's the other way around, and people who feel that we live in a living Universe are drawn to using electricity as a way of describing what they see. For too long the progress of contemporary science has been made absurdly slow because we have no idea what we're looking for. Whereas if we started with the idea that we live in a living Universe which is a structured hierarchy, and that energy and influence must travel from the larger worlds into the smaller, and then again be brought up from the smaller back up to the larger, well then the progress of science would go much faster. Instead of being surprised that our atmosphere has layers, we would begin the research expecting such an arrangement. And we'd look for the role of electricity in maintaining these layers. A colleague of mine sent me this link about the ACES II mission. Let's spend a little time looking at the mission. Here are some images of the flow of electric current around the solid, rocky Earth. The electric and magnetic body of the Earth is quite complex. It is important to change your thinking about what is the body of the Earth. Because we all have received no training in how to use our five senses, we generally believe that the body of the Earth is only the rock below our feet. But this is only a part of the body of the Earth. Maybe we could call the rocky part the bones of the Earth. Around this solid core is a body just as complex and multi-layered as the rest of your body that surrounds your bones. Plasma has an amazing ability to segregate to form walls, membranes, and tubes. The flow of electricity through this larger body of the Earth is just as segregated as the flow of blood in your veins. The plasma flows only where it is supposed to. And just like your arteries and veins, the plasma membranes are semi-permeable. The right things get in, the right things get out. And still, the whole system is highly pressurized and self-contained. Long before the mammalian circulatory system came to be, the Earth had solved all the problems of a self-contained circulatory system with semi-permeable membranes. Only it did so in the realm of plasma, electricity and magnetism. Getting back to the ACES II Mission, look at this image. The orange lines coming into and flowing away from the Earth are electric currents. The flows have an interesting double in-and-out structure. Energy comes from far away, and then it goes back into the magnetosphere, and then it returns, and then it is sent back into the solar system. Most of this activity is along the sunrise and sunset lines. if you pull back from the Earth, you will see that there is only one sunrise and sunset because the shadow of the Earth remains fixed, while it is the surface of the Earth that spins underneath that shadow. Along this shadow line electric currents flow both into and out of the Earth. We don't know what happens to this current close to the Earth's surface, and this is the focus of the ACES II Mission: fly two [sounding rockets] through this lower region and collect data. While the mission is very exciting, it is half  a mission. It is half  a mission because it is not starting with the question of what is the function of the aurora? The aurora must transfer its energy to the body of the Earth and must also translate the digested energy back up into the solar current. The circuit does not just come down willy-nilly, make a right turn, and head back out to the magnetosphere. End of story. The current is coming down to interact with the Earth and all that lives on the surface of the Earth. This is like breathing; this is like digestion. The Earth is receiving solar energy and the Earth gives something back. This is physics, this is engineering. It is also permeated with beauty. Quite literally, solar energies enter into the Earth at sunrise. We all, animals and the plants and the lichen, all use this energy as we live a day on this Earth. And when we lie down to sleep, something is taken back up into the solar wind current. The ACES II Mission needs to be paired with measurements of the electric currents and magnetic fields in the surface of the Earth. The aurora and surface of the Earth might be connected directly, like a flashlight current flowing through a filament. The solar current could flow directly into the body of the Earth, or the aurora might make a connection through induction, like an AC Transformer where vibrations in the input current are communicated to the receiving coil, but no electric charges flow from one to the other. My bet is that both induction and transfer of matter are happening. This is the sort of question that needs to guide missions of this kind. I've been looking for updates on the mission since its successful November 21st launch, but cannot find anything yet. Millennia ago, the word ‘cosmos’ was used to designate a living whole. All ‘cosmoses’ are built on the same blueprint, the only difference being the size and how physical laws manifest at that scale. You and I are each an example: citizen cosmoses that live in the larger cosmos of the Earth. Planets are an example: citizen cosmoses that live their life in the larger world of stars. Star is an example: a citizen cosmos of the larger beings we call galaxies. Going the other direction, every plant and animal on Earth is composed of cells which are built on this same blueprint. A cosmos is born and dies, eats and eliminates. A cosmos has power to heal after injury or sickness. Coming back to the very start of this lecture, a nebula in our galaxy is not a cosmos. At least I don't think so. The nebula is an integral part of a larger being or of an organ within our galaxy. Yes, galaxies have organs that perform specific functions. Like this beauty. What's the standard explanation of this? Oh, just another random explosion crashing into pointless surrounding gases. What's a better explanation? This highly structured object is doing something. Nature always links structure and function. So, let's try to understand what it is doing. The Electric Universe paradigm somehow brings all of this into better focus. Electricity and light as the finest matters we know, permeate all levels of the universe. Electricity and light can organize, and manifest, at all levels large and small. And can travel between the large and the small. By comparison, I would say for example that gravity plays a very small role in the world of cells. If you believe that nothing in the universe is alive, that is a belief, not science. You have done precisely zero experiments to test your belief. If you believe that stars are not conceived and born, that is based upon precisely zero experimental evidence. If you believe that love and yearning are not powerful forces for stars and galaxies and cells, okay, that is a belief. If you call yourself a scientist, it is time to grow up and admit that these are beliefs based upon, you know not what. Perhaps you no longer trust your feelings and trust only your instruments, made of metal and glass. An instrument made of metal and glass is not alive, and hence can only measure other things that are not alive. A living being can only be sensed by another living being. One of us looks out and sees a dead universe, the other sees a living universe. Those who study the dead are always surprised by the new findings, while those who study the living often have an inkling of what we would find. [Music] 
From Cosmic Currents to the Electric Sun No pressure! What I want to do, and I'd like to thank Michael Clarage for his introductory talk. I thought that was brilliant. What I wanted to do here is to talk about the problem of trying to figure out how we connect an electric Sun to cosmic currents. And just to talk initially about the Electric Universe itself, I came across this quote from Science on the 16th of November. "The most important characteristic of a paradigm is its fruitfulness." And I think Michael has pointed out the fruitfulness of the Electric Universe paradigm. There's a couple of things I just like to read from that article, which I think are very appropriate. It says, in the midst of a revolution, what counts as good evidence and reason in a discipline, are themselves open to dispute. Important terms or concepts change their meaning or even cease to be meaningful in the new paradigm. Modern science isn't fruitful, it's dogmatic. It generates no new insights and it produces no new outcomes, no new ways of generating evidence. Science in Kuhn's image, must be productive or its paradigm must change. And that is the thing that's been driving me ever since I began this journey. So the question is what makes the Sun shine? And this has been thrown into sharp relief. Just recently with this article published in Science, I think it was. And a couple of quotes there: "Convective velocities", that is the convection region of the Sun, just beneath the photosphere, "are 20 to 100 times weaker than current theoretical estimates..." That essentially means that the theory of how the Sun works is incorrect because somehow or another, the Sun is supposed to get the intense radiation from the center, from the core out to the surface to give us the heat and light that we observe. And what we've found now is that one of the key links in that transfer of energy is missing. Of course, this prompts the question: What actually does transport the heat flux of the solar luminosity outwards? But a better question is: "does Sun shine come from within the Sun?" And the Electric Universe has said from the beginning that it doesn't. And this I think, is some confirmatory evidence. If we look at star birth, as I said yesterday, star birth is a gravitational accident in the Big Bang cosmology. But this is a quote from over 30 years ago, from Hannes Alfvén, "There is a general belief that stars are forming by gravitational collapse; in spite of vigorous efforts no one has yet found any observational indication of confirmation. Thus the 'generally accepted' theory of stellar formation may be one of a hundred unsupported dogmas which constitute a large part of present-day astrophysics." Now, the reason for introducing this is that if we're going to look at how a star connects to the galaxy, one of the bits of evidence we can look at is star birth. What actually goes on? And this is what the infrared telescopes have been telling us that stars are formed along cosmic current filaments Of course, the reports don't talk about electric current, they just talk about the filaments. This is a network of 27 star-forming filaments derived from the Herschel observatory. They're numbered there because in the original report they were very interested in the fact that the filaments are huge, stretching for tens of light-years, and regardless of their length or density, the filament, the width is always the same. And what is that reminiscent of? A lightning bolt! The lightning bolt stretches from the clouds to the ground and its width remains roughly the same over that entire distance. So what we're looking at in effect is a form of cloud to cloud lightning. What's more, the stars within these filaments flicker! Now, the gravitational model doesn't allow for that because for it to flicker requires material to be added to the star repeatedly and very quickly. So astronomers were surprised to see the brightness of young objects varying by more than 20% over just these few weeks, since the accretion process should take years or even centuries... But of course, we all know how electric lights can flicker. Lightning itself can flicker. The quote of course is: "Yet again, Herschel observations surprise us." This is a very recent image which shows a bipolar nebula. It's described as a newborn star which is rather odd because most of the bipolar, in fact all of the bipolar nebulae that I've seen so far, have referred to them as dying stars ejecting material. But here we have one that's supposed to be being born. So there seems to be some confusion here. Also it says there are hundreds of low-mass brown dwarfs in that cloud and this provides us with some ideas about how stars are born, where they're born and also the chances of capture a brown dwarf by bright stars which impinges of course on the Saturn story. The red dust at the center is thought to produce the hourglass shape. This is the mantra that's used in all of these bipolar nebulas that it has to have a disk of matter right at the center of that hourglass which somehow causes the material ejected from the star to take these particular shapes, the hourglass shape. This is another visible stellar circuit. This of course is supposed to be a dying star. It's an hourglass shape and it has an odd-looking focus there. It's 8,000 light-years distant. Remember that example I gave yesterday where if the Earth's orbit was two inches across and the Sun was a speck of dust, that you could measure the distances of stars by miles. So that'll be 8,000 miles away, there's a speck of dust which has this particular interesting shape. Here it says, the hourglass shape is produced by the expansion of a fast stellar wind within a slowly expanding cloud which is denser near its equator than at its poles. Now these are all very special conditions. How and why are these conditions established? There was no real explanation of these objects. And the formation of the shape of the inner "eye" is not yet fully understood. It's interesting they call it an eye because that was a very powerful reference in mythology to some of the things that were witnessed in the electrical events in prehistory. This is another visible stellar circuit. This one is 2,100 miles away as a speck of dust, if you would like to look at it in that way to give you some perspective. This particular nebula represents the spectacular 'last gasp' of a binary star system at the nebula center. You notice they're 'dying stars'. In the Electric Universe, the age or the life and death of the star is not measured at all in this way. Astronomers theorize that the gravity of one star pulls some of the gas from the surface of the other and flings it into a thin, dense disc extending into space. This magic that gravity is asked to perform, can in no way explain all of the detailed parts of this nebula. You'll notice that it's coaxial too. There's an outer cone and then there's an inner one and then there's these strange bright objects here, here and here. None of these are explained by this particular model. And yet we have a quote like this, "Such a disk and successfully account for the jet-exhaust-like appearance of M2-9." I don't think so. Here's another visible stellar circuit and this one is really stunning. In fact, Peter Tuthill from Sydney University said, "The thing that really takes your breath away is the astonishing degree of symmetry within the intricate linear form." Now, I'm not sure whether you can see it all that well with the light on the screen but you can see these descriptions here, the rungs here, there's rungs and there's thin filaments radiating from this central point. What I've done here is put my little addition. I'm calling these Birkeland current filaments and I'm calling these rungs here across those filaments, double layers. Because double layers are regions in plasma where particles are accelerated and you tend to get a glow as a result. And you can have multiple double layers when the plasma is changing in density as you move towards the star. So you see here's one that's quite bright, that rung there. "A series of rungs and conical surfaces lie nested, one within the next, down to the heart of the system, where the hyperbolic bicone surfaces are crossed by a dark lane running across the principal axis." And of course, this is usually referred to as your disk of dust and so on, which produces this shape. But this is so intricate and beautiful that it cannot be formed by an explosion of gas and dust and that kind of thing. But, it does have all the characteristics of an electrical pinch discharge. "It is fascinating to take a second look at one of the most famous astronomical images of them all: SN1987A." Now, this particular supernova is important in my life because I had a peer-reviewed paper published on an electrical explanation of SN1987A in the IEEE Plasma Sciences journal. With the help of Tony Peratt who also had several other papers published, including one on the formation of Martian blueberries and so on in an electrical discharge in that same issue. So for me, that was a milestone. To get peer-reviewed papers published on the Electric Universe is extremely difficult as you might imagine. This object is the 'Red Square' as it's called. It's 34 times closer than the supernovae so you can see far more detail. It was described as "...the best astrophysical laboratory yet [discovered] for studying the physics of generating the mysterious sharp polar- ring systems like that around SN1987A." "...a system as complex and fascinating as this is bound to keep us guessing for years to come." Well as soon as I saw this, I published my explanation. And since then I've heard nothing from the experts but it's sitting there, waiting for their discovery. This is the supernova I referred to and here I'm only showing the central ring. The important thing about this diagram is that it gives you some impression of the complexity of what goes on in these plasma discharges. For instance, this is the neck. If you consider, right at the very apex of those hyperbolic curves sits this pinch. And this is from Tony Peratt, this particular diagram. And as it pinches down, it forms these particle beam columns right in the center of this, sort of purplish spot, there is a central column but then it's surrounded by a ring of filaments and they take on characteristic numbers. Now around Supernova 1987A, this is where the actual object, where the object was that exploded, you have this ring of bright spots. There are three coaxial rings. There was one up here and this is symmetrical, so down here you've got the same kind of feature, and there was a third ring down here. But they're all coaxial, which is significant because it, more or less, says that this is what was going on. It was sitting at the centre of a plasma z-pinch discharge. I predicted at the time that these bright spots would not behave as if there was a shock-wave racing out from the star. I also said that they should appear to rotate and that they will flicker in brightness. So far I haven't seen, I haven't followed up to check just to see but all of these predictions are sitting there, waiting to be confirmed. What happened next was that we found around the Sun, in the Sun's interstellar interface, the IBEX mission discovered that there are energetic neutral atoms, called ENA's, which were arriving in the Solar System and they took on this ring shape. What's more, they had bright spots, these yellow and red spots. So we have around the Sun, in plasma dark mode, because they're not visibly bright, this same ring and it's also set perpendicular to the local magnetic field. So all of these things fit the electrical model. But it raises the question then, how does this connect to the Sun, how does it power it? This is what I wrote back in 2005: "The solar plasma and that of interstellar space are two different plasmas which must therefore have a "double layer" or Langmuir plasma sheath between them. So to treat the heliospheric boundary simply as a magnetohydrodynamic..." it's a hell of a word "...shock problem..." it just means a magnetized fluid, and like something plowing through water or an aircraft plowing through the air "...is naive." it's not what we will find. And of course, since that date the evidence has been piling up in favor of the fact that it is not a hydrodynamic shock. In fact it was said that there is no shock, just recently. Also, this is just describing in terms of my diagram, that I used back then, what's going on. This is the Sun, this is your speck of dust, around it is the heliosphere which, remember I said, if the Sun is a speck of dust this is 20 feet wide. The solar wind comes out and it goes, it continues on, it continues on out to these Birkeland current filaments. This is the looking at a cross-section through that cylinder. That supernova cylinder if you like. So here's one of these particle beams coming down here. It meets the solar wind, it neutralizes some of the ions coming from the Sun and those that are happened to be moving in a way towards the heliosphere will come back in and be registered by the IBEX mission. So this is what the IBEX mission found, is these things here. And even more recently, as I said, the Sun's Z-pinch is aligned with the local galactic magnetic field which is what the IBEX mission found. The ENA's come from solar wind ions meeting the Z-pinch current cylinder and then returning back into the Solar System. And also up here we have the possibility of double layers in this central column and evidence for these particle- accelerating double layers is arriving. Remember in the 'Red Square' image, I showed you those rungs. It's this kind of thing that forms the rung. So that if there are some out here, you would also see this rung across this pinch. And just very recently, December the 4th 2012, the Voyager 1 crossed a boundary. Now the expectation was that when Voyager 1 crossed this boundary, these magnetic field lines would, all those particles and so on, would be blown aside by this headwind if you like, and travel around the heliosphere like that. Instead of that, what they found is that the particles suddenly, they keep going, the magnetic field keeps going out this way. Which is what I said on the other diagram, they continue on. What's more, the particles seem to be accelerated here. There are no slow solar wind particles beyond this spot and that is also expected on that electrical model. The quote here is of course "...the new region isn't what we expected, but we've come to expect the unexpected from Voyager." Here is an active stellar circuit and Michael Clarage also showed you this object, this is the Crab Nebula. This object, which shows you the complex activity around this star. It's supposed to be a neutron star with a period of 33 milliseconds, which means it's spinning extremely fast. But you'll notice some of the things that are going on here, which I'll show you in more detail in a moment. These are called wisps and these are hotspots and this is the central object. But this thing here is of interest. Because just recently, it's been found to be the source of intense gamma rays. They are only discovered because, by accident, because they only occur for a day or so and you have to be looking at the object just at the right time to pick it up. Now before I show you that close up, I'm going to talk about the plasma focus. The plasma focus is a very simple device but it also is capable of producing the most concentrated form of electromagnetic energy and also the most concentrated source of neutrons and high-energy particles. In a beam, you'll notice, in a jet! All you've got is two different conductors, an outer electrode, an inner electrode. And if you discharge this capacitor bank which stores electrical energy, across this switch between these two electrodes, what happens is that a discharge moves down the barrel, comes out here, balloons around, comes back in here and forms a particular kind of plasma instability which is called a plasmoid. And that is the most concentrated form of electromagnetic energy. The plasmoid then breaks down and fires a beam of particles out this way and back that way. Then, this direction is not shown because the plasma gun, this is always closed off. But in space, you'll get two jets in different directions. This one is negatively charged, this one's positively charged. So you get this beam of X-rays and particles. And of course, if the energy is sufficient you will get gamma rays. Now I'll run this little animation. So, you'll notice there that one of the forms of plasma instability is the corkscrew shape or a whirlwind or a tornado. Because we'll come to that again in a moment. So we've come back to the heart of the Crab Nebula. From this object in this anvil feature, powerful gamma rays were coming. Now this is some distance from this pulsar, which is here, but this, in the Electric Universe terms, is part of the circuit to the star, along this axis. You'll notice, it has a shape which might appeal to the plasma mythologists amongst us. It has kind of upraised arms and then this strange shape. Now amongst the petroglyphs you'll find that; I'll just get the rest of this up here... The shape of the anvil feature is typical of a plasma instability or plasma focus effect, but it can take on shapes with, like a, duck's head. Now there are many petroglyphs around the world, which have this strange-headed creature with the arms upraised. It's a plasma instability! And the other thing is that that is where that plasmoid exists, right there. So the burst of gamma rays is completely explained in terms of a plasma gun effect focused on this half of this pulsar, (they) want us to call it a pulsar, it's actually a normal body, there's no such thing as a neutron star. But this circuit is driving this star to such an extent that the entire surroundings is lit up and is in motion, rapid motion. As I said, it's reminiscent of the prehistoric petroglyph figures with a 'duck's head' atop upraised 'arms'. Now this is another visible stellar circuit and you see here the hyperbolic cones. The star is in here. And here's its counterpart, the other half of the bipolar shape. This one is, if you like, 450 miles away from the Sun, in terms of that model I talked about last night. Now, all of these circuits have to somehow tie up with the Sun circuit. And this is the Sun circuit. This was actually drawn, many years ago, by Hannes Alfvén. Only he considered the Sun, at the center here, as the driver. We're suggesting that no, the Sun is actually being driven by this circuit here. So the puzzle now is to figure out what is the connection between this powerful circuit and the Sun, which is sitting in this tiny little heliosphere in the centre of it all. And we have to couple it to this circuit. Now, I've taken on this project in collaboration with Don Scott who made many... many of you have probably read his book The Electric Sky. Now I think, this is one of the most interesting and puzzling things that I've had to work on for many years and we hope to be able to present at the next conference, our version of what this circuit looks like. Because if we can do this, we can look at the questions of what causes the solar cycle, the 11-year solar cycle. We can look at the possibility of using radio telescopes on that, which can trace these circuits to deduce and forecast what may happen over the longer term. All of these things I think, would be of benefit and only available from the Electric Universe model. It's interesting. In all of the work I've done, one of the most fruitful things to do is to go back in time and look at the Pioneers. And also look at the arguments that went on when certain things were accepted, like Einstein's theories. And if you read the articles before Einstein was accepted, there were some brilliant papers describing the flaws in Einstein's work. But there comes a point, a tipping point I suppose, when Einstein was accepted and all of these arguments are lost. Students never see them and I think this is a great failing of education. This chap here, amazingly, Sir William Huggins said in 1885, "The grandest displays of terrestrial electrical disturbances must be altogether insignificant in comparison with the electrical changes which must accompany the ceaseless and fearful activity of the photosphere... Surely it is not too much to say that our terrestrial experience of lightning and of aurorae fails to supply us with any adequate basis for a true conception of the electric force in action on the Sun." So the idea that the Sun was an electrical body was a possibility in the 19th century but we lost it in the 20th, unfortunately. Recently there was a discovery, a paper published about tornados existing in the chromosphere, between the corona up here, and the photosphere, down here on the Sun. Now remember, I talked about the plasma instability which creates the corkscrew motion or the tornadic motion. This is an example of an electrical connection between the Sun at the photosphere, and the corona. In other words, this is one of the circuit elements. It's estimated, there are more than 10,000 of them continuously present in the quiet Sun. Surface and coronal vortices are connected. They talk about coronal vortices here so I will come on to the subject of sunspots. And what of these granulations on the Sun. Once again, if we go back in time and look at Kristian Birkeland at the turn of the century, of the end of the 19th century, he said "...it might be imagined that the interior of the Sun formed the positive pole for enormous electric currents." This fellow never ceases to amaze me when I read his works. "...[this] assumption has the advantages of appearing to give a natural explanation for the movement of the sunspots in various latitudes." In other words, the solar sunspot cycle. "In this case, the origin of the sunspot must be that the presumptive, more or less insulating photospheric envelope was sometimes pierced by disruptive discharges, thus forming great electric arcs." Now it was discovered in the Space Age of course, that the Sun is surrounded by a plasma ring, a plasma doughnut. That's seen from the pole looking down on it, this is looking at the equatorial region. So the plasma doughnut is an energy storage ring which can, when it becomes unstable, discharge to the Sun. And that, I suggest, is the origin of sunspots. And this is looking down into a sunspot. This is penumbra, this is the outer region of the sunspot, look like turbulent boiling hot jets or hot gas. And of course, this comes back to that paper I showed you right at the beginning, which says, there is no or virtually no detectable convection occurring on the Sun. Why is the sunspot dark if the Sun is hotter beneath? The simplest answer is that the Sun is thousands of degrees cooler below! Penumbral filaments are glowing plasma tornadoes. So this is the counterpart of the tornado in the chronosphere. This is going deeper into the Sun. This is a bit like on Earth where you see at the top of the diffuse elves, which can be 80 km or more wide, then you come down to the jets and the blue jets and so on and sprites which are much thinner, and then you come down to lightning which is thinner still. This is the same kind of effect. They have bright edges, dark cores and a rotary motion. Inset there is a fuel fire with a helicopter engine above to create the vortex and you can see how it has bright edges and a dark core. And up here you can see these filaments on the Sun, bright edges and a dark core. And bright 'lightning' flecks their tightly packed 'granular' tops and the descending bases. It's like a descending tornado. The funnel of a tornado. In the actual sunspot itself, in the darkest part, we see the tops of even thinner filaments. And the tops of those are actually hotter than the surface of the Sun. This is a diagram, I won't go into it here. It can be read both in Don Scott's book and on my website and his website. It shows how the Sun regulates the current flowing through the photosphere to give us steady heat and light. This is one of those amazing things where nature seems to have worked out the simple way of doing things. The same as we have with transistors to control electric current. The spicules, these jets between the granules on the Sun of course, are unexplained in the standard model but they're necessary in the electrical model to provide the charge carriers for the double layers (in) above the Sun. This is the electric Sun. This can be seen in the online book of the Sun Electric. And in that model the Sun has a core here, a very extensive atmosphere and then all of the photosphere out here is like a global lightning storm or electric tornado storm. If you like to look it that way. And the energy flow is inwards and not outwards. The corona is a familiar glow discharge phenomenon recognized by high-voltage engineers. So, like the lights of a great city at night, stars are lit at great distances from where their power is being generated. Each star is the focus of an electromagnetic 'pinch' in the galactic current stream. The details of which have to be worked out. And I suggest, the Sun sets on 20th century science.

You've just entered the theater of an alien sky. iIf the words and images seem strange to you, there's a reason for this. Our world was once a vastly different place. To experience this won't hurt you, and there is nothing to fear. The Myth of the World Mountain Any systematic investigation of ancient myths and symbols will lead inescapably to the mysteries of the world mountain, the cosmic mountain, the mountain of the gods, remembered by every culture on earth and memorialized through thousands of sacred mountains, pillars, and symbolic poles and posts, all appearing as symbols of an alien sky. Our early ancestors revered the towering column as the visual axle of the cosmos, reaching upward from Earth's horizon to the center of heaven around which this starry dome visually turn. No ancient culture was free from the memory of the world mountain: the Golden Mountain, Silver Mountain, White Mountain, the mountain of fire and light. called also the world's highest mountain. Here the gods themselves gathered upon the summit, giving the great column its name as the Mount of Congregation. Nations the world over identified this divine habitation with the "first time," the "best time," the "ideal time," meaning of course the lost paradise, the mythic homeland of the gods before they departed for more distant realms. In fact, every ancient nation on earth assimilated at its own history to that of the world mountain. The point was stated emphatically by Mircea Eliade "The world mountain always signified the 'point where creation had its beginning' ". And so the early cultures declared with one voice, "We came from that place. the cosmic center, the place of the divine ancestors." And accordingly, all ancient rites of sacred construction, of kingship and royal marriage, of sacrifice and holy war always direct our attention back to the same location, the place par excellence. In every culture whatever the imaginative form, the mount connected heaven and Earth as a pillar or ladder or spiralling stairway from the world below to the divine habitation above. And it was much more than that as we shall see. In ancient Egyptian myths, this was where the primeval sun god, the wandering Atum or Ra, found his stable resting place. This stationary spot in the sky was the apex of a mountain of fire and light, wind and water, the pillar in support of the sky. The Egyptians called it Akhet, the "Mountain of Fire and Light." Of the creator Atum the Coffin Texts say: "The Great God lives Fixed in the middle of the sky Upon his support" Throughout all of ancient Egypt priests identified every holy site as the summit of the cosmic mountain or pillar. The priests of Karnak symbolically located their temple on "The Venerable Hill of Primeval Beginning." The priests of the Edfu Temple recalled "...the First Occasion in the High Hill at the Beginning of Coming Into Existence." In the language of the ancient cultures, such phrasing meant the first appearance of the cosmic city or temple or kingdom, the model for sacred construction on Earth. This remarkable idea was already in place at the birth of Egyptian civilization. The oldest texts in Egypt, the Pyramid Texts, speak of the primeval hill of the land in the midst of the sea, the cosmic waters whose hand no earthlings have grasped. Through images and texts, the Egyptians personified the heaven-reaching pillar as the god Shu, remembered as both a cosmic column and the support at the divine habitation. And it was more, the Egyptians also described Shu as a luminous etheric column of wind water and fire rising from below to vivify the dwelling of the Gods. In ancient Mesopotamia, the priestly traditions described the god Enlil as the pillar of the sky, naming the god as the Great Mountain, stretching between heaven and Earth. Exactly in the fashion of the Egyptian Shu, Enlil signified a visible etheric "wind" joining the two worlds. This is not something disputed. Though, of course, a column of "air" or "wind" functioning as a pillar will always appear as a conceptual absurdity but only until we meet the archetype in its own terms. The cosmic mountain and its diverse mythic content always suggests a progressively evolving dwelling of the gods resting upon the cosmic column. With the passing of the myth-making epoch, the absence of this original referent in the sky changed everything. It guaranteed a rapid loss of the original idea, leaving only the local symbols to reflect the first form, the prototype. So when searching for the lost paradise, we have only a mountain that is no longer there to guide us, all complicated by a thousand local hills named after or pretending to be the cosmic original. It didn't take long before the world mountain was everywhere and nowhere. The theme needs to be followed back to its origins. Where was the revered Hindu Mount Meru around which the stars revolved? Or the Persian Haraberezaiti identified as the tallest mountain and world axis? Or the Japanese world mountain Shumi or Sumeru, called the center around which the heavenly bodies revolved? Or the Chinese holy mountain Kwenlun, the axis of the celestial revolutions? Or the Mexican Colhuacan, whose summit the priestly astronomers identified as the celestial pole? What assures us of an original global tradition is the consistent role of the cosmic mountain as both world axis and stable support of the sky. The cosmic center and the apex of the world mountain meant exactly the same thing, to which we must add the identification with the exemplary site of creation itself, the birthplace of the primeval paradise. Traced to its origins, all of the imagery is cosmic. The events occurred in the sky and were always filtered through myth-making imagination. They did not occur down here where we live. The greatest mistake we could make it to ask the local geography to explain the original idea. No terrestrial hill gave Olympus its name Aegus, meaning the "axle" nor did the Hebrews name Zion as the site of creation by some accident of geography. Upon the summit of Zion, the creator fashioned the city of heaven, the temple of heaven, or the kingdom of heaven. The original referent was the cosmic center and summit where creation began. The themes are global, and they belong to the core of world myths and symbols. This memory held humanity in its grip for thousands of years. And nothing could add greater confusion than attempts to explain the symbolism of a sacred mountain by attributes of local geography. The archetype always precedes the local symbol. All that a regional hill could ever provide was a symbolic pointer back to the original cosmic mountain of the gods. In fact, the symbolic echoes were far too numerous to be blended into one story by later chroniclers. Long ago the best students of comparative symbolism recognized the linkage of the Hebrew mount Zion to a similar memoriy shared with their Canaanite neighbors of Mount Zaphon in the farthest reaches of the north. Of course, in modern times the ideas can only appear ludicrous. But it's the cross cultural integrity that substantiates a global experience beneath the chaos of local myths and symbols. The axial supportive and heaven reaching role of the world mountain was its defining character, always attached to the land of the gods themselves. But always keep in mind that human imagination in the presence of this celestial column would see much more than just a mountain. The archetypal form naturally inspired multiple myths and interpretations. By symbolic extension, thousands of local prominences and man-made artifacts received their mythic content from the human memory of the cosmic mountain. In the shadow of a grand mythic tradition, monumental construction was always commemorative. That's the core meaning of the word "monument," a word receiving its original significance from the collective nostalgia for things formerly seen in the sky but no longer present. By their devotion to sacred construction, humans on Earth strove to maintain a symbolic connection to the gods, always painfully aware that the original connection was broken by heaven-altering catastrophe. Nothing weighed more heavily and powerfully on human minds than the nostalgia for Paradise, always mixed with a collective anxiety, the fear of doomsday, the great catastrophe which brought the paradisal epoch to its violent conclusion. Every collective memory of the cosmic mountain directs us back to the time before the sky fell, before the gods departed for remote realms, before, in the most reliable astronomical traditions, the great gods departed to become the now distant planets. This memory held humanity in its grip for thousands of years. And nothing could add greater confusion than attempts to explain the symbolism of sacred mountains and pillars by attributes of local geography. The archetype always precedes the local symbol. All that a regional Hill could ever provide was a symbolic pointer back to the original cosmic mountain of the gods. In fact, the symbolic echoes were far too numerous to be blended into one story by later chroniclers. Of course, the disparities in local traditions would spawn regional competition and a growing confusion between the archetype and the local symbol reflecting it. Many scholars have already noted that Zion and Zaphon merged as pointers back to a single archetype, and that fact should always take precedence in comparative investigation. We know that the Greeks identified several local hills as Olympus just as the Hindus named more than one mountain and innumerable man-made replicas after their cosmic mountain Meru. The Greek sacred mountain Ida in present-day Turkey had its counterpart in a Cretan mount of the same name. And that's just one illustration of a vast pattern of symbolic replication. But today, as is the case with all archetypal forms, both the land of the gods and the towering column of fire and light upon which it stood are nowhere to be seen. That's the heart to the dilemma we intend to resolve by taking up the diverse but intricately connected features of the cosmic mountain, all ranging far beyond the mythic idea of the regional hill. 
welcome to space news from the electric universe brought to you by the thunderbolts project at Thunderbolts dot info scientists with the European Space Agency's Rosetta mission are writing a new chapter in the history of comet science however institutional Sciences understanding of comets is less certain today than ever before recently the Rosetta team published their first scientific papers following their successful landing on the comet 67p yet the scientific summaries have raised far more questions than answers while news media around the world have lauded the missions remarkable human achievement it must be noted that the feat was at best a partial success the primary purpose of the mission was to penetrate the comet's nucleus and gather a large sample of material however on landing the probe encountered a terrain nothing like the icy snowy surface it had been designed to withstand after bouncing into the shade of one of the Comets rocky cliffs the team ultimately resorted to using a mechanical hammer to attempt to acquire a sample for testing according to the ESA team the hammer was quote unable to make more than a few millimeters of progress even at the highest power level of the hammer motor in the e essays words the hammer was bested by quote mechanically strong ice but what ice is a ESA referring to to the astonishment of mainstream scientists he complexly layered pitted boulders strewn desiccated terrain of 67p has not revealed the abundant water ice that the standard model requires indeed according to a recent nature report scientists found that 67 piece dust grains shattered on a target plate revealing they contained no water ice in the wake of this and other surprising revelations it is useful to look back at the past predictions of the standard comet theory consider the image on your screen on your left is an illustration prior to the 1986 mission to the comet Halle in the center is a ESA teams rendition of the commentary terrain they expected to encounter at 67p on the right is an actual image of 67 piece nucleus yet today the assumptions behind the drawing on the left remain unchanged in any meaningful way institutional science still insists that comets are primordial aggregates of ices and dust the leftovers of the early solar system with the cooperation of science media it would appear that the theory is unfalsifiable however unbeknownst to most in the general public an alternative theory of comets does exist for decades the electric universe theory as developed by physicist wal Thornhill has made the seemingly outrageous claim that comets asteroids and meteors were electrically machined from planets in relatively recent epic of planetary instability doom like ripples fields of boulders in rubble craters pits cliffs rocky spires a complexly layered terrain and the absence of water ice are all consistent with the electric universe theory of comets and comet origins here is wal thornhill with our first report on the initial papers from the Rosetta team the first papers on comet churyumov-gerasimenko or comet 67p were published by the rosetta team last week once again expectations of a boring lump of ice and dust were not met instead there were ever more surprises a natural result of an incorrect theory of comets in science magazine under the headline comet close-up reveals a world of surprises diverse landscape of 67p suggests an unexpectedly complicated origin we find the usual mantra many of the intriguing landforms the main science camera Osiris has found testify to the power of the Sun which heats up 67p during part of every orbit igniting Jets of gas dust that resculpt the surface of the comet other discoveries could be primordial dating from the comet's formation more than four-and-a-half billion years ago however Nicholas Thomas and Osiris co-investigator and an experimental physicist at the University of Bern confesses the Sun alone can't have created all the layers topography and chemical diversity that scientists see I find it hard to believe at the present time that 67p was originally homogeneous you've got to produce all of these diverse morphologies on the surface with that one energy source I find this tough of course it's tough because years or decades of work that was based on generally accepted false assumptions must be abandoned the lead article in the special section of science magazine reporting on the Rosetta mission opens with comets are the best sample of primitive solar nebula material presently available to us dating back 4.5 7 billion years to the origin of our planetary system this bold statement is not fact but fiction no one was there as witness or timekeeper it hasn't been shown that nebulae around some of the stars our planet forming accretion discs it's going too far to argue the complexity of the Comets suggest that the comet forming regions of the early solar system were more turbulent and chemically diverse than theorists have thought pushing the anomalies so far into the past that anything is possible doesn't advance science and some of the features like layering the dune like ripples and boulders with wind tails show the gaping hole in the accretion story of comets these are planetary processes now that the comet 67p and most comets show little sign of the ice is required to fuel jets of gas to sculpt their surfaces why cling to the story about comets being primordial when all the evidence is plainly against such an idea scientists need to be conscious that we are a tribal species and as such we utterly disdain things that challenge our worldview and after centuries of repetition the story of the birth of the solar system has fixated our worldview to the extent that covers of stars forming along growing filaments in a decidedly non-gravitational manner and thousands of planetary systems that don't conform to our worldview have had no effect on that story cosmology is a belief system sustained by confirmatory bias no alternative to the old primordial gravitational accretion model of the solar system is believed possible meanwhile comet 67p is reported to show rocky seeming terrain which refers to the low density of the comet far less than rocks on earth perhaps the comet is a polystyrene model rocky seeming is an expression that denies the evidence of our eyes and exposes our fundamental ignorance of mass and gravity no more serious accusation can be leveled at theoretical physicists modern science has no solid foundation for our worldview our gravitational cosmology I predict that will be comet 67p s greatest lesson if we have the wisdom and courage to discard our tribal myths let me be clear mass is a property of matter the mass of the comet is not equivalent to the amount of matter in the comet mass is a measure of electromagnetic energy stored in matter according to the best known equation in physics the equals MC squared so comet 67p can be composed of rocky minerals while exhibiting low mass and a density like cork or wood low mass implies that the rocky comet is under low electrical and gravitational stress gravitational stress electrically distorts the atoms within a body by pulling the heavy nucleus towards the center of mass as a small body far from any planet and having electrons stripped from its surface in the solar discharge Comet 67p is under very low internal stress which is reflected in its low mass it doesn't demand it be a fluffy object with the porosity of 70 to 80 percent and if there's any argument about the Jets issuing from Comet 67p being electrical it's only necessary to look at the way nearby elementary jets are alive and draw together this is natural for coronal discharge as issuing vertically from a surface and the subsequent attractive force between parallel currents according to amperes law the effect is seen clearly in images of the Sun's corona it is not a natural formation

[Music] I arrived in Brooklyn for the Global Breakthrough Energy Movement conference. Opening my suitcase in my room at the hotel, I discover I’ve forgotten something absolutely crucial to the presentation I have to give with Monty the next day. [Music] Amsterdam is only half an hour away by train; so I decide on a run into the city - see if I can replace the crucial item. This is the handmade outfit I got in England... and I brought this, nice shirt and jacket in the room and found out I'd forgotten my pants. So there was unanimous agreement that I should just give the talk in boxer shorts and that the cameraman would be honest and just film me from the waist up. But I kind of wanted an excuse to go shopping in Amsterdam, and that’s what we are doing: shopping in Amsterdam. [Music] [Music] Now that the SAFIRE project is moving forward, to create something useful from all we have discovered. Everybody is asking us to explain what is happening scientifically. What's the mechanism for energy release and for the transmutation of elements. We can tell them what we are doing, the engineering and chemistry involved, but we can't tell them how nature is doing it. We don't know how - not yet - and we may never know how, let alone why. But think about this. I fly from Boston to Amsterdam, in a jet that is controlled by electrically powered computer systems. I ride an electric train into the city. Four thousand times a minute, an electric spark makes an explosion to run the engine of a vehicle passing me on the street. Stop-and-go lights keep me aware, so I don't get squashed by a girl on a bike. I take pictures with my electric cellphone, immortalizing my search for pants in Amsterdam. Ships navigate the world's oceans using computerized navigation systems. I navigate the streets of Amsterdam using the maps in my cellphone, which is a computer. Computers wouldn't exist but for electricity. I visit thrift stores lit by electric lights, so I can see if my pants are there. If I could find some pants, I would pay for them with my credit card. Credit cards wouldn't exist but for electricity. ”Nothing there... I don't know, what should we do?” ”You know what? We may have to wear jeans, we may have to wear jeans... but as the nice lady said, You’re in Holland. What's wrong with jeans? Everybody wears jeans. OK, lead on.” Breweries use electricity to make beer. Refreshed with a pint of Dutch beer, I take more pictures for posterity. There is no film - it's all digital, meaning: electric. Those church bells ringing? You can bet there’s a timer and an electric motor involved. I walk the streets of Amsterdam after the Sun has set, my way illuminated by electric lights. [Music] I could take an electric streetcar if I wanted to, but I don't. I like to walk because then I can discover mysterious places, which I would never find if I wasn't on foot and if it wasn't for electric signs. “They have a section here for trying to publish papers that are outside the current physics paradigm; there's a section in there.” Communications, medicine, transportation, construction, manufacturing. There is a universal current running through the very heart of the modern human condition. It is so ubiquitous and all pervasive, that we hardly notice it. We take it entirely for granted. Electricity. And you know the most fascinating thing about electricity? No one on Earth can tell us what it is, or why it exists. I am at the train station on time, to catch the next electric train back to my hotel. I know what time it is, because of my battery-powered digital watch. I further immortalize my search for pants with a last electrically powered cellphone photo. [Music] I could read a book on the ride back, if I wanted to: there was plenty of electric light. “Uranium, radioactive uranium in there; ultimately it will devolve into lead 206, which is a little easier to deal with than some of the other things we're burying in the ground; or dropping into the sea”. I couldn't find any pants in Amsterdam that would match my fancy suit. “Some of the half-life of ...” There rare are certainly times I go into the lab, feeling I'm missing a crucial element that I need to do my job. “What happens is that in SAFIRE, while you remediate the nuclear waste, because it's a plasma, it’s going to boil water. It's very hot, so boiling water and turning a turbine is actually no big deal. That's been done. That's easy to do. And so now we get into the big picture and Michael, you're back home.” But sometimes, despite that, “this is my favorite part”, nature gives nature gives me something absolutely remarkable. A glimpse  of the bigger picture. I don't think nature cares about my limitations, or my pants. “Here's me drawing a planet. He really does draw this fast. One of the key ways of working that our team keeps coming back to, is what is nature doing? What's the natural way that things happen? If you've ever seen one of those photographs of the giant ITER magnetic confinement machines, nature doesn't do it that way. There is no situation out there where that's happening, and I think that's why we have not been able as a community to do it that way either, because nature does not want to do anything that way. I don't see, how do I put this? I’m not looking for free energy. I'm not looking for energy out of nothing. What I see when I look at the world, is that the universe has an enormous amount of energy that is constantly being transformed from one state to another, in all of the most amazing ways that you could imagine. So I'm looking for the transformation of energy. And to look then at a large scale picture of how is nature doing this already? We can look at stars and planets and the interstellar medium. This is a good, simple representation of a planet from an electrical point of view. Planets have enormous amounts of electric current coming into them, and going out of them. It's not simple, like a light bulb. No way. The currents are going in and out of the North Pole, in and out of the South Pole, and there's ring currents going around. This is just two sets of currents; we're up to, I think like six or seven that we know about now, that are around Earth, Jupiter, Saturn. And then we're going to take this planet picture, blueprint if you will, design, idea, the way that nature is doing things. And we'll put that into the larger world that a planet is part of, namely getting its energy from its star, its central star. Stars also have pole currents, ring currents. I'm drawing in some planets there. Planets all have their magnetic bodies, electricity coming in, going out. This pattern starts to appear, if you draw it correctly, right? You start to see that there's some structure here that nature seems to be repeating. The magnetic body of planets is something I try to help my students understand. We see dots of light when we look at a planet. Jupiter is just a dot of light, when seen with our eyes, but if we could see the magnetic body of Jupiter or Saturn, it will be larger than your hand, if you hold your hand up against the sky. Different planets are made of different materials. There's no understanding, really, of why planets are made of different materials, but we do know that different planets are made of different materials. And then we're going to look at, well let's place all of this into the interstellar medium. The interstellar medium we now understand is highly structured, highly structured, and that was not known before ten years ago. So let's take our star now. We're zooming out more; we see the star; imagine all the planets around it; keep that in your head. And we're going to place this into a larger world that the Sun lives in; that the stars live in. We now know through direct data that there are filaments throughout the interstellar medium and stars are only along those filaments. Stars are not randomly placed - they're placed like leaves on a tree. We also see these other things in there, which I'm making as blue dots, and you might see them referred to as Proto Stellar Cores, or something like that. And whenever I hear the word “proto”, I know the person has no idea what they're talking about. They just need something, to just put in place. Now, it may be that these other blue, I put in blue dots, are something else entirely. Why do they have to become stars? Maybe the stars are there to help these other things, right? We don't know yet. We don't know what all the roles these things play. There's a lot of organic molecules in the interstellar medium. It's one of those stories you just get tired of reading them. Astronomers are surprised. Astronomers are shocked, right? All the organic molecules out there. Hundreds and hundreds of organic molecules. Sugars are out there, amino acids are out there. What are they doing out there? If we look at just the inorganic elements, this is the top 11, okay. This is just by abundance; this list changes, right as we get more sensitive instruments. But here's the top 11. Part of what I do is study the interstellar medium, and this list is known to me and after our set of experiments that you've just heard about, we're sitting there and we're going - wait a minute, wait a minute! I think I've seen this list before. Those are the elements that we saw appear in our chamber. I don't think that's a coincidence. I think what we're looking at here, is that the the interstellar medium, in ways that we don't yet understand, is quite capable of making whatever molecules and elements it needs. It's not just some random collection, that those stars, the planets, the filaments - they all have functions up there in the galaxy. They're not doing nothing. It’s an absurd idea, to think that nature would organize such an enormous .... something that had no function; makes no sense. So, what are .... so the interstellar medium can make whatever it needs, or organize whatever it needs. The easiest elements that it makes and organizes are the ones that you're looking at there, and they are also the same elements that we see most prominently appearing in our chamber. [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info It's a notion that generations of astronomers have agreed upon with nearly unanimous consent, that the clockwork predictability we see in our solar system today can be traced back over countless eons of time. The planets and the Sun formed about a swirling disk of gas and dust through a process of gravitational collapse and accretion and for billions of years their respective orbits have remained undisturbed. On our own planet, it's presumed that the geological processes we see on earth today can be traced back over many millions of years since a giant asteroid impact killed the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. This is the picture of our solar system's four-and-a-half billion year history, sanctioned for publication in educational textbooks for many decades. But this picture is incrementally changing in the face of an ever-growing evidentiary crisis. The belief that our solar system formed from a collapsing nebular cloud, finds no parallel in the thousands of exoplanetary systems scientists have discovered, including planets with bizarre retrograde orbits and Jupiter-sized planets orbiting tiny parent stars at a fraction of the distance separating the Earth from the Sun. In fact, with increasing regularity, mainstream scientific literature acknowledges that our solar system has undergone dramatic changes, making it a very different place than it was after its formation. Recently, scientists surveying nearly 1,000 exoplanets in over 300 multi-planet systems, discovered an astonishing pattern. Planets that share a star appear like "peas in a pod" with planetary neighbors of consistently similar sizes and regular orbital spacing. On the ramifications of these findings for an understanding of our own solar system; a recent Phys.org reports states, "...in our solar system, the inner planets have surprisingly large spacing and diverse sizes. Abundant evidence in the solar system suggests that Jupiter and Saturn disrupted our system's early structure, resulting in the four widely-spaced terrestrial planets we have today." As those who have followed the Thunderbolts project are aware, for many decades our chief principals have proposed such a disruption to our solar system structure though not to billions of years in the past and these catastrophes were not typified by random impacts but by electrical discharges between planets. Rocky planets and moons reveal bizarre cratering patterns and other features that have been easily reproduced in decades of laboratory experiments with electrical discharges. Material removed from planetary surfaces formed our solar system's comets, asteroids and meteoroids. A "radical notion" to which scientific discovery lends increasing support. Today, scientific research into arguably the most perplexing meteorite ever found on earth is "rattling" the solar system's status quo, challenging astronomers fundamental ideas about our solar system's formation and history. Since 2013, scientists on earth have been studying fragments from the so called Hypatia stone, a tiny meteorite found in the Libyan desert glass field in southwest Egypt. In 2015, a number of research teams announced that the material cannot be identified based on any known type of meteorite or comet. As reported by phys.org in January of this year, new scientific research by a team at the University of Johannesburg has, "...provided unsettling answers that spiral away from conventional views of the material our solar system was formed from." The matrix of minerals composing the Hypatia stone has been described as a "fruitcake" resembling no known meteorite or comet and consisting of strange and never-before-seen combinations of minerals. And the dust material found in the fragments confounds the very core of the solar nebula hypothesis. As described by phys.org, "Generally, science says that our solar system's planets ultimately formed from a huge, ancient cloud of interstellar dust (the solar nebula) in space. The first part of that process would be much like dust bunnies coagulating in an unswept room. Science also holds that the solar nebula was homogeneous, that is, the same kind of dust everywhere. But Hypatia's chemistry tugs at this view." Lead investigator, professor Jan Kramer states, "For starters, there are no silicate minerals in Hypatia's matrix, in contrast to chondritic meteorites (and planets like the Earth, Mars and Venus), where silicates are dominant. Then there are the exotic mineral inclusions. If Hypatia itself is not presolar, both features indicate that the solar nebula wasn't the same kind of dust everywhere - which starts tugging at the generally accepted view of the formation of our solar system." In part one of this two-part presentation, Thunderbolts colleague Peter Mungo Jupp begins an examination of the Hypatia stone as we explore the object's ramifications for the Electric Universe theory. The Hypatia stone, was it a comet or a cosmic thunderbolt? Now, the Hypatia stone is a chemically unique carbonaceous tektite considered alien to earth. In 1996, Egyptian geologist Ali Barakat discovered a tiny one-ounce stone in the Eastern Sahara. And ever since, scientists have been trying to figure out where exactly the mysterious pebble originated. Recently, research at Jan Kramer’s team from the University of Johannesburg found its chemical composition doesn't resemble anything found on earth or in the comets or meteorites they have studied. They therefore concluded it was a deep-space extraterrestrial from behind the Kuiper asteroid belt. It was discovered amongst the supposedly 29 million years old Libyan desert glass-strewn field. Jan's team proposed that the Hypatia stone is a remnant of a cometary nucleus fragment that impacted after incorporating gases from the atmosphere. Its co-occurrence with Libyan desert glass suggests that this fragment could have been part of a bolide that broke up and exploded in the air burst that formed the glass. Chemical analysis from the team suggests the fragment was a deep-space extra-terrestrial from behind the Kuiper asteroid belt. In normal chondritic meteorites, we expect to see a small amount of carbon and a good amount of silica but Hypatia's matrix has a massive amount of carbon and an unusually small amount of silicon. Even more unusual, the matrix contains a high amount of very specific carbon compounds called poly(cyclic)aromatic hydrocarbons or PAHs, a major component of interstellar dust, which existed, the team claims, even before our solar system was formed. In another twist, most but not all, of the PAHs in the Hypatia matrix has been transformed into diamonds smaller than 1 micrometer which are thought to have been formed in the shock of impact with the Earth's atmosphere or surface. Carbon isotope data does not fit terrestrial coal or carbonaceous chondrites as the source of the pebbles, due to the high carbon-13 content. Carbon-12 is the norm for so-called fossil fuel surface deposits containing vegetable and animal fossil inclusions. But is there a better explanation? I believe their conclusions, although possible, are not the only explanations. I will build a questioning case against this controversial theory. Some of the team's foundational paradigms, in my opinion, are suspect. Now, firstly the claim that the pebble is 29 millions of years old relies on dating procedures such as uranium, thorium and potassium argon that demands a constant half-life of an isotope over eons of time. I suspect this is a fallacy when applied all the catastrophic scenarios that have revisited earth. Synchrotron and many other forms of radiation may well order the internal structure of atoms and thus their half-life. Linear half-life is impossible to verify over eons of time being merely an extrapolation based on a very narrow time sampling, in other words the present-day. Some indications are in strong denial of this proven scientific fact. Now, for instance, Rick Firestone who I interviewed, a world expert in isotopes, who ran the cyclotron at Berkeley National Laboratory, revealed as an example that the same isotope of cobalt-60 can have dramatically different half-lives. He couldn't explain why, other than to suggest internal changes in the nucleus. Could cosmic discharge events be involved in altering stable isotopic half-lives? Big question. So, in other words, suspect dating methods were used by Jan's team to support explanations using millions of years to place the Hypatia pebble’s creation as part of an assembly of unchanged pre-solar matter. They claim this matter existed in space before our Sun, the Earth and other planets in our solar system were formed. But slow relentless change over millions of years is totally unproven and more often dodges the real explanation. This concept of uniformitarianism, that is everything happens gradually and only as witnessed in our present world, is at odds to the observed catastrophic events that have often driven periods of extremely rapid change in the Earth's and solar system's development. The result mass extinctions and planetary chaos are but one example of radical chemical transformation. Old Might Just be Young Now, I was fascinated to talk to Louis Hissink, a former diamond geologist with De Beers. He enlightened me on his escape from the confines of classical geological theory. His epiphany came when confronted with Aboriginal mythology that explained recent diamond formation in the Australian Kimberley region. This may also explain the presence of diamonds in the Hypatia stone. Louis was expanding exploration from the famous Argyle diamond mines, biggest in the world, to the alluvial plains near Kununurra some 150 kilometers away. Alluvial diamonds were found in a nearby river but the site was yet to be isolated. A magnetic anomaly pointed to a concentration point. Now once obtaining local approval from the Gija and Miriwung tribes, a fascinating local legend came to light. The verbal Australian Aboriginal legend stated that a giant, shining Barramundi, that's a fish, had jumped out of the ground at Argyle, where the diamond pipe was. The magnetic anomaly site at distant Kununurra was where the aboriginals insisted it dived back into the earth. Both sites were rich in diamonds around their deep diamond pipes. Was the Barramundi legend nonsense? Or had these people witnessed perhaps a giant plasmoid causing transmutation of elements and the creation of diamonds on a grand scale. Now, regardless, Louis Hissink started to question the crusted paradigms of modern geology which, as its backbone, maintains that millions of years are required to change the topography of Earth. Foundational geologists Hutton and Lyell's, classical theories of the 19th century, maintained that slow, erosional decay and gentle chemical change is the steady tool of Earth's geological dynamics. This theory of uniformity asserts that nothing has happened on Earth that's not witnessed today. Louis pondered that if these paradigms were correct, how could historical aborigines witness a diamond creating event supposedly millions of years old? Louis Hissink concluded, and I quote, "Some of the cherished geological theories we hold may be quite wrong!" Our first objection to the University of Johannesburg's hypothesis is blunt. The age of the Sahara Desert is nowhere near 28 million years old. Insightful, as a witness, are the pictures by David Roberts, painted around the 1850s, which show many ancient Egyptian destruction sites such as the Kom Ombo temple; and the Sphinx, half buried under sand. This deposition of sand and earthquake damage is obviously an historical event. Even more direct evidence of the Sahara desert's relatively low age is shown by Barth's 1850 discovery of drawings of herds of cattle rendered by the desert's early dwellers. The animals depicted no longer inhabit this area and many are generally extinct. Neolithic implements, vessels and weapons have also been found near the drawings. The drawings of the cattle contain disk on their horns similar to Egyptian drawings of disk, circa 4 to 6,000 years old time frame. Pictures of chariots, drawn by horses, are found in areas where horses today couldn't possibly survive. They've been revealed in both the eastern and western parts of the Sahara. Men lived in these densely populated areas where cattle pastured, but where today are enormous expanses of sand, stretched for thousands of miles. Even the ancient document Papyrus Ipuwer describes a calamitous time when the deserts of Egypt were created. Our quote is, "The desert is throughout the land, the nomes are laid waste." So it's, that's evidence that the creation of the sands where the desert glass and the Hypatia stones were found, are only recent creations. They're thousands of years old and not due to an episode 28 million years ago. Stay tuned for part 2 
[Music] Every butte has a crack, but not  all cracks are beautiful. Though some are magnificent, ruler-straight and parallel, some can be ugly, chaotic mangles. But there's a quixotic pattern to ugly cracks, so we must not discriminate. Whether they make lovely geometric shapes or chaotic mangles, a study of cracks is essential to Electric Universe science. The reason is cracks are interfaces – boundary layers – and electrically, that's where the action is. To understand any geology, the first thing to look for is boundary layers. Charge collects at boundary layers where it displays the effects of inductance and capacitance most prominently. To begin with, the outside of Earth's crust is a boundary layer. Sonic shockwaves made the geometry, and electricity made the chemistry. Wind,  also motivated by electric currents, made things move – kinetics. Energy  came from within the Earth as a release of stored capacitance. That in a  nutshell explains the face of the Earth. The creation of virtually every mountain, hill, and dale on the planet is summarized in those sentences. The devil is in the details, however, so that's why we're looking at cracks. Cracks are the remnant of capacitor interfaces in Nature's circuitry. They are boundary layers between different materials. The boundary layer separates two dielectrics with a double layer of charge – a capacitor. The dielectric difference was due to difference in dielectric properties of the material at the time it was laid down by plasma winds. The dielectric properties differed due to the elemental and molecular makeup of the material and the state it was in at the time. The material's temperature, density and  pressure influenced the material’s dielectric, and shockwaves produce sharp discontinuities in pressure, density, temperature, as well as charge density. First, let's dismiss cracks that aren't part of the electric circuit we want to examine. Some cracks are from thermal stresses as matter cooled and contracted, or structural as matter shook and settled from seismic forces. These cracks are generally vertically aligned due to gravity. Gravity makes the fracture plane vertical because it's the path of least resistance, where gravity's force vector has no influence holding the rock together. A good example is how hydraulic  fracturing is done in oil and gas production. A fluid is pumped into the wellbore to the bottom of the hydrocarbon formation, and pressurized until the wellbore pressure exceeds the overburden pressure. Fluid pressure separates the rock vertically, creating a fissure that extends the contact to the wellbore upward into the hydrocarbon-bearing formation. The practice allows access to hydrocarbons otherwise locked away in dead zones far from the well. But that's just to illustrate that vertical fracturing is predictable, applied science. A cooling, contracting rock will fracture vertically for the same reason that is swelling the rock under pressure fractures vertically – Newton's laws. Some cracks are due to lightning. These are certainly electrical, but lightning finds its own  path. It's not wave-guided by interfaces other than the surface it contacts, which  still leaves much freedom of motion. Therefore, lightning wanders, following conductive paths on the surface it strikes. It may be vertically oriented, vectored by the electric field, but it will generally not display a pure geometry, such as straight lines and polygonal forms. Its form is chaotic. Lightning-blasted rock often displays shearing where the blast fractured rock, or melting, burning or chemical reaction from the heat and charge. A dipolar  magnetic signature should be detectable across the current path. But lightning scars are not the type of cracks we want to talk about today. We want to discuss cracks generated by shockwaves and electricity at the shear zone between the land and plasma winds, at a time when Earth was embroiled in the epic maelstrom of creation. In other words, we want cracks made  where the filthy underbelly, the Ouroboros scraped the land. The Ouroboros, or the penultimate representation of the concept anyway, is the plasma wind that wrapped the Earth during key stages of its evolution. Sharp discontinuities and plasma winds caused by supersonic shockwaves left imprints in deposits of ionized dust, which manifested as cracks as the dust recombined to form rock. The  discontinuity in a shockwave includes density, pressure, charge density and dielectric properties, which electrically makes it act like a capacitor. Therefore, cracks in rocks are the all-important proof of wind formation and the circuitry in the plasma winds. To define a crack, first of all means an intrusion or separation between rock matrices, or the boundary between stratified layers, whether the space between is a void or filled with material. Therefore, we include rock, veins, dikes, shelves, faults and similar geologic structures, along with empty cracks. The difference is whether material is pulled into the crack, or expelled from the crack by electric fields. Either way  the crack was made by shockwaves. That is why there are a lot of diagonal cracks. Also, polygonal cracks. There are triangles, rectangles, squares and diamonds, everywhere in the rocks, the mountain flanks, and the outline of mountain peaks. The mountains are composed of triangles at virtually every scale. These were caused by shockwaves. It's also why they form at particular angles. Mainstream theory assumes rock strata always form horizontally, and then ”uplift” shifts strata into various angles. Uplift is assumed to be caused by the stretching and compression of the crust due to tectonic movements. It is then assumed erosion from wind, ice, vegetation, and rain over millions or billions of years then polishes the crustal surface into the forms we see today. The assumptions they make are actually ridiculous. Most rock is very brittle. Limestones and sandstones can break in your hands. Igneous rock like granite, break with a whack of a hammer. If the planet's crust churned the way they say, under the forces of compression and expansion, lifting and falling, all the while scraping and jostling for billions of years, the mountains would be piles of rubble, not sharply defined tetrahedrons. Erosion would further break rocks apart, smoothing their edges, rounding their corners, and dissolving any geometry they might have had. The mainstream model of tectonics would leave piles of sand and rubble. Yet,  what we see are sharply defined geometries that accurately and predictably follow the form of sonic shockwaves and the separation bubbles they form at the wind-ground interface. When a shockwave forms, it forms at an angle to the wind's direction determined by the ratio of the wind's speed to the speed of sound, called the Mach number. A Mach number of one or more means the wind is supersonic. A Mach number of two means the wind is twice the speed of sound, and  so on. The incident angle the shockwave makes with the ground varies with the Mach number, so it can be used to determine if winds were consistent, forming at consistent angle or variable in either speed or direction. If you know the density of the atmosphere you can determine the velocity of the wind from the Mach angle. Shockwaves reflect from an interface, like the ground, just like a beam of light reflects from a mirror. The angle of reflection complements the incident angle. The ground forms a plane shockwaves reflect from. Wherever supersonic winds blew, and evidence suggests that was nearly the entire face of the Earth, standing waves formed and reflected from the ground from every channel of jetstream wind. In fact, shockwaves formed whenever a jet stream wind changed direction or expanded or sheared against the Earth or another wind. Therefore, shockwaves patterned the winds. And the wind rippled with shock- waves as they deposited dust and sand, and the deposits retained those patterns. Figure 9 compares images of a diagram of a standing shockwave reflecting from a surface from wind tunnel tests with an impression of a shockwave reflection in a mountain exposed by a road cut. Every feature of the laboratory-produced shockwave is evident in the road cut. The angle between the incident shockwave and the reflected shockwave forms a Y. Inside the Y there is a step in the stratigraphy. The Y forms a discontinuity where the layers take a step down as if this wedge sank. They also angle, or dip differently, just as the pressure regimes inside the Y in the diagram do. The stratigraphy inside and out of the discontinuity closely matches the ”stratigraphy” of pressure regimes in the boundary layer of supersonic winds – because this hill was formed in the boundary layer of a supersonic wind. Look people, this ain't no damn coincidence. How could this happen by conventional theory? How could this wedge drop a few feet and neatly fit the Y without its edges even getting ruffled? The Y isn't straight; it has a hyperbolic compound curve. How could the wedge sink and  still match this curve perfectly without pinching or leaving gaps, and without disturbing the geometry of the curves or strata inside or on either side of the discontinuity? Why does the angle of the wedge strata shift with respect to surroundings on the left and the lower right, but not at the upper right where the strata remains consistent across the discontinuity? How come, while falling into the crack, the wedge became thicker and the big white band of strata at the top, but only on one side of it? None of this makes sense, unless you consider wind deposition at the boundary layer of a standing shockwave reflection. The discontinuities are the impressions left by the incident and reflected shock waves. They form a sharp geometric boundary with no evidence of friction between. As dust deposited, it met this shockwave and followed the pressure and charge density profile of the shockwave. Dust was sucked down into this hole by pressure differentials across the boundary layer, but layered in proportionate thickness to the step voltages that segregated each pressure regime, and the type of dust being delivered by the plasma wind. The wind had to pile this dust and gravel pretty fast, because the layers filled concurrently. That is, these layers didn't stack up one after the other. They fire-hosed in, each layer at the same time, segregated by the dielectric properties of the dust and the electric winds. It's  amazing when you think about it, but this was all one flow, segregated like a rainbow that came suddenly to a stop and compacted itself into a mountain, freezing in that moment this shock reflection and the effect of its sudden pressure anomaly in the airflow. See the damn pattern. These images are scientific proof, a direct link between repeatable, empirical tests and nature. This is far more evidence than anything geologists have presented for any of their tectonic theories. Any. Ever. Their theories are built on the big ideas of arrogant, goateed bow tied phonies, without a shred of empirical evidence. Their evidence is conveniently shrouded in the depths of time. Millions and billions of years of imperceptible, sand grain-by-sand grain movement, which they are still working to explain how CO2 made happen. Who are we to question them? Actually, there's no need to question them. Just stop listening to them and for christ's sake stop giving them money. The shock features exhibited in the road cut is only a small part in the full picture of a supersonic wind-generated shockwave. It's best to think of a shockwaves as the membrane of a bubble. On one side of the membrane is a gas of higher pressure than on the other. The entire bubble structure is very complex however, with regions of expansion and compression, recirculation, laminar flow and turbulence and a supersonic wind is passing through the bubble. In a dusty plasma, it gets even more complex, with electric fields, sheets of current and step voltages across the membranes, which is no longer the physics of fluid dynamics, but of magneto-hydrodynamics. The following image shows where I think the road cut feature came from. This  part of the shockwave, circled in red, is a part of the structure that dips into the separation bubble, which is the turbulent region at the base of the bubble. The separation bubble is where dust collects, which ultimately buried the tip of the  shockwave. The shockwave is not the primary incident wave, but it's a harmonic reflection of it that does not always form, but depends on conditions. Note the fine vertical lines to the right of the primary shockwave in the image. These are stepwise gradations of pressure in the airflow throughout the shockwave structure. In the plasma these gradations are also steps in potential. These vertical gradations can be seen in rocks crisscrossing the diagonal shock waves produced by the Mach angle. Sometimes dust can fill the entire lambda foot structure. In the diagram where the incident and reflected shock meet at a triple point, in which case you get mountains like this. To be clear, some mountains are formed inside the separation bubble or separated flow zone which is the wedge at the very bottom of the structure. And some mountains fill the entire lambda shock structure, the large triangular feature. The lambda foot manifests at the base of every shock reflection, so it is a repeating fractal element of the shock wave and appears at different scales. The stratigraphy in the separation bubble ”dips”, meaning it's angled with respect  to horizontal, consistent with the wind's vector inside the shock bubble, because  that is how the wind layers its dust load. Mountains that fill the entire lambda structure may have stratigraphy that dips at a shallower angle than the dip of the Mach angle displayed by its flat triangular face, because the wind was vectored upward and dust fell, filling the lambda foot from the bottom. Although this should not be taken as a hard and fast rule because there's always variables. Generally speaking, of wind-generated mountains, it can be said that is why shallow dipping hills, foothills and mountains have layered stratigraphy that dips with the contour of the mountain, while larger triangular peaks are more like layered bricks, not necessarily horizontal, but a relatively shallow angle at odds with its outline. Mount Everest is a good example of a big lambda foot mountain. In fact at 29,029 feet I'm pretty confident it's the biggest, baddest lambda foot ever. Follow its stratigraphy, such as  its famous “yellow band” and you can see the dip in relation to the facets of its outline. That's how mountains are formed. The evidence is everywhere, and looking at cracks yields well, mountains of information about their genesis. The interface between stratigraphic layers are cracks by my definition, in case you think I'm losing the thread; talking about the shape of mountains instead  of cracks. Cracks are the remnant signature of shockwaves and electric currents produced in the storm that built the mountain, just as the outline of the mountain is. The contour of the mountain, the cracks in it, and the dip of its sediments are all related to shockwaves. The angles in their layers and contours as pure information about their creation, because information is always a waveform, and the mountains store the waveform. The shockwave and shockwave reflections form an electric field across the walls of the wave in the manner of a capacitor. A double layer forms on the interface as with a dielectric field between. The  charged layers can be the same or opposite polarity to the charge of the dust being deposited, leaving either a void or hardened rock. A hardened seam will have more conductive material, like the quartz and rock veins, than the surrounding rock matrix. Mineral-bearing veins for instance, bear conductive minerals like gold, silver and copper because these conductive materials were attracted by the electric field of the shockwave, either as a vapor from the atmosphere, or by diffusion through the ground. Diffusion through the ground is how consensus theory works, with the attractor being hydrothermal venting. Why hydrothermal venting should attract metals from far and wide isn't clear. An electric field does that though, without  question. So our theory is already better if Occam's razor means anything. The quartz veins and the images of granite were created by an emerging effect of shockwaves, called traveling waves. Note there are four wide quartz veins in the larger image, in two pairs that parallel each other diagonally across this granite face. Traveling waves are semi-stable reflected waves that migrate through a shockwave structure due to instabilities in the bubble. The even vertical lines that appear in figure 10 are examples in a steady wind, but shockwave bubbles can wobble just like soap bubbles, producing instabilities as wind speed and direction varies. They move in harmony to the shockwave frequency in repeating patterns and  that is why there is a pair-of-a-pair, of similarly structured, highly complex repeating forms in these rock veins. The next image shows clastic dykes in Washington  state. These dikes are vertical-to-diagonal intrusions in a sedimentary hill exposed by  road cut. Each dike is layered vertically with different fineness of sediment graded  from silt to gravel, in each separate layer. The sediments inside the dikes are completely different material than the hill they intrude in. It's as if each vertical layer of the dike sucked a different dust down into it from somewhere other than the mountain  it's in. And that's exactly right. Each layer in this dike was a separate funnel  of air pulling dust down from different regions of the shockwave bubble,  where different grades and types of rock were flowing in segregated jet stream winds. The “funnels” were traveling waves that deposited these dikes in little, downward- pointing pressure regime spikes, while the separation bubble filled around  them. It's hard to think on this scale. The cracks, dikes, and veins just shown were produced in the very bottom of a shockwave structure like the one shown in this image. They formed in the turbulent back-end of the separation bubble, a result of friction where the wind literally scraped the ground. Mountains like Everest, the  Matterhorn, and thousands of lesser peaks were formed by dust filling the entire lambda foot structure, forged by winds and electric potentials that are nearly incomprehensible. Supersonic winds had to wrap the entire planet. Earth looked like Jupiter, only a lot worse. The fastest winds rolled up and down and swept against the ground because they were driven by electric currents coupled to Earth's. Higher winds moved slower, circulating positive charge in a halo over the concomitant destruction and creation below. Hence the Ouroboros. It did circle the Earth, winding and coiling like a serpent eating its tail. It's all circuitry. Every feature points to the actions upstream in the current path. That is why the true creation story is knowable. The patterns remain that tell the story. Frequencies, harmonies, wavelengths, and  wave guides. Shockwaves are wave guides. Everything is electric. Everyone needs  to know this, the sooner the better. [Music] 
[Music] We concluded the previous presentation by introducing recent James Webb Space Telescope images of the Seifert II galaxy NGC 7319 within Stephan's Quintet. Before moving to those images, we need to talk a little about dust and its relationship to telescopic observations. In the absence of any obscuring matter, the intensity of light emitted from a light source diminishes with the square of the  distance. Light in the visible portion of the spectrum can be further diminished, or even extinguished, as a result of being absorbed or scattered by matter between the source and receiver. Infrared light can penetrate through dust that is opaque to visible light. The image on your screen compares visibility and optical and infrared light in a smoke-filled room. This is a relevant example, because smoke from a fire is not purely a gas. In fact, its major constituent is particulate matter and those particles are tiny, just as dust particles in space are tiny. This image shows how even a relatively small amount of dust can effectively block a visible light, while allowing infrared light to pass. In 1784, William Herschel was heard by his sister Caroline to explain “There is truly a hole in the heavens.” Herschel was referring to a dark patch in the constellation Ophiuchus, where  no stars at all were visible in the field of view of his telescope. Herschel was convinced that what we now know as molecular clouds, were what he termed ’vacancies’, or regions of space devoid of stars as far as the telescope could see. That became the prevailing view among astronomers and was only finally overturned when in the early 20th century,  Edward Emerson Barnard assembled a body of photographic evidence, showing that the dark regions in the Milky Way were opaque clouds of dust that block the  light of background stars. The histories recounted wonderfully by the radio astronomer, Gerrit Verschuur in his book “Interstellar Matters”. In this set of images of the Dark Cloud Barnard 68, the first two are within the range of visible light. The remainder, moving clockwise, are at increasing wavelengths of near infrared light. This is a comparison of Hubble images of the Pillars of Creation with a visible light image on the left and a near- infrared image on the right. Notice how the relatively tenuous, bluish glowing gas and dust surrounding the Pillars, effectively blocks the visible light from all but the brightest background stars. An ESA feature explains how dust affects what a telescope can see, and how that is dependent upon the wavelengths of light being  captured. Quote, “Although our eyes cannot see infrared radiation, we can sense it - as radiant heat. Infrared radiation ‘is’ heat and all objects, even the coldest ones, an ice  cube for example, emit a certain amount of heat.” ”In fact, celestial objects with surface temperatures of about 2,000 degrees Celsius - cold compared to the Sun which has a surface temperature of about 5,500 degrees Celsius - radiate most of their energy at infrared wavelengths... The cool universe is best studied in the infrared.” ”Dust is the bane of the optical astronomer’s life, blocking the view of many interesting objects. The universe is full of dust, microscopic particles of varied composition – carbon, silicon, water ice, minerals, frozen carbon monoxide, organic compounds, silicates - the list is almost endless.” ”The particles can be hard or soft and come in many different shapes, but their size is usually less than one micron, or one thousandth of a millimeter. The wavelengths of visible light is much the same size as many dust particles, so it is easily blocked, i.e. scattered by the dust, whereas longer-wavelength infrared radiation passes through unhindered and dust is therefore transparent to it. And in the far-infrared, we see the glow from dust itself.” Unquote. When dust scatters light, we may see some of that scattered light as a reflection, just as we see in the glowing dust around the Pillars of Creation, or in the most famous Reflection Nebula, the nebula  surrounding the Pleiades. However, as noted in the ESA feature, in the mid-infrared dust ceases to be transparent to infrared light and instead becomes visible on account of its own thermal emission. At these wavelengths a Space Telescope can capture the glow of the dust itself. This is a spectacular example with an optical image of the constellation of Orion on the left, and a mid-infrared image of  the same field on the right, revealing extensive clouds and filaments of glowing dust. This is Webb's MIRI and NIRCam composite image of Stephan's Quintet with the relevant portion of NGC 7319 indicated by the box. This is that portion of the Webb MIRI and NIRCam image centered on the quasar. Notice that the quasar is surrounded by a halo. With image processing to enhance contrast and saturation, the halo clearly has a hexagonal shape. A James Webb technical document illustrates the morphology of artifacts produced in both the MIRI imaging system and in the NIRCam imaging system. Undoubtedly, the hexagonal halo is  an artifact of the telescope's optics, primarily from the longer wavelengths of MIRI. Here is a larger view of NGC 7319 from the Webb MIRI and NIRCam composite image of Stephan's Quintet, with the quasar indicated by the arrow. Note the prominent filamentary dust lanes. Here is the same region, this time from the Webb NIRCam  image only. Note the filamentary dust lanes have all but disappeared. It is plain that they are contributed almost entirely by the MIRI image. And here is the same region, again from Webb's MIRI image only. The dust lanes dominate this image. Note that the quasar coincides with a dust lane. Comparing the MIRI and NIRCam images side by side, we see that the dust lanes in NGC 7319 are prominent in Webb's mid-infrared MIRI image and all but invisible in Webb's near infrared NIRCam image. This is precisely because Webb's MIRI instrument was capturing mid-infrared light emitted by the dust itself, whereas Webb’s NIRCam instrument was capturing near-infrared light with wavelengths that pass through the dust, rendering it largely transparent at those wavelengths. Moreover, dust sufficient to produce the pronounced glow recorded in the MIRI image, indicates a column density that would, on any view, be sufficient to block visible light from a distant background visible light source. Just as the comparatively trivial amount of dust in the vicinity of the Pillars of Creation, seen in visible light as a reflection nebula, was able to block the visible light of almost all of the background stars. The Hubble images of Stephan's Quintet, released in 2000 and 2009, were both essentially visible-light images, albeit that both include light from filters at 814 nanometers in the very near-infrared. Those Hubble images demonstrate one simple key fact - the quasar is bright in visible light. This collage shows the same close-up field, centered on the quasar from Hubble's 2009 visible light image at the top left; Webb's mid-infrared MIRI image at the top right; Webb's near- infrared NIRCam image at the bottom left; and Webb's MIRI and NIRCam composite image on the bottom right. In the NIRCam image, the relevant dust lane is not visible. Near-infrared light from the countless millions of stars in the body of the galaxy is not obscured by dust to any discernible extent, just as we would  expect. However, the Webb MIRI image and Webb MIRI and NIRCam composite, demonstrate that a substantial dust lane, seen by its own glow, extends all around the quasar. As stated, this demonstrates the presence of dust, sufficient on any view, to block  the visible light of the quasar captured in the Hubble image, if that visible light was coming from behind the galaxy - let alone, for more than 9 billion light years behind the galaxy. In the Hubble image, the dust lane appeared to coincide with the quasar, but there  was still some room to debate the matter. The proposition that the quasar is a deep-background object, shining through the whole disc of the dusty Seyfert II galaxy NGC 7319, including the substantial dust lane captured in visible light by Hubble - seen in both the WFC2 image released in 2000 and the WFC3 image released in 2009 - is quite simply preposterous. In summary, the Hubble and Webb images of the quasar associated with NGC 7319 are observations that simply and unambiguously prove that the high redshift quasar is a foreground object. These observations falsify the redshift- distance relationship, the foundational axiom upon which the whole edifice of Big Bang cosmology is erected. The wisdom of Edwin Hubble's caution  is demonstrated, and Halton Arp is vindicated yet again, just as I predicted. However, Standard Model astrophysicists and cosmologists will continue to insist that the quasar is not in front of the galaxy and must be a background object shining through the galaxy. If they don't, they will be forced to admit that these observations destroy the foundation of Big Bang cosmology. It's a textbook case of paradigm paralysis. But as Chico Marx might have put it, who  are you going to believe, them or your lying eyes? Of course the quasar in NGC 7319 only adds to the numerous examples that Arp and others have produced, demonstrating unequivocally the existence of physical connections between objects with wildly different redshifts. Like the connection between the low-redshift galaxy NGC 7603 and a high-redshift quasar - a connection established even more convincingly by Martin Lopez Corridora and C. M. Gutierrez who obtained the images you see on the screen. Or like the connections between NGC 4319 and Markarian 205. A physical connection between these two objects of very different redshift, was first imaged by an amateur astronomer in 1970. Halton Arp demonstrated the reality of that physical connection in a paper published in 1971. In 2002, the Hubble Heritage team at the Space Telescope Science Institute released the image on the left, showing no connection, and accompanied by a commentary stating ”Appearances can be deceiving. In this NASA Hubble Space Telescope image, an odd celestial duo, the spiral galaxy NGC 4319 - in the center - and a quasar called Markarian 205 - in the upper right - appear to be neighbors. In reality, the two objects don't even live in the same city. They are separated by time and space. NGC 4319 is 80 million light years from Earth. Markarian 205 is more than 14 times farther away, residing one billion light years from Earth. The apparent close alignment of MRK 205 and NGC 4319 is simply a matter of chance.” However, image processing of the STSI's own image file by Bernard Lempel, shown on the right, brings out the bridge of matter physically connecting these objects. In each of these cases, and many others, a physical connection is demonstrated between objects with redshifts, so different that such a connection is utterly Impossible on the Big Bang's foundational axiom. These examples, as powerful as they are, are but one component of a vast body of evidence accumulated by Arp and others that falsify the Hubble relationship and establish that cosmological redshift is intrinsic; that quasars are ejected from active Galactic nuclei; and evolve into galaxies in quantized redshift steps. [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info On this series we are shining a light on an unresolvable problem for astrophysicists, the challenge of explaining unimaginably powerful electromagnetic emissions and energies in a universe in which electricity causes nothing. In our first three episodes, we explored this question through our discussion of the stupendous magnetic and filamentary structures seen all throughout the visible universe. The features are neither predicted nor explained in gravity-centric cosmology but they are the expected features of an electric universe. Fantastic electromagnetic phenomena are increasingly recognized with each passing year. From the powerful electric fields and supersonic plasma jets detected on our own Earth to the mysterious electron acceleration in Jupiter's aurora and even tremendous electric currents measured in galactic jets. Yet standard astronomy still holds to theories in which mechanical and kinetic processes, collisions, explosions, gravitational collapse, heating and shock waves, produce the measured electrical effects. But it cannot be a coincidence that ever finer technological data only increases astrophysicists' expressions of amazement and perplexity. In this episode, we will explain why the discovery of "giant light bulbs in space" is the 4th of 10 reasons why the universe is electric. The Fermi Bubbles It is one of a growing list of astounding mysteries that demand entirely new theoretical pathways. For over seven years astronomers have struggled to explain the presence of the so called Fermi Bubbles, giant structures emitting powerful gamma-rays that stretch for tens of thousands of light-years above and below the Milky Way's spiral disk. Both the structures' mind-boggling size and energetic emissions appear to pose intractable problems for astrophysicists. Astronomers using the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope discovered the so-called bubbles in 2010. The energetic lobes emanating from the Milky Way's center have been a source of extreme puzzlement ever since. The 2014 phys.org article 'Despite extensive analysis, Fermi bubbles defy explanation' outlines the mystery as follows, "The outlines of the bubbles are quite sharp, and the bubbles themselves glow in nearly uniform gamma-rays over their colossal surfaces, like two 30,000 light years tall incandescent bulbs screwed into the center of the galaxy... Their size is another puzzle. The farthest reaches of the Fermi bubbles boast some of the highest energy gamma rays, but there's no discernible cause for them that far from the galaxy." As we outlined in a recent Space News episode, Does Gravity Cause Lightning in Space, it seems almost beyond belief that astrophysicists can only visualize mechanical and kinetic processes even when observing the unmistakable signatures of electrical discharge phenomena. The aforementioned phys.org report poses the question, what blew the bubbles? As if air is being expelled from the galactic center and filling a balloon-like fabric in the vacuum of space. One theoretical possibility investigators have proposed is that a tremendous population of giant stars all exploded at roughly the same time for some reason, somehow forming the gamma-ray bubbles. As noted in the phys.org report, another ad hoc theory for the "bubbles" is that they "...could have been created by huge jets of accelerated matter blasting out from the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy." More recently, in 2017, astronomers claimed that a so-called giant snack, several million years ago, by the hypothetical black hole believed to be at Sagittarius A, produced the energy that created the bubbles. These scientists may have forgotten that the supposed black hole had the opportunity for another "snack" when the gas cloud G2 made its long-anticipated closest approach in 2014. Apparently, the imagined gravitational monster was not hungry leaving the gas cloud intact to the amazement of astronomers around the world. We again note the irony of scientists looking to colossal gravity to explain stupendous electromagnetic phenomena, in this case, no less than "incandescent bulbs" screwed into the center of our galaxy. As we've reported several times recently, the stupendous electric current in a galactic jet, estimated at 10¹⁸ amps or the equivalent to a trillion bolts of lightning, has been measured by radio astronomers and the seemingly unfathomable discovery of radio jets in numerous galaxies in a distant region of space, all spinning in the same direction, will never be explained by black hole proponents. As we've also discussed several times recently, in the Electric Universe, an ultra-high density energy storage phenomenon called a plasmoid is at the core of the Milky Way, a kind of load in the Galactic electrical circuit, rather like a rechargeable battery. In a galactic circuit, electrical power flows inward along the spiral arms lighting the stars as it goes and is concentrated and stored in the central plasmoid. When the plasmoid reaches a threshold density, it discharges usually along the galaxy's spin axis. This process has been replicated in the laboratory with the Plasma Focus device. The most seemingly puzzling feature of the bubbles, the presence of the most intense gamma- rays at the outer edges of the bubbles at the farthest distance from the galactic center, is explicable and indeed predictable in the electrical interpretation. The father of plasma cosmology, Hannes Alfven, proposed that a plasma formation called the double layer should be classified as a discrete celestial object and that explosions of double layers could be the source of gamma-ray bursts and mysterious X-ray emissions. A double layer, or what is known as a Langmuir sheath, forms between plasma regions of different properties. It's a complete mystery to astrophysicists why the most intense gamma-rays should be at the outer edges of the bubbles. Yet in the electrical interpretation the edges of the bubbles delineate the boundary of the Galactic plasma environment and that of deep space. A double layer only exists where there is an electric current flowing through space plasma. In this case, the double layer at the bubbles' edge would be like a giant spherical plate capacitor with positive charge on one plate and negative charge on the other. Charged particles are accelerated across the double layer generating electromagnetic radiation which can include X-rays and gamma-rays. The double layer acts as a boundary effect, dissipating electrical energy in a thin layer. Plasma scientist Dr. Anthony Peratt wrote in his book, Physics of the Plasma Universe, "...x-ray and gamma-ray sources are likely to have their radiative energies supplied by electrical currents." While astronomers continue to ascribe the bubbles to a mysterious blast or eruption event, millions of years ago, another important feature of the bubbles completely defies this notion while affirming the electrical interpretation. In 2013, in the journal Nature, scientists reported the observation of "...two giant, linearly polarized radio lobes, containing three ridge-like substructures, emanating from the Galactic Center. The lobes each extend about 60 degrees in the Galactic bulge, closely corresponding to the Fermi bubbles, and are permeated by strong magnetic fields of up to 15 microgauss." These extremely powerful magnetic fields follow closely the directions of the ridges which wind around the flow of energy as we must find if the ridges in fact represent electrical currents. Critically, the width of the ridges is remarkably constant at about 300 parsecs. Like the consistent width of star-forming filaments, the constant width of the bubbles' ridges is the unmistakable hallmark of lightning. Collisions, explosions, eruptions, geysers, shockwaves, heating; like countless others stupendous electromagnetic phenomena in the cosmos, these kinetic and mechanical mechanisms will never explain the spectacular Fermi bubbles. But why should it be surprising that electricity is actually the source of so-called giant light bulbs in space. The celestial surprises will surely continue until the light bulb of new understanding begins to flicker in the minds of astronomers, illuminating for them our electric universe.

Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info On August 6, 2012, the NASA rover Curiosity touched down on the planet Mars to begin the latest investigation into the Martian environment. It seems that NASA's scientists are most curious about whether Mars could have ever supported microbial life. Beyond this, much discussion in the science media has centered on internet hoaxes and misunderstandings that have duped many in the general public. Based on the NASA press releases one is left to wonder, do any real mysteries remain for Curiosity to explore. Well, it is true that there's a great deal of rumor mongering on the Internet and this gives NASA officials an opportunity to correct misinformation and to be more informed on the subject than those who are spreading the rumors. But there is an irony in all of this. Here on the surface of Mars today, we have a rover named Curiosity and this Rover is a witness to stupendous technological achievement but the irony is that within the theoretical sciences today curiosity is absent. Here we have a laboratory in space, the planet Mars which offers such a unique opportunity for discovery in the sciences. But the questions are not being asked. Just consider for example the mystery of the Martian profile as a whole where you have such a split personality, completely unexplained. Two hemispheres so radically different. In the North, virtually no craters. In the south dense cratering. How could that be? We make assumptions about planetary evolution and hold on to those assumptions for decades after they've stopped working. The mysteries surrounding Martian geology may run far deeper than the general public have been led to believe. The key piece of evidence is the shape of the planet. The northern hemisphere is actually lower than the southern hemisphere and it's not just that that planet was somehow squeezed into an odd shape. The definitive consideration is the crustal depth for reasons that no planetary scientist has explained. The crust of the northern hemisphere has been excavated. It's been eaten away, up to 6 miles deep. And there is one force only that could achieve hemispheric excavation of a planet. That force is electric discharge in an age of planetary instability and violence. A reconsideration of Martian geology could challenge many of the underlying assumptions of planetary science. Planetary scientists have long maintained that you can date the surfaces of rocky planets and moons by counting craters. This would make the southern hemisphere of Mars a billion years older than the northern hemisphere. But if Mars was engulfed in the electric discharge in the past, one of the first questions to ask is whether that pervasive cratering in the southern hemisphere could be explained by electric arcs. And electrical experiments by plasma scientist C.J. Ransom of Vemasat laboratories, showed that production of craters by electric arcs can also generate the telltale markers that you see on the planet Mars, including the central darkened bumps of so many craters and the general darkening of the heavily cratered terrain. These are not patterns that would be expected from random bombardment by rocky bodies from space over a billion years. The cratering patterns created by high-energy plasma discharge to a solid surface, may help explain the many anomalous crater forms on Mars. It really is a fact that textbook theory does not account for Martian cratering patterns. Bizarre hexagonal craters for example. A hexagon is a common trademark of electric discharge. So-called bull's-eye craters where one crater centers on another beyond all probability. Craters with towering central peaks that terminate in another crater. Finally, terraced crater floors. Then crater walls. Huge mesas sitting squarely within a surrounding crater. Sharply scalloped walls as seen in the case of the famous Victoria crater. Also the endless strings of craters or crater chains. And what about craters with central spherical domes, incredibly enigmatic. Is it a coincidence that Dr. Ransom got exactly the same form in electric discharge to a Martian type soil. The cratering mysteries on Mars are just the beginning and if NASA will open the door to an electrical interpretation, a different picture of Solar System history is certain to follow.

a comet can be a wonder to behold for thousands of years these visitors have mystified enchanted and terrified humanity and even today despite much attention from astronomers the popular science of comets is filled with enigmas and unresolved mysteries to theoretical views of comets today stand in stark contrast but aided by recent discoveries we can compare the two vantage points and test them against presently known facts it was only in the mid twentieth century that a scientific consensus emerged on the nature of comets in 1950 astronomer Fred Whipple proposed a model that came to be known as the dirty snowball hypothesis crippled envision comets as conglomerates of frozen gases mainly water carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide together with the primordial dust of the early solar system but a dilemma had to be solved comets lose considerable material at each pass around the Sun this means that the Comets we see cannot have been around all that long so the Dutch astronomer Yann Oort envisioned a vast hoard of icy objects circling the Sun about a thousand times more distant than remote Pluto he imagined that after billions of years one of these dirty snowballs could be deflected from the icy cloud by a passing star it might then fall into the inner solar system to produce an active comet as astronomers came to accept the idea they called this theoretical source of comets the Oort cloud but in the early 1990s with improved observations it became clear that numerous objects circled the Sun at much closer distances than the conjectured Oort cloud and eventually all short-term comets were theorized to have arrived from a disk of debris called the Kuiper belt it's extending out from Neptune's orbit and containing objects that drifted inward from the Oort cloud across the eons my astronomers own admissions these theoretical guesses leave numerous comet mysteries unresolved but always it is assumed that comets are composed of dust and ice warmed by the Sun to create a coma and tail leaving a rind of dust the theory suggests that beneath the blackened shallow crust pockets of gas form at critical moments the pressure breaks through the surface creating Jets blasting vapor and dust away from the nucleus but how well does this popular theory explain what we've more recently learned about comets in an alternative view comets have a much different history this view sees comets is debris left by intense electrical activity in an earlier phase of solar system evolution not billions of years ago but a much more recent epoch of planetary instability and violence one that reached even into early human times this new perspective combines historical facts with surprising recent discoveries about comets in the electrical interpretation not just comets but asteroids and meteors as well were born in planetary upheaval as electric arcs blasted material from the surfaces of planets and moons to produce fused formations identical in appearance to fused material and laboratory experiments with electric discharge here an arriving comet moves on an elliptical path through the sun's electric field an exceedingly weak field but immensely powerful across the great distances of interplanetary space as the comet draws closer to the Sun the charge imbalance triggers electric discharge creating a coma and long cometary tail the mysterious Jets of comets can then be understood in terms of arc discharges to the nucleus very similar to industrial electric discharge machining the excavated material is accelerated into space along the Jets filamentary pathways intermittent and wandering arcs he rode the surface and Burnet black leaving the distinctive scarring patterns of comet nuclei the Jets explode from the nucleus at supersonic speed and retained their coherent structure for hundreds of thousands of miles scene in terms of an electrically neutral vacuum in space nothing of this sort should occur the tails of comets reveal well-defined twisting filaments extending up to tens of millions of miles without dissipating in the vacuum of space for proponents of the electric model this contradiction of neutral gas behavior is no surprise it is the testament to the Comets electrified environment the proponents of this interpretation also say it's the electric force that holds the spherical coma in place against the solar wind as the comet races around the Sun the diameter of the visible coma will often reach millions of miles and it's surrounded by an even larger and more improbable spherical envelope of fluorescing hydrogen visible in ultraviolet light for decades we've been assured that comets were made in the deepest of deep freezes in interstellar space comets coalesced from interstellar Stardust the primal material of the universe before the emergence of the Sun as we know it or its planets and their moons a foundational principle of Comet theory and of modern cosmology as a whole is compositional zoning at the outermost reaches of the sun's domain formative processes were limited to the most rudimentary material raw dust constituted in an environment close to absolute zero with no complex chemistry in contrast bodies later formed close to the emerging Sun would exhibit minerals formed at relatively high temperatures for decades this theoretical claim stood fast and the claim was even carried into space it's what prompted the Stardust mission to comet ville 2 as indicated by the very name of the scientific mission the theory required that a comet be constituted of Stardust but the core assumptions of Comet theory could not withstand the shock from the data returned by the Stardust mission launched on February 7th 1999 Stardust carried with it a tray of aerogel to capture samples of Comet dust from built to and it returned these samples to earth scientists could then view microscopically the raw material of a comet the first surprise was the size of the dust grains much larger stronger with far more complex structure and chemistry than Theory allowed and the gel did capture trivial amounts of the expected microscopic dust invisible to the naked eye and leaving shallow bowl shaped pits in the aerogel but more common by far were much deeper tracks more in the shape of carrots than shallow pits the particles themselves were clearly visible to the naked eye to their amazement the mission scientists found elaborately developed crystalline structures in the ville to dust it was an exciting discovery but one that challenged all prior theory of a comet's origins crystalline structures cannot form in the absence of minimum temperatures temperatures unavailable in interstellar space the specter of silicates and cometary comas were evident as far back as the probes of Comet Halle though largely ignored but the mystery couldn't be ignored after a rival of the comet hale-bopp in 1997 this comet spectra placed an exclamation point on crystalline silicon structures in cometary comas to get past the problem astronomers hedged their beds they surmised that billions of years ago the raw material of the comet was ever so slightly warmed by an emerging Sun then all of the discrete particles in a vast circle around the Sun were transported outward by means only guessed at to the faraway and frigid Oort cloud but this rationalization failed outright once the scientists had real Comet dust in their laboratories the grains were simply too large and the mineralogical and chemical compositions far too complex one puzzle was followed by another comet theory assumed that water ice was a primary constituent of active comets but no water ice was detected on the nucleus of ville two and not a trace of water was found in the well-preserved comet dust and yet paradoxically the raw comet material of vilt two contained iron and sulfur minerals that can only be formed in the presence of liquid water liquid water not in the near-perfect vacuum of deep space and not in a deep freeze instead of trivial warming the built to minerals revealed a diversity of formative processes various sulfide minerals requiring liquid water can only exist below 210 degrees Celsius or 410 degrees Fahrenheit these minerals have never seen higher temperatures but also occurring in the comet dust was the mineral olivine whose molecular structure rapidly breaks down in the very presence of water it's a common igneous form an abundant byproduct of volcanism perhaps the biggest surprise was that some of the comet minerals such as forsterite in the instant of their formation were heated to thousands of degrees forsterite is formed in the most intense volcanic heating of silicates but occurs also in lightning strikes to silicate rocks the message could not have been more emphatic it was not just the hypothesized Oort cloud that failed to work is advertised the entire concept of compositional zoning is applied to comets failed its first acid test comet material requiring moderate temperatures in liquid water comet material formed at exceedingly high temperatures only the most trivial levels of the presumed raw material of comets interstellar dust a complete absence of water despite cometary material originally formed in liquid water though the olivine abundances could not have been formed or even survived in the presence of liquid water and of course liquid water requires atmospheric or other pressure it cannot exist in the extreme vacuum of interstellar space - this seemingly contradictory picture we must add extreme selective heating selective heating because much of the compositional material could not survive the super heating that created olivine forsterite and other crystalline minerals the Ville - discoveries have forced upon comet science one inescapable fact in our own cosmic neighborhood the diverse mineral content of ilk - is typical only of planets in the habitable zone of a fully developed Sun when the fundamentals of a theory are falsified by unexpected findings a new vantage point is required one that explains and predicts the surprises without introducing new contradictions the conjectured Oort cloud freezer forming and preserving comets for billions of years is falsified by the vill to findings only the diverse surface environments of rocky planets can provide the required raw material and only the recent formation of comets can explain why these rapidly degraded objects are still with us the bold question must now be asked where comets created and in recent periods of planetary instability and intense electrical events would minerals formed in liquid water then come as a surprise would comets now exhibiting no water be a surprise or crystalline structure suggesting igneous processes or minerals pointing to the exceedingly high temperatures of lightning a more unified picture of comet formation is available to us and if comets were born electrically what might the causative connection be to asteroids and meteorites the apparent cousins of the comet built to mineral cuba night a copper iron sulphide is abundant on earth and so2 on mars in fact it's found in Martian meteorites now known to have been blasted up to escape velocity from the surface of Mars later to arrive at Earth a few years ago things now stated by astronomers would have been considered preposterous astronomers now acknowledge that the margin moon Phobos long called a captured asteroid was formed out of material blasted from the Martian surface for the source of a comet's constituent materials planets close to the sun's habitable zone are the most reasonable places to look the foremost candidate is the planet Mars in this intellectual adventure we must revisit all earlier ideas about solar system history evidence for high-energy electrical events can no longer be ignored the popular bill in your scenarios describing a comet's origins will be displaced by things now established as fact and the changing picture of solar system history will surely not stop at the new story of the comet you 
welcome to space news from the electric universe brought to you by the thunderbolts project at Thunderbolts dot info the comet 67p has provided an avalanche of astonishing discoveries that may puzzle scientists for years to come and one problem that will simply not go away is the seemingly impossible dooms or doom like ripples at the Comets neck at its first observation the feature drew gasps of disbelief from scientists and science media alike as planetary geologist Emily locked a wallow wrote on October 28th 2014 other features are odd because they look familiar and yet have no right being on a comet I've called them rhythmic ridges but to pretty much everyone who looks at them they look like sand dunes which are just plain impossible on a body that has neither atmosphere nor much of any gravity more recent close-up images of the impossible dunes have only deepened the mystery emily lacta Walla is of course correct within the standard model of comets and comet origins so-called sand dunes or dune like ripples are clearly impossible however vision scientists have had no choice but to grasp for an explanation they have suggested that the Comets Jets act as a kind of wind to create a Dueling process despite the absence of the required atmosphere dr. Nicholas Thomas said to the New York Times you have to ask yourself is that possible you can convince yourself you could make the move it's plausible at least at the moment this remarkable conjecture has even been given a scientific sounding name localized gas driven transport a hint of another possibility has been suggested on at least one science news service on January 24th the Universe Today website suggested of the doom like ripples formation electrostatic levitation of dust charged by sunlight may also play a role indeed electrostatic dust levitation on the moon has been a subject of scientific interest for several decades since Apollo astronauts observed fountain of dust hundreds of kilometres above the lunar surface the implications of this discovery have long been clear for other airless bodies in the solar system we can now see on the horizon of the illuminated portion of 67 piece nucleus a cloud of dust lit by the Sun both the behavior of the Jets and the Comets dust layers defy the notion of an icy body moving through an electrically inert vacuum the increasingly energetic Philip mentary Jets are aligned and draw together and it appears that the dust is being gathered in two unique configurations on the surface and globally levitated above the surface this increases the confidence of electric universe proponents that surface electrical activity could profoundly reconfigure the dust layers in the course of the next few months we note that the most abundant and energetic Jets originated at the Comets neck which is frequently in shadow and is the coldest region on the nucleus which means it should be the least active region if solar warming is the cause of the Jets nor have we seen evidence that the Jets are connected to the supposed pressurized chambers which are said to provide the quote nozzles from which the Jets explode as noted in a recent space news episode for more than 15 years members of the electric universe community have been exploring the effects of electrical discharges and electric fields on surface dust these experiments have successfully replicated many familiar planetary features including dunes and dune like ripples confirming the ability of the electrical force to organize dust material much more efficiently than mechanical wind or gravity alone consider also the significance of this experimental research for our understanding of planetary science the planet Mars has an atmosphere less than 1% as dense as Earth's and it's scientists have puzzled for decades over the planets towering dust devils and global dust storms today the electrified nature of the giant dust devils has been acknowledged by NASA investigators mechanical wind alone does not explain the Martian sand dunes a more than it can explain the dunes on 67p in the past few decades scientific papers have suggested minor electrostatic and photoelectric effects on comets and asteroids but comet theorists as a whole have yet to give serious attention to the electric universe theory of a comet the electrical interpretation sees comets as negatively charged bodies moving through a weak electric field of the Sun comets simply pick up the negative charge during their time at greater distances from the Sun a new scientific paper appears to have confirmed yet another prediction of this theory in the fall of 2014 the Rosetta orbiters ion and electron sensor measured a high level of excess electrons surprisingly close to 60 7-piece nucleus the paper reads IES has revealed the presence of greatly enhanced electron fluxes and densities which appear to be associated with cometary ions created near the nucleus electron fluxes within a couple of hundred of kilometers of the nucleus greatly exceed solar wind electron fluxes the presence of surprising densities of electrons near the common nucleus is precisely what we do expect if cometary displays are electric discharge phenomena the successful predictive record of the electric comet theory stands in stark contrast to the record of the 65 year old dirty snowball model indeed in recent weeks we've seen some remarkable statements from the Rosetta team in January dr. Nicholas Thomas was quoted as saying by the science News org website Rosetta has blown the dirty snowball idea out of the water however the ad hoc theories constructed by the Rosetta team still hold to the original story of comets as primordial icy bodies from the early solar system how institutional science responds to the now acknowledged falsification of the dirty snowball model will be a crucial test of its health and integrity whatever the outcome the current challenges for comet scientists will simply not go away for continuous updates on space news from the electric universe stay tuned to Thunderbolts dot info 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info In part one of this presentation, Thunderbolts colleague Peter Mungo Jupp began a provocative reassessment of the standard geological and anthropological timetables on planet Earth. We have proposed a radically alternative history for planet Earth and indeed our entire solar system. In relatively recent times, there was a chaotic period in the inner solar system, when planets approached one another close enough to exchange electromagnetic energy taking the form of interplanetary lightning. One of these planets was Earth. Whose close encounter with Venus, the great comet, was recorded in ancient texts around the world. In this scenario, in an era of prehistory, the Earth was bombarded with tremendous electromagnetic radiation. What effects did this have on our planet and its living organisms? Most geologists and biologists work from a uniformitarian viewpoint, i.e. that's only small incremental changes in the last thousands of years. One though has only to read Claude Schaeffer's works, the archaeologist in the Middle East, to realize that many violent perturbations have occurred within the last few thousand years. We're talking roughly no more than 8,000 years and if one is to believe historical and many of the myths as argued by Rens van der Sluijs, then continent-encompassing floods, earthquakes, volcanoes, and massive electrical phenomena must have played a huge part in altering the carbon-14 isotope's concentration in living species. Also, dead carbon-13 from underground sources in huge volcanic eruptions must also falsify carbon-14 ratios. The concept of dead carbon contamination. Now, before we go on to the atomic clock mitochondrial DNA Theory, let's just touch on one of the last archaeological modern science dating technologies. Electric spin resonance, uranium- thorium, thermoluminescence and optically stimulated resonance. How accurate are these other methodologies used in establishing chronology? Electric spin resonance and uranium- thorium series dating methods are secondary in the sense that they rely on measurements of isotopes and others not originally present in the living body and the modeling of process taking place after burial. For instance, thermo-luminescence and optically stimulated luminescence dating methods are applied to quartz grains in sediments containing skeletal remains but not directly on the bones. Again, these must be subject to interpretation of the environment at the time of inception. Brian notes that he found thermo- luminescence dating highly inaccurate with echoes of the Jinmium affair which we'll go into. When dating marine deposits, the laboratory result was 20,000 years BP (Before Present). He maintains this cannot be accurate for the time the shoreline was well out to sea. He also remarks that this technique cannot be considered accurate if the event that initially triggered the zeroing of the quartz particles occurred at night. It's light dependent In this case, it will not start the clock ticking. He also notes serious age reversal effects with carbon dating. We have not always lived in an uniformitarian universe and what happens today may have been and most probably was drastically different to our own relatively geologically calm world. These methods too, could be subject to gross error without knowing the physical, historical, geological history of the site. Cataclysmic events have often shaped the Earth in only the last few thousand years. Our reliance on scientific dating demands caution. I touched on the Jinmium affair with first declared the site is possibly 170,000 years before present, using luminescence dating. But it was eventually found to be only 3,000 years old. Optical luminescence methods are highly subject to contamination with Bowler, from Melbourne University, noting in his last studies of Lake Mungo that one lower level came up at a later date than the higher one. Impossible? He declared this was contamination but there are serious flaws for this method especially when water has, at some stage, washed through an area. In addition, it assumes zero crystal attachment when initially exposed to sunlight at its foundation. It depends on how it was formed and this is how to assume when the geologies was not there at its inception. Similarly, electric spin, electron spin and uranium-thorium series methodologies, make many assumptions gleaned from our uniformitarian present-day world and make no speculation on conditions evident in the ice age where unknown factors were probably at work. For instance, note the discrepancy between Bowler and Thorne's work at Lake Mungo. One came to 40,000 years before present, the other 60,000. A 20,000 year discrepancy. Carbon dating if it's not standardized with dendrography, which only goes to 8,000 years, cannot be accurate. Remember, we're not doubting the accuracy of mass spectrometry used, only its universal application without time calibration controls. And finally we move on to the atomic clock- mitochondrial-DNA-phylogenetic theory. Aha! Is in fact mitochondrial DNA the atomic clock genetic scientists claim it to be? Eukaryote cells, that's mammal and other living cells, contain mitochondria within the plasma of the cell but outside its nucleus. Amongst other functions, they are an energy factory driving the cells. Curiously, they most closely resembled the bacteria Rickettsia and have many similar properties. What has become of great interest is the mitochondria's ability to transport, that's with the exceptions the female line to the next generation. The quality that excites interest is that a certain portion of the genetic chain of the mitochondrial DNA, is subject to mutation in what is believed to be a constant rate within any species. Thus analysis of past generations should reveal the number of generations, noted at humans for 20 years per generation, and thus act as an atomic clock to peg the age of the specimen. Recently, an attempt was made to estimate the age of the human race using mitochondrial DNA. This material is inherited always from mother to children only and there are exceptions but that's a distraction. By measuring the difference in mitochondrial DNA among many individuals, the age of the common maternal ancestor of humanity was estimated at about 200,000 years. Is this true? A problem is that rates of mutation are not known by direct measurement and are often computed based on assumed evolutionary timescales. Note that 'assumed evolutionary timescales.' As we have seen in the previous work above, all these age estimates could be greatly in error. In fact, many different rates of mutation are quoted by different biologists. It shouldn't be very hard explicitly to measure the rate of mutation of mitochondrial DNA to get a better estimate on this age. From royal lineages, for example, one could find two individuals whose most recent common maternal ancestor was, say, 1,000 years ago. One could then measure the difference of the mitochondrial DNA of these individuals to find its mutation rate. This scheme is attractive because it does not depend on radiometric dating or other assumptions about evolution or mutation rates. It is possible that in 1,000 years there would be too little difference to measure. At least, this would give us some useful information. Now along this line, Parsons, one of these researchers, has recently done some work to measure explicitly the rate of substitution in the mitochondrial DNA control region. That's a narrow region where a lot of mutation occurs and I'll read his summary, "The rate and pattern of sequence substitutions in the mitochondrial DNA control region is of central importance to studies of human evolution and to forensic identity. Here, we report a direct measurement of the intergenerational substitution rate in the human CR." Now, this is a way we can actually find the age. He compared these to what they call 'phylogenetic analysis' that claim the use of mitochondrial DNA to ascertain the age of, let's say, a particular Neanderthal for instance. He found the observed substitution rate reported were very high compared to rates inferred from evolutionary studies. So, using so-called mitochondria DNA in fact, 20 times higher. "Using our empirical rate to calibrate the mitochondrial DNA molecular clock would result in an age of this mitochondrial DNA of only 6,500 years, clearly incompatible with the age of modern humans (as estimated by evolutionary studies) ...it remains implausible to explain the known geographic distribution of mitochondrial DNA sequence variation by human migration that occurred only in the last 6,500 years." In fact, the evolutionary molecular clock, as measured by mitochondrial DNA, has a long and troubled history. Hampered by a lack of empirically measured mutation rates, the evolutionary molecular clock researchers have historically assumed mutation rates by dividing two species' genetic differences by their evolutionary time of divergence, e.g. human-chimpanzee divergence. Since the latter was inferred from the evolutionary age of silence in the fossil record which is basically not very well understood, the evolutionary molecular clock amounted to a circle of evolutionary assumptions and never, never an independent test of a species' time of origin. The advent of modern molecular genetics has resulted in an increasing number of publications in which mutation rates in various species and in various genetic compartments have been empirically determined independent of the evolutionary age of silence in the so-called fossil record. Using the mitochondrial mutation rates, predictions can now be made on how much mitochondrial DNA diversity should result after a specific number of years have elapsed. These studies represent an important and significant step forward in our understanding of the origin of human mitochondrial DNA differences. Though the mutation rate was measured only in European individuals, predictions with this mutation rate on the 6,000 year time scale captured the mitochondrial DNA diversity. All non-African people groups including the major Eurasian groups and representatives of the native peoples of the Americas. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info The interview you are about to hear with physicist Wal Thornhill was recorded on Monday April 8th, 2019. In anticipation of the scheduled release of the so called 'first ever direct image of a black hole' which occurred on Wednesday, April 10th. Now, whenever we talk about a space science story which has crossed over and become a major international news headline, we seem to attract an inordinate number of viewers who have little or no prior familiarity with plasma cosmology and the Electric Universe theory. The problem is that the overwhelming majority of the general public have no idea that any theoretical alternatives to the black hole exist and should actually be taken seriously. So here's a brief segment from a possible elevator speech for newcomers to plasma cosmology and the Electric Universe. Plasma cosmology is a model of the universe which recognizes the now undeniable significance of plasma and the electromagnetic force in the cosmos. For several decades, plasma cosmologists have successfully reproduced, in laboratory experiments, many Astrophysical phenomena. An electric plasma universe predicts, and in fact, requires the pervasive and shockingly well ordered cosmic magnetic fields which are now recognized but are not explained and were not predicted by gravity-centric cosmology. And for decades, it's been proposed that at the center of galaxies is not a black hole but rather a physically real object which is produced and observed in laboratories, called a plasmoid. Now, you've probably never heard Neil deGrasse Tyson or Brian Cox talking about plasmoids, but that doesn't make them any less real. So what is a plasmoid? Well, the term plasmoid was coined by the physicist Winston H. Bostick in the 1950s. Bostic described a plasmoid as follows, "The plasma is emitted not as an amorphous blob, but in the form of a torus. We shall take the liberty of calling this toroidal structure a plasmoid, a word which means plasma-magnetic entity. Now, Bostick is probably most famous for having performed many experiments in the plasma lab which reproduced the formation and evolution of spiral galaxies. Now, Wal Thornhill explains in this interview in some detail the nature and properties of plasmoids and for viewers who wish to gain an understanding of what plasma cosmology and the Electric Universe actually propose for the phenomena that astrophysicists attribute to "black holes." In the comments section, we have penned a comment which will feature a dozen or so relevant links to previous Space News episodes and a number of other resources. So finally, as I begin to play my discussion from Monday with Wal Thornhill, bear in mind again the description of the plasmoid as a "toroidal or doughnut-shaped structure." Now consider the side-by-side comparison of the plasma cosmology prediction of what's actually at a galaxy's core which is the aforementioned extremely dense magnetically confined hot spot called a plasmoid, and to the right we see the image that has been touted as the first picture of a black hole, of course, with no alternative being considered. So here now is part 1 of my two-part interview with Wal Thornhill, recorded April 8, 2019. On April 6, the Phys.org report says, scientists are set to unveil the first picture of a black hole. The thing is that the picture itself is actually a virtual reality image, like most of these deep space images turn out to be and that's because the imaging algorithms that were developed to fill the gaps of data and they say the gaps of data we are missing in order to reconstruct a picture of black hole. So in other words, it's the algorithms that they've developed based on their understanding and their assumptions about what it is they're looking at that will generate this image. They just granted that they are looking for something at the center of the galaxy which would appear about the size of a, try to photograph a golf ball on the moon, according to this article. There is plenty of opportunity for making the image look like what you expect to see. And this has happened of course before. It's just like the gravitational wave detectors that were built to detect gravitational waves and all of the assumptions were built-in into that so that they had to find something. So they had hundreds of thousands of templates against which to match these signals and then of course the signals have to be sort of pulled out of the noise, they're looking at signals that are incredibly tiny, which gives rise of course to the possibility that what they're seeing is like making faces out of clouds. The notion that black holes exist is based on gravitational theory. Now gravitational theory, according to modern scientists, is that of general relativity, Einstein's general relativity, but the problem with that is and it was best described, I think, in a television program put on by the BBC which showed Brian Cox explaining the genius of Einstein in looking at a falling cannonball and a feather in a huge vacuum chamber. And of course, the two fall together. And what Brian Cox said was that Einstein's genius was that he said, they're not actually falling. In other words, it's all an appearance but the only way you can get away with that is to disregard everything else that exists in the universe, which was a tendency of the mathematics of general relativity and also special relativity. Special relativity makes all observers, no matter how they're moving, equivalent which is sheer nonsense. The only way you can do that is to disregard the rest of the universe because the most their motion will be different for different observers with respect to this background of all the stars and matter in the rest of the universe. So it's a weird kind of perception that's induced by Einstein's theory. The Electric Universe has followed the guide of the plasma cosmologists, the plasma physicists who've done real experiments and developed a simple theory which explains what is at the center of our galaxy and other galaxies and that is a plasmoid. Now, plasmoid is a concentration of electromagnetic energy caused by electric currents flowing in along the spiral arms into the center of the galaxy and this is seen in the laboratory, the plasma laboratory, in terms of what's known as a plasma focus where you have a central conductor and a surrounding cylinder with that large voltage difference between them; and you produce that voltage difference by having a huge roomful of capacitors, stored electric charge, which you release suddenly. What you do then is, you create a discharge which runs down the cylinder, between the cylinder and the central electrode and when it comes to the end that it moves out beyond the end and curls back in on itself and forms as tiny plasmoid. Now, a description of all of this and the physics behind it was given by Eric Lerner in his book 'The Big Bang Never Happened' which was published in 1991. It's easily understood, it makes sense, it conforms to electromagnetic theory, and it is all about electrodynamics that is the movement of charged particles. And when you think about it, the universe is formed by moving charged particles. So, the governing force in the universe is what's known as electrodynamics, not gravity. And in particular, spiral galaxies, their form and the way they move is easily explained in terms of electrodynamics, not gravity! Now when you concentrate a huge amount of electrical and electromagnetic energy in a tiny plasmoid, the energy storage means that it appears to have a lot more mass than you would expect in such a small space. Also, the plasmoid has a doughnut shape. So it's quite likely that what we will be told is that they've seen a glowing accretion disk. The gravitational accretion has nothing whatever to do with it, it is all electro-dynamic. So yes, there can be or they should actually see a glowing doughnut- shaped object quite bright because there's an awful lot of radiation and so on from this object and in the center there will be nothing. No black hole, just the plasmoid, and it's only when the plasmoid begins to break down that the, where the electric and electromagnetic forces are greatest that is in this center of the doughnut. That is where the breakdown occurs and you get these jets formed. Now jets from a black hole are an incredible nonsense when you think about it, because black holes are supposed to suck everything in and here they are, forcing jets out along the rotation axis. Maybe I should expand a bit on what these jets are and how they're formed. If you can imagine that the plasmoid has a combination of both positive and negative charges in that plasma and this is quite normal for a plasma; where they become forced closest together is in the center of the doughnut, if you like. And when the density of these particles reaches a critical point, the protons and electrons may actually join together to form a neutron and the neutrons then are not subject to the electromagnetic forces that have held them in place and this is why they escape in the form of neutrons and the neutrons of course decay in a matter of minutes but that's enough time for them traveling at relativistic velocities to get away to then become positive and negative particles once more. The electrons tend to be trapped longer by the powerful magnetic fields involved, they tend to spiral around much more tightly than the heavier protons, and so you get an electric current flowing along these jets. And this is actually being measured by the magnetic fields they create and these currents are huge. So the whole galactic environment and behavior and appearance can be explained electromagnetically and has been done so by plasma cosmologists decades ago. But of course, astrophysicists and this over-specialization of science these days creates walls between people, even within the same discipline. It's difficult often to get ideas broadcast and discussed rationally and rational decisions made based upon rational argument even within individual departments, let alone across departments in a university. So in some ways, our institutionalized education and research system fails us, dismally, and this is why we get away with this huge expense on things like the gravitational wave detectors when no one actually knows what the gravitational force is, and event horizon telescopes when even the very concept of the event horizon for a black hole is nonsense. The answers all lie in getting a grip on the real history of science because we actually lost the plot at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century. It's as if the human race went rather berserk, both politically and scientifically at the same time. And of course, the history that's taught to students is sanitized, you only hear about the people that they want you to hear about and those who had other ideas are not even compared against the ideas that are so-called, you know, 'accepted science' or 'consensus science.' The whole idea of consensus science is nonsense anyway because the truth is not found by a vote. Well, an unspoken agreement that lurks behind this kind of media sensation is the assumption that no basis exists for anyone to doubt the black holes' existence. So here's a very simple question for you, what is your response to the astrophysicist who says that the existence of black holes is an established fact? The questions to ask an astrophysicist in return for any dogmatic statements is to define mass and energy because here we hear these black holes have masses of millions or even billions of Suns and they're compressed into a space where the mass resides in a singularity. Well, a singularity involves infinity and you're no longer talking physics when you introduce infinity because infinity is merely a concept, that's not a thing, it's not a number, you can't use it in mathematics as school boys were taught when I went to school. But it's a word that's often used in reference to black holes and also the Big Bang. This gets back to Eric Lerner's book and why it's important to read it. From the physics point of view is, that he deals with these things, the plasma cosmologists don't deal with infinities, they have no need because the electric force is so much more powerful than gravity that you can ignore gravity and they've actually tested that in their supercomputer simulations of their experiments and they can include gravity quite easily and in the simulation or they can leave it out and it makes no difference.

Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info The following presentation is an adaptation of the Mel Acheson Picture-Of- the-Day article, “What Science Says.” The link to the article may be found in the description box of this video. It's common to hear people refer to ”what science says.” The usual assumption is that what science says is said indefeasibly. But the term “science” has two conflicting senses: science as Currently Accepted Theory and science as method. To conclude that method inevitably leads to Currently Accepted Theory and furthermore, that Currently Accepted theory is the end of science, is to wallow in hubris. Both the history of science and the nature of cognition contradict such arrogance. The universe is large, and data both accumulate and can be arranged and valued in different ways. The discernment of orderly patterns in these mutable fields of data, can result not only in refinements of a theory, but in the wholesale replacement of a theory. In pursuing the questions raised by Currently Accepted Theory, method is likely to overturn Currently Accepted Theory. In the competition between a Currently Accepted Theory and its potential replacement, the two senses of science apply opposite standards of evaluation. From the viewpoint of science as Currently Accepted Theory, the standard is conformity with the fundamental principles of the discipline. Any fundamentally different theory will be seen as a “crackpot” idea. Half a century ago, fitting continents together like a jigsaw puzzle, was ridiculous. From the viewpoint of science as method, the standard is systematic exercise of cognitive skill: the discernment of orderly patterns in domains of experience. The distinction between fundamental and superficial differences is irrelevant. That continents can be fit together like a jigsaw puzzle, was a clue to a new theory and recognition of a new phenomenon. In the sense of method, particular theories are just tools, something with which to build a technology, to be replaced when experience and curiosity move on. All theories are “working hypotheses”, not Ultimate Truths. I'll use the Electric Universe Theory for an example. In the standards of Currently Accepted Theory, it's ridiculous: four or five planets stacked one above the other on a common axis, is if not impossible, so far from the familiar and the expected, that it's laughable. Gravitational theory has come up with the orbit of SOHO, revolving around an empty spot in space. And Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 stretched out in a line that might have mimicked the Saturnian polar configuration from one of its components. But if gravitational theory alone can't quite say it's impossible, the many interlocking connections with other disciplines, makes it extremely unlikely. In the standards of method however, this is all merely argument from authority. Method is concerned more with process than with the product. In the following, I'll compare the Electric Universe theory with a list of standards developed by B. J. F. Lonergan in his book, Insight. The Canon of Selection requires a theory to involve sensible, observable consequences. In accord with this, the data of the Electric Universe theory are the words, written and spoken, of the myths of all cultures, their ritual and cultural contexts, linguistic associations and etymologies, and the associated artistic expressions such as pictographs, ceramics and architecture. The Canon of Operations involves an accumulation of insights from observations, applications and experiments. The Electric Universe Theory verifies the existence of expected themes from one myth and culture to the next. It modifies the generalization of those themes by the comparative removal of local embellishments and addition of common elements. The Canon of Relevance is concerned with the intelligibility imminent in the data. The Electric Universe Theory derives its model from the structure of the common themes. The Canon of Parsimony - called Occam's Razor in its simplistic form - requires that nothing be added to the data, except the laws verified in the data. The Electric Universe Theory is limited to only the structure of common themes in the data. Note here that modifying the theory to make it compatible with theories of other disciplines, would be a violation of this Canon. Contrary to one’s first impulse that Occam's Razor requires cutting off those parts of the theory that are “added assumptions” to Currently Accepted Theory and instead requires strict independence from Currently Accepted Theory. The Canon of Completeness requires a theory to account for all the data. It's precisely the Electric Universe Theory’s method of comparing all the myths of all cultures, that reveals the common themes and their interdependent structure. The conclusion is that science says two things: as Currently Accepted Theory it says the Electric Universe Theory is next to impossible. But as method, it says the Electric Universe Theory is a viable and valuable insight that presents the opportunity of enlarging the insights of other disciplines. [Music] 
Welcome to the Electricity of Life, brought to you by the Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info In the 21st century, scientific discovery routinely forces a new perspective on the nature of reality, including physical phenomena at every scale in the cosmos. One of the strangest beliefs in cosmology is that celestial bodies exist in isolation, with no connection or influence on one another. However, today our most powerful telescopes reveal astonishing networks of plasma filaments which connect stars and galaxies across unfathomable distances. It's been said that no man is an island and likewise, in our Electric Universe, no islands exist in space. For generations, a similar strange belief about the human body has prevailed in the world of Western medicine. Specialization means treating each organ and part of the body as a separate isolated instrument and just as finer technological data reveals the connectedness of the most distant celestial objects, today, mainstream medicine increasingly recognizes the basis for a more integrative approach to human health. Just as an electrical circuitry connects distant celestial objects, the electrical circuitry of the body is a stupendous, complex network central to life. One of the leading pioneers in integrative health is Dr. Jerry Tennant, a world-renowned ophthalmologist whose book series ”Healing is Voltage” describes his groundbreaking research into the body's circuitry. Recently, Dr. Tennant offered a series of presentations as part of a continuing medical education class for Naturopathic Doctors in Arizona. Dr. Tennant and his group have kindly granted us permission to share these presentations in a series of videos. In this introductory episode, Dr. Tennant begins with a remarkable summary of his personal and professional journey. To further explore Dr. Tennant’s resources and materials, you may visit the links in the description box of this video. This is Dr. Jerry Tennant. I'd like to discuss with you some concepts about ”Healing is Voltage”. First of all, a Notice: Tennant Institute is a Private Expressive Association, as defined by law, and is under the direction of Jerry Tennant, MD, MD(H), PScD. This lecture is given under the auspices of my Arizona MD(H} license and Not my Texas MD license, partially with the support of a contribution by Synergy Medical Group. Participation in the seminar implies that the participant has given an acknowledgement of the rights noted above and others recognized by law, and asserts first, ninth and 14th Amendment rights. Participation means, “I voluntarily license Jerry Tennant, MD, MD(H), PScD to counsel me with his Arizona MD(H) license. Disclosure of Interest, I likely have a financial interest in patented and/or trademark devices and books that carry my name. The concepts presented here were contributed to by many people, including the staff of the Tennant institute, Dr. Steven Evans, Dr. Max Collins, Dr. Nathan Bryan, CareyLyn Carter, Leo Szymborski, Dr. Robert Gilbert, Dr. Richard Hull, Eileen McKusick, Dr. Dan Winter and Dr. Karim from Cairo, Egypt in bio geometry. So, I was trained as an ophthalmologist and had a great deal of enjoyment and fun, and in doing so I was able to do a lot of different things in ophthalmology but one of the things that I did was to do the majority of the research for the laser from the company called Visx used in Lasik surgery. So, as an ophthalmologist, I was able to accomplish many of the things that people strive to do. I was successful in my efforts as an ophthalmologist. I changed the way ophthalmology is practiced by introducing and helping to develop the techniques for outpatient eye surgery. I developed intraocular lenses that were widely used in eyes after cataract surgery, and one of the things that I was able to do was the majority, as I mentioned, of research for the laser used in Lasik surgery. So, one of the problems was that we didn't recognize that the laser wouldn't kill viruses, and so I treated a gentleman from Europe who had leukemia and also had scarring in his cornea, and I used the laser to carve the scar off his cornea. What we didn't understand at the time was that the laser would not kill viruses and as the viruses escaped his cornea, they went up through my mask, through my nose and into my brain, and I developed encephalitis. That resulted in me having overwhelming fatigue. I got to the place where I could see a patient, I knew what was wrong with him, but I couldn't remember how to write a prescription. Also, I developed spastic movements, which doesn't work really well if you're operating inside somebody's eyeball. And I came to the place that I could only have two or three hours a day in which I could think clearly enough to understand the newspaper. Otherwise, I spent about 16 hours a day sleeping. I also had a bleeding disorder and had some bleeding under my skin. If you'll notice the picture with the dogs, you'll see that I had viruses in my brain and viruses in my spleen, and these two dogs seem to understand where my problems were. So, the brown dog, Teager, would always come and lay on my head, and the Hawaii dog, Poo, would come and curl up next to my spleen. So, I always considered these two dogs the original bio modulators. So, as you can see in the image of me, I was robust and had a great life, but then slowly over time, as you can see, I began to fade away and where I was basically totally dysfunctional. I eventually figured out that the difference between peak performance and death was voltage. So, in the two or three hours a day I could think, I began to read cellular biology books with the concept that, if I could figure out how to one make one cell work, I could figure out how to make them all work. Because after all cells look different but they really have the same hardware, just different software. And in all of the cellular biology books I began to realize that cells had to have voltage to work. So, for a moment let's look at the concept of regeneration versus healing. If I cut myself with a knife, then the skin will heal, leaving behind perhaps a small scar. On the other hand, if I cut off a finger, but that finger actually regrows, then that's called regeneration. And regeneration is controlled by voltage. So, the purpose of this lecture, among others is to focus on the role of voltage in stem cell function, along with exosomes and recovery from chronic disease. This subject cannot be adequately covered in the few minutes we have allotted, but it is hoped that this lecture will focus your attention on its role so you will want to learn more. Now the foundation work of this subject was done by Robert Becker and by Dr. Bjorn Nordstrom. Becker wrote the book “The Body Electric”, Nordstrom wrote the book “Biologically Closed Electric Circuits”. So each of us, working in this field, are standing on the shoulders of these pioneers. So, in Becker's work, he was interested in the subject of, if a human loses a piece of bone, they grow more bone, but if they lose another body part, it's replaced with scar. And he wondered why that was. Why is it that the human can make bone, but has difficulty replacing other organs. So, to study this, he used the salamander. The salamander has essentially the same anatomy as the human, that is the same number of bones, muscles and nerves and in the same arrangement. But unlike the human, the salamander is capable of growing an exact replacement of an arm, leg, eye, ear, up to a third of its brain, almost all of its digestive tract and up to half of its heart. A salamander is so efficient at regeneration, that it does not get cancer. The regeneration of the salamander cannot be explained by chemical- mechanistic views of traditional medicine. So, Becker studied the salamander by studying its voltage patterns. So, he found that, if you cut off the salamander’s arm, then over the next days, it would actually grow a new arm. So, a salamander’s base voltage is minus 10 millivolts, compared to a human which is minus 25 millivolts, as we'll discuss later. As the arm is amputated, the voltage drops to approximately plus 25 millivolts of “electron stealer”. So again, it goes from minus 10 millivolts of electron donor, to plus 25 millivolts of electron stealer. Then, as the voltage begins to recover, and as it does so, it eventually gets up to minus 30 millivolts of electron donor. And as this occurs, then stem cells are formed and the salamander grows a new arm in somewhere around 25 to 30 days. Now, Becker found that, after you amputate the arm, the skin grows over the stump and then at somewhere around a week or so, stem cells begin to accumulate in the stump and by two weeks or so, there is a large number of stem cells. And then by three weeks, the arm is beginning to regrow and somewhere in the neighborhood of day 25 or so, the hand begins to form. Now, he found some other very interesting things. So, if he amputated the arm and waited until the stem cells formed and he extracted those and made an incision somewhere else in the body, the salamander would grow whatever the local area was. So, for example, if he amputated an arm, early on extracted the stem cells, made a slit by the salamander’s hind leg and put the stem cells in there, it would grow another hind leg from those stem cells. On the other hand, if he waited until the stem cells were more mature, before he extracted them, it was totally different. So, he amputated the arm, he waits till the stem cells are somewhat matured, extracts them, makes an incision on the top of the salamander’s head and puts them in there, the salamander will grow an arm at the top of his head. So, what became obvious is that early on, the stem cells had not been programmed into what they were to become, and wherever you put them, they would become or regenerate one of those body parts. On the other hand, if you left them a bit longer, they would be programmed to become what they were locally, and then when you extracted them and put them elsewhere, they would continue to grow that organ. Now, in the lower right picture, you see an image of a dog that was on the news recently, who had a tail growing out from between his eyebrows. And of course, they didn't seem to understand how this could happen, but looking at Becker's work, it's quite obvious. The stem cells from this dog's tail had been programmed to grow another tail, but somehow got moved and inserted between his eyes, and thus grew a tail there. In this image, we see an amputation of a salamander’s arm at 48 hours, and you can see the bone sticking out the end. You can see the skin and the muscles have retracted somewhat. Here at 18 days, you can see the stem cells that are quite prominent. This is a collection of stem cells that are called a blastema, and you can see, begin to see, the differentiation of the muscle cells. Here at 42 days, the limb pattern is completely restored and as the salamander continues to grow the new arm. Now, this is an image of a young boy who was a passenger on a four-wheeler; the driver of the four-wheeler turned it too sharply and actually caused the four-wheeler to roll, resulting in this injury. This boy was taken to the hospital, then taken to surgery and the wound was cleaned up. The surgeons felt that this was going to require attention by the plastic surgeons, and that perhaps that recovery would be difficult. I received a call from his father, and he sent me a picture that you saw. So, I quickly sent him a bio transducer and a bio modulator which, of course, that bio transducer puts out scalar energy and the bio modulator puts out electromagnetic energy. The boy had been crying constantly since his injury, in spite of the narcotics that they were giving him. Within minutes, after they placed the devices in this position as you can see, the boy quit crying. The following day, he was taken back to surgery and the plastic surgeon showed up. But the general surgeons were able to close this primarily without a skin graft. And the plastic surgeons were saying, “so, why are we here?” as they left the operating room. Well the picture on the right is a recent photograph of this boy's foot. You can see that it healed quite well. And this boy now can play soccer and football, and has no apparent symptoms that he ever had this injury. So, to some degree you will have to acknowledge that this was, in some regards, regeneration as well as improved healing, by restoring the voltage to the area. So, you must realize that the human body is an electronic device. Now, any cellular biology book will tell you that cells are designed to run at a pH of 7.35 to 7.45. pH is actually the measurement of voltage in a solution. So, if you have a copper wire, if the switch is on, electrons flow through it and if you turn the switch off, they do not. And that's called conductive electricity. But a liquid is completely different, and that is, a liquid has the ability to be either an electron donor, or an electron stealer. And so, if you take a pH meter, which is a type of sophisticated voltmeter, it has a switch in which you can measure in millivolts or you can measure in pH. So, by convention, if the liquid is an electron stealer, you put a plus sign in front of the voltage and if it's an electron donor, you put a minus sign in front of it and then you convert it to a logarithmic scale that goes from zero to 14. So, plus 400 millivolts of electron stealer is the same as a pH of 0, and minus 400 millivolts of electron donor is the same as a pH of 14. if it's neither electron donor nor an electron stealer, it's a pH of 7. Now, I mentioned that all cellular biology books will tell you that cells are designed to run at a pH of 7.35 to 7.45. So, 7.35 is synonym of -20 millivolts of electron donor, and 7.45 is synonym of  -25 millivolts of electron donor. So, what you see is that cells are designed to run between minus 20 and minus 25 millivolts. Now, some people get confused because, if you take a cell and put it into a petri dish, and put an electrode inside the cell, and another outside the cell, and measure the voltage across the cell membrane, you'll get about minus 90 millivolts. However the environment in which cells are designed to run, is between minus 20 and minus 25 millivolts. So, cells need minus 25 millivolts to run correctly, and minus 50 millivolts to make new cells. So, this leads us to understand that all chronic disease is characterized by having inadequate voltage. Let me say that one more time, all chronic disease is characterized by having inadequate voltage. Now, the other thing that's important to realize in understanding chronic disease, is that we're constantly wearing ourselves out and having to make new cells. So, different sources have slightly different times, because studies are based on tissue turnover time from natural stable isotope labeling, which varies according to bomb testing and other environmental factors. However, in general you will find that you get new cells in the macula of your eye every 48 hours; the lining of your guts is replaced every 3 days; your skin is 6 weeks old; your liver is 8 weeks old; your nervous system is between 8 and 12 months old, etc. So, what's critical to understand is that chronic disease only occurs when we lose the ability to make new cells that work. So, let me say that one more time: chronic disease only occurs when we lose the ability to make new cells that work. So what's it take to make new cells that work. Well, as I mentioned, cells run at minus 25 millivolts, but it requires minus 50 millivolts to make new cells. And as we also pointed out, if you measure across a cell membrane and a petri dish, you'll get about minus 90 millivolts. So, we need to make new cells, we need minus 50 millivolts, but we also need all of the materials that are necessary to make new cells. This is called “nutrition” and requires a functional digestive system, including stomach acid. And finally, we must deal with any toxins that destroy cells as fast as we make them. The most common toxins are heavy metals like mercury, dental toxins, GMO foods with pesticide, called Roundup or glyphosate. So, what's the body's voltage and wiring system? Well the body has five battery packs. The most important that are perhaps, or at least the largest, is our muscles. Our muscles are rechargeable batteries and the fascia around the muscles serves as the body's wiring system. Our cell membranes are small batteries called “capacitors”. Water inside the cell membrane is called EZ water, which is H3O2 - and it's an electron donor form of water. Inside the mitochondria we have a rechargeable battery system called “ADP/ATP” and then finally our DNA has its own battery, using scalar energy. So, this diagram was sent to me by Dr. Al-Tubaikh, who is also a medical artist and I'm grateful for his sending this to me. What one sees here, is that we have the muscle battery packs. So, one must understand that the muscles are piezoelectric. So, what does that funny word mean? If you take a piece of quartz and you squeeze it with a pair of pliers, it emits electrons. So, the process of distorting something and causing it to emit electrons, is called piezoelectricity. So, one of the reasons that we exercise, is that doing so causes the muscles to emit electrons. Our muscles are rechargeable batteries as well, and so every time we exercise, we are actually recharging our muscle battery packs. Now in addition, our muscles are stacked one on top of each other in a very specific order to create a battery pack. And it's that pack of our stack of muscle batteries is surrounded by a stocking of fascia and thus this stack of muscle batteries and fascia creates the muscle battery pack for every organ, that is to say, every organ in the body has its own battery pack, and such a pack of muscles is called an acupuncture meridian. Now, each acupuncture meridian extends from a leg to the brain, or an arm to the brain, and then makes a loop and comes back to near its origin. So, these large muscles then are acupuncture circuits, [they] are the major battery for all of our organs. Now, each of these circuits runs through very specific teeth and thus our teeth are an integrated part of every circuit. As the voltage from the muscle battery packs gets to the cell membranes, we have another battery pack here, or a battery that is called a capacitor, and that's the cell membrane. Now, if you take an electron conductor and a second electron conductor, and separate them by an insulator, you have what's called a capacitor. A capacitor is actually a type of small battery; the difference is that a regular battery can discharge electrons slowly, whereas if a capacitor is asked to deliver electrons, it empties itself and so it then has to recharge. Well, our cell membranes are made by opposing pairs of specific types of phospholipids, that have a ball on one end and two legs on the other. The balls are electron conductors and the legs are electron insulators and thus they form a capacitor. So, we have our muscle battery packs, then we have the cell membrane, which is a capacitor or a small battery, and just inside the cell membrane we have what's called EZ water, which I will explain more about in just a moment, and then we have our mitochondria. Now, inside the mitochondria we have a rechargeable battery system; when the battery's discharged, it's called ADP and when it's charged is called ATP. And then finally we have the DNA, which has its own power system in that scalar energy inflows into the center of the DNA to give it its voltage. So, here we see a diagram of the EZ water; EZ stands for “Exclusion Zone” and so, you can see in the upper image on the right, the EZ zone is thinner and if you expose it to specifically, infrared light, it expands into a larger battery pack, if you please. Next, we have the DNA battery. So, the characteristics of DNA was first elucidated by Rosalind Franklin in 1952. Her work was stolen by Watson and Crick and they received a Nobel Prize for the technology that they took from Dr. Franklin. Nevertheless, you can see on the left her original picture, photographing the DNA from within. Now most pictures of DNA that you see are from the side, but when you look at it from the end, you can see its torsional pattern and also the hole down through the center. So, scalar energy implodes down through this hole or canal in the center of DNA to energize it, because scalar energy will implode into anything that's golden mean, and certainly DNA is golden mean. Now, the scalar energy as it implodes into the DNA, is capable of reading the code there. It's capable of transmitting that code to a new cell, if a cell division occurs. It's also capable of communicating with nearby cells, through the use of the scalar energy. This work has been recently published by Konstantin Miele, a physician/ physicists in Germany. Now, let's look a bit at the voltage oxygen control mechanisms. So, if we look at the fetus, everyone understands that there is the umbilical cord that comes from mother, providing blood and nutrition to the growing fetus. But it's important to know that this umbilical cord also brings voltage into the fetus. Now, as you can see, the fetus has very little room for exercising inside the uterus, and thus the normal mechanism of charging our muscle battery packs is impractical in a fetus, that is in the process of growing its muscle battery packs and acupuncture wiring system, and there's just not room for that. Well, at the time of birth, a string is tied around the umbilical cord and it is cut, so that it leaves the new baby free from the umbilical cord. This then scars over on the end and becomes our umbilicus. Now, it's at this point when the umbilical cord is cut, that the baby switches from this fetal or original wiring system, to the muscle battery pack acupuncture system. Now, here you can see that surrounding the blood vessels, we have a fibrous sheath and this fibrous sheath, like the fascia, is capable of acting as a wiring system and moving electrons from place to place. So, one of the things you should remember is that around our blood vessels and also surrounding our muscle battery packs, we have this fibrous connective tissue. Around the muscle battery packs, it's called fascia and it has a different name around the the arteries and veins called tunica adventitia. An important thing to know is that these structures are semiconductors. So, what's a semiconductor? A semiconductor is a collection of molecules, arranged in such a way that electrons flow through them at the speed of light, but only in one direction. So, understanding that, helps us understand how the body can quickly move electrons from one place to the other. For example, if you put an essential oil on the foot, the frequencies of those are in the brain at the speed of light, because those frequencies travel through the fasciae which is a semiconductor. Now, in the fetus, as you can see, then we have this wiring system going to all of the organs and in this slide you can see how that works. So, it goes from the placenta through the umbilical cord, to basically every organ in the body, using the semiconductor of the tissue around the vessels. Now, because the umbilicus scars, where it was cut from the umbilical cord, it is blocked; electrons cannot flow through there. However if you simply put the bio transducer with its scalar energy over the umbilicus, what you will find is that it reorganizes the scar as we'll discuss later and once it does so, electrons can now flow through it, and so now we are capable of again using the original fetal wiring system. So, when you open this system, now you have access to that original wiring system that goes to every cell in the body. One of the reasons that this is important and useful, is that this system is rarely blocked, whereas muscle battery packs can be blocked by scars, dental infections, emotions, etc. [Music] 
Welcome to the Thunderbolts.info podcast for july 15, 2016. In the last two episodes, David Talbott, the director of the Thunderbolts project, has outlined the foundations of his working relationship with one of the world's leading plasma physicists, Dr. Anthony Peratt and the impact that this relationship had on Peratt's life work and career. As David described, Peratt's research proves undeniably that high energy plasma events occurred in the earthly sky within human memory and were recorded in rock art and cave drawings in various locations including the American Southwest. In this episode, David explorers, in greater depth, one of the most remarkable rock art motifs which has an explicit counterpart in laboratory experiments with plasma and that is the Stickman figure, carved on stone around the world. Evidence gathered from around the world has made abundantly clear that in ancient times intense electrical activity above observers on earth was the subject of massive collective endeavors to record the forms on stone. Especially compelling is the rock art theme called the Stickman. The illustrations shown here compare a well documented electric discharge form in the laboratory to the remarkably similar rock art carvings from different parts of the world. These rock art Stick-men are taken from Tony Peratt's 2003 paper in "Transactions on Plasma Science", published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. Peratt states his conclusion forthrightly. The recurring petroglyph patterns are reproductions of plasma phenomena in space. Of course the majority of rock art authorities, particularly those with primary interest in Native American sources, argue that only images of the Sun, Moon and stars reflect actual celestial phenomena. Apart from such associations most authorities claim that global patterns do not exist. Rather, they tell us, the ancient artists projected onto stone the subjective content of shamanistic trances. Peratt's investigation say the opposite, that the most fundamental patterns of rock art occur globally through massive labors, some apparently taking whole lifetimes, according to Peratt. The artists carved onto stone, observed electric discharge phenomena in the heavens. The stickman configuration occurs when a disc or donut like torus, around a linear discharge column, is bent by magnetic fields induced by intense current flow. From the viewpoint of the observer, the edges of the upper disk may appear to point up forming arms and those of the lower torus may appear to point down forming legs. The underlying hourglass pattern with many subtle variations not only occurs around the world, it is among the most fundamental forms appearing in highest energy electric discharge in the laboratory. To appreciate the evolution of the discharge configuration, these graphics must be visualized three-dimensionally. Illustrations show the structure of a translucent plasma discharge whose 3d configuration would not be self evident in a rendition carved on rock. Here is a key consideration, rotating the configuration on its axis would not change the basic form or appearance to the observer. Our idealization here of the dynamic geometry show slight variations between the upward pointing and downward pointing components, consistent with common variations in the laboratory and in rock art. The upper champagne glass form results from a distortion of a disk as the edges curve upward. In the warping of the disk below, the downward curvature is interrupted at the extremity which bends outward to create a squashed Bell appearance. The rock art images we've noted in this series are all characteristic of intense electric discharge in the laboratory. In the case at hand, the idealization of the hourglass discharge form, accents the visual relationship of the two symmetrical dots or circles to a transparent donut like torus - viewed edge on. But many other nuances of such discharge configurations must be taken into account since the warping of the upward and downward extremities of the hourglass form can occur in almost limitless variations. If Peratt's conclusions are correct, then several thousand years ago the terrestrial sky was ablaze with the electrical activity. The ramifications of this possibility will directly affect our understanding of cultural roots the world over. What was the impact of the recorded events on the early civilizations, what was the relationship to the origins of world mythology, to the birth of the early religions or to the massive ancient investments in monumental construction? Both the rock artists and the mythmakers had true perils on their minds. The rock artists recorded and the mythmakers interpreted electrical events in the sky as plasma discharge sequences moved through discreet phases, some of celestial beauty, others intensely violent and terrifying. The most essential issues concern the connectedness between seemingly different rock art themes. For example was there relationship between the Kayenta pictograph previously noted and the global Stickman image? Why is the Kayenta form more sparsely recorded than the worldwide Stickman archetype? There is good reason for this, according to Peratt. The Kayenta pictograph signifies a critical moment, just prior to a collapse of that more complex form into the simpler Stickman form. The synchrotron radiation proceeding that transition would have been deadly, making it close to impossible for humans to record the form while standing in the open. This means that the relationship between the two, never mentioned in Prior rock art studies, is crucial to an understanding of both global themes. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info Science news headlines around the world tell of a baffling mystery on the planet Mars. In March of 2012, amateur astronomers spotted enormous plumes jetting from the Martian surface. The plumes were more than 250 km high and several hundreds of kilometers in length. Similar bright, enormous plumes have occasionally been spotted on Mars since 1997. The lead author of a new paper in the journal Nature states, "At about 250 km, the division between the atmosphere and outer space is very thin, so the reported plumes are extremely unexpected." The ad hoc explanations scientists are grasping for are extremely limited. One suggestion is that frozen shards of carbon dioxide or water vapor somehow form the plumes. But as noted in a recent Scientific American article, their existence would require the atmosphere to be much colder than models predict for that altitude. Scientists have also suggested that the plumes may be a kind of Aurora similar to the Northern Lights on Earth. The Nature report states, "Mars does not have a global magnetic field, only pockets of magnetization. The mystery clouds were spotted over one of these so-called magnetic anomalies, and auroral lights have been observed there previously. However, to explain the 2012 observations, an aurora would have had to be 1,000 times brighter than the Northern Lights. This would require an increased flow of charged particles from the Sun, but its activity was not unusually high during the time." But there is another possibility that planetary scientists have yet to consider. For an important clue, let us go back to 2001, when Mars became engulfed in the greatest global dust storm ever observed on the planet. The giant Martian dust storms had already puzzled planetary scientists for decades. How can an atmosphere less than 1% as dense as Earth's remove dust from the soil and accelerate it into massive clouds circling the planet up to 40 miles or more above the surface? In late June, 2001, the Hubble telescope revealed the first stirrings of a dust storm. Within a few weeks, it had covered the entire planet. And the storm did not begin to subside until October. Scientists were left to ponder in vain. How is the dust excavated from the surface? What held the dust aloft? What accelerated the winds and dusts across the near vacuum of Mars's upper atmosphere to speeds greater than 250 miles per hour? Like the baffling Martian plumes, conventional planetary science offers no answers that withstand scrutiny. However, in 2005, The Thunderbolts Project offered a critical prediction about dramatic dust raising events on Mars. The article 'When Dust Storms Engulf Mars' states, "Since Mars has no thunderstorms to 'charge up its ionosphere,' it should present a good case study of the Electric Universe. The electrical model predicts that the Martian ionosphere is indeed charged, and it posits no isolated dynamo to 'separate charge.' On Mars, electrical effects will reach directly from the ionosphere to the surface without the ameliorating leakage via storm clouds that we see on Earth. Unlike radiant energy from the Sun, electrical energy can accumulate in the 'planetary capacitor' for some time, with a potential for planet-altering events when the atmosphere finally 'breaks down' and massive discharge activity is initiated." The Thunderbolts Project noted in 2005 that, when the greatest storm on Mars began in June of 2001, Mars had reached opposition and was the closest it had been to Earth in about 12 years. We then suggest it is not a coincidence that in March of 2012, just days before scientists spotted the enormous baffling Martian plumes, Mars was again at opposition and was at its closest proximity to Earth in over two years. The Martian plumes resembled the fountains of electrostatically levitated dust hundreds of kilometers tall, first observed on the moon in the 1960s. Indeed, according to a 2008 NASA report, Earth's magnetic tail creates a powerful electric field near the lunar surface occasionally causing dust storms on the Moon. NASA scientist Tim Stubbs states, "Earth's magnetotail extends well beyond the orbit of the Moon and, once a month, the Moon orbits through it. This can have consequences ranging from lunar 'dust storms' to electrostatic discharges." We also note that NASA scientists have acknowledged the electrified nature of the giant Martian dust devils. A NASA news report in July of 2005 begins, When humans visit Mars, we'll have to watch out for towering electrified dust devils. The article describes a typical dust devil on Mars as a 'monster column' towering kilometers high and hundreds of meters wide, ten times larger than any tornado on Earth. For decades, physicist Wal Thornhill and others have proposed that dust devils, tornadoes and water spouts are all electric discharge phenomena. We must also note that we cannot say definitively at this point that the Martian plumes are composed of excavated dust. However, planetary scientists must not ignore the proven ability of electric fields to levitate dust in a near vacuum like the Martian atmosphere. We cannot emphasize enough that scientists are just beginning to recognize the extraordinary electrical environment of Earth and of all planets and moons. In 2012, scientists around the world were astonished by the discovery of giant electric fields in Earth's radiation belts, some more than 1 million volts strong. Structures familiar to plasma physicists called double layers in the outer belts are said to be powerful enough to accelerate electrons to near the speed of light. With each new discovery, planetary scientists move closer to recognizing the electrical circuitry between planets, moons and the Sun. The electric currents that connect Jupiter and Saturn to their respective moons are now acknowledged by NASA scientists. It is therefore no coincidence that the so- called 'volcanic plumes' of the Jovian moon Io, and the so called 'geysers' of the Saturnian moon Enceladus, closely resemble the baffling Martian plumes. The Electric Universe does not call for rewriting the known laws of physics. Rather, we need only acknowledge the undeniable significance of electricity in our lives and in all of nature. We again remind scientists that all matter is electrical, and it is electrical connectedness that drives the universe.

Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info In part two of this presentation, physicist Wal Thornhill continues his discussion of the recent discovery of the so-called shocking electric wind at the planet Venus. As described in the previous episode, the electric wind is said to be sufficiently strong that it can strip an entire planet of all its water components. The co-author of a study on the Discovery said of these findings, "It's amazing and shocking. We never dreamt an electric wind can be so powerful that it can suck oxygen right out of an atmosphere into space. This is something that has to be on the checklist when we go looking for habitable planets around other stars." But as Wal Thornhill explains, neither this nor countless other surprising discoveries has freed planetary scientists from their ideas about the history of the solar system, including the notions of how life arose on Earth and could arise on other planets. I answered in detail in June 2004 the question, why doesn't Venus have much water, in my article - Cassini's homecoming. It was written to coincide with that amazing spacecrafts' arrival at the rings-giant Saturn. The simple answer is that Venus hasn't been around long enough to lose an ocean of water so its puzzling heavy carbon dioxide atmosphere requires a very different explanation. Likewise, it is nowhere admitted that, according to the standard model, the Earth should not have oceans of water either, because hydrogen would have been blown out of the inner Solar System early in the Sun's assumed career. However, all observations in the Space Age saw the Solar System to be a blended family of odd bodies, each with their own story. Nothing is to be gained by trying to force fit them to a centuries-old evolution-in-place theory, with all of the hypothetical collisional drama occurring billions of years ago. That might make us feel safe, but it has nothing to do with science! Meanwhile, gravitational systems as presently understood, are inherently unstable. Something is seriously wrong! So, back to these electric winds, stripping planets of oceans and atmospheres. Velikovsky's identification of Venus as an electrically discharging comet was spot on. The problem of how comet that size can end up in the most circular orbit of any of the planets, has had to wait for the electric universe explanation of the electrical nature of mass and gravity. It provides the essential feedback mechanism to establish and maintain clockwork stability. As a comet, Venus was discharging massively as a cathode in the solar discharge and swiftly circularizing its orbit. As a planet, Venus still discharges five times more strongly than the Earth. The electrons leaving Venus drag along positive oxygen ions to a degree that was unexpected. But the euphemism "electric wind" means an electric discharge, like an air ionizer. It's an electric current. This is confirmed by the twisted magnetic flux ropes, known more correctly as Birkeland currents by plasma physicists, identified in the cometary tail of Venus. That tail still stretches to tickle the Earth at inferior conjunction. That's a mechanism that determines the spacing of orbits. It's true that this gradual loss of atmosphere and water over eons poses a problem for life on earth-like planets. It shows the folly of assuming, in typical geocentric fashion, that life in the Universe is to be found in a narrow Goldilocks zone about a bright star. It's not a good situation to be in, either for the establishment of life or its long-term survival. The electric universe shows instead that all stars are a form of low pressure electrical gas discharge phenomenon in a galactic circuit. Red stars of all sizes are those that have expanded their glowing plasma sheaths, in order to collect enough electrons from the interstellar plasma to satisfy their discharge requirements. That's why red giants are observed to expand and contract in response to changes in their electrical environment. But it's inside the glowing red spheres of brown dwarf stars that orbiting satellites find conditions best suited for life! Every square meter of each satellite's surface receives the same radiant energy, there are no seasons. Most significantly recent observations show, water and other molecules necessary for life are found in the spectra of brown dwarfs, and those molecules will mist down on the satellites, establishing oceans and atmospheres. Significantly, ferns are adapted to misting rain, and red light is the most conducive to photosynthesis. And water which is essential to life, is activated electrically by infrared light or warmth. So, it makes sense that brown dwarfs should be considered as the most likely candidates for cosmic wombs, not bright stars like the Sun. This raises many issues in the search for life elsewhere in the Universe. Perhaps most important is that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence or SETI is doomed to failure because radio waves cannot penetrate the glowing plasma shell of a red star. And the chances of intelligent life, happening to survive, being torn from its brown dwarf womb in a capture event, like that suffered by the Earth and Mars, seems remote. In fact, Mars stands as mute testimony to the devastation that we narrowly avoided. It is our closest relative in the Solar System and shared the same cosmic womb. This much is made remarkably clear by applying a forensic approach to all of the evidence available from human observations of the skies over millennia. Of course, none of this information is deducible from the narrow deductive perspective of a modern cosmology, which has no interest in history and denies any electrical involvement in the celestial mechanism. Thankfully, in this age of instant global communication, we may not have to wait centuries for a paradigm shift.

Cosmic Power Lines Part 1 Now the gentlemen that set this up have done a marvelous job. I told them they have built us a 747 here with these screens and a lot of controls in front of me. You should all come up and look at this before you leave. And I said I would be happy if I could get this damn 747 off the runway. Anyway, thank you very much and good evening. It's a pleasure to be here and thank you for paying me the honor of wanting to hear what I have to say. The topic of course, is the cosmic power grid and what it consists of is some updates about Birkeland currents, where they go what they do? Those of you who have been to this conference before perhaps heard me speak on this very topic. And one of the nice things about the area that I'm in; which is this idea of electricity in the sky and that sort of, the electric universe and so on, okay, thank you; is that new stuff keeps coming along all the time. And I'm very happy. Between the last workshop that we had here in this in this hotel I think and then the previous conference in Albuquerque, some very new and I think very, from our point of view, encouraging data has come back about this very topic, the Birkeland current. What is a Birkeland current then, who was Birkeland? Well, let me very quickly get by that because I know that some of you have heard this story, have been to these conferences perhaps longer than I've been coming to them, oh I doubt that but... beard beard, you know, anyway. The newcomers might like to know just a little bit about the background of this so... For you all folks, I don't mean that by age, you veteran attenders take it as a refresher course, ok? Birkeland current you can think of as a pipeline in the sky. It's not an oil pipeline, it's not a water pipeline, it's an electrical current pipeline, it carries charge and carries charged particles and it can carry them in both directions and it consists... Well, we'll talk a little bit in detail about what it it consists of and what its structure is. And I was very happy to, in the last April this, couple of months ago, to get a paper published about this topic. And this, I'm saying this not just to brag about getting the paper published but to make a comment about the status of science these days. You perhaps have heard us complain and moan, people like me, others that you will hear at this conference, about how difficult it is to get anything published from here, from the Electric Universe. Oh it's those guys, there are the fringe scientists. And so if you say anything that anybody in mainstream science doesn't completely agree with, you're out of there, it's not going to be published. So I submitted this paper to a very well-known journal but, if you want to know I'll slip it to you later, but they turned it down! Cold! For the wrong reasons. The guy who did the review, who sent me the negative review didn't understand what I was saying and he was absolutely wrong! So I finally found through the good offices of a couple of friends of mine this other journal and they did publish it. And there is, if you want to see the article itself, on the bottom there is, it's a pretty big long URL but I think you can get to it just by putting in your browser - progress in physics and that'll give you the magazine, the journal page and look for the April issue and you can see all the great gory details in there. But anyway, well, I'll talk some more about what that paper says and what it means as the talk goes on. But I always have to, and every time I'd give a talk here I have to say this because it stabbed me in the heart so much that I need to have a catharsis I guess, at your folks expense. That is, some things never changed in this world, it seems like. The people who talk about black holes, dark energy, missing neutrinos, missing that, neutron stars, all of which are blatantly impossible, call us the fringe scientists. When they don't believe that a fellow by name James Clark Maxwell ever lived or that a fellow by the name of Langmuir ever won the Nobel Prize or Hannes Alfvén who won the Nobel Prize and it's his, those people's principles that we use. We use all of the tools in the toolbox, they ignore the electrical half! They're fine with thermodynamics and fluid dynamics but they don't, they don't take advantage of what we do. And so therefore we can get some answers and I hope to show you some of those answers tonight. But our detractors seem to keep getting promoted, I have a sort of a joke here. I'm not getting through, hello! Okay, sorry for the interruption. The joke on here is that a fellow, who's a very well-known astronomer; he is now the head of a very prestigious astronomical organization in this country and perhaps in the world; said this: "Yes, yes. We know there are electrical currents in space, but they don't DO ANYTHING." Well okay, I had his picture and I was going to put his actual picture on here but I thought I didn't want to get sued so I would put that on and said. Anyway down to business. The paper that I'm going to talk to you a little bit about derives the mathematical equations that constitute a model of a Birkeland current. And when I say a model, that's a meaningful thing. Engineers like me very often build models of things, mathematical models, will come up with an equation and we try to make those equations mimic what we see. I mean, science is really making observations and fitting some theory to those observations and then later testing those theories and see if they pass the tests of time and whatever you want to do to test them out. Some people think that they are not making models but they are actually discovering the equations by which the world works. By which the universe works. They want to discover the equations God used when he made thing. Engineers are less ... aggressive than that. We want to just model, we want to come up with something that works, kind of like the way the real thing does and the closer we can make it work the happier we are. So that's what's the difference between being, I guess, a cosmologist who wants to know how does it work and us who say, we just want to make a model. So for example, the model can be, this model that I developed and can be or, I should say, be very careful to say that the original model, the original equations were discovered back in 1950 but the guy just wrote down a couple of lines and took off. He did write, he did show this diagram, that curlicue diagram on the left of which, sort of, shows what the Birkeland current looks like. It's a curlicue, a helix of current and magnetic field, parallel if you will. I know there's some EE's in the audience and you usually don't think about currents and magnetic fields being in parallel, you usually think of them as being at right angles to each other. But if you can get them to relax, they will actually line up and those of you who know what I'm talking about, the Lorentz forces between them, their tendency to push each other back and forth, goes away. If you can get them to line up and so there's a thing called a "Force Free Field Aligned Current. And that's a picture of it, that barber's pole there on the left or on the right. The difference between the two is of course size, that's all there is. And so in this model there is a scale factor, in all models there are scale factors. If you build a model of a ship or model of an airplane or think about a map, a map is a model of reality. If you draw a topographical map of a mountain, that's a model of the mountain, as you see, the topographical contours. You can see exactly where the mountain is higher, steepest, less steep or whatever. But I think sometimes scientists, especially cosmologists, mistake the mountain for the map with a map for the mountain and forget about the fact that they are two different things. So what we have here is a model of the way the Birkeland current works. I contend! And the scale factor maybe seems to be, you know, not important but it is. For one, it's what got my paper rejected the first time. Because you're gonna ... scale factor. It's a property of the plasma and you don't have any idea what it is. My answer of course is yes, it's a scale factor and I, the model builder can tell you what it's going to be. You want it to be seven, make it seven. And it's not like the permittivity or permeability, something that comes to you through what is nature but it's just a scale factor so you can make the size of this thing bigger or smaller. Anyway there's the journal. That's the April issue. And the reason I show it to you is, I don't know if you can read the small writing there at the bottom. Let me see if I can read it. It says; "All scientists shall have the right to present their scientific research results, in whole or in part, at relevant scientific conferences, and to publish the same in printed scientific journals, electronic archives, and any other media." And this is from the Declaration of Academic Freedom. To which, I think, the editor of this journal actually wrote. And so, I think that's a step forward in and of itself regardless of whether they publish my paper or not. That's a breakthrough. No longer do people like me and people who are called fringe scientists, we're going to resent that totally but of course. We don't have to be under the heel, under the boot, the jackboot of, "do you please the powers that be or not?" These, I know for sure that a couple of my friends, and you will hear from them later, or they're in here, Pierre Marie Robitaille and Stephen Crothers also have a paper in that same issue. And I know for certain that there is disagreement, I won't say between whom and whom, but as to what they think is right. But they got their paper published, I got my paper published and the editor honors that there may be differences of opinion. But he's still going to publish it and I think that's a real breakthrough. It may be a subtle thing, a subtle thing for people to understand but I think it really is. Anyway, my contention is that some scientists refuse to see analogies. I'm a big analogy, you know if you know how it works in this state, in this area, in this milieu, maybe it works the same way in this thing over here. If you know how that... How that building is constructed and how it stands against 100 hundred mile an hour winds maybe you can build your whatever, in the same, using the same principles and have it be stronger too. To see analogies across fields, I think is a very important thing. The analogy that I'm really talking about is the, well, that's obviously the aurora borealis. The aurora australis looks the same. And what you're looking at there is the business end of a Birkeland current. And if I can describe it to you which i think is very apparent, I think you would say the same thing if I asked you to describe it to me. It's a concentric, a collection of concentric hollow cylinders that contain filaments that transport stuff. In this case the stuff is electric charge. It looks as though they possibly might be some spiraling going on there and it looks also that the center of the thing is fairly solid. ... that's the way a Birkeland current works and that's the way the model that I... Well, I should say finished the derivation of, predicts that the thing should work. Well okay, if a long time ago we found out that this fellow Birkeland, after whom these things are named, was right! He contended that the energy for, to power the aurora was coming from outer space. He said from the Sun. I would modify that slightly and say, from the neighborhood of the Sun and that we receive energy, electrical energy into our North Pole and that's how the auroras are present. Well we know other planets have auroras as well. But you never hear these people, astrophysicists, saying that, "Oh yes, we know there are Birkeland currents going into the North Pole of Saturn." or into the North Pole of Jupiter or North Pole of whatever. We know there are aurorae there but we're not going to use the word Birkeland. I don't know why. I think that's, I don't know... Maybe it's because they, they're ashamed of how they treated Birkeland. They essentially told him he was a lunatic. The poor man died in 1917 and it wasn't until after the end of World War II when we sent Rockets up into this area that we found out he was right! Not just a little bit right, he was a 100% right! So Birkeland Currents are named Birkeland Currents for a good reason. The topic, I guess, but the property that is most important at least for our purposes here this evening, is this idea of counter rotation. That the Birkeland Current, if you want to think about it, is like a bunch of concentric pipes. Start off with a rod in the middle, put a pipe around it and then put a bigger pipe around that and then a bigger pipe around that and keep doing that until you could run out of pipes. And the answer is, of course, until you run out of charge that wants to be transported by this mechanism. And each of those pipes counter rotates. You pick out one, the one above it and the one below it is going in the opposite direction. That's what I mean by counter rotation. That's what the model says! Now the question is, do Birkeland currents really work that way? Well those of you who were here, I guess at the last one or two meetings, I forget which one it was, I showed the picture, know that that's true, we can we've seen that in one specific case. But there is what the model comes up with. And it might be. Let's see if I can make the 747 get off the runway here. Yes, look at that! Oh well, like I have a pointer. Do you can see these dark, the black lines, the outer one here? You can see that the circles there, the black circles with arrow heads showing the counter rotation. Those black circles that are counter-rotating are the current and the magnetic field of the Birkeland current. The salmon-colored rings are not really, they don't really occur in a Birkeland current in free space but they do when you jam that Birkeland current down into the North Pole of the earth, you've all seen what the magnetosphere looks like, it's like a funnel. Because the magnetosphere is like this big fat doughnut with the earth in the middle of it and the current comes down and as it comes down closer and closer to Earth gets squeezed into narrow or narrower diameters. The same amount of current with less area means the current density increases. And so when the current density increases you get this, those salmon colored rings are concentrations of matter. And matter concentrates into also, not the same concentric rings because you can see that salmon coloured rings are, there are fewer of them, then there are white more widely spaced than the black ones which are, the black ones are the magnetic field and the current density. But anyway, that is the main property that I would like to get across. This counter rotation of the of the Birkeland current is very important. I'd like to change the next slide but I can't do it. Very good, okay thank you. There is a picture, taken by Dr. Tony Peratt in Los Alamos Nuclear Laboratory, of one of these Birkeland currents that he shot into what's called a witness plate and so you can see exactly or pretty exactly what I'm talking about. There is the slight spiraling look, there are certainly that center is sort of a solid core and then there are these rings going outward. One of the properties of plasma is that it breaks up into filaments. And so what we've got on the outside, and if I could have my pointer I would show you what I can't. See those dots around the outside, those are filaments of plasma. And Peratt has drawn a circle of little dots to delineate where the, at least the theoretical filaments should be. Keep this picture in the back of your mind because we're gonna see something that looks exactly like that. Okay, next slide please. That's a picture of Saturn's North Pole and it was the famous, not hurricane but the hexagon is actually there. And okay, thank you, all right so. This is certainly true, everyone was so surprised about the hexagon shape, the question about if these things counter rotate or not was never really asked. There's, wow, a hexagon up there! Why is there a hexagon? That was all over the press for a couple of years. But of course I'm asking the question, are those rings going in the opposite directions from one to another? And okay, well let's go, let's go with this. This is a NASA video [Video] Cassini has been in orbit around Saturn for 9 years and we've been following this hexagon which surrounds the North Pole. It's bigger than two Earths and it's a wandering jetstream. But it's been winter in the north so we have not been able to see what's at the center of the hexagon. But now it's spring! And what we've found at the center of the hexagon is a Saturn hurricane. This is a view from directly over the North Pole which is made possible ... [Donald] You see the counterrotation. Again if I could point, you can see the whitest ring from the outside, you can see those set of elypses, those are called diocotron instabilities and they happen in plasma and in any hydraulic fluids when their shear. And so, perfectly in the upper left-hand corner, you see those curlicue things? Those are diocotron instabilities. And it shows that what's to the inside of that and and what's to the outside of that are at least traveling at very different velocities and probably counter-rotating. Go ahead, turn up the volume. I don't know if you can hear what he said. He said that the hurricane is anchored to the North Pole and it's been there as long as we've been able to observe it and he's worried about the fact that a hurricane is never anchored to anything, it moves. And the other thing about a hurricane, on Earth at least, is it has a warm ocean. You know, when a hurricane gets all over land it breaks up because it loses its heat energy from the warm water and all look for any warm water on Saturn. So they are very mystified by this and I'm not at all mystified by this. You folks can see that diagram. This is from a paper that was published just earlier this year. The question was, are there actually counter rotational winds? And if you look very carefully, at A is the North Pole and B is the South Pole so there's no hexagon on the South Pole but there is certainly on the North Pole. And the, you can look at the velocity, it's way on the left-hand side, you can see zero is sort of at the junction between the blue and the turquoise and one is positive one ... is negative. It means it's going in opposite directions. So between blue and turquoise ther's a shear. And they quote that this, in this paper that yes, there is indeed counter-rotation on Saturn. How about Jupiter? Well, from the looks of this it looks as if there's a hexagon on Jupiter too maybe. I don't think so. But I think the guy who drew the hexagon has a little wishful thinking but we don't know. And does Jupter have a hexagon, I'm not sure, right? My vote would be no because from what I'm going to show you it doesn't look like there's a hexagon there. But does it have a counter rotational kind of a thing happening? Do these cloud belts counter rotate as the ones on Saturn do? Well, nobody knew for years. And this came out after my last lecture. About two days after I got home, bingo! This comes out from NASA. And why so late? Why so late? You know, anyway. There's a picture of Jupiter's North Pole. And actually, well, I won't hold you in a suspense. Do you see any counter rotation? I sat there for about 20 minutes and tried to count the rings and I counted 15 different counter rotating cylinders. And the, you can see going around about oh, I don't know, maybe, what, three quarters of the way out you can see there's a real steady progression of those little black dots. I think those are probably Tony Peratt's filaments, that he has in those circles that he drew around his witness plate. But this is on an endless loop now, you can sit here and watch it all night if you want to but... I just, and again look at, look on the upper right-hand corner, right there you see? Those, all those diocotron instabilities. So you can definitely see that there's a shear going on there. So is there counter rotation on Jupiter? Yeah, you bet there is. How about Uranus, well, Uranus is a crazy animal. You folks probably know about the Uranus is actually lying over on its side, more than 90 degrees over. So if you point that, to see going out to the left there, there's a vector to the Sun. So when this was drawn, it was Summer at the north pole of Uranus. And the spin axis is pointing downward. The magnetic field axis, the axis of its magnetosphere is 59 degrees farther down than that. This thing is really screwed up. But the question is, does it have an aurora? Yes, yes, it does. Where is the aurora? Is it on the geographic pole, the spin axis? Does it depend on what parts pointed at the Sun or does it depend on the magnetic axis? The magnetic axis. So the aurora on any planet is due to the magnetic field, is due to the Birkeland current coming in to the magnetosphere of that current, of that planet. Some of you've seen that diagram before, we're not sure about Mercury because Mercury doesn't even have, it's got like a 1% of the magnetic field of Earth. And does it have enough of a magnetic field to actually cause a Birkeland current to go down there into the North Pole? I don't know. There's some doubt about it. But boy, it sure looks like there's been some action at Mercury's North Pole. And maybe in an earlier geologic period there was a magnetic field. Who knows, we don't know now. There's some new, new to me at least, apparently if you look at the second line there, these stable auroral red auroras have been known for about 50 years but they, there's, they're will o' the wisp because they're always, sort of, in daylight and they're always so far south that you don't see them very much and there's city lights down here and along the northern axis, northern border of the United States. But wouldn't it be nice if what I'm saying is right and the Birkeland currents are indeed symmetrically placed concentric hollow cylinders. Maybe these SAR auroras are due to the second, the second column out there, the second cylinder, the real Aurora's are due to the inner one, up on the North Pole which is not shown in this diagram. We're up nearer to the north, nearer to the North Magnetic Pole. Don't know. Neptune, some of you have seen that one already. There's a hotspot at Neptune's South Pole. You think about it, the South Pole! South Pole is the hot spot of the planet?! Well, there's a possibility that it's getting a real powerful electric current in there and that's what's heating up that particular spot on Neptune to be the hottest spot on the planet. Okay, we're down to the punchline. The latest piece of evidence that I've managed to accumulate is... Well, I'll show it to you in a minute. But let me make a sort of a slight aside and say a couple of things. I made an assertion in my paper, back a couple of months ago, that the Bessel function model of a Birkeland current specifies that these currents are composed mainly of hollow, concentric, counter-rotating, cylindrical, sheets of current. And I think I've showed that to you. I hope I have. I think this is the first time anyone has made that statement. But I'm gun-shy because when I did the, my derivation of this model I didn't know that Stig Lundquist had come up with the form of the solution about 50 years ago. Nobody else had talked about it, Tony Peratt never talked about it in his book. And so I completely was blindsided and I don't want to be blindsided again. So if anybody knows of anybody else, any other investigator other than me that has said that Birkeland currents consist of counter-rotating concentric cylinders of current density and parallel magnetic fields, I want to hear about it. Until that time I claim the... You know, it's like the explorer who crawls across and plants the flag on the island. I may be wrong, I may be very disappointed to find out that yes yes Rick Dicksmutnitz back in 1420 came up with this idea. But I hope, maybe it's my contribution. I hope it is anyway. Anyway, what I have to show you now is a picture, very mundane picture taken here on earth by a spectacularly good photographer of the Northern Lights and he did a video of the aurora borealis and he did it from a fixed super high-resolution camera on a fixed tripod and just let it rip. And I want to see if you think he captured any counter-rotation, okay? This is Caithness on the northern end of Scotland, right below Scapa Flow with the English naval bases. His name is Maciej Winiarczyk. See the inner one moving right to left? Is there counterrotation, uh, that's hard to say. The red is oxygen, the green is nitrogen. That's the whole "business end" of a Birkeland Current. That's, of course, the edge of it. ... over on the left This is sort of a picture of a train wreck if you start to think about it. This is the end of the Birkeland current ... that smashes into, into the earth. So yes, there's shattering and it takes a while for that form to come back again. There you can see, I think, some counter-rotation. The inner green one is moving well, who knows. Some people see these black stripes on a zebra, other people see white stripes It looks like MacDuff's Castle. Yeah, there's a more, I think that you can see counter-rotation there. The very last scene I defy anybody not to see counter-rotation and I'll tell you when it... not quite here. You can see stuff, some stuff going one way, some another. This one! See the one in the, in the distance, it seems to me is going left to right, the one up on top here, the fuzzy ones are moving right to left. Those are just clouds, don't worry about the clouds. Did you, did you see the counter rotation? I don't know, it's hard to see whether it's there or not. It's, how, I've lost my clock, I don't know what time it is... How, do we have two minutes to run that? Okay, why don't you run that video one more time and we can see, sit back, get a glass of wine and see. He has released this, by the way, to the public for educational purposes. Up on the left, it's coming at you. I think that's some obvious counter-rotation in there, left to right. Way over on the left not to take care of those here's the Pleiades and the constellation of Taurus. Taurus the Bull, there's Aldebaran see the ... ? There's the one that seems to be in the far distance, it's moving left to right and up here near us at the top it's moving right to left. I think that's pretty obvious there. But that's me. Maybe other people can say, I don't see that, oh. I don't know. Anyway, that's, that is the latest piece of evidence and there are all sorts of folks now taking time-lapse photography those were, ... time-lapse to get it to speed up. There are some videos available that are just in real time, not time-lapsed and you can still see the movement. And it's, as one and particularly taken from Yellowknife up in Canada that I think is almost as good as this but not quite. This is the best one I've been able to find. Anyway, just one last kind of piece of evidence, if you guys heard of the what do they call it, the Blue Eye of the Desert and the Richat Structure It's in the Sahara Desert, it's about 30 miles in diameter, the rings are spaced equidistantly from each other. That's a Bes... anybody who knows anything about Bessel functions realize that the zeroes are all equally spaced. And I'll talk more about that in my next talk but... Well, how Bessel functions are important but forget the math. The surface altitude is higher toward the center. And there's what it looks like. If that doesn't look like a Birkeland current... And they're all, it's about 30 miles across there. Anyway that's, it's another example so I'm concluding by saying, I think we've seen several planets have auroras that are likely created by Birkeland currents. The Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and possibly Mercury and Neptune, who knows. (It will) be interesting to see what they find in Pluto next month. If they take any measurements of that at all. And we now have evidence of concentric counter rotation as predicted by the Bessel function that is the Lundquist model on three of them that is Saturn, Jupiter and Earth. So how about the Sun? Is there a Birkeland current coming down into the Sun? Well, tune in tomorrow, I'll be back again. Thunderbolts.info 
All right good afternoon and thank you too for Dave Talbott and the rest of the team for making this conference happen, and for inviting me to speak here today. It's certainly an honor to be here has a long-standing supporter of the Thunderbolts project, and plasma universe generally, and I'm hoping that what I will say today will be able to make a contribution to the ongoing development of the electric universe model which Wal Thornhill and Monte Childs referred to this morning. So here we go as we've seen, the electrical nature of the Sun is not in doubt. But I would suggest that some of the recent evidence doesn't seem to fit our current model. I want to look at this anomalous evidence, and speculate on possible changes to the model to account for it. The basis of the EU model is the work of Hannes Alfven and Ralf Juergens who both argued that electric currents are important in the solar system, but they both had differing views on where those currents flow. Alfvén  suggested that the Heliospheric current sheet is part of a circuit in the heliosphere. Near the Sun the current splits into north and south components, which then flow along the meridians towards the poles of the Sun. Birkeland currents then flow from each pole, and the Alfvén circuit closes at some unspecified distance from the Sun. The important thing is that Alfvén's current does not enter or leave the photosphere and the direction of the current changes in alternate solar cycles. In contrast, Juergens argued that the photosphere is a region of anode tufting and therefore current must always be flowing through the photosphere into the body of the Sun, which he identified as the anode. By ecquating the sun's radiant output to the electrical power, and assuming a driving potential of ten billion volts. Juergens calculated that the inflowing current is around four times ten to the 16 amps and according to this model, the anode sun receives charge which will tend to neutralize it. A potential of 10 billion volts, if it was on the surface of the Sun, equates to a minimum charge of about three-quarters of a billion coulombs on the Sun itself, which is a very large charge to have accumulated, but it's tiny compared to the inflowing current. And that means the Sun would be discharged in a very short time. Now Juergens recognize this, and originally postulated that the galaxy's potential kept changing to maintain the voltage differential between the anode Sun and the galaxy. But by 1979 Juergens and Earle Milton between them had developed a different model in which electrons are simultaneously flowing in through the tufts in the photosphere and out again between them. But they still recognized that you had to deal with this question of how the Sun doesn't get discharged. The current EU model modifies that again, and we now assume that the inflowing electron current is balanced by positive discharges from the coronal torus to the photosphere. And as Wal Thornhill said this morning, these discharges appear as sunspots in the photosphere. In the heliosphere, the inflowing electron current powering the Sun is assumed to drift slowly towards the Sun under the influence of a very low electric field, like the current in a Crookes tube. (And a Crooks tube is a device for studying electricity and plasma in the lab.) In the revised Juergens model the heliopause is assumed to be a virtual cathode where most of the voltage drop occurs. Now there seemed to me to be two questions relating to this model. The first question is how we reconcile of Juergens' and Alfvén's circuits. One involves a current flowing in through the photosphere, and the other does not. So, Don Scott's diagram, which we saw earlier, combines the two ideas, and shows the Alfven current entering the photosphere at the poles, and leaving at the equator. Therefore, given that the photosphere is presumed to be a region of anode tufting, one region should show anode tufting, where the electron current enters, but the other region should not. But what I find puzzling is that the photosphere completely encircles the Sun. There doesn't appear to be any difference between the polar regions and the equatorial regions, suggesting that the current doesn't enter the photosphere and leave the photosphere in quite the way the diagram suggests. So that's one puzzle. The second question is, whether the evidence supports the model and as I said, some of it seems to contradict Juergens' anode sun. And I want to focus on that first. We've seen that the balancing positive charge is apparently delivered from the coronal torus, and creates sunspots as it punches through the photosphere. But there's a puzzle here too. The torus forms at solar minimum, when there are no sunspots, and disappears at solar maximum as we see on the right, where sunspots are the most numerous. Now these two diagrams I'm showing you, here are both looking in the equatorial plane, so they're not the same views as we saw this morning, where the the encircling photosphere /coronal torus diagram was a view from the poles. These are both photographs taken from the earth, so they're in the equatorial plane. The one on the left is at sunspot minimum and the one on the right is at sunspot maximum. So the torus comes and goes with the cycle. And the model that suggests that the sunspots are caused by discharges from the torus is out of step with when the torus is actually there. Now another problem is that the source of the balancing positive charge isn't explained. Presumably protons must come in from intergalactic space along with the electrons, otherwise the heliosphere would become negatively charged. But protons entering the heliosphere seem to contradict the anode model. If we now turn to the evidence for the Juergens drift currents, to get a current at all, there needs to be an electron drift relative to the positive ions, and we can estimate the relative velocity of the electrons from their known density and the current we need to generate. Now if all of the electrons present at 1 AU radius - that's the radius of the Earth's orbit - if all of the electrons are drifting slowly towards the Sun, they've got to have an average drift velocity of 350 kilometers a second to generate the current. And that's almost the speed of the slow solar wind away from the Sun. Now I would have thought that velocity should be obvious in the spacecraft data but it's very difficult to find it in the published papers. The measured data seem to indicate that both the protons and the electrons in the solar wind receive additional energy as they get further from the Sun. They're always getting faster. So the protons are behaving as expected, but not the electrons. And we'll look at one or two examples from the literature to show this. Here's the data for electron temperatures from Philips at all(1995). The bottom black line shows the expected adiabatic expansion temperature in the mainstream model. The other colored lines show the electron temperatures as actually measured by various different missions relative to a nominal value of 1 at 1 AU (just to show you the shape of the curve). And all the other lines show that the electron temperature is decreasing more slowly with distance than expected. So something appears to be heating the electrons as they get further from the Sun. And that's the wrong way around for an anode Sun model. This plot from Cranmer (2009) shows proton and electron temperatures in the fast solar wind plotted against radial distance in the data taken from the Helios and Ulysses missions. The red dots show the protons and the blue dots show the electrons. Strangely, the electron temperature branches beyond about two AU radius. The lower values clustered near the black curve occurred at solar minimum but the uptick of blue points you can see there occurs at solar maximum. And that shouldn't occur if the electrons are being accelerated by an anode Sun, and nor should the effect be dependent on the solar cycle. So let's look at the electrons in more detail. Štverák et al. (2009) tells us that the electron velocity distribution functions observed in the solar wind typically exhibit three different components: a core, a halo, and a strahl population. The strahl appears as a beam-like population moving away from the Sun along the magnetic field. Now in the figure the strahl population is the white zone under the starred curve to the right here. And the thermal core is a normal Maxwell distribution. The non-thermal halo populations are symmetrically distributed non maxwellian distributions. The important point is that there is no corresponding strahl population on the left of the diagram, which is the part moving towards the Sun, as you can see from the velocity at the bottom is zero in the middle. So these are moving away. There are no strahl electrons moving towards the Sun over there. And that seems to be clear evidence that there are more electrons moving away from the Sun faster than the protons, because the baseline for these measurements is the protons. So taken together these various strands of evidence seem to argue against an anode Sun. So when I got this far looking for this evidence which I was expecting to find and couldn't find, I then thought, well, what evidence the Juergens have. So I went back to his 1972 paper - the original one in which he postulated the anode sun model - and he started off by saying,"The dipole component of the solar magnetic field can only be attributed to the rotation of the charged Sun as a whole, as Dr. Velikovsky pointed out more than two decades ago". The problem here is that the dipole field of the Sun reverses every cycle, but the rotation doesn't. So that was a puzzle. Juergens then refers to a paper by Ogilvie et al.(1974) apparently suggesting that electrons in the solar wind are traveling away from the Sun too slowly. And I've looked at the original Ogilvie paper and this is what it says. Ogilvie did find that the electron heat flux values are sufficiently low to require modifications to the Spitzer-Harm conductivity formula used in the Parker disk model. But he also concluded a detector measures a net electron flux away from the solar direction. Juergens then quoted a paper by Lemaire et al. (1971) who Juergens says have a solar wind model that claims better than average success in squaring predictions with observations. So what did they say? Their conclusion was that a voltage drop of only 400 volts at around 6 solar radii was all that was needed to explain the observations. And that doesn't sound like a 10 billion volt anode. Juergens then quoted a paper by Gosling et al. (1971) which he claimed showed the constancy of the solar wind during the solar cycle, arguing that this demonstrated that the energy could not come from inside the sun, otherwise sunspot activity would alter the output. Now Gosling's paper did say that the average speed was remarkably constant. But he also stated high speeds in excess of 550 km/s were more commonly observed near solar minimum than solar maximum. And Gosling also demonstrated a very good correlation between sunspot activity, the electron corona radiance and the ratio flux. So the sun's output does vary with the solar cycle after all, Which means I find it hard to understand how Juergens interpreted the evidence that he quoted as support for a 10 billion volt anode Sun. Now I must re-emphasize that the EU model now says that the voltage drop occurs at the heliopause, not at the Sun itself. Now it is an important change, but it doesn't get around the fact that the 350 km/s electron drift towards an anode Sun is needed to power the radiant output in the Juergens model. Neither does it solve the problem of fast strahl electrons coming away from the Sun or the electron heating further out. And nor does it solved the problem of where the supposed balancing charges supposed to come from. So altogether, I wonder, are we trying to modify a theory, that was flawed from the start? So let's look at what the evidence does actually tell us. The solar wind seems to be evidence of electrical activity. That's clear. But we need to clear exactly what it is, and where it's occurring. The solar wind itself consists mainly of protons and electrons streaming away from the Sun. The slow solar wind comes from the equatorial regions, where the magnetic field lines of the Sun are often looped back into the Sun - so we see that coronal mass ejections and similar formations which loop back in. The fast solar wind comes from the higher solar latitudes, and especially at solar minima where coronal holes appear as dark regions in the x-ray spectrum you can see on the right here. After leaving the Sun, the fast solar wind curves along the magnetic field lines towards the equator from both poles, eventually linking up to form the heliosphere current sheet. And this diagram from Coles (1998) paper shows the effect close in to the Sun. A little bit further out you'd have also seen the lines from the poles dropping down to the equator. Now this geometry is similar to the geometry of the Alfvén current except that it's not clear there's a concentration of current along the polar axis. The situation seems to me to me more like the proton emission in the cigar galaxy shown in the picture on the right, where the protons are the red explosion along - vaguely along - the axes, but not concentrated along the axes. So the question is, "What accelerates the solar wind?" Is it a small electric field through the heliosphere, or is it more local to the Sun? There's evidence that the acceleration takes place very close to the Sun in astronomical terms, and I'll just give you two examples from many in the literature. Shapiro in 2012 states that the solar wind acceleration region is a a dozen solar radii. And Frazin et al. in 2003 states we know that the O 5 plus ions need to accelerate somewhere before 3 AU. These and many similar references appear to suggest that the acceleration zone is close to the Sun, and not spread throughout the heliosphere. So let's look at the field that the EU model predicts. Now Wal Thornhill has made the point that simple electrostatics can't be applied to the Crookes tube discharge model of the heliosphere. The pith ball model on the lower picture is the wrong model. I agree. The Crookes tube analogy suggests that there's no space charge in the heliosphere, but there is a shell of positive charge at the inner boundary of the heliopause which maintains the sun's potential up to the heliopause and outside this positive layer there's a negative layer which is the virtual cathode where most of the potential drop occurs. And in the model the electric field from the anode Sun itself will fall off with the inverse square of the distance from the Sun giving a low electric field within the heliopause as required, but a high electric field immediately adjacent to the Sun. If you've got a charge on the Sun there must be an electric field coming from the body of the Sun itself, and then outside that you have the heliopause double-layer where the main drop occurs, but we can't get away from the fact that you need a potential drop near the Sun. And this makes the anode sun behave like a double-layer, exactly as we've seen in the acceleration data. So so far that's so good, but it's more complicated than that, because in the EU model there are actually four separate charged regions. The body of the sun is an anode and in this diagram the body of the Sun is off to the left here, and its anode voltage is this intersection with that axis on the left. The inner and outer photo spheres are two layers a positive charge, which you can see as blue regions here, causing the height of this potential hill here, and then the lower corona is a negative layer here, which causes this steep potential drop down here. As we've just seen from the data, the data appears to indicate that the acceleration is coming from this steep potential drop here, as the model suggests. But the acceleration data which is what we measure way out here somewhere, can be explained by this part here. How do we know from the data that you've got this extra layer here, and you've got an anode Sun here? I find it hard to see how we can interpret from measurements out here what's going on behind this double-layer here. So we've got no direct evidence of the anode Sun inside that steep double-layer. Apart from causing the charged layers out of the heliopause, there appear to be two main reasons why the anode Sun body is necessary. The first is to drive the in flowing current from galactic space, and power the Sun. In a Crookes tube, the current is driven by the external circuit. And that also removes any charge arriving at the anode, so you don't have a charge balancing problem. The second reason for having an anode Sun relates to the control of the solar wind by Don Scott's PNP transistor analogy. And that model assumes that the ions in the anode Sun are trying to escape, and so they need to be restrained by this potential hill here in the photosphere. An alteration of the height of this hill here regulates the amount of ions that are allowed to pass across and reach this steep part here - the double-layer - and that controls the output of the double-layer, which we measure out here as the solar wind. Now without an anode Sun, an outwardly directing double-layer, consisting of the outer photospere and lower corona, would accelerate the positive ions in exactly the way we measure. But then how could the control work if you don't have this hill part between the anode and the inner photosphere? Well in the first place, without an anode, there is no excess of positive ions trying to escape. Any positive ions that are drifting around here will be accelerated if they get to the edge of this hill, and they will be accelerated down the potential hill, if they approach the double-layer, but they won't be being forced outwards from an anode Sun if it isn't an anode. And secondly, control of the acceleration is basically the control of the height of this part of the hill here. And that could be achieved equally well either by the adjustment of the voltage of the photosphere here, that is, the amount of charge in these layers, or slightly more subtly, you could keep the charge in the two layers the same, and simply separate them - physically separate them - slightly further. And both mechanisms would increase the voltage, or therefore the height of the hill, and therefore the acceleration. So just this part - the double-layer part here alone - can provide the control mechanism. Now I wonder, is an anode Sun necessary after all? So, if there's a double-layer, without an anode Sun inside it, what happens at sunspots? The transistor analogy suggests that sunspots are holes in the double-layer, through which the positive ions can leak out. But a problem with this model is that the observed motions of sunspots appears to show that matter is falling in. For example, Newton in 1958 refers to an always present slight downdraft of hydrogen and calcium gas from the chromosphere above the sunspot, falling in. Also, sunspots are known to emit electrons. We've already seen Birkeland's work presented a couple of times this morning. Here's the diagram you'll recognize. Now in relation to this diagram Birkeland refers to the emission of cathode rays from sunspots and compares them to what he found when his terrella was the cathode, not the anode. With slight magnetization on his cathode glob, the rays came from the equatorial regions, which is the sunspot belt, and they formed groups, exactly like sunspots do, as we see here in the picture. And these rays - these cathode rays in Birkeland terella - seem to be analogous to the strahl electron beams we've already seen. In his recent interview with Michael Goodspeed, Don Scott pointed out the correlation between sun spots in the photosphere and the bright x-ray emission regions in the chromosphere and corona above. The x-ray emission stops at higher latitudes, where there are no sunspots. Now x-rays are due to high-speed electrons impacting neutral atoms. So it seems that the high temperature electrons causing the X rays are coming from the sunspots. These factors all seem to point to a source of high-energy electrons inside the Sun, which need to be contained by the double-layer, in contrast to the containment of positive ions in an anode Sun. The double-layer would be the same way around we've seen already, but it's just containing electrons, not protons. So why should there be a double-layer at all, if there's no anode body there to cause it? It's well-known the plasma also forms a double-layer to separate areas of plasma with different properties, such as temperature, or degree of ionization. And these types of double-layer are current-free double-layers in contrast to the current-carrying double-layers formed in a Crookes tube. And in essence, that's the difference I'm suggesting. The anode Sun model requires a CCDL around it, but plasma could generate a CFDL cell boundary, without a charged anode. And the particle acceleration in the double-layer is similar in both cases. But one type of double-layer is caused by an externally driven current and the other is not. So perhaps we should look at what sort of plasma the Sun might contain, which would prompt the formation of a current free douple-layer. The recent interest in fusion has led to the study of plasmoids. This is an example here. I'll show you after I have a small drink. Most fusion devices aim to create a high temperature plasma which is contained by external magnetic fields, such as seen here in the tokamak machine near Oxford. However there's a perfectly good example of naturally occurring self-contained plasmoids in nature and that is ball lightning. And the recent fusion research has looked at ball lightning in an attempt to explain what's going on in these lab machines. I found two very good papers by Tsui published in 2001 and 3 respectively who demonstrated that there's a stable force-free arrangement of currents in a plasmoid when there is the right balance of toroidal and poloidal fields. So that means that a stable plasmoid is like a Birkeland current wrapped around into a closed loop. Now this force free form occurs at all scales. It's been suggested elsewhere that the electron itself is a toroid and as we heard this morning Wal Thornhill has argued that there's a plasmoid at the heart of the Milky Way and other galaxies. So if we accept that, it seems possible that a plasmoid may be contained inside the Sun and other stars as well. Now, this idea isn't new. Alfvén argued that the Sun was a pair of toroidal rings. And this double ring model explains the loops of prominences on the Sun as escapes from the toroids. Now, perhaps that's why the Paris Observatory recently published the similar image seen on the right, something of an artist's impression, but at least they're adopting the model. Now, Bostick's experiments in 1956 demonstrated that the Rings are formed when a plasma gun discharges into a magnetic field across the field lines as you see on the left. Initially the plasmoids of tubular and aligned along the field lines and then develop into knots and eventually into rings, In contrast shown on the right. Charles Bruce was convinced that ball lightning is a result of ejection of plasma from bends in lightning discharge channels, where the stretched magnetic field allows highly energetic plasma to escape from the main lightning discharge channel. Observations of naturally occurring ball lightnings seem to support this view that is associated with conventional lightning discharges. Birkeland currents can also develop bends due to what is known as the kink instability. So a plasmoid could be formed at a kink instability in a galactic Birkeland current without the need for an artificial plasma gun. Now if a star forms as a plasmoid, it will inevitably contain high temperature electrons similar to the tokamak devices, and so we should expect to see a CFDL form around it to separate the two plasma States. So I'd like to suggest that there may be a plasmoid in the center of the Sun and a CFDL around it. Ionization would then occur in the interaction region with the surrounding plasma. The tufting in the photosphere would be due to ions being accelerated away because they got too close to the double-layer. And the electrons would be drawn in against the electron temperature gradient. Sunspots in that case would be leaks of high temperature electrons like in the Birkeland experiments, and the leak of high-temperature electrons would maintain the overall neutrality of the plasmoid. The energy would come from the energy contained in the plasmoid which is slowly leaking out, by interaction with its environment, which is similar to what we see in ball lightning behavior. And the CFDL would accelerate the solar wind away from the Sun just like the CCDL in the anode Sun model. But the plasmoid CFDL model avoids the problems of the electrons not behaving further out and it also avoids the need for a balancing proton inflow into an anode Sun. So it solves a couple of problems. But if we replace the anode Sun with a plasmoid Sun, where does this leave the Alfven current? Well, I suggest that we leave it exactly where it was, with the one exception that we touched on earlier. The concentration of the current along the polar axis is not obvious in the ulysses mission data. It seems to be more distributed and therefore more like the arrangement shown here from Alfven's 1941 paper. In that paper he argued that the field aligned currents from the Sun caused orbital rotation of the heliospheric current sheet by the Faraday motor mechanism. It seems as though the Alfven current around a plasmoid which is not energetically producing axial Jets is primarily concerned with rotation and transfer of angular momentum not with the processes going on in the photosphere itself. But if that's so, which way is the momentum being transferred? Recent evidence suggests ############## that the corona is not rotating the same way as the photosphere, or in the same way. It rotates in same direction, but not in the same manner. This graph from Giordano 2008 shows the measurements of the rotation period plotted against latitude. And the parabolic curve shows the differential rotation of the photosphere for comparison. And the puzzling aspect is that the corona does not show differential rotation. Also the corona has a faster rotation. That is a smaller period, than the photosphere at higher latitudes. So that says to me that photosphere can't be driving the corona. It seems that it's the corona that's linked to the Alfven Faraday motor. But Alfven's mechanism can work both ways. And therefore it's possible that the corona can be driven by the heliospheric current sheet. But, if so where could the heliospheric current sheet motion come from? The recent evidence from the IBEX mission suggests that the heliosphere sits in the center of a galactic Birkeland current. And it seems reasonable to assume that the presence of the heliosphere effects the Birkeland current, which either bulges around it as NASA says shown on the left, or perhaps pinches down onto it as we might prefer. Now we know that a Birkeland current has a radially varying helicity which allows each particle to follow the magnetic field line at its own location. The balance is maintained automatically because if it is not parallel to B at any location, the cross-product will generate a radial force, which moves the plasma back into alignment. So suppose that the heliosphere causes the Birkeland current to become misaligned at the bulge or the pinch, then some plasma will be shifted radially into or out of the heliosphere. If it's incoming it will still be carrying the spiraling current which is carried mainly by the electrons. So the incoming electrons will have a strong orbital velocity component and an inward radial drift in which the electrons are moving faster than the protons. Once inside the heliosphere we would see this as the current in the heliospheric current sheet, which according to Alfven spirals in towards the Sun in alternate cycles. The motion of the heliosphere current sheet could then drive the corona by the Alfven mechanism in reverse. During the other cycle, when the sun's magnetic field is reversed, but the rotation remains the same, the radial component of the current must reverse and flow back out. And it may be during that phase the corona is driving the heliospheric current sheet. So it seems possible that the solar cycle is due to the galactic current bleeding into the solar system in one cycle and leaking back out again in the next. And Don Scott has recently referred to a paper by Decker published in Nature in September 2012. Decker reported that contrary to NASA's models Voyager 1 had measured zero north-south plasma flow near the heliopause. And instead they found an unexpected totally unexpected east-west ion flow plus a continued radial drift. So already there seems to be some evidence for the suggested interaction between the heliosphere and the Birkeland current. So to summarize I suggest that the evidence does not seem to support Juergen anode Sun but it's more in favor of a CFDL near the Sun and this may be a result of normal plasma cell formation around a force-free plasmoid which could have been formed by discharge from a kink instability in the original galactic Birkeland current. The energy would come from the plasmoid similar to ball lightning and caused ionization of the plasma next to it. The DL accelerates the islands and draws in electrons until there's an imbalance when high-temperature electrons escape fire holes in the DL which we see as sunspots. The role of the Alfven circuit seems to be largely rotational transferring momentum between the corona and the HTS and exchanging electromagnetic and kinetic energy during the solar cycles. The coronal torus does store part of that energy during the cycle. The primary driver for coronal rotation in may then be the galactic Birkeland current leading into the heliopause due to misalignment at a pinch or bulge around the heliosphere. And oscillations of the misalignment might cause the saivors cycle but is it right? I don't know we need more evidence. I do suggest that the forthcoming SAFIRE experiment should keep an open mind as to whether the Sun is an anode or not. And I think the Thunderbolts project either has to find convincing evidence for a drift current towards the Sun and a better means of maintaining the anode voltage or perhaps we have to consider abandoning the anode. Electricity is undoubtedly the key, but how and where it flows is uncertain. But the good news is there's still plenty of physics to be sorted out and I think it's exciting to be involved in the search for answers. I hope you agree because there's a role here for anyone who's interested. Thank you for listening. 
I want to start by asking your question how can liquids behave like an ionized gas plasma okay the answer I think is the plasma behavior depends on the motion of charged particles which are free to move in response to electromagnetic forces so if the liquid is partially ionized than the charged particles in the liquid ought to experience similar forces and the liquid will behaviors sort of similarly to the ionized particles in the gas so what we're going to do is to look at three examples of partially ionized liquids and compare their behavior to plasma behavior in space so the structure of the talk first of all we'll examine the floating water bridge excuse me and the various attempts to explain it without using plasma behavior then we'll compare it to the way plasma behaves in space we'll find that some of the puzzling features of the floating water bridge can be explained by using plasma behavior and the second half of the talk will then use the same plasma behavior and professor Pollux easy layers in water to offer an explanation of unusual fluid flows in plant roots and blood vessels so we're starting off with a floating water bridge now you've already seen this a couple of times already courtesy of Professor and Elmer Fuchs who made the film so the floating water bridge forms between two beakers of pure water when a large potential difference of about 15 thousand volts or above is applied between them and here you can see two features of the bridge there's a nearly cylindrical tube of water 1 to 2 millimeters in diameter between the beakers and the tube can be stretched up to about 25 millimeters long and the bridge is like a tightrope it doesn't sag as you would expect it to under its own weight even when it's stretched out to 25 millimeters now this film also by Elmer Fuchs shows that the water is rotating the films in slow motion because the rotation is actually too fast to see with a naked eye so folks have shown that water in the bridge is separated into an annulus and an inner core and the circular annulus is the part that's rotating in laser light shown in from the end of the bridge you can see that the light is curving around the rotating annulus part and avoiding the core in the middle so it gives you some indication of that shape I'm talking about now folks also found that the annulus and core each carry water along the bridge but in opposite directions so that's quite extraordinary really water is flowing in both directions at the same time now not only water earth but charge flows across the bridge as well now charge flowing in opposite directions is an electric current by using pH dyes fuchs has shown that the bridge transports charge or current from one beaker to the other and here we can see charge regions adjacent to the terminals boiling off as it were charged during an experiment and at the end of the experiment you can see the difference in pH and the Meekers now Armstrong back in 1893 who is the guy who first discovered the floating water bridge the experiment was in for Kaufman for about a hundred years Armstrong found that the annulus is positively charged and the core is negative so there we can see how we can get a current flowing across the bridge positive charge in one direction and negative charge in the other is equivalent to a current in one direction so to summarize a floating water bridge is a stiff cylindrical tube with an annulus and call structure there's simultaneous bi-directional flow of water and charge across the bridge and the annulus is rotating very fast around the core what's more the annulus is positive and the core is negative so researchers approached the analysis of the floating water bridge from both the classical and the quantum directions the principle of the classic EHD approach is that electric stress causes the axial tension in the bridge according to Taylor electrodynamic currents are assumed to be so small that magnetic induction effect can be ignored Bertram and Sowell expanded on Taylor's analysis but without achieving complete success they stated although the quantitative agreement between theory and experiment is not as close as one might like using surface transport as an adjustable parameter it brings them into agreement sounds great isn't it but the problem with that is that the adjustable parameter is completely arbitrary its values chosen to make the equations work it's not a measured value from the experiment well of course you can make it work if you can choose any value you like so there's something missing why'd Amana lies the water bridge in terms of the Maxwell pressure pencil in a dielectric fluid he assumed deionized water throughout because the need for deionized water is evidently necessary to prevent conductivity effects from masking the insulating dielectric effects in other words his analysis only worked with a dielectric but the presence of charge and the beakers after an experiment shows that the water does become partially ionized this obviously casts doubt on widens analysis you so what's missing what's missing from the LRC's is that they don't account for the annulus and course structure all the bi-directional flow or the fast rotation of the annulus now I suggest that these may introduce additional electromagnetic effects which haven't been taken into account because as we know the water is charged will therefore compare the floating water bridge with another filamentary structure in which an electromagnetic effects dominate the behavior here's a picture of plasma behavior in space now Rogoff and others have described plasma as the fourth state of matter the other three of course are solids liquids and gases plasmas are estimated to constitute over 99% of the visible universe and plasma as you all know is often described as an ionized gas but as Alphen said whilst this is technically true it doesn't reflect the complexity of the behavior of plasma under the influence of electromagnetic forces normal gases simply can't do what a plasma does plasma can transmit an electric current in a defined filament without affecting the surrounding plasma as we see here in the Cygnus loop the plasma rearranges itself to form what is effectively an insulated cable around the current path and so the bulk plasma the rest of the plasma in space isn't affected and the way it does this is by forming a rotating cylinder of adjacent layers of positive and negative charge on the outside of the current this filamentary arrangement is known as a berkland current now the behavior of the berkland current is governed by Maxwell's equations of the Lorentz force law applied to the individual charged particles in the filament essentially each and every particle has to follow the magnetic field lines where it is but it also by moving it modifies the same magnetic field lines so according to both alpha and peratt's the net result of this interaction is a result is a spiraling filamentary pattern in which the circularity of the paths of the particles is dependent on their radial distance from the central axis of the filament so here you can see a diagram with three examples chosen at random the further you are from the centre of the current the more rate more circular the path you have to follow so strongly helical and the outside layers so the charged particles always follow the magnetic field line direction at their location and this explains the alternative name for a birth length current as a field aligned current the field aligned direction is the most efficient direction for current to traveling through a magnetic field and that's because the Lorentz force law effectively imposes an electrical resistance on motion transverse to the magnetic field that means the resistance is lowest in the direction parallel to the magnetic field therefore the current is in a fourth free configuration when it's field line one other effects important here the outer paths are strongly helical and that means that the outer layers are rotating around the axis of the filament and that in turn generates more electromagnetic forces and they are an essential part of the stability of the berkland current so the summarized berkland current plasma behavior means that a berkland current has a form of annulus and called structure it has bi-directional flows because of current of opposite charge particles and it also has rotation of the outer layer that sounds a bit like the missing bits of the floating water region now 
You've just entered the theater of an alien sky. If the words and images seem strange to you, there's a reason for this. Our world was once a vastly different place. To experience this won't hurt you and there is nothing to fear. Invitation to Jordan Peterson Tonight's talk, this is the most popular talk we've ever done in 15 years. Please welcome one of the world's great public intellectuals, Jordan Peterson! Well, that was nice. It's not surprising that we've been asked to comment on the YouTube presence of Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson. It seems his star rose spectacularly after a record-setting interview with Britain's Channel 4 host Kathy Newman. Posted on YouTube in January, the interview attracted over 11 million views in about six months with an overwhelmingly positive rating, not to mention the multitude of repostings of the same or similar material garnering up to a million views each. Prior to this remarkable turn, there was little to distinguish Peterson from other qualified presenters on YouTube. But now when Peterson gives public presentations auditoriums sell out. Just one cautionary note is required here. Though Peterson is most definitely not an evangelist for any religious view, he does single out the dominant religion of the Western world, Christianity, as an indispensable force in our culture. And he frequently states his personal view that civilization would collapse were a culture to fully abandon its broad religious heritage. Due to the diversity of people contributing to the Thunderbolts Project, we've avoided contemporary politics and religion when discussing the Electric Universe movement. After many years of observing this rule, we can now say that without this constraint the Thunderbolts Project could never have emerged as the most popular internet voice of the Electric Universe idea. So we've asked ourselves how to respond to our own supporters urging us to take up Peterson and his work. The answer has come from looking more closely at how he acquired his current perspective. His academic training placed an emphasis on the mythic archetypes, the deepest structures of human thought in ancient times echoing across all of human history and continuing to influence our world today. By their cultural impact, Peterson observes, the archetypes have provided guidelines to humanity inspiring people to live productively and responsibly in the world. Though we don't have an answer to offer on contemporary religious and political questions, we've noted that Peterson's historic subject matter is pretty close to that of psychologist Carl Jung who saw in the world's great myths a repeated presence of certain first forms evident in the early expressions of human consciousness. By archetypes Jung meant deeply embedded recurrent patterns of sacred beliefs and practices the world over. Bringing the ancient mythic and symbolic structures to light became the first priority in Jung's approach to human psychology. So we see in Peterson's presentations a clearly stated respect for Jung and for such comparative mythologists as Joseph Campbell. And it's worth emphasizing that most comparative mythology does not require a student of ancient history to know how an archetype arose. What really counts, they would say, is the archetype's cultural function. One discerns its role as the culture strives to affirm its own identity in a changing world. But for us, there is also a deeper level of analysis available, one almost never expressed in popular treatments of the archetypes. Our claim is that the real obstacle to deeper insight is the one that prevents an investigator from seeing what will ultimately become obvious. The archetypes did not originate in today's natural world nor did they emerge from a vacuum. They arose as the effect of a prior cause. A prior cause within a natural order that disappeared thousands of years ago. If we're correct in this fundamental conclusion, just imagine the scale of the disconnect when trying to comprehend the ancient archetypes in terms of familiar natural experience today. All we'll have available to us are the later projections of mythic themes onto fragments of the natural world while the original provocation remains forever elusive. Well the remarkable truth is that by following rational ground rules for comparative analysis, hundreds of archetypes can be reliably identified and not just by their own essential qualities but by seeing them in terms of origin and timeless significance. All archetypes have a direct connection to an extraordinary natural experience and all are inseparably connected to each other with no more than two or three degrees of separation between any of them. With this specificity in front of us, we can assure anyone coming into this discussion for the first time that the answers given will not allow us to simply perpetuate modern-day interpretations of ancient myths and symbols. And so we've stated our conclusion emphatically and repeatedly that the archetypes point back to a former time. And the most persuasive answer requires the clearest connection between cause and effect as the cause itself becomes logically inescapable. That's it, we will then say. But next comes the greatest challenge arising from a vast field of evidence, confirming that each and every archetype arose explosively in response to earth-shaking and mind-altering events. To many newcomers that proposed cause will seem preposterous. Yet after decades of systematic research, we have never found any other plausible cause of a single archetype. And that means no justification for ignoring the cause that fits the evidence precisely. For those close to The Thunderbolts Project, the greatest surprise has come from the predictive ability of the reconstruction offered. What one would expect to find within the framework proposed, one does find. In this regard, it seems that Jordan Peterson himself has delivered to us several examples well worth exploring. In number 7 of his Maps of Meaning series he takes up what some have called The Consilience Test for assessing the overall integrity of an idea. That test becomes particularly useful when a novel idea reaches across multiple layers or patterns of fact, he states. Of course, we've drawn on this very principle when we proposed what we've called the acid test of the historic polar configuration -- the centerpiece of our reconstruction. Do the mythic archetypes become predictable when seen from the perspective of this evolving configuration? Our claim has been that hundreds of archetypes meet the acid tests unequivocally. A level of specificity that could not be possible by cherry-picking. When comparing our claims to Peterson's tests of consilience, one difference should be noted and this difference shows up in virtually all comparative studies of the mythic archetypes. The more familiar studies, such as the highly popular work of Joseph Campbell, invariably stop short of anything that could be called an explanation. While describing undeniable patterns, they do not penetrate to a proposed origin or first cause. The archetypes are simply there as a profound influence on human conduct and cultural evolution over time. But this is where our challenge to today's most pervasive scientific illusion enters the picture. The illusion that we've called the uniformity principle. Others have called it uniformitarianism. The uniformity principle suggests to astronomers and planetary scientists that they can retro-calculate the position of any planet in the ancient sky at any historical juncture based on today's planetary motions. They will not realize that in the 19th and 20th centuries, this disregard for ancient testimony was the greatest mistake of modern science. A mistake that continues to echo through all of the scientific disciplines today. Of course when living in the shadow of this mistake, the very idea of Earth- altering events in the past will appear preposterous. But allow the ancient witnesses to speak and a vastly different sky will reveal itself. We've proposed that all of world mythology, all of the enchanting stories and symbols and commemorative practices that have come down to us are explained by an ancient gathering of planets close to Earth. We make that claim based on global evidence. Yes, in innumerable instances evidence is remarkably explicit, but explicit will not mean obvious to a person looking somewhere else. No one could explain or has ever explained the archetypes in the absence of an extraordinary human experience. And that's the historical truth we'll continue to highlight in these Discourses. It's also why we invite Jordan Peterson who's contributed so much to public discussion of the archetypes, to join us in a common exploration of first causes and their implications. Few sciences or social sciences could possibly escape the effects that followed from the most fundamental theoretical error in our time. 
So this is about Ptolemy, Belief Systems and other Dark Matters. Now, we're all here or watching online because we have an interest in the exploration and an explanation of the cosmos. Now when we think about the investigation of the cosmos we often focus on the capabilities and limitations of the instruments and the observational tools that we use. We lose track of the limitations that are imposed on us by possibly the greatest instrument, the most critical instrument involved in this exploratory process and that is of course the human mind itself. Now, unlike the instruments of our invention, the human mind really hasn't changed very much, if at all, since we took our first steps on this great journey. I often talk about how we have not really changed very much from our previous selves so many thousands of years ago when we huddled together, trying to figure out what populated the darkness beyond the campfire. And so we lose track of how the greatest challenge ahead of us is not really the precision of our mechanical or electronic instruments, It's the cumulative psychological and sociological and biological and evolutionary hindrances in our own mind. Now, I plan to talk about this for the next little while, but first I thought it would be instructive to open with a story. And this is the story of the clever king and the sage. Now once upon a time there was a clever king. In fact he was so clever that it was widely held that he was the most clever person in all the land. More clever than anyone had ever been before and probably more clever than anybody would ever be. And one day the clever King decided that he would devote all of his cleverness and all his kingly resources to enriching the lives of his subjects by discovering the secrets of the cosmos, the Sun, the stars, the Earth and even life itself. And so he collected all of the clever people in his land to help them in this great work. And for many years the King toiled with his hundreds of clever people in constructing the most amazing, sophisticated, complicated mechanism ever built. They poured all of their collective knowledge into it, all of their cleverness. Nothing was missed, no mistakes were made. And it was wrong. The magnificent machine, so complex, did not explain the cosmos, the Sun the Earth, the stars and life itself. It always gave something different than what the king could see. Something was wrong. So, he was so confident, he knew, he was certain in fact, that something little was missing. They had poured so much of their knowledge, so much of their cleverness into this machine. It had to be something incremental. So in frustration he looked for other clever people who could come and help him find his missing pieces. And finally he heard of a sage, and old wise man who had wandered through all of the kingdoms and was said to be as wise as time itself. So he summoned the sage to come before him and look upon his great work. And so the King explained, piece-by-piece, this incredibly complicated, beautiful machine. He's showing him how all of the cleverness all of the knowledge had gone into it. And the old wise man nodded and smiled and he blinked in wonder. Then said, my king I can tell that indeed you are the most clever person in the land, more clever than anyone who's come before, probably more clever than anybody will ever be.. But, he said, I can immediately see what it is, where the missing pieces are that will complete your great work. The king was overjoyed, he was amazed. This is fantastic, he knew it done the right thing bringing in that sage, right? So he said; this is great, can you please tell me what the missing pieces are so that I complete this great work? And then wise man said; the pieces that are missing are all the things that you don't know that you don't know. Well, the king was dumbfounded, he sputtered in frustration, so how am I going to complete this great mechanism if I don't even know what I don't know? And the old sage nodded and smiled because now he knew the king was asking the right questions. And he said; my king when I first met you I knew you were the most clever person in all the land but now you're just a little bit wiser. Well I can't say the king took that very well but the moral of the story is that the clever man has complete confidence in the cleverness of his inventions and that complete knowledge is just a few pieces away, with just a little few more pieces to complete the picture. The wise man accepts and acknowledges that we can never really know what we don't know which means we can never be certain about anything we think we know and that, the pursuit of absolute certainty is probably a foolish goal anyway. Now there are a couple things i like about the story. One of them is this metaphor of this machine for conceptual frameworks. After all the system of differential equations is really just a mathematical machine. You crank away at it, sort of algorithmically, and answers and simulations come out the other side. And if it agrees, relatively well, with some subset of what we observe we get quite a bit of certainty [that] in its general use. And this ingrains some belief that it can be used in all conditions. Well, modeling mimics understanding. Now over the course of our history we've constructed various complicated  conceptual frameworks to try to understand the workings of the cosmos. Now, one of these very complicated conceptual frameworks can actually trace its lineage back to ancient Greece and Aristotle but it was actually perfected by Claudius Ptolemy. This is of course the geocentric model of the universe. This notion that the Sun and the planets revolved around the Earth. Now, Claudius Ptolemy was an observational astronomer and mathematician we actually don't know very much about his life except that he lived and worked in Alexandria about 150 AD. Now however, most of his work actually survives and foremost amongst this is the Almagest which is a treatise in 13 volumes that describe the motion of the Sun and the planets. And indeed the universe was conceived as a great mechanism. Nested planetary spheres comprised of a perfect crystalline substance called quintessence or ether. And the planets riding on the crystalline spheres. Now quintessence has a natural perfect circular motion and also it can never be experienced here on earth where we could only experience the normal elements of earth, air, fire and water. And now we have this notion arising of some disconnection between the physical nature of the heavens and what can be experienced here. We actually see this recurring in modern cosmology. We'll talk more about that later. Now one of the things that I like about this model, one of the things I find interesting is this creation of new physical entities and mechanisms to fill in our gaps in understanding. What we don't know, we populate with new physical entities and as our imaginings are modified and adapted to fit with what we observe then these imaginings are transmuted into an illusion of understanding. Now, probably Ptolemy's great innovation was the use of the equant and the use of the epicycle and deferent. Now through multiple spheres per planet and sophisticated use of epicycles and deferents, he was able to construct a very complicated system to predict the motion of the Sun and the planets. And here we see in this animation that through this use of epicycles and deferents he could model that back-and-forth wandering of the planets. And actually the Ptolemaic model was relatively satisfactory and from a mathematical perspective was probably one of the most outstanding achievements of the human mind. In fact it's very difficult to identify another scientific system of thought that was so successful in predicting for so long. For over 1400 years it dominated as our view of the cosmos. At least until the advent of Copernicus. Now, Nicholas Copernicus was originally educated in art and mathematics but when he became canon of the Frombork cathedral he traveled to Italy, ostensibly to study religious law. But what he really did was he dived headfirst into astronomy and he made full use of the books that were available at the time due to the advent, the recent advent of the printing press. Now we all know that Copernicus made that great leap and placing the Sun at the center of the cosmos and he was largely motivated by a sense of simplicity and elegance, the theme of this conference. But he was also, he also believed very strongly in Plato's notion of perfect circular motion. He abhorred Ptolemy's equant but because he was limited to circular motion he needed to use the epicycle and the deferent to make his model match what was observed. Now to a certain extent it was more simple and elegant than the Ptolemaic model but it's arguable whether it was really that much simpler and in fact in real practice it didn't really provide that much better prediction, if at all, than the Ptolemaic model. There's also something on the heretical side as well and Copernicus took great pains during his life not to actually broadcast these notions and is only, was only really published very shortly before his death in 1543. And he was right because in the oncoming years the church condemned the work and the book was added to the list of banned books in 1616. And so the geocentric model persisted, even in the face of fairly convincing contradictory evidence that was coming forth from Galileo. Now Galileo was working with the telescope which was just invented in 1609 making some really critical observations. Observations like moons around Jupiter and craters on the moon and sunspots, but his most critical observation of all was probably that of the phases of Venus. The phases of Venus, these observations were completely inconsistent with the geocentric notion of the universe. If the geocentric model was a scientific hypothesis it would have been disproven out of hand. And it's a wonderful example of how humans can ignore evidence that contradicts a strongly held belief system. Well, it is fair to say that life became uncomfortable for Galileo; inquisitions tend to do that, so he eventually recanted, was exiled and the geocentric model persisted. In the meantime Kepler was working away and did away with this notion of circular motion and developed a new empirical set of planetary laws of motion based on the ellipse. He sort of set the stage for true revolution in human thought. But it was the groundbreaking work, actually, of Isaac Newton that really did away with geocentrism as our dominant view of the cosmos. Now, Newton began his groundbreaking and amazingly broad range of work when the Scientific Revolution of the 17th century was in full swing. His new notions of gravity provided an exciting new explanatory framework for the motion of the planets. He established a unified earthly and heavenly system of mechanics. He was able to independently derive, mathematically derive, from first principles, Kepler's empirical laws of planetary motion. Now the power of Newton's system lay in its universality. It tied together the physical phenomena both earthly and heavenly into one system. There was no longer this separation between the physical nature of the heavens and what was on earth. And it's interesting that this separation, this, this connection between what happens in the heavens and what happens on earth has only been recently severed again. But more on that later. Now the way to Newton's power to this universality was through mathematics and the title of his book The Mathematical Principles Of Natural Philosophy sort of speaks for itself. It's embodied and inspired this notion that the universe could be reduced and accurately modeled through mathematical formulation. But Newton himself admitted that and if I can paraphrase, "he had found the laws but not the cause". He even though had not really describe the underlying physical principles as the cause behind gravity, he had established that this new system of the world was uniquely grounded in gravitational laws, and it's been immensely successful. It's Newtonian mechanics that launched rockets and satellites into orbit and put men on the Moon and our lack of understanding of what underlies the gravitational laws has in no way kept us from taking full advantage of its mathematical description. So again we've been lulled into a sense of understanding. Now with the advent of field theory inspired by the work of, Far.., I mean Michael Faraday, we did away with this mechanical notion of the universe and replaced it with more abstract notions of field of influence. Ultimately Clerk Maxwell mathematically codified Faraday's empirically derived laws of electromagnetism. Einstein applied field theory to a fairly major refurbishment of the gravitational laws in the general theory of relativity. And it's with the general theory of relativity that we turned our faces to the natural world we embraced a mythical, mathematical universe of space-time fabric and the smooth dance of gravitational fields. And where was electricity and magnetism in all of this? Well it was sort of banished from the cosmological stage with a vague promise that it might be unified later on. And so the earthly sphere became one of sparks and magnetism and vacuum tubes and Edison and Tesla and the electric and the electronic ages, swept over us. But in cosmology the mathematical perfection of gravity held sway. The heavenly sphere was one of pristine space-time fabric and singularities and infinitely perfect physical entities that could not be experienced here on earth. Sounds familiar. Now it's ironic that it said that Einstein kept a portrait of Michael Faraday in his study. It's ironic because Einstein's great achievement effectively removed electricity and magnetism from our exploration of the cosmos. And while we waited for the square peg of electromagnetism to be fit into the round hole of Einstein's theories over the next hundred or so years, there was a new complex, sophisticated mechanism developed and constructed to explain the workings of the cosmos and this is of course the lambda cold dark matter model. It's presently known as the standard model of cosmology. So, let's have a look at the lambda cold dark matter model to orient ourselves a little bit. Well, if you look it up in Wikipedia, it's a parameterization of Big Bang cosmology and cosmological constant lambda that's associated with dark energy. Dark energy and dark matter between the two comprise something like 96% of the matter and energy content of the universe. That other 4% that thin slice of the cosmological pie chart, as I like to say, is what we can observe and actually directly experience. So here we are again in a cosmological model where most of its material content is outside of our experience. It cannot be experienced here on earth. And I feel like we've taken, certain, to a certain extent a step backwards in fact dark energy is even sometimes referred to as quintessence. You might remember quintessence of the crystalline spheres in the Ptolemaic model. And I'm amazed not so much by how humans repeat history, but the level of detail that they do so. It's not just a repeat of the same sort of philosophical concept of the separation between the physical nature of Heaven and Earth. Actually reusing specific words again to fill in gaps in our understanding. Now it took over 1,500 years and the full force of the age of enlightenment to shatter those crystalline spheres. But here we are again. From the age of enlightenment to what I can only term the age of “endarkenment”. Dark energy, dark matter, black holes.. OK, well, let's focus in on one of them. Let's look at dark. matter. Why dark matter? Dark matter, the need for dark matter arose in the late sixties and the early seventies from the work of Vera Rubin, who plotted gravitational, I mean, rotational curves like this. Curve A is the curve that we expected to see and curve B is what was actually observed. It implied that most of the mass, there was more mass density in the galaxy then we can actually observe. And Vera Rubin reckoned that there is something like about 6 times the dark mass in the galaxy than we can actually see. And very shortly after, it became quite common knowledge and became commonly accepted that Dark Matter constituted most of the galaxies' mass. Now, it's interesting because this whole thing is based on a fundamental assumption that gravity is the only force at work. The equation, the orbital velocity equation only uses gravitation as one of its parameters. So what if though, what if we don't know what we don't know what if there's something missing in that mathematical modeling? What if electricity and magnetism actually could play a role? What if this sort of line of reasoning was applied in a different field of science? Now I come from a biological background, as you heard and I remember in ecology class learning about the Lotka-Volterra equation. The Lotka-Volterra equation is a system of differential equations used to model the population dynamics of predator-prey pairs in ecosystems. It was famously used to model the population dynamics of lynx in arctic air in northern Canada. Now what if Lotka found, when he went out and measured, [think] actual population dynamics of lynx and hare that it didn't really agree with what his model showed. What if he had absolute certainty that his mathematical model was complete. Then what if he then {somemore what-if] questions, what if we then proposed that there was a hypothetical creature in the ecosystem that we can't see and left no impact on the environment, in fact its presence could only be detected through its influence on the population dynamics of the lynx and the hare. And what if he did a lot of super computer modeling to show that other predator-prey pairings in the world could actually be modeled and predicted if he just adjusted the placement and the relative density of this hypothetical creature that we can't see. Well it didn't actually play out that way because biologists have a very healthy respect for the incompleteness of their mathematical models. But you see the logical flaw here. Well, what if a similar sort of logical flaw has taken us to incorrect conclusions about dark matter? Well then we would expect to see discrepancies between what the cold dark matter model predicts and what we observe. That happens to be the case. There are actually a list of issues. There's the Dwarf Galaxy Problem. There is the Cuspy Halo or (Core/Cusp) problem. There's this issue with the Ratio of regular Matter to Dark Matter in some cases. There's a Dwarf Galaxy Pancake Problem which is actually fairly serious and we have a problem with, we don't have any Local Dark Matter. So we'll go through each of these in turn. Now, the dwarf galaxy problem is also referred to as the missing satellite problem. Now this stems from computer simulations in the cold dark matter model which predicts orders of magnitude more satellite dwarf galaxies than are actually observed. So, for example, there are about 11 satellite dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way but computer simulations, in one case for example, predicts more than 500 so we're orders of magnitude away from what we actually observe. And then we have the cuspy halo problem and this refers to, again, computer simulations that predict the density distribution of dark matter in a galaxy. The mathematical computer simulations indicate that it's cuspy. By cuspy I mean, the dark matter distribution increases sharply to a peak at the center of the galaxy. Well when the usual mathematical derivations are done based on gravitational dynamics, the inferred dark matter distribution in galaxies is seen to be quite smooth. Smooth, maybe there's a bit of a core and the core and the core/cusp problem but it's actually a smooth profile, there are no cusps, there's no cuspy dark halos. This is also known as the small-scale cosmology crisis. Then there's the problem with the ratio of regular matter to dark matter. Recent studies of a galaxy sized cloud of gas, it's actually plasma, Virgo HI21, this is actually the bullet cluster, but in Virgo HI21, that the derived amount of dark matter is about a hundred times the amount of matter that we can observe and that's 10 times higher than it really should be. So this is a real disconnect between what the model predicts and what we observe. And now we have this pancake problem. This is observations in January of 2013, observers from Canada and France at the Keck Observatory were amazed to find that satellite galaxies were moving in unison around the Andromeda galaxy and they were in sort of a disk-like structure. A similar disk-like structure was found around the Milky Way. It's indicated that it's not unique to the Andromeda galaxy and we'll probably find more of them if we go looking. Now it's important to note that in the decades of cold dark matter modeling, satellite galaxies are always predicted to be oriented randomly around the larger galaxy. So this is clearly inconsistent with the predictions of the cold dark matter model and actually it puts me in mind a little bit of the observations of the phases of Venus by Galileo. These observations were clearly inconsistent with the predictions of the geocentric model, and in a very similar way the observation of this disk like-structure of satellite galaxies is completely inconsistent with the cold dark matter model, and yet the model persists. And finally we have the problem with no local dark matter. Now this story, actually the story is a bit of a tale, starts in 2012 with the report from a group of observers at the ESO's La Silla observatory headed by Christian Moni-Bidin. They mapped over 400 stars up to 13,000 light-years away from the Sun and used this data to calculate the mass of matter in that volume of space. It was four times the volume of space than had ever been considered before. The intent was to compare the amount of observable matter versus the amount of matter that is derived gravitationally, through mathematical means, and compare the two and the discrepancy like we saw with Vera Rubin, discrepancy would indicate the amount of dark matter that's present. And what they found when they compared the two was that there is no need to invoke a dark-matter component. So there was no dark matter. Well this prompted an article in The New Scientist where they declared a dark-matter conundrum. Well about a month or so later there's a paper from another group headed by Bovy and Tremaine who took exception to one of the assumptions in this previous paper and it was an assumption that the rotational velocity of the stars in that region of space were constant as you moved away from the center of the galaxy. So they corrected for that and they also introduced their own assumptions about the mass distribution in that volume of space and what they found was actually, now, there was the amount of dark matter [the] model predicted, in fact just a little bit more just to be on the safe side. So, that elicited another article in The New Scientist where they claim that the crisis was averted. And there's a really interesting quote in this New Scientist paper that I like where they say, "the true believers of dark matter were never really worried". So I find it interesting the use of the term "true believers" and so the story ended for the New Scientist. But, if you follow that kind of literature and you track these issues, in 2014 Modi Boudin et al. published another paper finding that the mass distribution assumptions of Bovian Tremain actually were completely inconsistent with observational data; and that, when they corrected for a mass distribution that was consistent with observational data, and corrected for their own assumption about the rotational velocity of the stars, that in fact, again they found there was a negligible amount of dark matter. There really was no need for dark matter but.. So, crisis averted? No, not really! But there were no headlines, there's no follow-on story in The New Scientist, and the point of view of the New Scientist "Crisis averted" -- the world was safe for dark matter. But why "crisis"? I'm interested in the use of this word 'crisis'. I happen to live in the UK and next week we're going to vote to see if we stay in the EU or not. Now proponents of both sides present various crises that will ensue if we go one way or the other. If we leave the EU the national health system will suffer, the real estate in London will go down and foreign exchange and the UK pound will suffer. Or, if we stick with the UK we'll lose\sovereignty, we'll lose control of our destiny. So crisis on both sides. But why crisis with dark matter? I don't understand that. If we find that there's no such thing as dark matter it's not going to change the real estate prices in London, so I don't understand what the crisis is. Well it's a crisis in belief and when you have belief systems in science you've got trouble and belief systems come wrapped in certainty. When you have certainty, our rational mind ceases to play a primary function in our cognitive processes. But really, I can't say it better than Mark Twain; "it's not what you don't know that gets into trouble it's what you know for sure that just ain't so". And so we have a problem with certainty. And when it comes to certainty I really can't recommend a better book than this book by Robert A. Burton, On Being Certain or Believing You're Right Even When You're Not. And in it he covers a range of material about certainty and our sense of knowing. For instance a very interesting example, called the Challenger study. This pertains to how we remember things around dramatic events in our lives and when the Space Shuttle exploded dr. Ove Kneisser, psychologist and the father of cognitive psychology had 106 of his students record in their journals what they were doing at the time, what was happening, how they felt. All of the details they can remember when the event actually happened. And then he interviewed them two and a half years later. Now as you might expect, 25% of them got a lot of the details completely wrong. And at least half had a few details incorrect but what was really interesting was the reaction of some of the students to their handwritten notes. In the words of one of the students, "that's my handwriting but that's not what happened!" So the students had complete certainty over their sense of knowing even in the face of very convincing evidence, their own handwritten notes. Now Burton uses another example along these lines and it has to do with Cotard syndrome, this is dr. Cotard who described a syndrome in patients who develop a delusion of negation. Negation of their own existence, negation of limbs, that their limbs are putrefying and what's really interesting about the syndrome is the unshakable belief in these patients that they're dead. Now Burton describes one case, Miss B who came into the hospital with a very  severe case of viral encephalitis. While she was there she began to complain about things not feeling real and that she was dead. The hospital staff had her hold her hand to her heart so that she can feel her beating heart and she admitted she could feel her beating heart. But she argued that the beating of her heart was in no way evidence that she was alive when she was clearly dead. She was absolutely certain she was dead, all evidence to the contrary. So Burton uses Cotard's syndrome, the Challenger study, placebo effects to show that when there's a conflict between rational evidence and what we see with our own eyes, vs our feeling of knowing, our sense of rightness and correctness, that feeling wins out almost every time and he argues that there's some physiological basis to this feeling of knowing that is so powerful that it makes a rational thought seem, feel, wrong or irrelevant. And he felt that, he argued, that it had to do with the limbic system. Now the limbic system is associated with our primitive brain, it's the seat of strong emotions, fear and hatred and anger. In fact the amygdala controls all the strong emotions. The hippocampus plays a role in converting short-term memories into long-term memories. Burton describes a study, a cortical mapping study, where they stimulated regions of the temporal lobe associated with parts of our lymbic system. And he described patient responses where, if that particular part of the temporal lobe associated with limbic system was stimulated, they had a feeling of certainty. They had a feeling of certainty, a sense of knowing, a deja vu, a sense of familiar.. a sense of familiarity in a strange environment. So, he argued that if it is possible to stimulate the brain and produce these primary feelings and knowing it's very much other, like other primary things like anger. And he argued that our feeling of certainty is actually closely associated with these primary feelings in our lymbic system. And it's not surprising that certainty is connected with the limbic system. Recent neurological research has shown that social threats and rewards evoke the same neuro-chemical responses as actual physical threats and rewards. A threat to our certainty evokes the same neurotransmitter response as an actual physical threat. So it would seem to be connected to the limbic system. So we have a number of issues, things that we are up against. Well, we don't know what we don't know but we always seem to forget that. We have certainty in what we think we know and it limits the acquisition of new knowledge. There's this myth of the rational objective mind where we're really under the control of our limbic system and what we really need to do is encourage the pursuit of uncertainty, but that's completely counter to our physiology in our evolution. So here we are, all of our beliefs and our biases and our blind spots trying to make shapes of the darkness and we construct stories that match the shapes that we think we see. So should we stop trying to discover what's out there, looking back in the darkness? I don't think we could even if we tried We're compelled to ask these basic questions like the clever king about the cosmos, the Sun, the Earth, the stars and life itself. But we're also compelled to construct stories, to help fill the gaps in our understanding, to give us satisfying answers however wrong they are, to answer those basic questions. So like any device that we use to investigate the cosmos, we need to understand the limitations of our own mind. When the device, when the instrument is giving us noisy or valid data, are we believing what we see or seeing what we believe? I would argue that dark matter is more of a manifestation of gray matter, so we end up seeing it everywhere we look. It's been shown that our rational mind cannot work independently of our threat-reward responses. We're under the sway of the limbic system like some great psychological schoolyard bully in our mind. Our ability to objectively observe is severely limited by our biases and beliefs, we know that! And yet we have this myth of the rational objective mind. We think we got it all figured out, just a few more pieces, we're almost there. But how can we, when we don't know what we don't know. Have we learned nothing from the clever King. Which reminds me, I haven't actually finished the story of the clever king and the sage. The sage learned that it was unwise to provoke a frustrated and angry king and he spent a few years learning even more wisdom in the King's dungeons, unfortunately. The King learned wisdom, over many years, because he discovered that he could never complete his great machine, and that it was probably based on faulty principles anyway. And so he learned that the sage was actually right. So he released the sage who was very ancient by that time and they together, in the remaining years, taught the clever people in the kingdom about the foolishness of certainty and the rich rewards of uncertainty. Now having said all that I have a few qualified certainties of my own. I'm only human after all and I'm encumbered with my own belief systems. So I believe that there is no matter and energy in the universe that cannot be experienced and experimented with here. We do not live in an island of normal matter in otherwise exotic universe. The darkness beyond the campfire is not inherently different, is just as yet unlit. That the universe is a manifestation of gravity and electricity and magnetism in a glorious interplay that we're only just now on the verge of glimpsing. And that in this quest we need to embrace uncertainty and allow ourselves only a qualified provisional understanding of what we think we see in the darkness beyond the campfire. Thank you! 
[Music] In Part 1 of the cosmology of the Electric Universe, we looked at how the electrical systems of the Earth and the planets exist in the larger electrical body of the Sun. Do we stop at the body of our Sun? No of course, we do not. The Sun lives within a larger world. The Sun lives inside the galaxy. This, of course, is not a picture of our galaxy because we cannot take a picture of our galaxy any more than a cell in your liver could take a picture from the outside of your  body. We do have decent evidence to believe that our galaxy looks something like this. When we shift up in scale, we can ask what's the relation of each star to the larger galactic body of which it is a part? Every star is transforming galactic currents and fields. In our schematic, we picture current coming from the galaxy and being transformed by the stars, and we must allow that stellar transformation of galactic energies is just as complex as what we are learning about the electrical transformations taking place on planets. In other words, my little drawing is very inadequate but it does convey the main point: stars transform galactic energy. So, are we done with our picture? No! Our most excellent engineers and astrophysicists have given us a larger view to contemplate. In this picture, which is a computer generated picture, each dot, each tiny dot represents galaxies and clusters of galaxies. This is the large-scale structure of our Universe. And you might not be surprised to  learn that this filament-like structure was a complete surprise to standard  cosmologists. But it was predicted by Electric Universe theorists. Gravity cannot explain this structure, but electricity, and the flow of electricity does predict  this. Keeping our theme of each world eating and transforming energies from the larger world it lives in, we can see that galaxies are transforming energies from, well it's hard to say from what, we're kind of at the limits of what we can talk about. But we can say  something like, ‘galaxies transform the great currents and fluxes that course through our universe as a whole’. Coming back to our own human scale. All plants, all  animals, all humans, transform energy that comes from the Sun. This is rather  obvious. Plants turn sunlight and minerals into leaves and fruits, animals digest the fruits and the leaves, and we humans eat all of it. We only move and think and feel because of the flow of electricity in our bodies. If it were possible to stop the flow of charged particles and electric fields within us, then our thoughts, feeling and sensations would instantly stop. I am studying the electrical connections that exist between one living creature and another, or exist between every plant and animals and the Earth. Or between living creatures and other planets. Or even the connections between an individual man or woman and the Sun. All of this is my field of study. As a closing note, since I said that cosmology must also include our aspirations, what does this new cosmology say about our yearnings and our hopes? In a better cosmology, we would recognize that caterpillars do sometimes turn into butterflies, and buds do sometimes turn into flowers, and  the sperm and the egg do sometimes become babies. These transformations are part of our life and part of every aspect of the living Universe. The Electric Universe model says that the brightness of a star is a function of how much galactic current it is transforming. Bright stars are transforming a lot of galactic energy, dim stars transform little. Maybe the stars we see burning more brightly, are actually doing more work for the galaxy and the brightness is really more of a side effect, a consequence. The bright stars in the sky are literally responding to some galactic need that requires more energy. And we can go one step further because we know that some stars completely transform into a supernova, putting out for a short time more energy than the entire galaxy. In the old view, this is an accident, and unconnected to anything else going on in the galaxy. But in a better cosmology, we can see that the supernova is a star that has taken a  huge leap in its ability to transform galactic energy. A supernova is burning so incredibly brightly because it it has found a way to be much more useful. The Crab Nebula was once  an ordinary star, doing ordinary work for the galaxy. And then something  changed. And it has since been churning out prodigious amounts of super-high frequencies. What is the purpose of these enormous energies, at these very high  frequencies? We don't know, but I do know that these supernovae play an important galactic function and I know that a similar transformation is possible  for you and me at our own scale. We could actually take a leap and be much more useful to the world around us. We could start emitting much more energy at much higher and finer frequencies. This promise is one of the reasons I pursue the Electric Universe paradigm. In closing let me say that I do not think electricity explains everything, but including electricity  in our explanations, provides a much more coherent view than using gravity to explain everything. I personally think as we try explaining how galaxies and Suns behave, we will have to be open to including other forms of energy that are  beyond light and electricity. I also want to remind us all that hubris is one of the lowest places we can go to intellectually. Hubris, a form of  arrogance. This knowing that I'm right, believing I have explained everything, and then being offended when my brilliance is questioned; believing that human understanding can penetrate the ultimate degrees of truth, all this is hubris. And let none of us fall to that level. And besides, hubris makes us all quite boring and oh so tiresome. In this truly exciting adventure, a lot of what we are proposing might be totally wrong, but I know that a lot of what has been proposed is totally right, more right than things have been for many years in science. [Music] [Music] 
As you can imagine there's a lot to be said about how do you form a shish kebob of planets and how do you capture a star, a passing star. So this is going to be a race against time. ...the clicker we have now here it is, yep yep... we have the new less modest lectern THE STAR 'PROTO-SATURN' This is Saturn before it became a gas giant planet in the solar system. And this is a quote from Roger Wescott, the late Roger Wescott who was a good friend and used to come to the Kronia conferences and actually spoke at one or two, "Pre-history was a dream turned nightmare. Mankind forgot the dream because it was too remote and the nightmare because it was too shocking. The prehistory that we have confabulated, however, is too bland to be believed." He was a professor of anthropology and linguistics at Drew University, Madison, New Jersey. What does the star Proto-Saturn mean? It means a star became the gas giant we now call Saturn. This claim is outrageous according to present-day cosmology and our understanding of stars but it is supported by lifetimes of forensic research into the earliest recorded memories of mankind and it is confirmed by the recognition of global prehistoric petroglyphs as representations of the many distinctive forms of plasma instability seen in the highest energy electrical discharges. It has become crystal clear that the legendary Thunderbolts of the planetary gods were real and they accompanied a major recent disturbance of the solar system but perhaps the greatest puzzle for scholars has been the references to Saturn as the first Sun and in my home in Australia the original inhabitants have legends of a time when there were two suns, a greater and a lesser Sun. Details in their Dreamtime Stories have no reference points other than in high-energy plasma experiments. They were not dreaming! My concern since I became aware of this evidence has been to make classical physics sense of Saturn as a star and to understand the sequence of events that led to the seemingly peaceful solar system we see today. So we have these big questions; Do we really have a 4.6 billion year old clockwork solar system? How do planets form? ...I beg your pardon... How do planets form? How did the atmosphere and ocean form? Was the past like the present? And I think from the evidence that you've seen that Dave Talbot and Ev Cochran have provided, it certainly wasn't anything like the present. So if Saturn was a star within the memory of mankind, it throws some big questions into sharp relief and in doing so it throws a harsh light on to our self-satisfying fictional story of the earth and the solar system. The Origin of the Solar System Professor William McRae wrote; It is impossible to discover the origin of the solar system by observing it now and working steadily backwards in time in order to infer the whole of its past history. The solar nebula model has no successful predictions to its name! That's a bit of a sobering thought. The... Here we go, yeah. My meeting with Dr. Velikovsky I visited him in 1979 at his home in Princeton, New Jersey, he very gracefully accepted my family as well, I've got photos of my daughters with him but none with me, I was rather shy of asking him for a photo. But the main question then was this problem that he faced with astronomers. What don't we know about gravity, there's something really missing in our physics. Velikovsky argued that planets change orbits, exchange Thunderbolts and quickly settle into peaceful orbits. Rapid settling following chaos defies our understanding of gravitational systems which for more than a two-body system are chaotic as I said. If one planet departs from its normal orbit by a small amount, it will affect the others and there's no way of restoring the original situation, the system flies apart. Our understanding of gravity and solar system mechanics is inadequate. So we have a new cosmology. A new forensic approach to old evidence produced the recent history of the solar system that requires a critical examination of modern science instead of dogmatic rejection of evidence. The result is an entirely new cosmology, the Electric Universe. The history of this new cosmological paradigm goes back to 'Worlds in Collision' in 1950. In the last chapter Velikovsky referred to Jupiter and Saturn as stars. And I quote, "There I wrote with respect to the future that some dark star like Jupiter or Saturn may be in the path of the Sun and may be attracted to the system and cause havoc in it." That was in chapter 9, The end. Worlds in Collision comprises only the last two acts of a cosmic drama, wrote Velikovsky in Kronos volume 5 number 1 in 1979. That's the Kronos issue there. And then we have David Talbott's remarkable reconstruction of the earlier acts in our prehistoric skies that was published in 1980. Then in Aeon vol 5 number 5 in January 2000, I first published my physical model of Earth's relationship to the Dark Star dubbed Proto-Saturn in Stars in an Electric Universe. It had appeared earlier on my website as Other Stars Other Worlds Other Life in December 1999. And then we have all the books by Dwardu Cardona and they're all there, God Star published 2006, Metamorphic Star 2008, Primordial Star 2009, Flare Star 2011. So the evidential history is; Earth and Mars were satellites orbiting a brown dwarf star; It was a very hospitable environment for life; Atmosphere, water and minerals were deposited on the satellites; The system changed spectacularly on encountering the Sun; The brown dwarf flared and ejected a new satellite; An axial column of satellites was formed; And intense plasma discharge phenomena were observed. The terms giant and dwarf applied to stars are misleading. That is calculated on the standard model of the Sun And the notion of a star's age based on its appearance or spectrum has no validity for the same reason. Stars on the main sequence may be characterized as self-regulating cosmic power transformers, as I spoke about this morning, that focus diffuse galactic electrical energy to catalyze fusion in their photospheres to provide radiant energy. Like the Sun, such stars derive their luminosity from very bright anode tufts in their plasma sheaths. Moving diagonally upward to the right, the current density increases. Anode tufting becomes more crowded and their mutual repulsion forces the photosphere to grow to accommodate them. At the top right of the main sequence the light from those Tufts is electric blue of a true arc and the stars appear as blue giants, intensely hot objects appearing considerably larger than our Sun. As you might expect, blue giants tend to be concentrated on the central axes of our galaxy's spiral arm discharges. Red stars must collect more electrons than the plasma can deliver continuously to its surface. So bright anode tufts are unnecessary. The anode expands instead by forming a negative space charge sheath and as that sheath expands its electric field grows stronger. Electrons caught up in the field are accelerated to ever greater energies and before long they become energetic enough to excite neutral particles they collide with in the outer sheath to take on a uniform red glow. A white dwarf is a star whose discharge current is satisfied by all the approaching electrons, drift electrons plus those those randomly move towards the anode. It has no anode tufting. It is rather like moving a low-energy corona of a main-sequence star down into the atmosphere of the white dwarf star. That's why the star, that the dim star Sirius B is brighter in X-rays than Sirius A because the corona emits X-rays. So what is a brown dwarf? To summarize, a red or brown dwarf can be characterized as an independent gas giant type object under low electrical stress from its galactic environment. A main-sequence star is electrically stressed so it resorts to becoming a tufted anode which, as I said, regulates the output of the star, this is why most, all bright stars appear to twinkle. They don't change from day to day. Red Giants are normal stars under low electrical stress. White Dwarfs are stars with a low luminosity coronal discharge only. ...was that at the same point... Red Giant are normal stars and allow additional stress... and White Dwarfs... So, size matters. Brown Dwarfs come with a major drawback for astronomers, their stellar radii are hard to determine accurately. In the Electric Universe, Brown Dwarfs are not dwarf stars, instead all red stars have a bloated glowing anode sheath which expands and contracts in order to collect the amount of electrons required for that discharge. As the anode sheath grows, its electric field grows which results in the prodigious and unexplained stellar winds from cool red giants. If the winds were due to the heat of the corona, then this puts paid to that idea. In a December 2008 NASA report, the brightness of a brown dwarf at 17 light years distance was twice that expected for a brown dwarf with its particular temperature. The solution? The object must have twice the surface area, they said. It must be twins. Such ad hocery is unnecessary in the Electric Universe model. A brown dwarf's photosphere is much larger than the standard model of such stars predict. The Cradle of Life And this goes back to the idea of the Garden of Eden period in man's memory. If you are a satellite orbiting within that anode glow, and this is not an outrageous idea because astronomers have suggested the same thing for red giants that planets could actually orbit within that star because the atmosphere is such low density. In fact, we orbit in the sun's atmosphere if you like and it doesn't cause us any trouble. But within that glowing shell, the radiant energy received from that envelope is constant over the entire globe. The light from the plasmasphere is not reflected light, it's a radiant energy. Brown Dwarfs radiate blue and ultraviolet light, even though they are cool at a temperature around 950 K. This is further evidence that we are looking at a mix of an electrical red anode glow and coronal ultraviolet blue end of the spectrum. There are no seasons, no tropics, and no ice caps. A planet does not have to rotate. Its axis can point in any direction, and its orbit can be eccentric, and you'll still get this beautiful, even temperature over the whole body. The radiant energy received by the planet will be strongest at the blue and red ends of the spectrum so photosynthesis, which relies on red light, would be very active. The sky light would be a pale purple, which maybe is referred to by the classical purple dawn of creation. And I know that in Canberra we have this new Arboretum, which is fantastic, and all of the new trees that are being planted are put in red plastic to start with. And I asked the head of the Arboretum why they did that, and he said, the plants grow much better in red light. Water molecules dominate the spectra of brown dwarfs. So you want to know where the Earth's water came from? The light on Earth was dim and purplish amid a continuous mist of water. No other bodies in the system were visible. This is what Dave mentioned yesterday. This explains the abundant water on Earth and many satellites of the gas giant planets and the rings of Saturn. And the red light, warmth and water was ideally suited for giant ferns, it explains the gigantic lush vegetation found at the poles fossilized as coal. Now the problem faced by life on planets orbiting a red star, I think you saw last thing, last night, which was this flaring red dwarf. So this tendency to flare up is a problem. The reason for this is that, as I said, the red stars don't have the current regulation afforded by the bright photosphere. So the response of a red star to a sudden electrical disturbance in their environment is to shed charged matter in a flare up. They may also change in apparent size as the anode glow accommodates to the electrical environment. I think this would account for the great dyings in the geological record, and the episodic deposit of vast sediment and mineral layers on the earth and on other bodies too. Every body that's been looked at is layered. What's more, it explains for the first time the oceans of salty water on Earth. Comets cannot be responsible because they have little or no water and little or no sodium chloride. To see how much of this I want to show you because we saw this yesterday.   This is that, referring to that superflare you saw yesterday and you remember the astrophysicists said, anyone who was on a planet orbiting that star at the time would be having a very bad day. I think the Earth has had its bad days, and they're reflected in the geological record.   Mass Extinctions As I said, those flare-ups can be so drastic that it would practically wipe out the life on, any existing life on those satellites of that dwarf star. This raises an interesting side issue, and that is, ironically, intelligent life can't communicate through such a plasma shell using radio waves. So the lack of intelligible radio signals in the SETI project is understandable. In fact, denizens of such worlds would most likely be unaware of the universe at large. Now astronomers also submit that orbiting a red dwarf is possibly one of the best places to look for life. What they've never considered is orbiting inside a red dwarf.   I don't think I'll talk about this one, this is a recent report of a spotty brown dwarf which suggests there are things orbiting within that red anode sheath causing a dimming of the red glow behind where that satellite happens to be. They're calling it weather but of course if it's anode glow it has nothing to do with weather.   So this is a picture of the Brown Dwarf Proto-Saturn as I see it. Now there would have been many more bodies than you see there but I've included Mars and Earth and Proto-Saturn because they're the main players at this stage. 50% of red dwarfs have Earth-sized planets in their conventional habitable zone. This suggests there are a large number hidden inside the red star's glow and you can say that too because our gas giants all have large numbers of satellites orbiting quite closely. But you'll note there is no Venus at this stage. Gigantism It wasn't just pterodactyls that struggled to get up off the ground. Scaling of muscle and bone strengths shows that dinosaurs could not have raised their bodies off the ground in today's gravity. For them to move about, Earth's gravity needed to be about 1/3rd of today's. Global extinction and fossilization requires far more (pardon me) than a simple impact Clearly, we have no understanding of the cause of gravity. Is Gravity Electrical? Gigantism in the animal kingdom ...Sorry, beg your pardon. The question is of fundamental importance for cosmology and our understanding of the solar system. And the answer should provide insights into the demise of the dinosaurs; the sky our ancestors saw and why they feared 'doomsday'. This is the crucial thing, this is the thing I asked Velikovsky; What don't we understand about gravity? And of course, we're getting confirmation you'd ever sought from this comet visit because all the measurements say it has very low mass, it can't be rock and I'm saying no, you don't understand gravity, it may appear to be of low density but it's made of rock. This is the kind of thing that the Earth would have been, a situation for the Earth when it was orbiting Proto-Saturn presumably. So we get to Proto-Saturn's Capture. Capture by the Sun is almost impossible gravitationally because there is no energy loss, there's no way of losing energy, a body coming in and swinging around the Sun will depart again because there's nothing to put the brakes on and make it go around the Sun. Electrical capture has a huge cross-section by comparison. Two stars will see each other electrically once their heliospheres or astrospheres, as they call generically, touch. Now the sun's heliosphere is 100 Astronomical Units (AU) in radius, another star would be something comparable, so you're talking about a huge cross-section. So the chances of capture of an object is far greater than gravity would suggest. I actually, I'll explain more about this when I give my presentation on cosmology, this change in gravity and so on. So Proto-Saturn changed from being a star, that is an anode in interstellar space, to becoming a cathode or cometary body in the Sun's heliosphere and, like all cathodes, surface material is electrically ejected and the body may fragment under internal electrical stress. And this is the kind of thing which the ancients reported. As you may expect in the electrical model, a brown dwarf desert has been identified close to bright main sequence stars because the brown dwarf switches off, becomes a gas giant and this is what is seen by astronomers, you won't find brown dwarfs orbiting closely to bright stars. So gravitational theory only accommodates accretion disks. Expulsion disks are believed impossible despite the copious evidence of stars ejecting matter in jets, even the Sun does it in a modest coronal mass ejection kind of way. It's also interesting to note the large number of close-orbiting gas giants about nearby stars. This fits the electrical fissioning argument and not the nebular accretion model. Gas giants have also been discovered at distances from their stars where they couldn't have formed within the age of the star. All of the impossible planets and stars being discovered are not impossible in the Electric Universe model. Instead, they are expected based on that model. I'll deal with this issue in my presentation on cosmology. So it explains why there are so many hot Jupiters, have been found closely orbiting a star and it explains the expulsion rings and many satellites of the gas giant planets in our solar system. And the fact that Saturn's is the most spectacular indicates that it was the last or most recent gas giant to flare up and eject matter. Right. Axial Tilt Families A simple method of identifying related objects in the solar system is to look at their axial tilts because in the close relationship between a gas giant or a brown dwarf and its close orbiting satellites, there will generally be phase-lock. The satellites all have the same face pointing towards the parent. And as these close orbiting satellites therefore will have their rotation axis aligned with the parent. Having the same degree of axial tilt modified by precession after disturbance like the tearing apart of the Saturnian system, that tilt to the plane of their orbits, of the ecliptic, should be roughly the same and we can, this is one way of trying to identify members of the same family because the Sun has an adopted family. So when you look at the planets here, you've got Mars and you've got Venus and you've got Earth and you've got Saturn, the main players but Venus is the odd one out. Because research shows with great certainty that it was born from Proto-Saturn in a massive flare up resulting from the initial adjustment to the present Sun's quite different electrical environment and this is why there were all those radiating streamers because it was born as a comet from an already cometary body, so the cometary body fissioned and the resulting ejected body went into, it was still captured by its parent but it too was busily discharging frantically trying to adjust to its electrical environment. So all the radiating streamers and the colossal Venus Comet appearances can be explained by this model. Now, when Venus was ejecting material it occurred equatorial, we were sitting underneath this chain of objects and the streamers were coming out radiating from Venus and this is actually what we see on Venus today, the scars are wrapped around the equator. But also when these bodies are ejected the main body may be spinning this way and the material is ejected in a stream, it's given a backward kick by its parent and the result is that the satellite initially, at least, has a backward rotation and this is what Venus has, very slow backward rotation. It had no time before the system was totally disrupted to achieve phase lock with Proto-Saturn. So we look at Saturn. In June 2004, the Electric Universe was the only model to predict the surface features of smog shrouded Titan. Titan, being a huge moon which would be classed as a planet if it was separate from Saturn. These surface features were predicted before they were revealed in detail by the Huygens probe from the Cassini spacecraft. In "Cassini's Homecoming" I wrote, "A scenario follows that is so alien to any conventional theory of Saturn's history but should be easily tested against information gained from the Cassini mission. It shows striking connections between many seemingly unrelated facts about certain planets." That is something that conventional cosmogony or cosmology has not been able to do. Until recently, Saturn was an independent brown dwarf star with his own entourage of close orbiting small planets and Dave Talbott alluded to those last night with the circling objects around the god, the god Saturn. The tilt of Saturn at 27 degrees to the ecliptic plane is itself an enigma unless it formed independently from the Sun and the axial tilts of Saturn, Earth and Mars are very similar. Are we on the same page? No, let me catch up. The Titan is very important to study because it may be a sibling of the Earth, Mars and Venus. It's an enigma, having a massive atmosphere mainly of nitrogen with the pressure of the surface 1.6 times that of Earth's air at sea level, this is for a smaller body, and anomalously high nitrogen 15 levels in a 95% nitrogen 14 atmosphere. It is not a body more than 4 billion years old. The Electric Universe was the only model to predict the surface features before Huygens descended and photographed it and that was based on the kind of electrical sculpting seen on Venus, Mars and Earth. The earliest reports from scientists are usually the most revealing before they have time to recover from shock and make up stories. So what was discovered in the first close flyby of Titan? In New Scientist of November 6, 2004, just after the event, Titan images add to moon's mystery wrote Stephen Battersby. The world got its first peek at the surface of Saturn's moon Titan last week. The images were taken as Cassini's, Cassini-Huygens spacecraft swept past the moon. The images show a landscape that is clearly still being shaped. Where'd we heard that before? We heard that about Venus. Although Titan must have suffered numerous meteor impacts in the past, its surface today is largely crater free. Once again, just like Venus. Somehow these scars must have been eroded or filled in. There's that operative word "somehow". We are seeing a place that is alive geologically speaking says Charles Elachi. This is what they said about Venus, it must have overturned the entire surface recently. That's precisely what was said about Venus when the Magellan orbiter revealed that planet's surface. It is only supposition that Titans surface is still being shaped. It is based on the belief that Titan must have suffered numerous meteor impacts in the past and therefore something must have occurred from within the moon to fill the craters. However, like Venus, there may have been no impact craters to fill. Some initial comments by Cassini team members, accompanying this picture in that little insert there of Titan from the descending Huygens probe, reflected on the Venus-like appearance of features on Titan. Now I'd predicted these before the event. "These remind me of what we have observed in the past on Venus." This is a quote. Another quote, "We now have the key to understanding what shapes Titan's landscape." - said Dr. Martin Tomasco, principal investigator for the descent imager. He added, "Geological evidence for precipitation, erosion, mechanical abrasion and other fluvial activity says that the physical processes shaping Titan are much the same as those shaping Earth." Oh yeah But nonpolar liquid methane is not like liquid water as Jerry Pollack would tell anyone. In the atmosphere such molecules form smog, not heavy rain drops. This demonstrates the problem of interpreting evidence when your thinking is limited to flowing liquids to carve channels. The channels on Titan bear the hallmarks of lightning imprinted on the surface. As I've done there, I've inverted the black and white and turned it up the other way to make it look more like lightning. The channels on Titan bear the hallmarks of lightning imprinted on the surface. And the lack of a methane ocean was predicted because Titan's atmosphere is not yet in equilibrium, after recent events. So a vast reservoir of methane is not needed to make good the losses expected over the 4.7 billion years required by the solar nebula model. Because the expectation was that the Huygens Lander, the Huygens probe, would go through the clouds that it'd photograph it on the way down and then it would plop into a methane or ethane ocean. They never found it. Titan's Enigmatic Atmosphere Titan's atmosphere is believed by many scientists to be similar to Earth's early atmosphere, billions of years ago. This is the usual story, we're out there to try and show how the earth was born. Toby Owen, principal scientist at JPL said, "What we've got is a very primitive atmosphere that has been preserved for 4.6 billion years. Titan gives us a chance for cosmic time travel, going back to the very earliest days of Earth when it had a similar atmosphere. All conjecture. But in a sense Toby Owens may be right. Titan can give us insights about the Proto-Saturnian environment but just take off about five zeros from that age figure. The striking disparity in nitrogen isotopes is telling us something about the way planetary atmospheres are formed rather than how they evolved. Hannes Alfvén wrote in Evolution of the Solar System, and I quote: "The Laplacian concept of a homogeneous gas disc provides the general background for most current speculations. The advent of magnetohydrodynamics about 25 years ago, and experimental and theoretical progress in solar and magnetic and magnetospheric physics have made this concept obsolete but this seems not yet to be fully understood. While acknowledging Alfvén's point, it is possible to go a step further and invoke several processes available in the plasma discharge model that would affect Titan's atmosphere. Was Titan captured or born earlier by Proto-Saturn in a major electrical event in its recent history? This is hinted at by Titan's eccentric orbit which cannot have persisted for billions of years and isotopes will separate in the combined electric and magnetic fields of a cosmic plasma discharge. So this is where we get into the problem of nitrogen in planetary atmospheres, you've got Venus with it's heavy carbon dioxide atmosphere. How did these happen? Why are these differences? And it comes down to the electrical effects on atmospheric molecules which I don't think I'll discuss here, just, I've done so many, I have so many slide preparations, I'm not quite sure which things I've addressed. Ah, here we go, yes. We come to Venus. Saturn's last-born and a birth witnessed by humanity. The planet shows a surprisingly young surface that gave rise to ad hoc theories of resurfacing events. They're unnecessary. Venus is a baby. The Electric Universe account explains its hellish temperature having been born recently from the interior of a brown dwarf star and its thick 96% carbon dioxide and 4% nitrogen atmosphere was inherited from its brown dwarf parent, was subsequently modified by cosmic discharges. The amount of nitrogen in the Venusian atmosphere is relatively small, compared to the amount of carbon dioxide, but because the atmosphere is so much thicker than that on Earth its total nitrogen content is roughly four times higher than the Earth's, even though on Earth nitrogen makes up about 78% of the atmosphere. But Venus may have begun with more nitrogen, more like the Earth. Now nitrogen, and this isn't understood by astrophysicists, is catalyzed by hot iron atoms to carbon monoxide, the two molecules have very little energy difference. So if you get a catalytic effect on a hot iron surface, it will convert nitrogen to carbon monoxide. And the carbon monoxide and water on a hot surface gives you carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The hydrogen, being a very light gas of course, escapes to space and it's still escaping -- it's been shown. The heavier deuterium tends to be left behind which might explain Venus's 10 times higher ratio of deuterium to hydrogen than the Earth('s) and solar UV light is totally inadequate as an explanation if we accept the short history of Venus. Now notably, if water is being consumed at the surface and being converted into carbon dioxide with the surface carbon monoxide and the hydrogen is escaping, it's very interesting that water was found to mysteriously decrease as the surface was approached by the Venus landing craft. In other words, that reaction is still taking place today. So here we see the Venus's equatorial scars were caused by spectacular radial discharging which was faithfully recorded by the petroglyph artists. The thicker the atmosphere the more filamentary the surface lightning becomes as you see. Venus carried away significant charge from its parent so that it still has a cometary magneto tail which was detected back in the 80's and its mountains glow with plasma discharges that reflect radar and this puzzled the scientists greatly: Why are the mountains of Venus shiny when we look at them in radar? And I wrote at the time, it's because they're all, got St. Elmo's fire type discharges at above a certain elevation and that's why just the peaks were glowing in the radar signal. Battle-Scarred Mars The devastated face of Mars shows the colossal gash of Valles Marineris stretching a third of the way around the planet. Carl Sagan in the Scientific American of September 1975 wrote, "The ultimate objective of comparative planetology it might be said, is something like a vast computer program into which we insert a few input parameters, perhaps the initial mass, composition and angular momentum of a proto planet and the population of neighboring objects that strike it and then derive the complete evolution of the planet." End of quote. Sagan's statement, it epitomizes everything that's wrong with modern science based on computer generated models of virtual-reality. The first law of computing is, and since I was in the computer industry all my working life, garbage in equals garbage out. Planetologists have adopted their story of the earth, sorry, adapted their story of the Earth to accommodate their findings on Mars. So we now have eras called the Noachian, the Hesperian and the Amazonian based on crater counting. But crater counting assumes the conventional story of formation of the solar system which, as I've shown, has no real evidential support. In fact, the evidence is strongly against it. In my next presentation, which is later today, I will talk about the damage on Mars but Mars was stripped of atmosphere, water and rocks. And the modern evidence, we are still receiving Mars rocks on Earth today!! And the evidence of Mars' battles with cosmic Thunderbolts is written hugely on its "scar-face". That was the name given to Mars by the North American Indians. What can conventional planetologists do with evidence like that? And of course we have the MAVEN mission that is going to tell us how Mars atmosphere was stripped off over 4 billion years. So whatever that mission was designed to do, the question, initial question, is irrelevant and wrong. And this is the really interesting thing. Is Earth a former Saturnian? And the first question is... Why continents and oceans of water? There's no other body in the solar system with continents and oceanic type basins like the Earth. Each planet has its own story of electrical birth and the scars of interplanetary thunderbolts in order to achieve orbitals' harmony. This is where the battles these cosmic battles with the Thunderbolts of the Gods can scar the face of a planet terribly but also the birth process itself can do the same. Electrical sculpting of planetary features is the most powerful concept missing from planetary scientists' toolkit. The Earth's unique oceanic basins with their mid-oceanic raised ridges and orthogonal coronal pattern, if you have a powerful discharge, high voltage discharge you get coronal discharges at right angles to the main discharge channel. And I would suggest that the Earth probably suffered the massive ocean basin carving as a feature of its birth. It was a pole to pole discharge. Mountain ranges with their electrically sculpted ridges and gullies and backbones of intrusive melted rock called granite signify surface and subterranean telluric currents unimagined by geologists. Global tectonics is a failed paradigm because it assumes undisturbed evolution of the Earth in place over millions of years. Brown dwarfs flare and deposit minerals and gases on their satellites. The flare ejects stellar matter from the brown dwarf equatorially or axially, most usually equatorially. The composition will vary depending on the depth from which matter is dredged up and the chance encounter between that ejected matter and each satellite. This I think explains the water and mineral deposits on Earth largely. So the rings of Saturn are a water ice remnant of flaring activity. Saturn was the source of the copious amounts of surface water on the Earth and probably the sodium and the chlorine in particular because it's hard to get chlorine out of rocks. Each planet has its own birth drama and complex history, this is why this solar system is a complete fruit salad of objects with all sorts of different surfaces and characteristics, axial tilts, rotation rates and so on. They are all individuals, you know. This explains why the Earth, Mars and Venus appear so different even though they may be members of the same family. There is no nebula gradation of physical properties of the planets and the ad-hoc suggestion of migration of planets only serves to confuse the issue. All the Electric Universe does is work with the forensic evidence about the most recent chapter in solar system history. So The Future? Professor Wescott is right, mankind's survival is astonishing. Of course, there are reports globally of dreadful heat and cold while the Earth established this new home in the solar system. This is to be expected on a cometary orbit. It seems to me that part of the answer for our survival lay in the great heat reservoirs of the oceans but there was also the exchange of electrical energy via the cometary discharge which may have provided some additional heat while circularizing the orbit of the Earth, as I'll discuss later. But as Roger Wescott makes clear, we may have no future if we do not understand our irrational behavior trying to imitate the power of the old gods in our ability to destroy each other and the environment. Velikovsky as a psychoanalyst, felt his most important legacy, as he makes clear in Mankind in Amnesia, was to help us understand our catastrophic past and by so doing begin to heal from those psychic wounds. Fear is a great cattle prod. But we are not cattle. Thank you! 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info The following presentation is an adaptation of the Mel Acheson Picture Of the Day article: Matter, Charge and Conjecture. The link to the article may be found in the description box of this video. Electricians know the electric force is thirty nine orders of magnitude stronger than gravity, and the graviticians know the gravitational force is 40 orders of magnitude stronger than electricity. This misses the point. On the purely mathematical level, you can plug numbers into the equations to get any magnitude of force you want. The gravitational force between two 10 kilogram lead spheres placed one meter apart is the figure on your screen. To equal that force with electricity, the spheres would have to be charged to this figure: This could be achieved with a current of one micro ampere in less than a millisecond. The technology of nylon rods  rubbed over cat fur can transfer enough static charge to overcome the gravitational attraction of lead spheres. But can you get electricity to move planets? That would require a lot of cats. The question is not relative strengths of forces but rather whether it's possible to accumulate enough charge and move it with enough power to toss planets around like electrons. Irving Langmuir could provide some enlightenment here. He's dead, but his discoveries linger on. One discovery was that just a few ions in a substance can cause it to behave in unexpected ways. It forms cells and filaments. Charges separate into double layers that insulate cells from each other. The filaments twist around each other. They writhe and radiate. They seem almost alive--which is why Irving called the substance a plasma. An accumulation of charge inside one cell doesn't interact with that in another cell until the double layers break down. Then they interact with tremendous power. Another discovery (maybe this wasn't Langmuir's) was that plasmas exhibit the same behavior over large ranges of scale. From millimeter-sized sparks in a lab that last a millionth of a second to kilometer-long lightning bolts that last several seconds, the same properties can be observed. A long list of investigators has tried to draw attention to the similarities between certain astronomical phenomena and these lab and terrestrial plasmas. Just on a theoretical level, it seems rather simple to scale up a lightning bolt that can toss around our lead spheres to the size of an interplanetary bolt that can toss around planets. But does it actually happen? We can't clip the leads from a planet-sized voltmeter across the solar system and measure the voltage drop. So we're left arguing about similarities. And we all know argument from analogy is fallacious. That doesn't mean it's necessarily wrong, only that it's uncertain. The idea of gravity tossing planets around is familiar, the idea of plasma doing it isn't. Much of our preference for one idea over another is simply the business of familiarity. Much of the work required to reach a new understanding of something is just this effort to make the unfamiliar familiar. By analogy with argument from analogy, argument from familiarity is also fallacious. After allowing for the preference for familiarity, gravity is in no better shape than plasma. We see large accumulations of matter-which we could just as easily see as large accumulations of charge if that idea were familiar. We assume an identity between the ideas of a large accumulation of matter and a large accumulation of mass, but mass is a property--that's not necessarily identical with quantity of matter. The Machian idea of inertial mass being the relationship of a particle of matter to all other particles within its sphere of communication implies that a newly created particle increases its mass as it ages. The Meta Model idea of gravitational mass being the shielding effect of other matter within the mean collisional distance of gravitons implies an upper limit of matter accumulations beyond which mass remains constant. We can't hatch a Machian chicken and see if it grows without feeding it corn, nor can we stick a large toothpick into cakes of Meta matter to see if there's uncooked mass in the middle. What we're stuck with is a conflict of paradigms. Each explains overlapping sets of data in different ways. We won't know for sure if the universe is electric until we travel to a Seyfert galaxy and stick our finger in the socket. Nor will we know for sure if it's gravitic until we drop a Newton's apple off the Leaning Tower of M87. The question of what's the truth is premature. The truth is this: no paradigm is believable, that is to say, none are certain. Being stuck with a conflict of paradigms is really an opportunity. We can choose whichever conjecture strikes our fancy and follow its implications to see if we can invent something new to make our lives more comfortable and exciting. It's not necessary to choose; it's an opportunity to choose. We're better off having more conjectures to choose from than having less. It's time to scrap the outworn philosophy of physics based on an illusory certainty. Instead, a more biological philosophy based on conjectures and refutations (Karl Popper's phrase) or blind variations with selective retention (Donald Campbell's phrase) would be more appropriate for small soft creatures living on a speck of terrestrial dirt and prancing around the cosmos. 
[Music] We have explored the current crisis in cosmology and what it means to have a revolutionary shift, or change in cosmology. Now let's step back and explore why cosmology matters in the first place. Why does cosmology matter beyond science and to non-scientists? And, how  does cosmology impact everyday life? We know that the study of the universe is important to science, but cosmology has impacts far beyond science and has a significant cultural component. Cosmology has impacted everything from anthropology and art to philosophy, morality, religion, and even politics. Cosmology also impacts our worldview and how we view ourselves in the world. Historically, changes in cosmology have precipitated tectonic cultural and ideological shifts that have shaped, and defined, the course of history. But  the relationship between cosmology and culture is not unidirectional. It is far more nuanced than that. Cosmological shifts are also a product of their time and often grow out of, and/or reinforce philosophical and socio-political settings that benefit from, or exploit the ideas promoted and reflected in a new cosmology. Let's look at these points in greater detail. Changes in cosmology can have tectonic ripple effects that influence the course of history. A classic example is Galileo and the Copernican Revolution and the shift from the geocentric to the heliocentric model of cosmology. This shift was so profound that it sparked a Scientific Revolution. But it also had profound consequences beyond science, as the educational director of the Italian consulate in the United States explains.  Quote, “Galileo's ideas not only sparked a scientific revolution, they initiated a large-scale revolution in human thinking. He changed the way we see the world and, more importantly, how we perceive ourselves within it.” End quote. The shift from an Earth-centric to a Sun-centric view of the cosmos, created an historic opportunity to unseat the power of the church and eventually led to what has been described as, quote,  “...the most important idea in modern history... The idea that any person, regardless  of his or her individual characteristics, can seek and find the truth.” This  meant that the catholic church and clergy were no longer the sole investigators and arbiters of the truth. Putting knowledge within reach of the individual and human deduction was a revolution in human thinking, one that landed Galileo in deep trouble with the church. However, the human mind as important and worthy of contemplation is an idea that predates Galileo, going back to Greek philosophy. When Socrates spoke of the need to know thyself, he shifted the emphasis of the contemporary philosophy from nature to humans. Promoting this type of thinking, eventually got him executed for atheism. Thus, Galileo fared far better than his philosophical predecessors. This may be due to the environment in which Galileo's ideas emerged. Galileo's discoveries were bolstered by, and reinforced, renaissance humanism, a philosophy that prioritizes  and glorifies the potential of the individual and the human mind, especially in the areas of creativity and the arts. Power structures tend to prop up, or support, the cosmological trends and tenets that serve larger pre- existing notions and agendas. While Galileo was condemned by the church, he was also backed by certain segments of the aristocracy. Specifically, he had the patronage of Lord del Monte, a nobleman and author of several important works on mechanics. The Scientific Revolution helped bring the fruits of humanism into the realm of politics. It shifted ultimate political power from the church to the monarchy, which was good news for monarchs and the nobility who could now rule without the blessing or approval of the church. But the monarchy supremacy was short-lived, as notions of human importance and self-actualization led individuals to question the absolute dominance of monarchs and rise up throughout history, most notably during the Enlightenment in a manner that eventually gave rise to republics, the nation- state and modern-day concepts of democracy. Overall, Galileo's ideas reinforced and furthered, the tide of humanism and were beneficial to opponents of the absolute power of the church and later on, the absolute power of monarchs. Beyond politics, the technological advancements of the Scientific Revolution also shaped economics and labor, moving the west from a feudal system to economies that are or were industrial and factory-based. It has been noted that quote “...the Scientific Revolution lit a path that, centuries later, with the help of a lot of steam and coal power, money, and labor, led to the Industrial Revolution.” End quote. This triggered the necessary socio-cultural shift from a predominantly rural population to an increasingly urbanized one. Galileo's impact also affected and reinforced trends in the arts. His influence reaffirmed and expanded upon, the work and focus of renaissance artists of his time, who were obsessed with representing man, and nature, as  geometrically accurate and realistic as possible. Despite the vast cultural and technological impacts, for many, the most profound impact of the scientific revolution, was how it helped shape our understanding of what it means to be human. Implied in the Scientific Revolution is the recognition that individuals matter and can think for themselves. This is arguably the underlying tenet of the Enlightenment or Age of Reason, that humankind is a rational thinking being capable of arriving at truth and therefore, enlightenment. Central  to enlightenment thought were, quote,”... the use and celebration of reason-- the power by which humans understand the universe and improve their own condition.” Implied in this belief is a view of the universe as reasonable and understandable. For, how can humans apply reason to understand a universe that is not reasonable or comprehensible? Enlightenment thinkers in England, France and throughout Europe, shared the common enlightenment themes of rational questioning and a belief in progress through dialogue. One can imagine how these notions would benefit and be bolstered by powerful or influential individuals that favored republics and parliamentary forms of governance, since these are characterized by dialogue and cooperation between and among the people and/or their representatives. This is an example of the nuanced relationship between cosmology and culture, which can be described as a feedback loop, wherein sociocultural powers tend to adopt, and then promote, those parts of cosmology that can shape and influence present and/or future outcomes and behavior. Relativism  is another modern-day example. While much has been noted about Einstein's Theory of Relativity and its influence on relativism, relativism as an idea, goes back to the ancient world. Though it did not gain favor in ancient times and was refuted by philosophers such as Plato, arguments for relativism have existed throughout history. Moreover, there is presently no philosophical consensus on what Relativism actually means. Relativism  as I use it here, refers to the doctrine that knowledge, truth and morality are not absolute. Known respectively as epistemological, or  cognitive relativism and moral relativism. I believe that it was not until contemporary powers and interests in politics, academia and/or economics had a need for, and could benefit from, moral and cognitive relativism, that relativism was fully promoted and normalized in the popular culture. Einstein and his Special Theory of Relativity provided a good opportunity and catalyst for this. Reinforced by the Theory of Relativity, relativism eventually impacted art, philosophy and modern culture, influencing an/or engendering everything from abstract cubist art to postmodern theory and identity politics. As noted in an article in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy quote, ”...the popularity of the very idea of relativism in the 20th century owes something to Einstein’s Special Theory of Relativity, which was to be used both as model and as well as a vindication for various relativistic claims.” End quote. that article points to Gilbert Harman as one of the contemporary philosophers to use Einsteinian relativity as a model for philosophical versions of relativism. Harman has stated that quote, ”According to Einstein’s Theory of Relativity even an object's mass is relative to a choice of spatio-temporal framework.... I'm going to argue for a similar claim about moral right and wrong.... I'm going to argue that moral right and wrong.... are always relative to a choice of moral framework.” End quote. It is interesting to note that Harman wrote this in 1996, which is several decades after Einstein and curiously only a few years before identity politics began to gain serious and ubiquitous momentum as well as the support of the establishment in the West. The 2000’s witnessed the rise of identity politics which is grounded in post-modern notions of relativism and the replacement of traditional forms of left-wing opposition with identity-based movements which are often sympathetic to the establishment. Under identity politics, relativism is exploited to fragment, dilute and/or diffuse, political opposition  and ultimately, to serve power. Let's take a closer look at relativism. Epistemological relativism espouses the idea that there is no absolute truth to be had, since all truth is relative. Similarly, moral relativism holds that morality, right and wrong, good and bad, is also relative and varies from person to person. Such notions fly in the face of the Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment era's emphasis on the ability of the rational individual to seek and find Truth, with a capital T. Prior to relativism, philosophers argued that there was an absolute truth and an absolute way of approaching various aspects of life, especially with respect to morality and moral obligations. Moral relativism creates a philosophical slippery slope that can arguably be exploited, or abused, especially by those with power. If there is no such thing as an absolute right and wrong, then we are powerless to point out and confront the wrongs of those with power, since everything is relative. In other words, arguing that there is no such thing as absolute right and wrong, alleviates wrongdoers, big or small, from responsibility and accountability for wrongdoing. How convenient for the wrongdoer. Einstein was not a moral relativist and even recoiled at the misappropriation and misapplication of his theory in the non-sciences. As Einstein’s most prominent biographer has observed, quote, ”In both his science and his moral philosophy, Einstein was driven by a quest for certainty and deterministic laws. If his theory of relativity produced ripples that unsettled the realms of morality and culture, this was not caused by what Einstein believed but by how he was popularly interpreted.” End quote. Similarly, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy states, quote, ”It is...worth noting that Einstein did not think that the Theory of Relativity supported relativism in ethics or epistemology because, although in his model simultaneity and sameness of place are relative to reference frames, the physical laws expressing such relativity are constant and universal and hence in no sense relative.” End quote. It seems that Einstein's Theory of Relativity and by extension, contemporary cosmology, was misappropriated and misapplied in a manner that supports moral and cognitive relativism and the host of non-scientific or non-empirical interests they could potentially serve. A common criticism against epistemological relativism is that semantically, it contradicts or refutes itself. The statement, “all is relative,” holds itself to be absolute, therefore contradicting its original premise that all is relative. Put another way, if the statement “all is relative” is an absolute, then this contradicts relativism. And if  the statement is relative, then it does not have to be, or cannot be, accepted  as true. For this, many view relativism as a paradox. I believe paradox may be a contemporary motivation for the misapplication of Einstein. In Western culture, paradox is  increasingly presented as a good thing and is even celebrated and promoted in all areas of life, using science and cosmology as a justification for such arguments. For instance in a 2020 article entitled, ”Think Like Einstein: The Paradox Mindset”, the author notes that Einstein was used to conceiving and embracing opposite or contradictory ideas and that many Nobel prize-winning scientists are known to actively conceive multiple opposites simultaneously. Describing this as a paradox mindset, the author encourages readers to do the same, arguing that quote, “Embracing contradictory ideas is one of the main assets for raising creativity and is a better way forward.” End quote. The author concludes that strangeness is a good thing which ought to be embraced in the workplace. Similarly, in a 2020 BBC article on work culture, the author argues that the paradox mindset is the key to success in the workforce stating that quote, ”Although paradoxes often trip us up, embracing contradictory ideas may actually be the secret to creativity and leadership.” End quote. And in a talk at the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, scholars argued that the key to promoting peacemaking and peaceful intervention overseas is paradoxical thinking which they define as quote, ”...information that is inconsistent with held beliefs, and raises the sense of absurdity.” End quote. It is strange and perhaps disheartening to see paradox promoted as a good thing in the world of politics and peacekeeping. It is also odd to see politics discussed at the National Academy of Science. This  brings us back to earlier discussions about science and cosmology being used to justify larger and or pre-existing interests and agendas. It  also harkens back to what Thomas Kuhn implied about institutionalized science; that it is hegemonic and functions much like other institutions of power, such as religion or politics or, in the service of power. Promoting paradox and absurdity in politics and political intervention may be a way to disguise or preserve empire and political hegemony. Not least by framing inconsistency in absurdity as positive political strategy. Rhetoric about the benefits of paradox in politics and the workplace is somewhat evocative of that found in media articles on contemporary cosmology, which embrace and celebrate cosmological weirdness and paradox rather than problematizing it. As I note in a previous show, the increasing focus in mainstream media on the strange and wacky universe presents cosmic weirdness and contradiction as something that is matter-of-fact and non-problematic. Basically, the universe is a weird and unknowable place and that's okay because the universe does not have to make sense. If that's the case, then contemporary cosmology has failed us. For what good are science and empirical observation and analysis if they cannot give us answers? Rather than admit the failure or inability of contemporary cosmology to provide answers and explanations, mainstream science and mainstream media increasingly blame the failure on, or hide the failure behind, the strangeness of the universe. This suggests that mainstream cosmology is not actually interested in giving us answers. It also confirms what Thomas Kuhn believed about dominant or normal science. That it is hegemonic, dogmatic, and unyielding to falsification and change. At the sociocultural level, the promotion of a paradox mindset could be interpreted as giving people permission to act inconsistently, unpredictably, contradictory and/or without integrity. Rather than admit that systems or policies may be failing or contradictory, failure and contradiction can simply be repackaged as normal and acceptable, just as it is in cosmology. In terms of dominant discourse, this potentially opens the door to and/or justifies inconsistent, contradictory and deceptive discourse and narratives. As an aside, it is important to note that the paradox rationale is a tool that can only fully be exploited by those in a position of power. For if the average person on the street tried to argue in court that the law is relative or could be interpreted in a contradictory manner, it probably would not go very well for them. In closing, everything we discussed drives home just how influential cosmology is beyond the sciences, and how much it shapes and impacts the broader culture and human thinking. Cosmology and changes in cosmology have shaped and or fostered everything from the Scientific Revolution, to  present-day forms of governance, industry, philosophy, and morality. With respect to the most recent sea change in cosmology, that of Relativity and the Big Bang, theories and innovations in cosmology were misappropriated and misapplied by thinkers in the non-sciences in a manner that gave rise to various notions of relativism and eventually fostered a culture and worldview that embraces, celebrates, and promotes paradox, contradiction, and absurdity. This is a stark contrast to the Enlightenment's obsession with reason and rational thinking. We have been educated with clear evidence that cosmology is presently in a state of crisis and is inevitably heading towards revolution. Given that reality, our next logical step will be to explore what a future cosmology might look like, and how it will impact the broader culture and human thinking. [Music] 
Gerald Pollack Weather and EZ Water ― An Intimate Role of Separated Charge So I am going to talk about water but I'm going to talk about water in a special context and that is in the context of something that's really important around here and really important where I come from and that is weather. And so, I want to talk about water and weather and I hope to demonstrate to you that something is really important about weather that we haven't realized before and that is electrical charge which fits nicely into the theme of this conference. And, I guess, a shorter title would be, should I bring an umbrella to work? Okay, so let me start with a few questions. So, here's a question. Sometimes above the water you see a single cloud. But that's weird because you know, the water is evaporating from everywhere so how come only one cloud when the vapor rises all over? Is there some attraction of moisture that comes and pulls the moisture into this cloud or something else? How do we understand this? How come there's not one broad cloud that exists over the water? Another one. Maybe you haven't thought about this but what keeps the cloud afloat? Cloud consists of water, water is heavy, cloud like this consists of, I could give you in kilograms, the weight and such but it's convenient to talk about the weight in terms of elephants. So, this is the equivalent of perhaps a thousand or so elephants. And how come the elephants don't fall on your head? Maybe it's a question that you haven't thought about but some people have. And then, you know, in Seattle where I live, we get a lot of rain and we see dark clouds. Sometimes they release the rain and other times they don't. And so, what gives, how come, what makes it rain and why sometimes does it not rain? So we're talking about water and water is something about which we know so. So I want to start from a few principles that have been developed over the past years and then go on from there to talk about how these principles can be applied to get a better understanding of weather. And it starts with this book that Don Scott mentioned and we uncovered a different phase of water beyond solid, liquid and vapor. And it's the basis, it comes from a lot of experiments that we did and I think rather straightforward interpretations. And I just want to give you a summary without presenting the evidence for what we found. So, we found that if there's water and the water sits next to a hydrophilic material in particular not hydrophobic but hydrophilic, water-loving, what happens is that the water transitions into a completely different structure. A layered structure, honeycomb kind of structure that builds in layers from here one after another and just keeps going on and in fact typically we find up to millions of molecular layers that undergo these transformations. We call them EZ or Exclusion Zone of water because we find experimentally that as these grow they push out all particles and solutes so it's rather pure substance that we get here that's solute free. And the structure looks something like this. It's a hexagonal or honeycomb kind of structure consisting of course of oxygen and hydrogen and unlike the structure of liquid water which sits out here. And it turns out it's not H₂O anymore. It's actually H₃O₂ - if you count the oxygens and hydrogens in the unit cell. This is what you get and it's not surprising because experimentally we found that this region has a net negative charge and this is negatively charged. To be neutral, it would have to be H₄0₂ that is double H₂O that's neutral. It's negatively charged. If you wanted this to be neutral, you'd have to put one more proton in here to make it H₄0₂. So, negatively charged and the positive charges, complementary positive charges lie here in water and the reason is that, in order to build these what happens is the water molecule is breaking into its component parts into OH- which sits here and lines up to give you this structure and H+ protons. So this is negative and this is positive and what that does is to form a kind of battery. This is the hydrophilic surface, this is the water and this negatively charged, EZ, or we call it 'fourth phase of water' is sitting here and the complementary protons are sitting here. It's got potential energy just like a battery and in fact the energy to charge this comes from light, we found that. So, question is, how does this potential energy play into weather? Everybody's interested in the weather, nobody really understands it. And I think the answer is - profoundly. And I want to present to you some, well rather than really evidence, some of this is evidence and some of it is conjecture to give you perhaps some idea that differs from the conventional idea of what is responsible for weather. It's not with the watercycle and many of you have seen this before. Here's the atmosphere and the clouds and we have precipitation which could be water or it could be ice and snow and the groundwater flows down into the oceans and it evaporates and the evaporated water condenses and so on. And so, some of the water that exists, could be millions of years old. Same molecules that get recycled over and over. And so, we deal with ice and snow, we deal with snow-melt, evaporation, condensation and then precipitation. And that's what I want to talk about and I'd like to present you and argue that these are qualitatively different from what you think you have, what you might have learned. So, we're going to talk about this water cycle and weather and I want to talk first about water and ice which you saw on the upper left. Then evaporation, condensation, precipitation and then wind, something that many of us never really think about but it's certainly around. And, weather exotica. I'm not sure how much I'll get through but let's see. So, we start with water and ice. So you know about ice, you just basically take water and freeze it and you get ice. But it's not quite so clear as that. It turns out that this fourth phase that I mentioned to you is a necessary condition for the freezing of water. So we all think that when you freeze water you go from water to ice but what we found and is described in the book and I'll show you a few slides, is that water doesn't really transition directly to ice. It transitions to EZ whose structure is not so different from ice. It's not ice but not so different and then to ice. And if you melt the ice, you go from ice to EZ and then to water. So, the process of freezing differs. And the way it works is something like this, you start with the EZ structure, remember there are the these hexagonal sheets that pile on one another, and you may not have noticed it but each sheet is slightly displaced from the sheet behind it. It's displaced in such a way that the negative oxygen here lines up with the positive hydrogen here and so these are electrostatically attracted. The same here, so it's a stable structure, it sticks together. And what we found is that the ice forms as this EZ structure. Remember, you start, you go from water to EZ and then to ice. What happens is that you add protons, and I'll explain how in a moment, and these protons, positively charged, insinuate themselves between the two negative oxygens here and then there's a shift of planes so that the planes are no longer displaced from one another but they're actually in register and that's when the planes come apart so that the ice is less dense and the ice floats. And, you know, we're happy that ice floats because if it didn't float, if the ice were more dense and the ice began from the bottom and worked its way up then you'd have a real problem because creatures like this could be, maybe in cold climes, could be basically pushed out of the water and would obviously perish. So, we're lucky that the structure of ice is less dense than the structure of water. So, let me show you the evidence. Is it really necessary, is the EZ really necessary for ice formation? So, here's a simple experiment. What we do is, we take a droplet of water and we put it next to a hydrophilic material. This is one that we commonly use. It's called Nafion. And so, what we find is that next to the Nafion we have EZ water that forms and beneath this we have a cooling plate so basically this water is being cooled and eventually it turns to ice. But I want to demonstrate to you that it's the EZ where the ice formation is initiated. And that's shown here. And so, we're depicting this particular region over time and so here's a water drop and here's the piece of Nafion and remember the EZ is sitting right here and you see this bright spot. This bright spot shows the initial location of ice formation and later as ice formation occurs of course it moves into the water but it moves and penetrates down where the EZ is and you can see later it basically follows the EZ. So, the EZ is basically the first place to freeze. The freeze initiates in the EZ and that's the main point. And the way we think it does, and I'll show you evidence in a moment, is that you have the EZ here and remember negatively charged here and the protons here and gradually as the EZ builds up, more negative charge, you get more positive charge here. And when the positive charge gets dense enough, what happens is it moves into the lattice all the way to the most negative part and it forms here. And remember, EZ plus protons gives you ice and so we have the ice that forms right here and the process continues and gradually you get a whole bunch of ice starting with the EZ. Now to show you that this really happens, we have a setup that looks like this. So, here's a chamber. This is a thermoelectric cooler so this water then gets progressively cooler and we find that the cooler it gets the bigger the EZ gets and beyond that we just have water and we put pH sensitive dye. These are the dyes, you know, that change color just like litmus paper. Acid is one color, base is another color and here's what happens when freeze occurs. So here's the cooling plate, right. Here's this cooling plate. Here's the ice and here's the water that has yet to convert to ice. So, the green color is actually neutral and here in the ice the red color is very low pH. It means it's full of protons. So it shows that indeed, as the ice forms, a lot of protons enter into that region. So, ice formation involves protons. It's EZ, negatively charged, plus protons, give you ice. So we understand now that what happens is, you reduce the temperature, you get EZ, EZ builds up and all the protons that are sitting here rush into the EZ whose structure is a little bit different from ice and that converts to ice. So, what happens when the ice melts? Well, you might expect the opposite or the reverse process. So, the ice turns into EZ which then turns into - water. So do we really see EZ water when this melts? We did the experiment, put ice into a cuvette and allowed it to melt. And put the cuvette into a spectrometer which can measure the absorption of light at different wavelengths. And so we asked the question, does melting produce EZ water and protons? So, this is the absorption spectra of just melted ice, just melted water samples. And there are four different panels and the only difference between them is we used a different kind of water so this is de-ionized water, we use that to make the ice. Boiled de-ionized water, de-gassed de-ionized water. It doesn't really matter what kind of water you put in there, when you melt the ice you get a similar spectral pattern. In all cases, there's a big absorption peak at 270 nanometers and we know from our previous experience that the 270 nanometer absorption is the signature of EZ water. It's the defining feature. That water absorbs light in the UV region at 270 nanometers, ordinary water doesn't. So, we can conclude that as you take the ice and you melt the ice, the melted ice is EZ water. So, the melting is ice to EZ and then finally, after some time, the EZ converts to ordinary water. So, what about snow? Um well, it's pretty and I think all of you know that snow has hexagonal crystals and it's always been a kind of mystery as to why they should be hexagonal. But remember, the EZ is hexagonal and if snow grows from hexagonal kind of ordered water it makes total sense that the snowflake would But remember, the EZ is hexagonal and if snow grows from hexagonal kind of ordered water it makes total sense that the snowflake would actually be EZ, some construct of EZ water. And the fact that EZ water is negative means every snowflake should have negative charge and these snowflakes should stay apart from one another which basically they do, built from hexagonal EZ. So, we dealt with ice and snow and the fourth phase of water and I presented to you some features that are perhaps a lot different from what the conventional view is of freezing and melting. And now I would like to show you a video and this video is something that is on the Discovery Channel and it was based on my book 'The Fourth Phase Of Water' and we made it, you might say, to Hollywood and I want to show you a five minute clip. The movie is called 'The Fourth Phase'. It's done by a famous snowboarder Travis Rice. From when I was a kid I've always been intrigued with water and how we interact with it. Since then, traveling the world of snowboarding, the concept for this trip evolved to follow the hydrological cycle around the North Pacific really attempting to immerse oneself in the elements and see how this whole thing works. It's been incredible. As children, we're all motivated to find the truth. A child looks around and is learning truths all the time. We have this natural tendency to explore. I'm Gerald Pollack and I'm a professor of bioengineering at the University of Washington in Seattle. It can be really challenging to keep an open mind in these days. Scientists have become more hesitant to challenge perceived truth. "How are you doing? So, it's working?" There are some books that suggest that essentially we've kind of reached the limit of what there is to know. I'm shocked by this this perception. There are many aspects of water that we see every day and we don't really understand them. These are questions that need answers. We all learned that water has three phases; solid state, liquid state and also vapor state. However, you can't explain all the known properties of water with 3 phases alone. You need a fourth phase. What's the fourth phase? With an energetic input, water molecules undergo massive change. They become ordered, they acquire charge. All of this energy to create that order comes from light. We began with experiments to try to learn more. We noticed something that seemed almost magical. Every one of the tests that we did showed that this water was different from ordinary water. The individual molecules were actually linked together to form a hexagon, and then many hexagons. We can understand why snowflakes are hexagonal. They actually form from the fourth phase of water. After some time there seemed to be enough evidence to indicate that this was a distinctly different phase of water. You might ask, what implications it has for us? We're approximately two-thirds water. Most of the water inside of our cells, they're filled with fourth-phase water. This could be central to all of what goes on in the biology of the cell. This is going to lead the way to a better understanding of how cells function. I think part of the beauty of the fourth phase, especially as it relates, I guess, to this film, is the concept that not everything is as it appears to be. Leaving some space and open-mindedness for allowance of a shift in perspective on how you view the world is one of the most important things in my life. Being a scientist is a search for truth. We somehow need to change the system so that we're looking for ideas whose outcome has the capacity to really shake the earth and yield breakthroughs if not revolutions. You need to dig deeper and deeper in order to find the truth. Thank you. This was cool and I'm really shocked that these guys actually survive what they, what they do in the backcountry. OK, so I talked about water and ice and I've tried to demonstrate that the formation of ice and the melting of ice is different from what we think. And I want to talk about evaporation and the message is the same, it's not what we think. So, what do you think about evaporation? You probably think that you've got a glass of water, you know, and it's evaporating one molecule at a time. A molecule gets a kick of energy, of kinetic energy, and it comes up at least that's what I learned. And the reality is a lot different. So, let me start with this. This is taken at Starbucks and, you know, Seattle, Starbucks was born in Seattle so we drink a lot of coffee. And if you have a dark background you notice this is a hot latte, I think, and taken by my son. You notice something interesting, you can see the vapor. Now, if you can see the vapor, what does that mean? Well, you can see the vapor because the light is being scattered and you don't see a hell of a lot unless the scattering entity is at least on the order of the wavelength of light. Wavelength of light is half a micrometer. Well, it turns out that these are little tiny droplets in here that are tens of microns. Now, even one micrometer little droplet contains, you know, how many water molecules? You can do the arithmetic, it's something like a billion, on that order. So, there's something wrong with, appears to be wrong with the idea that the evaporative entity is one molecule, unless they come together above here and we know they don't because we've checked that where we've checked these when water is evaporating and we can check right just above the surface as this is emerging, it's no different from what you see here. So, that idea seems to be incompatible with basic physics. Well, another interesting feature is that it's not continuous. Look, it seems to be discrete. Now that's a surprise because most of us, we presume that the evaporative process is a continuous one, not only is it discrete but also it appears to come from one region of the water not necessarily from the entire surface simultaneously. Well, I have a lot of undergraduate students working in the lab and many of them don't do what I tell them to do. They have minds of their own and there was one guy, a Chinese student, we have a lot of them in Seattle, and he was curious and so he took a laser beam and he, what he did is to condense the beam into a plane and he wanted to get a cross-section of how one of these would look like. So, what do you think they look like? You might think, cross-section might, would look like kind of cotton or something like that, but doesn't. It looks like this. These are four different experiments and you can see, looking at let's say this one, that the bright area is scattering light. It means that's where the water is. In between that, the dark area is doing nothing. So it seems to be essentially empty. And I got to tell you that when I saw this for the first time I almost fell out of my seat because I couldn't believe that the evaporative entity had structure, just like this. It seemed inconceivable but, you know, after enough repeats of the experiment it was pretty clear that this was correct. So the first thing... Well, sorry it wasn't the first thing but we thought this is not created from nothing. This kind of pretzel-like structure. There must be something in the water that may be giving rise to this kind of pretzel-like structure. So, we raised the question, is there a corresponding structure in the water itself? I'm not sure if you can see it but I can see it on my screen. If you look into the warm water that you see here, and this picture was taken by my son, he was the artist of my book and I was really pleasantly surprised to see this. This one was at home, I think, not in Starbucks but... I can see it here, I hope you can. There's a mosaic structure. If you can't see it then take a look at this one. This is an experiment you could do yourself. So, this is a pan of warm water and it's illuminated not from above but at a glancing angle from the side. You might call that dark field illumination and you can see the same sort of structure, low angle illumination. And so, it looks like the warm water that's evaporating does contain some kind of structure as the previous slide showed as well. And we can also see it by using an infrared camera to look down at the warm water and you can see same sort of structures. There's no doubt that the structure is there. Well the usual interpretation when you use an infrared camera is that this region looks warmer than this region. In fact, conveniently they actually provide a scale for you so you can correlate the darkness with the equivalent temperature but it's not necessary that that's the only explanation. Another possible explanation is that these lines actually denote the presence of EZ water. Now why do I think so? Well it's because of older experiments that we did. Here's a piece of Nafion next to water and remember an EZ forms next to the water. And so the infrared camera is picking up the amount of infrared energy that's being radiated from that. The EZ is dark. That means it doesn't radiate a whole lot and the water beyond the EZ radiates, as you can see it's brighter, it radiates much more. So dark here, the EZ is dark and if we go back to the infrared image of this you have to ask the question, is it possible that the dark region here is actually EZ material? And we think it is because we've looked at the origin of these structures that form. And you can see little dots here just as they form. And these dots, we don't know whether they're little droplets or little bubbles but essentially it doesn't matter for us because what we found in our experiments is that if you have a droplet, this is the structure. If you have a bubble, this is a structure. And in both cases these are lined by layers of EZ material, just like onion skin and that's what holds it together for both of these. But inside you have a lot of protons and the protons are repelling each other, they're pushing out against the skin and that's what keeps it into a sphere. The difference is that in this case it's liquid, in this case it's a vapor. So we've learned in our experiments about these water droplets and since we don't really know if they are droplets or bubbles, we call them vesicles. And we do know that the vesicle structure looks like this and we do know that as they form before they enclose themselves, these positive charges tend to repel each other, they leak out. And so, the amount of negative charge here is always more than the amount of positive charge. So, these little vesicles, whether they're bubbles or droplets, have net negative charge. That's important. So, if you think about the possible explanation for these dark lines, remember I suggested, maybe they contain EZ material. Well, a possible way that they can contain EZ material is shown here that you have a lot of these vesicles that are stuck together and so, for example, this entire cluster here would represent what we see here consisting of a whole bunch of these stuck together. How are they stuck together? Well, we presume that they're actually glued by protons and so these are negatively charged and this is negatively charged. If you have protons between them, the protons will act as glue holding them together. Now this is not a wild speculation. It actually comes from Feynman, many years ago, who talked about negative, like charges that come together and he called it like-likes-like. Well, these negative charges like each other so they come together and he said the reason they come together doesn't violate any basic principles of physics. It's because opposite charges gather in between and so you might have positive charge which pulls this one and pulls this one. He said like-likes-like because of an intermediate of unlikes. And I think that's what happens and that's how you can imagine that these are actually glued together, negative charge here negative charge here, protons in-between holding it all together. There are many examples of this. I don't have time to present it. So, this is what, this is an oblique view that shows the same mosaic structure on top; but what this slide shows is that it's not just a surface layer, it actually extends downward. You can see the dark lines coming and extending downward and what that means is that these mosaic cells are actually mosaic tubes, they extend down into the water. And so, when we talk about evaporation we have a situation that looks like this. This is a kind of conclusion slide that we have these basically tubes that run down. They're not just on the surface. They run into the water and when sufficient charge gathers, they actually rise up like this and then they become vapor. And if you were to take a cross-section of this, it might look something like this. So, basically the vapor patterns that you see, especially in cross-section, come from liquid patterns that are down here. They simply rise up to give you this incredibly beautifully shaped vapor that we see. And you get clusters so you get one of these groups of tubes that rise, so this will be the first one then the next one and the next one and they're actually discrete events. But by the time you get up here, the droplets that make up these clusters eventually dissipate because you don't see any vapor up here. So they're basically dissipated into the air. And so, when you think about humid air, you can think about these negatively charged little droplets surrounded by positive charges which are known to occupy the atmosphere. However, if there's enough positive charge to glue these together and form clouds like this. In the atmosphere, the humidity disappears and it becomes clear instead of humid and then you can see a difference in your environment. So, if you have humid air, you can imagine looking through this humid air to some building that sits at some distance. And the building is not clear, it's fuzzy and the reason it's fuzzy is that the light that gets scattered from the building before it gets to your eye, it's scattered by numerous of these rather large little droplets that sit in the air as humidity. On the other hand, if the air is clear, if these little droplets have actually condensed into clouds, then you can see these buildings much more clearly. So, those of you who live on the East Coast, you know, Washington DC in summertime, buildings look like this but in the wintertime they may look like this. OK, so that's evaporation and the mechanism I've presented evidence to you that the mechanism is grossly different from what we think. OK, now what about condensation? So, you've got these droplets in the air, how do they condense into clouds? Why do we get a cloud to begin with? So, what we have in the atmosphere among other things are two principal constituents. One is these water vesicles that have a net negative charge and we have positive charges known, the atmosphere is known among atmospheric scientists to be net positive charge and somehow the positive charges are linked, nobody knows exactly how, to molecules in the air. So, we have negative charge and we have positive charge and so we come back to the Feynman like-likes-like mechanism, we have these vesicles of water that are suspended in the air and we have positive charge. If you add these together in the right quantity, you get a cloud because the positive charge brings these negatively charged vesicles together. So, a cloud may look something like this. Principally these negatively-charged vesicles and with enough positive charge these charges, these vesicles are actually linked together and they form these clusters that we call clouds. So question arises, what keeps clouds suspended in the sky? And I don't know, a lot of people have never thought about this question. Remember it's water, the water is pretty heavy. Well we know that clouds have charge. This is one example, probably not unknown to the Electric Universe people. We also know that the earth has an electric field. I mean, beyond the magnetic field. And the electric field runs perpendicular to the surface of the earth and it exists because there are positive charges up here in the ionosphere and beneath and because the earth has a net negative charge. By the way, the net negative charge may come from the EZ water that fills the surface of the earth and all greenery. So, this is the electric field at the surface of the earth. It is roughly a hundred volts per meter which means that my nose is 200 volts relative to my toes. OK, good to remember. You know, it's easy. OK, so we have, what about floating clouds. So, the earth is negative and the cloud is negative and so doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that there's a repulsive force between them. But your reaction might be or may might not be, is that repulsive force really strong enough to keep the clouds suspended simply by repulsion? I want to give you two examples that demonstrate it. The first is this. You take an old-fashioned 120-watt bulb and, you know, current is flowing through the tungsten filament. And suppose you could collect one second worth of charge flowing through it, just one second. And suppose, thought experiment, you could compress that to a point and you put that point down here of negative charge and you do the same thing up here and they're separated by one meter. So, the question I ask you is, you know that these are going to repel each other. This one can't go down but this one can go up. So, question is, how much weight do you need to put on this one in order to prevent it from going up, OK? So, I've asked this question. I got all kinds of answers from a gram to a ton or whatever and the right answer is about 50,000 garbage trucks. Now, knowing that there are Boeing engineers here, the original thought was actually, it's something like 5,000 Boeing 747s. But my son, the artist, couldn't draw a Boeing 747 stacked up so we wind up with garbage trucks and this is roughly the amount of weight. And even... So it, we're talking a huge force. Now, another example is this. So, you have a couple and the guy is lying here and the woman is suspended somehow. It doesn't really matter how she's suspended, you might think of a net or something that's keeping her away. Of course, they would like to join each other but she's suspended here. And suppose, this comes also from Feynman by the way, from his lectures except he has them vertical. I mean, standing instead of in this position. But suppose you're able to remove 1% of the electrons from this guy and 1% of the electrons from this woman so she's positive, he's positive. They repel each other. He can't go down but she can go up. He doesn't want her to go up, he'd rather have her go... Well, so, so a question is, how much weight would you have to put on her back in order to prevent her from rising up? Anybody have a guess? How many garbage trucks. OK, so actually the number of garbage trucks is so large, the correct answer, remember according to Feynman is the weight of the earth. It's astonishing. So, main point. The force that is generated by charges is much larger even than people in the Electric Universe are, most of you are, I think, thinking. Huge forces. And so we come back to what keeps the clouds suspended? And I think what keeps them suspended is the fact that the clouds have a net negative charge and the earth has a net negative charge. So one suggestion is a repulsive force between these and these. That's why the clouds are sitting up there. And if the cloud has more negative charge then it's going to be higher and if it has less negative charge then it's going to be lower. It's a simple paradigm and that explains what atmospheric scientists have a really hard time explaining and that is clouds in different layers. So, simple explanation is that this cloud has a lot of negative charge so it's high. And this one has a moderate amount and this one has low negative charge. And so that's how they're suspended. Side issue is this, think about it. The earth is negative, the atmosphere is positive. We all know that positive attracts negative and so you'd expect that simply by virtue of the fact that this is positive and this is negative, they're going to stick together. Now imagine if they didn't stick together. Just think about the scenario for a moment. The earth is spinning, right, and typical velocity on the surface is, we're talking about something like two times the speed of a jet plane. So, it means if you went outside and the atmosphere was not stuck to the earth, there'd be a hurricane outside every time you walked out. So, I mean the atmosphere must somehow stick to the earth and this is perhaps a simple explanation that plus and minus cling and so the atmospheric clings to the earth. And in fact, if you think about it, a question that might be raised is, does clinging force explain what we know as atmospheric pressure? We think of the pressure arising from molecules pressing on each other but, you know, the atmosphere is not a pile of bricks. The molecules are a gas which means they hardly touch each other and you can go through various arguments to come up with an idea of how the atmosphere could actually press on the earth but a simple argument might be that the pressure comes from the plus sticking to the minus. And that prevents the blow-away scenario because there are big winds up here and if you just have stray molecules around and the wind comes, you might expect that we'd have no oxygen left to breathe. OK, so I talked about the condensation. Now what about precipitation? It does rain, although not too often around here. So, what causes the rain? Well, if you listen to the weather people, they'll talk about pressure and they'll talk about temperature and I don't know about you but I've never been able to understand how this combination of temperature and pressure could yield rain. So of course, another question that people here are likely to raise is, what about charge? There's somehow charge involved in weather and bringing rain. We know that there's charge there and I'd like to bring up the principle of induction. This is Faraday induction which I think is known to many of you. So if you have a positive charge sitting up here, if it's really far away doesn't do a whole lot but if it's closer, it'll begin to induce opposite charge down here and the closer it is, the larger the opposite charge that’s generated. It doesn't matter whether this charge is positive or negative. Basically the same thing occurs and this force is always attractive, that is, if you have the negative here you'll always have positive here and they attract one another. And I think this principle, this simple principle that we all know about is really critical. An example of it is here. You take a balloon and you rub it on your shirt. And notice same shirt as in the movie, it's the only shirt I own. Embarrassing moment. And you put it next to the faucet and the faucet bends quite appreciably. It's a fun thing to demonstrate for kids. And what's going on? Well, the balloon is charged by the triboelectric effect, rubbing on your shirt or your hair, induces opposite charge and the two are attracted and so the stream bends this way. So, we have the same principle going. We go back to the cloud and in the cloud, we have the negatively charged vesicles containing the water and we have positive charges. They come together to form a negatively charged cloud. And when positive charge, more positive charge lowers the cloud, right, it comes closer to here, there's an inductive force, positive here negative here. And this pulls the water from the cloud. It's a simple pulling force that can do that. So, I think a possibility is that precipitation occurs inductively. I'll go back to that in a moment. And what about wind? So, we know the wind occurs and we sometimes think that it's a fire of the Dragon that creates the wind, but, what creates the wind? We, you know, we don't know. Is it pressure gradients, which I think is what you'll read in the textbook. But it's kind of difficult to understand how you get a wind gust? Gust is pretty local and of course the gust can be powerful as you see here. And I think it's possible that charge gradients are responsible for wind. And why do I think so? So, here's diagram that you've seen. Here's the earth and here's the positive charge in the atmosphere and it's known from measurements that protons diminish with increasing altitude. So here you have the highest electric field, and it diminishes with increasing altitude. At night, It's very small, possibly because there's not much evaporation and the positive charges don't get into the atmosphere. During the daytime, it gets much higher and this is well known. This is not conjecture. So here is low electric field and here's high electric field. Now this is taken from a published paper and what we're seeing here is the electric field up high in different places on the earth. So, forget this one for the moment. That's integrated over all of them. Let's look at Africa and Europe and this is GMT so we see that the peak electric field in Africa and Europe occurs at 14.00 roughly GMT. So, this is in Africa and Europe roughly early afternoon. It's when the sun is the brightest. Sun is really shining and you see it's much bigger than in the evening. Look at the Americas. The peak occurs at about 21.00. It occurs later than here. Again, it corresponds to when the sun is really up high in the sky. And the difference between nighttime and daytime is huge, it is a factor of 10. There's a big difference between the two. So, think about it. The electric field is high here and it's low here. So, that means you've got a gradient: high electric field, low electric field. So, in this case you've got a lot of positive charges here and very few positive charges. Positive charges repel each other. They want to escape. Where are they going to go? Well, they're going to go this way and that gives you wind. And I think, with this, I don't have time, I think this can explain both the trade winds that blow from east to west and the prevailing westerlies or jet stream that flows from west to east. They occur, originate at the two different light / dark boundaries. That gives you wind. So, what about a gust of wind? Well, I think a gust of wind could occur with a local charge gradient depending on the plants and the structures that exist there. I think they, it's possible that the origin of wind comes from atmospheric charge gradients. Now what about exotic weather? Seattle is not like Phoenix. This is what it looks like in typical winter time and we get a fair amount of rain and people get caught downtown, you know, without their umbrellas and they rush to their cars. So, what's going on? Why, the question is, why in Seattle do we get a lot of rain in the winter whereas the summertime it's a bit like Phoenix although a little bit cooler. And remember, this is the mechanism that we've deduced for clouds. You need the humidity with negative charge and you need positive charge to bring these together. And of course you need enough positive charge to bring it together because if you have a trivial amount, it won't happen. So, think about the winter in Seattle, OK. Now, when it's winter in Seattle, in the summer the earth is tilted in such a way that in the southern hemisphere you got a lot of sunshine occuring, right? And this lot of sunshine builds positive charge way up into the atmosphere. We don't get it here but we get it here. Now, where does this charge want to go? Well, the charge wants to escape from here, the high atmospheric charge, so it goes this way. Meanwhile, you have the prevailing westerlies going this way and the two are combined to bring moisture into Seattle in the wintertime. And so, you're getting a lot of charge coming and the situation is like this. You have a cloud, charge comes, right, and the addition of more positive charge reduces the negativity so the cloud gets lower. And of course, sorry, a lot of these vesicles begin to be attracted to these positive charges. So the cloud begins to, the cloud, because of the positive charge begins to lower and because of additional positive charges these clouds can actually merge with one another so not only do they get lower but they get larger and this keeps happening. Gets lower and it reaches the point where you have an inductive force, the negative charge induces positive charge and that brings the rain. If it's low enough and it induces enough positive charge, the positive pulls the negatively charged vesicles and we get rain. The rain is actually pulled toward the earth. So, rain or no rain it's, I think, the cloud must lower sufficiently past the critical point of inductive inevitability, then it rains. It's sort of like an orgasm, you know, you're almost there and then you're there, if you will. Interesting scientific fact. Some guys, not this one, this one. Some guys used high-speed video to record rainfall and we all know, if you have a droplet that's falling, based on its size, and physical properties, you can compute the velocity. Well they measured the velocity and they found that it was up to ten times higher than you could imagine due to to the fall and so they concluded, this is published in Nature, they concluded that there's a pulling force that brings it to the earth. I need about three minutes, OK. Now, exotic weather. For the Australians who are here, I think, this comes from Australia. We have these thunderheads which can yield intense rainfalls and notice the curvature around here. If you think about the earth that's rotating, you know. If you're standing on the equator, it's rotating really fast. If you're standing up here, the speed is pretty slow. And so, there's a gradient along here which means, because this is always faster than this clouds will always rotate in the counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere we see here. So, if you think about a hurricane, so here's a cloud that has negative charge. It's moving in this direction at least initially because the trade winds push in this direction. But think about the atmosphere, the positively charged atmosphere. So, this cloud is moving in this direction, compressing all of these positive charges whereas behind it, it's already passed through, there's not much positivity left. It's left a swath where there shouldn't be positive charge. So, this negative charge is attracted to a lot of positive charges. The two will tend to combine and when they combine, what happens is, remember you get more positive charge with the negative, this part of the cloud descends. It releases its rain and it becomes clear. And this will be the eye of the hurricane. Meanwhile, the cloud is rotating in this direction for the reason I showed you in the last slide so you come to here and again the same thing happens with this region and so the eye becomes larger. And it starts curling around until you reach the state where a negative charge, right, induces positive charge and the ice sticks to this. And it keeps going and building like that and eventually you get a structure that looks something like this. This is a typical hurricane. And sometimes, you know, you can get one of these typhoon, not typhoons, but tornadoes and think about it. Again, we have the rotation occurring here and what keeps it all together is the first point and most of these particles here are negatively charged. So, you've got positive charge that keeps it all together by the like-likes-like mechanism. And by the way, you often see lightning discharges in these. So, it's kept together and because it's kept together this entire thing is rotating. You get fierce winds out here and because of the charges, the induction force pulls up refrigerators from here. So we get some idea of what is responsible for the tornado. So, I've gone quickly through the entire cycle. Evaporation, condensation, precipitation, ice and snow, and so on. And I'm suggesting to you that not only are the mechanisms different from what we've all learned but that central feature for all of this is charge. Negative charge and positive charge. So, I would leave you with, charge is absolutely critical and there's not a single weather forecast that I've ever seen that says hey, the charge in the atmosphere is such and such and because of the charge we may expect this kind of weather. So, I think one day if the atmospheric people begin to take into account that the universe is really electrical, we'll know whether to bring an umbrella to work. And before I end, I have to talk one slide about the Institute for Venture Science, because well, for a number of reasons including, the next speaker is deeply involved in it and Dave Talbott was also involved in getting this and Susan, getting this started and the Institute funds promising ideas that challenge conventional thinking. And we received more than 200 pre-proposals. They've all been reviewed and out of those 200 we picked a dozen or so that are extremely promising. And the people, those people are now drafting full proposals which we expect to receive in about, well, two weeks and this is a going concern. Of course, we're looking for donors and anybody who knows people of means who have done well and would like to give back to society, I think this is a really wonderful way of returning to society in a way that is meaningful. So, I end with the book. The book has become popular and a lot of the ideas and issues that led to the speculations, which is really what they are, that I presented to you, come from this book, where you'll find the evidence. Thank you very much! 
Comet Siding Spring The discovery occurred on January 3rd, 2013 - a comet racing toward the inner Solar System, it just past the orbit of Jupiter. at the time of the discovery the comet was 670 million miles from the Sun - that's about 7 times the distance from the Earth to the Sun. So, why would a comet begin discharging in such a remote deep freeze? The first to observe the comet was Robert McNaught at the Siding Spring Observatory in Australia - that's the name, C/2013 A1 Siding Spring. Calculations soon showed that the comets trajectory could bring it into a collision with the planet Mars, but whether the comet's arrival would lead to a collision with Mars, or a near collision, cameras on the surface of Mars and in orbit around the planet could record the event. And, that possibility provoked excitement amongst comet investigators and planetary scientists exploring Mars and its environment. New calculations soon gave more precise figures for the comet's trajectory. It would not collide with Mars, but approach the planet within some 88,000 miles (well under half the distance from Earth to the Moon). Under standard comet theory this would be a visitor from the conjectured Oort cloud, surrounding our Sun in a remote space. So, comet scientists expected that instruments on the surface of mars and in telescopes orbiting mars would provide an unprecedented look at the ingredients of an Oort Cloud comet. "Comet Siding Spring - an Oort Clod comet that may contain material from  the formation of the Solar System some 4.6 billion years ago." Estimates place the size of the comet in under a half mile in diameter, however that calculation was not based on direct observation of the nucleus - it was derived initially from assumptions about water production astronomers just assumed that the hydroxyl molecules initially detected were created by water molecules from sublimating ices interacting with ultraviolet light from the Sun. That would require heating at the comet's surface up to the level necessary for surface ices to sublimate. Icy surfaces in Jupiter's deep freeze do not sublimate even close to the rate of water production that we observe with an active comet at such distances. That's not a fact to be ignored, and keep in mind that laboratory experiments decades ago had already demonstrated the production of hydroxyl electrochemically with no contribution from water. For electrical theorists, that's the overriding question: would electrochemistry play a role, possibly an indispensable role, in the encounter?  Well prior to its arrival at the Martian orbit, the comet was ejecting dust at three times the rate projected by theory, and the velocity at the ejected dust particles was more than double expectation. That mystery has yet to be resolved. Of course, the electrical theorists were most interested in any contribution of negative charge from the comet to the upper atmosphere of Mars. On its arrival at the Martian orbit, Siding Spring was traveling about 35 miles per second and the effects of the planet's entry into the tail of the comet were quite spectacular and almost instantaneous explosion of electrons in the margin upper atmosphere. Investigators speculated that this blast of electrons was due to ionization of cometary dust. The dust particles must have collided with air molecules from Mars stripping away free electrons but, even at its surface, the Martian atmosphere is well under 1% of the density of Earth's atmosphere and the uppermost region, the ionosphere, of Mars is an extraordinarily rarefied layer. Could ionizing collisions actually explain the remarkable changes in electron density, a sudden doubling in the electron count? We can only pose the question here, since data is still sparse but electron densities in the vicinity of comets have puzzled scientists since the first encounter with a comet in the mid 80's. That was when more than one probe reached Comet Halley to find a density of negatively charged particles, forbidden by prevailing theory. Earlier theoretical challenges should not be ignored when new discoveries bring similar challenges. Could the litany of comet mysteries be due most fundamentally to a theoretical mistake, a failure to see the electrical nature of these bodies? It was the most ambitious undertaking in the history of comet science: the European Space Agency's Rosetta mission to Comet 67P Churyumov/Gerasimenko. The probe was launched on March 2, 2004 beginning a 10 year journey to 67P arriving at the comet in the summer of 2014. Following orbital corrections from May through July 2014, the Rosetta craft was placed in orbit around the 67P nucleus. Then, in August and September, onboard instruments began gathering data including the first mapping of the surface. It would orbit the comet nucleus for well over a year and the mission would include the anticipated touchdown of a lander named Philae, on the surface of the comet. From the moment of Rosetta's arrival at 67P, investigators faced a succession of surprises, all told, a challenge to every standard assumption about a comet as a 'dirty snowball'. The unsolved mysteries included two distinct lobes joined as one by an improbably narrow neck; no appreciable water ice, even in the most active regions of the nucleus, for theory would require at the very least some hint of ice at the source of the comet's jets. The rudimentary molecular building blocks of the Solar System billions of years ago - nowhere to be found. Though, confirming such stardust in comets was an original purpose of the mission. A rock-like surface, partially covered by dust, but so hard that the Philae lander bounced off the surface and was nearly lost. Fields of rocky debris scattered across the surface, all suggesting formative processes flatly disallowed by the standard theory about of a 'dirty snowball'. Exposure of cliffs with well-defined terracing, but no common orientation, just a jumble of segmented blocks (as if) carelessly thrown together. Pervasive small nodules that should not be there but are seen embedded in the surface relief wherever the hard surface is exposed. So-called 'sand dunes' and wind-streaks in the regions of gathered dust with no wind available, in the extreme vacuum of space, to create them. A bizarre alignment of the wind-streaks, north to south, but no reason given for this consistent directionality; baffling changes in the dust configurations during the period of observation, something never expected and too (obviously) prohibited under standard assumptions. Acceleration of voluminous dust away from the comet at velocities simply unachievable by mere sublimation of surface volitiles; absence of any openings to the imagined pressure chambers beneath the surface, the supposed sources of the comet's jets. And, no energy profiles of the jets that would be consistent with the theorized the explosive release of pressurized gases. The confinement of the comet's jets in narrow filaments, in stark contrast to the well-known explosive expansion of pressurized gases in a vacuum. Enigmatic electromagnetic oscillations, or so-called sounds of the comet. A cloud of high-energy electrons close to the nucleus, though the presumed neutral body and neutral space gives no electrodynamic basis for such charge separation. Abundances of molecular oxygen, or O2, though this molecule is far too reactive to survive across the imagined epochs of Solar System evolution. Concentrations of hydroxyl ions and water molecules in the coma with virtually no water on the surface to account for them. From one comet visit to another, it seems that the mysteries have only deepened. But, the first requirement for progress in science is to make sense of the surprises; if every major discovery comes as a surprise, that pattern demands a new theoretical framework: comets are not what we thought ... In the review that follows, we will show detail by detail that the great surprises of comet science are, in fact, the predictions of an electric comet model. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info The geological features of our planet tell an astonishing story, a story that defies explanation based on standard theoretical processes. In this series of videos, Thunderbolts contributor Andrew Hall, has explored theoretical pathways which draw analogs between Earth geology and some of the most powerful atmospheric phenomena seen in the solar system. As Andrew explains in Part Six of his ten-part series, the key to understanding this analog, can be found in the properties and nature of water. In Part Five of this series, we looked at “boot print” craters and found there are cyclones raging on Jupiter right now that can explain them. Shock wave patterns in the crater rims provided confirming evidence. We also looked at California's mountain and valley structures and correlated those with a storm on Jupiter that displays in great detail the very same features. The examples we've looked at point to one significant observation: that fractal forms associated with the process of charge diffusion, can be found in both geology and weather. Why geology and weather should match really isn't hard to understand. Capacitance between Earth and sky are responsible for that, forcing charge to diffuse through each layer in mirror image. And that should suffice for an answer if our atmosphere were considered a plasma; charged particles responding to Earth's spherical capacitance would make sense. But Earth's atmosphere isn't considered a plasma. Neither is Jupiter's for that matter. Where are all the charge carriers? The answer isn't in particle physics. It's in the molecule of water. Water is the charge carrier - the electric wires of the circuit. Water is bi-polar and so adopts polarity in an electric field. This produces something called ”bound current”. Unlike a current of free electrons and ions, a bound current is carried by a bulk material that can be polarized or magnetized. An example is a ferromagnetic fluid that takes structural form in response to magnetic fields. Water is an example of bound current due to polarization of the water molecule. Water also changes phase: from vapor to droplet to ice crystal, all in the course of a weather cycle, which changes its electrical properties. And it's self-ionizing, readily shedding electrons to generate plasma. A cold plasma is only partly ionized, a few free electrons and ions floating about. But magnetic fields are created with any moving charge and magnetic fields influence their motion, and water follows because it polarizes and acts like a big, fat charged particle, making clouds into conduits of current generating stronger magnetic field. Star-like filaments and concentric rings form in thin cirrus of the upper atmosphere. Condensate filaments make turns and shoot tendrils at 90 degrees, crossing other filament paths and interfering in herringbone patterns. These are drift currents, responding to the pull of far-field potential within that layer of strata. Closer to the ground fat water clouds form cellular structures often in tetrahedron shapes which amplifies water’s polarity to a macro scale. Watch puffy cumulus gather for a storm, ultimately knotting into a torus around up-welling winds to birth a mesocyclone, and you are seeing a fractal electromagnetic structure of Nature at work. Airborne dust, pollen, aerosols and dander cloud the air close to the ground and react between surface and sky to form a charged sheath, polar-opposite to the water clouds. Higher up, where ice forms, wispy cirrus change polarity again. The result is multiple layers of charged, cold plasma between the ionosphere and Earth's surface. The sky is electric but consensus science doesn't seem to recognize that. They will say there is no evidence of charge densities high enough for plasma. That distances are too large to create double layers and develop capacitance. What they don't recognize water's role, and frankly I don't think they're looking. They are looking for answers to their preconceived notions about carbon’s minor role in all this and aren't even asking the right questions. Just look at the clouds and what you see is an electric field, writ large across the sky. It really couldn't be more obvious. Just ignore the scientists and use your own noggin. It's better if you're not institutionally taught to ask the wrong question. Then take a look at Google Earth and compare to NASA's images of Jupiter. You will see all the patterns of Jupiter's storm clouds reflected in Earth's geology. Mountain ranges and desert dunes carry the shape of the winds that formed them. Rising columns, violent downbursts, precipitation, whirlwinds, and lightning brushed the land like a painter and left indelible brushstrokes. The similarity of shapes and weather comes from internal circuitry of the planets. This means that Jupiter and Earth are very similar in that regard. Repeating fractal forms at different scales is one proof of a fractal process. Fractals emerge naturally in chemistry, fluid dynamics and biology, but the process that defines them all - the common denominator - is the process of charge diffusion in an electromagnetic field. It manifests not only at the particle scale, but the atomic, molecular, and cellular scale, and produces fractal forms at the macro-scale because they are made coherent with electromagnetic fields. Now let's raise the voltage a bit on Earth and see what happens. A correlation between the Colorado Plateau and the Great Red Spot (GRS) on Jupiter has similarities of such complexity in detail that it seems absolutely surreal. Inflow to the GRS appears in two sinuous lanes of rolling winds that correlate with the mountain ranges in the Pacific Northwest. These snaking flows of wind feed a giant thunderhead that occupies the lower third of the image of the GRS, where white anvil clouds obscure what’s below. Such a mesocyclone careened over the Great Basin, extending its entire rotating wall cloud clear to the ground. The Great Basin was formed by rippling waves of dust-laden winds spun beneath a 100 mile wide funnel, lashed by torrents of rain. The parallel rows of basin and range mountains, that march like rippling dunes across Nevada, were laid transverse to the wind. In the annotated image, wind fronts are denoted by dark blue lines, and there's an S-shaped range at the inflection point where the in-flow winds bent to the rotating updraft. The blue and violet lines denote the wind direction, exiting east at high altitude over Provo, Utah where it made no mark on the land - until it water-fell on the other side of the shear zone that formed the Wasatch Range, spilling a violent downdraft into the Uintah Basin. Another, large flanking downdraft flows south over the Wasatch shear zone and spills down to form the Mogollon Rim, the southern extension of the Colorado Plateau arcing south-east from roughly, the Kaibab rim of the Grand Canyon to the Gila River in New Mexico. The wind formed rim is intermixed with volcanoes. This was a wet, rotating mesocyclone, carrying considerable moisture which precipitated out and evaporated, forming salt basins behind ranges and culminating in a rain curtain over what is now the Great Salt Lake and Bonneville Salt Flats. The long, linear mountain ranges of the Great Basin are in many cases windswept dirt. Hard rock, which indicates heat and recombination of ionic matter is absent, or minimal in many cases, which indicates low-density lightning in this region. The triangular faces of shock wave reflections earmark the wind direction. Often, no triangular shock features are present, indicating subsonic flow, so many hills take a recognizable sand-dune shape. Where the storm down- drafted to the northeast, it landed in the Uintah Valley and joined the ground winds of another rotation. Actually, it's two primary rotations that sucked wind from the north, to form enormous pressure ridges perpendicular to the wind direction: the wind river and Uinta Mountains. The mountain ranges formed as lightning arced to ground and charged diffused across the land and channeled currents which form dikes. Dikes are walls of rock formed from the country-rock fused together, and often display troughs alongside where material sucked to the current. An example is the Tetons, where Grand Teton itself is a lightning generated fulgurite surrounded by smaller fulgurites, blanketed with wind driven dunes. The Teton fulgurite extended a dike to the south which collected dust against it, which drew more lightning to it creating a mountain lobe. Wind piled material against dikes to build a mountain lobe and leave one flank patterned with the sonic shock of the wind. Winds deflecting horizontal to vertical left ruler-straight ridge lines of tetrahedrons where shock reflections patterned diamond-shaped regions of expansion and compression. The wind was pulled by twin whirlwinds created by a grounded current loop. Its footprint is a dome and crater pair. Dome and crater pairs are created by what I call a coronal loop, because, electrically, it's the same as a prominence on the Sun. It's a ring current couple to the land and wind sucks up one side in a mesocyclone that leaves a dome, walled by inward- pointing shockwave tetrahedrons. The wind loops from the thunderhead anvil to feed the center of a down-drafting cyclone, the footprint of which is a crater with outward-pointing tetrahedrons. This pair is squished into almost polygonal shapes because it's pressed between larger rotations. The Wyoming vortex is the smallest of three primary vortices of the larger multi-vortex storm in the GRS. It isn’t apparent in Jupiter's clouds, but I suspect it's there underneath the anvils. From the South, hot dry winds scorched across Mexico and the American Southwest with counterflowing winds. Along the turbulent shear zone between, kinks appear in the Sierra Madre Oriental, where north-flowing jet streams mixed with a south-flowing stream that formed the Sierra Occidental and the alto-plano in between. The kinks in Mexico's Cordilleras match remarkably well the kinks of turbulence where inflow and outflow winds mix adjacent to the GRS. That's probably an understatement. There are details here to fill a book, but take a close look on Google Earth at these kinks to see some amazing wind and shockwave features. We looked in an earlier episode at the overall morphology of winds in the very eye of the GRS and the Colorado Plateau. So, now let's take an even closer look. The eye is a multiple vortex cyclone, which displays a complex system of coronal loops that twist the wind into a crocheted doily pattern. There are several paired updraft domes and downdraft craters centered on the Colorado Plateau and Rocky Mountains. The most distinctive is the San Rafael Swell in central Utah. The swell is ringed by explosively charged, dense region of recombination and magnetic pinch known as the San Rafael Reef, where its rows of dragon's teeth - tetrahedral monoliths of hard, fused sandstone - provide evidence of a shock wave at the boundary of the updraft. The reef is the rim of an updraft dome formed beneath an intense coronal loop that raged electrical havoc on the land at the sharp end of the storm. The dome behind is shaped like one lens of an eye glass, the other lens an inverse copy, made by the downdraft of the same coronal loop. The downdraft crater has a central peak of lightning- struck mountains where a material drew up in winds generated by the return stroke of the lightning. The rim of the crater forms Capitol Reef, were more monolithic tetrahedrons display wind direction and Mach angles pointing outwards. Another example of an updraft dome is Monument Valley, Arizona. Its shark’s teeth rim is formed by inflow winds expressed in the triangular sandstone layers of Comb Ridge. The interior of the dome is the sputtered remnants of lightning-diffused mesas and pinnacles, preferentially left behind as the landscape around lifted away in the most intense electric field in the eye of the storm. The downdraft leg of the Monument Valley ring current lies in the bend of the San Juan River, as it passes through the Four Corners region. Annotated to distinguish the features, the same eyeglass shape is evident where this Corona loop connects with Earth, but the shape is skewed to the ambient counter-clockwise rotation of the entire storm system. The downdraft lies at 90 degrees to the op draft because of fractal symmetry - something we'll discuss more later - and the ambient rotation of the eye. Once again, the crater has a central peak of lightning-fused mountains, but its crater rim has largely been swept away and its face flattened by the pressing rotation of winds. This is “ground zero” for the eye of the storm. Note, the San Juan River arcs around the downdraft after it passes through the center of the updraft, just as the tributary of the Green River wrapped around the Capitol Reef downdraft crater and then shot through the heart of the San Rafael Dome. These are the fractal forms of surface conductive discharges, or “arc blast” and the rivers are part of it, which we'll also discuss in future articles. A shear zone separates the Wyoming vortex from the eye rotation over the Plateau. At this shear zone, like others, mountains formed beneath upwelling updrafts. In this case, nestled against the powerful updrafts of the San Rafael Swell and surrounding cyclones, it formed in the shape of an oxbow. Here we see one of the wonders of fractal forms. The “oxbow” on Jupiter is a distorted image of the ”oxbow” on Earth, with the bows curving in opposite arcs. It seems odd, but nature is kind of dyslexic. Fractals display rotational and translational symmetries, meaning a shape can be in any of several orientations - rotated at 90, or 180 degrees,  or flipped about one axis in mirror image, or translated “back-assward”. When this happens, it doesn't change the overall structure it's a part of and the energy balance remains the same. Harmonic repetitions also appear. The most striking example lies smack between the updraft dome and the downdraft crater of the San Rafael coronal storm loop. Watch this fractal expression expand in scale. Images are taken along a “z” axis in space from a single point on the ground at varying altitudes. The fractal repeats but the center point of each fractal expression stays in place. It morphs in form with emergent effects, but the fundamental circuit relationship remain solidly displayed. They are the same weather patterns we have today, but of a super-Olympian scale, as told in countless ancient accounts. We need to start listening to the ancients because they knew things that we don't. Eye of the storm has presented an aerial view of the coupling of Earth's atmosphere to its surface, so far. Next episode, it's time to switch and talk about the other side of the mirror - the dark side of the mirror. Below Earth’s crust lie dragons and demons. Thank you. [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info Of all our planetary neighbors, perhaps none have proved more surprising to space scientists than Venus. As late as the mid-20th century, some renowned astronomers including Fred Whipple, the father of the dirty snowball model of comets, continued to argue that Venus, the so-called twin of planet Earth, might have water clouds. Instead, when the first space probes touched down on Venus, they found it to be the hottest planet in the solar system and drier than any desert on Earth. For many decades, Venus has only grown more puzzling. From its absence of so-called impact craters, to its retrograde rotation, to the super- rotation of its atmosphere, to the planet's vast comet-like tail which has been found to interact with the solar wind "like a comet." In fact, only one scholar successfully predicted Venus's superhot temperature and comet-like characteristics. In his best-selling book Worlds in Collision, Dr. Immanuel Velikovsky presented his thesis that Venus was globally remembered as an Earth-threatening comet and will thus be extraordinarily hot due to its recent birth. In subsequent decades, a number of scholars, originally inspired by Velikovsky, began the process of reconstructing the catastrophic events Velikovsky suggested, applying a rigorous cross-cultural comparison of world mythology. The evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that Venus's extraordinary role in ancient astronomy, myth and religion, cannot be explained in terms of anything observed today. One of the leading comparative mythologist to explore this question is Ev Cochrane, a colleague for several decades of David Talbott and the late Dwardu Cardona. As Cochrane exhaustively outlined in his books Martian Metamorphoses and The Many Faces Of Venus, the relationship between Mars and Venus is just one extraordinary clue to the celestial catastrophes recorded in ancient testimony. In part 1 of this two-part presentation, Cochrane begins by explaining the genesis of his own research including his and his colleagues' conclusion that certain aspects of Velikovsky's thesis were incorrect. My initial interest in Velikovsky's work centered around his claim that certain archetypal mythological themes, such as the dragon combat, trace the celestial determinants in astronomical events. So for example, the universal motif of the dragon, he identified as a memory of the Venus Comet. And so, my earliest articles in this area sought to investigate this particular claim, and so I focused on dragon imagery and the mythology attached to Inanna and Ishtar in ancient Mesopotamia. I was at Iowa State pursuing my master's program and then I learned of Dave's research in 1981 and so I reached out to him and visited him in Portland and slowly but surely we agreed to collaborate on a series of articles for Kronos on the Venus comet. Dave and I knew from almost day one that the Venus and Mars cataclysms were prehistoric in nature and thus predate by thousands of years the historical reconstruction advanced in Worlds In Collision. So that was a major flaw, to put it mildly, and so a fundamental flaw at Velikovsky's entire methodology was the fact that he tended to focus on Hebrew and Greek lore, and as a result he often overlooked the precise parallels to be found in the much more ancient Egyptian and Sumerian traditions. Yet, it stands to reason that the oldest traditions, the ones, you know, closest in time to the actual catastrophic events in question, should preserve the most complete record of the events, and so by generally overlooking these ancient traditions, Velikovsky's entire enterprise was compromised. At the same time, Velikovsky was an amateur mythologist at best and just did not give serious enough consideration to methodology or to comparative mythology and comparative linguistics. He identified Aphrodite with the Moon, for example. Had he given the matter much consideration at all from a comparative standpoint, he would have understood that Aphrodite had to be identified with Inanna and Ishtar, and thus had to be the planet Venus, not the Moon. Likewise, his attempt to identify certain mythological characters such as Oedipus and Noah with historical figures, is just simply misguided. As late as 1951, most astronomers believed that Venus was Earth-like in nature and likely home to lush vegetation and various forms of life. But, as I pointed out in the Many Faces Of Venus, it's a historical fact that conventional astronomers have gotten virtually everything wrong about Venus, so why should we believe them now when they tell us Venus has been moving on the same orbit for billions and billions of years? At the same time, it's important to distinguish between ancient terminology and modern scientific definitions. So, in describing the planet Venus as a prototypical comet, the ancient sky watchers were not employing scientific language and somehow implying that Venus moved on a wildly erratic or elongated orbit -- characteristic of modern comets. Rather, in describing Venus as a dragon star or long-haired star or comet- like, the ancients simply meant that Venus took on the appearance of a dragon-like object or presented wildly disheveled hair. In each case, it's possible to reconstruct the history of the symbol in great question during its historical evolution. The serpent, for example, after a period of disorganized activity, ultimately came to encircle the planet Mars. Similarly, in the phase marked by cosmic disorder, Venus's comet- like hair was wildly disheveled and spread out, but during the later phase marked by the encircling of Mars and the crowning of the warrior hero, Venus's hair is tied up or bound or otherwise brought under control. And during this latter phase Venus's hair is typically described as green or turquoise blue in color, a clear pointer to the remarkable nature of the events in question. As noted, Venus's extraordinary role in ancient myth, religion, and the earliest astronomies, has never been satisfactorily explained by astronomers. We asked Ev for his thoughts on occasional attempts by mainstream scientists and academics to explain the anomaly. In numerous recent books on Venus and/or ancient mythology, astronomers or scholars are always trying to dream up some explanation for why Venus is associated with this or that characteristic. So for example, Patrick Moore, the astronomer, was trying to explain why Venus was always regarded as a female. So he said, "A female association is in fact general; this is natural enough, since to the unaided eye Venus is the loveliest of planets." I mean, talk about a ludicrous idea, I mean, why would being just lovely have anything to do with being female, why would it be found in cultures all around the world, they'd all arrive at the same exact idea. Similarly, the astronomer David Grinspoon and Ed Krupp, they both pointed to Venus's phase of a morning star being roughly two hundred sixty three days, and they claimed that because that is a close approximation to the gestation period for a human female, that that explained why the planet was associated with fertility or love. As if these indigenous tribes in South America were carefully marking out the two hundred sixty three days of Venus's orbits, you know. So again, it's just laughable that these guys come up with these ideas. One of my favorites is from the top scholar in Inanna religion from ancient Mesopotamia, and this gal's conclusion was that "Inanna's function as a bestower of kingship and the protectress of the city-state of Uruk may have given rise to her warlike character, since kingship followed the fortune of arms." And yet, one page later she gives a different explanation. She says, "Goddesses of war and victory predominate like Inanna and Ishtar." And she says, "This may stem from a battle metaphor in which women in childbirth, men in battle were seen as struggling with elemental forces of life and death." Again, a very distinguished scholar, it never occurs to her to check and see how Venus was represented in ancient Mexico or ancient China, or these other cultures in which case she'd find that they've represented her as a warrior there as well. And as a raging goddess, that type of stuff that was comet-like in nature, her idea just falls to the ground almost immediately, as just laughably inaccurate to the puzzle in question. As I tried to demonstrate in various books, Venus's traditional femininity and catastrophic histories are recorded around the globe, so just a list of the goddesses; you have Inanna and Ishtar in Mesopotamia, you have the Persian Anahita, the Greek Aphrodite, Arabic Al-Uzza... I chronicled dozens and dozens of goddesses in South America that are typically lumped together under Star Woman category that share the exact same characteristics. So for example, Star Woman is virtually indistinguishable from Greek Aphrodite. In other cases however, the original identification with Venus was not preserved, so for example, one of the most prominent symbols in Egyptian literature is the Eye of Horus, and it's clearly a celestial agent, it's clearly a catastrophic agent, but it is nowhere explicitly identified with the planet Venus and yet, the mythology of the Egyptian Eye of Horus is identical to that of Inanna and Ishtar. Dave and I have written numerous articles on that subject, documenting that beyond any shadow of a doubt. So too, the Indian goddess Kali and the Canaanite goddess Anat are both indistinguishable from Inanna and Ishtar as warring goddesses, and yet they were never identified with the planet Venus to the best of my knowledge. The history of scholarship, with respect to the analysis of Venus imagery, presupposes that the ancient sky watchers were describing the familiar Venus, peacefully moving on an orbit millions of years from the Earth and that nothing could have changed in the planet's appearance and behavior in the meantime. Yet, such an assumption is entirely unfounded. Indeed, the mere fact that the planet Venus was described in an Inanna-like terms around the globe, should be enough to refute this conventional position. How else but upon the basis of common experience of the Venus comet are we to account for the fact that ancient descriptions of the Venus around the globe are so similar? As noted previously, it's a mystery unresolved by mainstream science and academia, why the planet Venus would be historically identified as "feminine" and why the planet Mars would be identified as a "masculine" warrior. In fact, as Ev explains, a remarkable number of cultures described a mythical union between Mars and Venus, which became the basis for many sacred marriage traditions. The old saying "men are from Mars and women are from Venus" is not of a recent origin. I mean, this idea has been around since the dawn of time literally, and the identification will hold around the globe, even though there's nothing in the visual appearance or behavior of the planets currently that could ever inspire such traditions. So, just to take a familiar example: in ancient Greece the planet Venus is inseparably associated with sacred marriages -- the union of the sexes. So, Aphrodite is specifically identified as the bride in human marriages, while the bridegroom is, specifically in early Greek documents, identified with Ares. This is exactly the situation in ancient Mesopotamia, where Inanna is the subject of the sacred marriage and identified as the bride or the female participant in the sacred marriage and Dumuzi is the prototypical bridegroom. Now, we know this mythology traces to celestial determinants, because the very same situation is found in the New World, where the Skidi Pawnee of North America, have a sacred marriage involving Venus as the female bride in a sacred marriage, and the planet Mars as her husband. According to the Skidi account of creation, the union of Mars and Venus sparks creation, and in each of these three cases: Mesopotamia, Greece, and North America, the marriage takes place in a verdant garden and promotes fertility throughout the world. So these coincidences are just too specific and remarkable to be coincidences alone. We believe they trace to common observations. Stay tuned for part 2 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info New scientific reports from Nasa's Insight mission reveals startling data about the planet Mars. Data which challenges some fundamental ideas in planetary science. In late November of 2018, the Insight Lander touched down on the red planet's surface. One of the most surprising discoveries for investigators came in April of last year, when the Lander detected a rumble of seismic activity. According to investigators, to date they've detected a total of 450 quakes with an average magnitude roughly the equivalent of a 3 to 4 magnitude earthquake. The discovery is highly significant, since space scientists have previously ruled out the possibility of plate tectonics in the Martian interior - the hypothetical mechanism that geologists have long believed causes earthly quakes. As noted in the February report by Smithsonian magazine, “mysterious is the origin of these extraterrestrial trembles. While earthbound quakes arise when our planet's tectonic plates grind up against one another, Mars lacks the same internal architecture, leaving researchers puzzled about the source of its quakes.” However, as is often the case in the space sciences, the notion that plate tectonics cause earthquakes, is a questionable hypothesis, mistaken as fact. Indeed, the existence of seismic activity on Mars, is just one among several reasons to explore new theoretical pathways in Earth seismology. For decades, a number of scientists have proposed that the Earth-Sun connection plays a major role in triggering earthquakes. Some of the evidence that seems to support this view, includes the apparent correlation between sunspot activity and earthquakes. Along these lines, it's been proposed that changes in the geosphere result from a temporary intensification in Earth's magnetic field. In 2020, geoscience has yet to explain a host of strange phenomena that have been observed for many centuries preceding large earthquakes, including mysterious low-frequency electromagnetic emissions, rapid unexplained changes in the ionosphere, major temperature anomalies seen in satellite images, the observation of so-called earthquake lights from ridges and mountain peaks, and unexplained animal behaviors, including migration several days before a destructive quake. As early as 2003, Dr. Friedman T. Freund addresses these anomalies in his scientific paper: rocks that crackle and sparkle and glow, strange pre-earthquake phenomena, published in the Journal of Scientific Exploration. Dr. Freund proposes an explanation for earthquakes which would actually place the phenomenon in the realm of semiconductor physics. In the paper, Freund states that rock acts like what is known as a p-type semiconducting material when placed under stress. Deep within the Earth “positive holes” are liberated and flow to the Earth's surface, collecting there without being reabsorbed, which is the proposed mechanism behind earthquake lights. In the 2013 paper, Nature of Pre-Earthquake Phenomena and their Effects on Living Organisms, Dr. Freund offers a simple summary of his hypothesis, which could explain some of the anomalous earthquake- related animal behaviors. “Earthquakes are invariably preceded by a period when stresses increase deep in the Earth. Animals appear to be able to sense impending seismic events. During build-up of stress, electronic charge carriers are activated deep below, called positive holes.” “Positive holes have unusual properties: they can travel fast and far into and through the surrounding rocks. As they flow, they generate ultra-low frequency electromagnetic waves. When they arrive at the Earth's surface, they can ionize the air. When they flow into water, they oxidize it to hydrogen peroxides. All these physical and chemical processes can have noticeable effects on animals.” In the Electric Universe, the electrical nature of the Sun itself provides the missing link between sunspots and earthquakes. The Sun is connected to the larger electrical circuitry of the galaxy and the same electric discharges to the Sun that cause sunspots can affect our planet’s ionosphere. As physicist Wal Thornhill explains in his 2005 article, “Electric Earthquakes”, “The ionosphere forms one ’plate ‘of a capacitor, while the Earth forms the other. Changes of voltage on one plate will induce movement of charge on the other. But unlike a capacitor, the Earth also has charge distributed in rock beneath the surface. And if the subsurface rock has become semiconducting because of stress, there is an opportunity for sudden electrical breakdown to occur through that rock.” Thornhill proposes that underground processes occurred similar to those found in atmospheric lightning. The small-scale traveling of charge results in precursor electromagnetic effects, perhaps similar to the so called stepped leaders between cloud and ground with lightning. However, larger earthquakes may involve a vast electric circuit from below ground, through the atmosphere, to the ionosphere. In other words, Thornhill suggests that the Earth stores internal electrical energy, which can trigger subterranean lightning which may cause deep earthquakes. In this view, massive disturbances of the ionosphere, accompanying major earthquakes, are expected. The Martian environment is of course very different from Earth's. On our planet, Birkeland currents entering the poles, spark aurorae and modify our planet's magnetic field. However, Mars is said to have no global magnetic field and its atmosphere is extremely tenuous - only about 0.5%as dense as Earth's. When solar storms impact Mars, the result can be a global aurora which NASA's MAVEN spacecraft observed in 2017, along with radiation levels at the planet's surface that more than doubled previously detected levels. In recent years, scientists have observed other dramatic atmospheric and geologic events, which have coincided with impacts from solar protons storms at Mars. For a number of years, astronomers have puzzled over dramatic dust plumes, sometimes seen erupting up to hundreds of kilometers into Mars's upper atmosphere. As we reported in 2016, scientists studying Hubble Space Telescope images of Mars, found an apparent correlation between one such plume and the likely arrival of a CME at Mars. The lead author of a Nature paper on the Martian plumes said of the discovery, “There is a coincidence of both events at Mars, the CME arrival and plume observation. Therefore, it seems plausible there was a relation between both events.” The New Scientist report states of the finding, “One possibility is that plasma could be interacting with ice grains or dust lower down in the atmosphere and electrically charging them, boosting them higher, but it's not clear how the effect would be big enough.” In fact, dust storms on Mars which sometimes last for months and engulf the entire planet, as well as the towering dust devils which reach the size of Mount Everest, remain unresolved mysteries. Again, with an atmosphere only about 0.5% as dense as Earth's, how is the dust excavated from the surface and held aloft in the near vacuum of Mars’s upper atmosphere? What accelerates the winds and dust, up to speeds greater than 250 miles per hour? And why should the storms be composed of packed congregations of dust devils, as seen in this image from the Mars Odyssey mission? For well over a decade, NASA investigators have noted the tremendous electric fields associated with the dust devils. From the Electric Universe perspective, dust devils and tornados, both on Mars and on Earth, are themselves forms of electrical discharge. The Electric Universe has always predicted that the Martian ionosphere is electrically charged even though, unlike Earth, it has no thunderstorms. This viewpoint is outlined in the 2005 TPOD, ’When Dust Storms Engulf Mars’. “On Mars, electrical effects will reach directly the ionosphere to the surface without the ameliorating leakage via storm clouds that we see on Earth. Unlike radiant energy from the Sun, electrical energy can accumulate in the ‘planetary capacitor’ for some time, with a potential for planet-altering events when the atmosphere finally ’breaks down’ and massive discharge activity is initiated.” On Mars, as on Earth, could an electrical circuitry from beneath the ground, to the atmosphere, to the ionosphere, be driving seismic activity? Of course, planetary science has only begun exploring the Martian environment, so from any vantage point surprising revelations are to be expected. However, the discovery of seismic activity on a world with ”no plate tectonics,” is not a surprise to proponents of the Electric Universe. But it might serve as a call to planetary scientists, to begin exploring theoretical alternatives, such as those offered by the Electric Universe. [Music] 
welcome to space news from the electric universe brought to you by the thunderbolts project at Thunderbolts dot info it is a great paradox in comet science we are told that a comet nucleus is a ball of ice or dirty snowball or icy fluff ball it accreted billions of years ago in the solar system's infancy comets are said to sublimate ices as they move toward the Sun and solar warming is responsible for much cometary activity including the energetic Jets and the production of the familiar coma entail more recently as the required ices have not been observed on comet nuclei scientists and science media have taken to referring to comets as quote deep-fried ice cream insisting that the body of ice must be present but is buried under an outer crust if his reasoning leaves unexplained countless puzzles and comets science for instance it is an unresolved mystery how a so-called ball of ice deep-fried or otherwise can survive an extremely close approach to the Sun as we see with occasional sungrazer comets in 2011 the Comet Lovejoy astonished astronomers when the comet nucleus somehow survived intact after one hour in the Sun's corona also unresolved is the question of how comets begin producing evidence of water in their comas and vast distances from the Sun much too far to explain through solar heating such was the case with the comet 67p whose apparent water output as well as the production of an amazing abundance of rich molecules was first detected while still hundreds of millions of kilometres from the Sun and countless other enduring puzzles abound we asked the question can the science of electrochemistry provide the answer to many Comet mysteries dr. franklin anariba a specialist in electrochemistry was a featured speaker at the Thunderbolts project's international conference the tipping point in 2013 dr. anariba is also scheduled to speak at the forthcoming 2015 conference path of discovery taking place June 25th to 29th in Phoenix Arizona we now present you in full dr. anariba z-- 2013 talk commentary electrochemistry a transcript of the talk may be found in the description box of this video ok so what I want to do here is try to give you an illustration of what can happen actually in comets so as you can see the time of my my talk here is cometary electrochemistry and actually that's the only thing that's new here is the term when you look at the leadership for instance you see the astro electrochemistry actually is this plenty of material air I sure do chemistry means that allowed the reactions that happen in space I actually driven by a potential difference in addition I came across a series of Russian scientists who actually proposed that electricity in the nucleus of comets can actually drive that the icing process of say water of methane so those ideas and their new ways new here is the idea that you have electrochemistry or electricity driving chemical reactions either in the nucleus of the comments or in the comments or the comments that's what's nice and that's what I want to talk about and I figured that most of you don't know who I am and so I just wanted to point here the fact that I live in Singapore I've been work living working there for 4 years and I think some of you I think I talked to being there before alright so this is the outline of my talk it's going to be brief and I'm gonna keep it simple because of the audience is very diverse tell you a little bit about what is electrochemistry why is the composition or comets and how the combination of these two concepts can actually allow us to provide with a you know it's like a framework of reactors happening in comments I'll also mention the other chemical model in question the question about cyanide production and how the model can explain this and I just make a 1 prediction if this model is correct there should be one observation that which to see in the future okay so what is very interesting for a chemistry standpoint is that energy in a way electricity it's kind of freeing nature this is a very good example here and you probably know this this is a zinc material and here we have a copper and once we connect this to what's going to happen is that electrons that are actually in the zinc we actually go in direction of the copper now electrons going flowing in a particular direction is electricity this happens in spontaneously so nature I should give us free energy the energy that you need to spend is in how you arrange these materials so that's that's the main concept here now another concept I want to I want to be pouring here is this in electrochemistry if you have this particular self which is suitable take cell as a function of time what's going to happen is the zinc material will actually dissolve it give us of the electron and a same time dielectric come from the atom they actually covers a higher right so in the negative side in a negative region of the particular cell you get the solution and on the positive region here in the copper you're going to get a accumulation of material this material comes in because this is this copper here is in solution this is a copper solution right but any other material be attractive because in this region you're going to have extra electrons so they'll be attracted to it will capture this electrons and the material we accumulate so a key point here is that you have active electrons you're going to have this solution on the negative region you can have accumulation of material in the positive region that's the key part in this slide now energy like I said before is naturally storing metals we can harness it it's not difficult to harness it we actually do it all the time the example this is a batteries batteries is its energy right this is story in the only difference here is how is a range that's it another concept that I want to introduce here in this slide is the idea having inner electrodes here show you active electrons they actually the electrode itself actually dissolves accumulates and in this particular example here I'll say that have electrodes which actually provide only the surface with the electrochemical reaction occurs good example these are carbon gold palladium platinum for instance because there are no reactive materials right now this will come handy when you think about the nuclear of comment interactions actually occurring in that particular case in location now I know some of you have know began to chemistry the chemist is actually a very difficult subject so what I'll do here is I'm going to tell you what is the main concept of electrochemistry it's very simple you can have a reduction in oxidation reaction here's an example of an oxidation reaction which occurs in a negative charge region and I'm doing this on purpose because the terminology that we use electrochemistry is different from physicists and engineers in terms of cathode and anode so in the negative charge region you have the say for instance I add some of our atom it gives up three electrons and you get an iron right these electrons over here if you're able to push them in a particular direction is what give us a current and the reduction will actually occur in the positive region yeah good example here two protons plus two electrons will give you a hydrogen gas all right so now this is the basic electric current this is what cannot survive to carry at this point well well do now is talk about comments why is the compositional comments well now we know the comments are actually formed by several minerals kind of minerals this is a good example over here this is olivine associated walk this means that you probably associated with high temperatures maybe with lightning and this is just various forms of olivine and while pinpoint to you is the fact that they have the rich in transition metals so this issue metals are important in actor chemistry because either they provide a surface or they provide electrons that easy to reduce an oxidized they have various oxidation states another point about the people in here is it is all silicates silicon and oxygen silicon oxygen a very abundant oxygen is a very rich lecture or atom electron rich which can also provide the lectures to provide current provided you have a potential difference another example is vision height associated with Mars and moon meteorites again very reaching iron Cuba Knights copper iron and sulfur form in liquid water this has been found in comets this is very interesting because that means the very complex chemistry going on here also rich in in iron another decision made at that have been found in the nuclei of comets are titanium vanadium in the form of nitrous platinum Ozma vitinho toxin malignant just to mention a few so you can see is very complex the compensation for electrochemical points complex in comments in the comment or comments this is the several gases that we identified carbon monoxide carbon dioxide series of oxides with nitrogen software oxides hydroxyl and I left our oxygen a night a molecular molecular oxygen molecular nitrogen so did you find all this compounds in comets that will tell you already that this is very complex chemistry going on here in addition to that you find organic molecules methane cyanide meth no eating anything ether ammonia carbonates D so again the level of complexity is beginning to get more higher I would say and more complex organic molecules I'd be identifying in comments I mean let's use natural for instance vinegar or acetic acid amorphous carbon you can think about charcoal polycyclic hydrocarbons with very important in in in agriculture for instance people who you know the work and culture they always talk about P ages because they control basically the pH and in soils for instance and surprisingly dry soon this is an amino acid so how can this motor work twelve artists of chemistry I'm talking about the composition comment so how can we apply this major chemical model here is a cartoon and it's not up to scale as you can see thusly we have the Sun and here we have the solar wind which are called the proton flux because that's mostly the composition even though there is no electrons in there and here we have nuclear a nucleus da steel ion plasma tail in a coma this is what this is what we see right this is the typical observation for comments so why am i proposing here is this paradigm or this model can be true if we show that we have a potential difference in this particular case making the Sun the positive region because of that or the other protons and of the solar wind and the nuke the nickels would be the negative region now if you're able to show this then you can apply with our fear and to chemical model so this is the key part I think this is why it's going to take us a lot of time in the future try to show that there's a potential difference here you can do it indirectly now in detail how is this one going to work well we work at the following way here is a electrical negative region which is can be the nucleus right because it's rich in minerals with silicates and to set your meadows and here it would be the solar wind which surrounds the nucleus as the comet approaches the Sun okay so what we need to do here like I said before is to have a potential difference if this is the case this would drive any reaction I saw you know the key part here is that the potential difference is big enough to drive there any reaction that you want we do this in a lab all the time now this potential difference is going to create a current flow from the nucleus towards the the positive region which is the solar wind while doing so you can see the comet why because what happens is you have this flow of electrons the electrons gonna collide with some of the electricity on these molecules say for instance carbon monoxide right so the electro there's been driven from the nucleus towards the positive region we go to the comarca live with some of gasses it's going to excite electrons first we'll see concealed carbon monoxide to a higher energy State we need the case down it is going to give off energy this energy is the one we see in terms of you know in the visible range right so the intensity of the coma and the colour of the coma would depend on what kind of gas is being excited right so it depends on the abundance now what kind of reactions can we have on the nucleus and if I get it will be a complex of some of you because this is chemistry but I will keep it simple here we know that iron two-plus for instance exists in these minerals right it's a really iron but if you have a potential difference thermodynamic squeaking this is possible you can give up an electron this electron means current the same for manganese and so on so forth even you can even have manganese right with some of the other water vapour or gases that can be in the coma you can have more complex structures you can find you can find solids manganese oxide for instance and again you get current some of the silicate material that I show you I cook the a part of the mineral can react with protons from the solar wind and you can get some of hydroxides I mean the possibilities are endless right because we all know exactly what's really happening there the point here is you can get current and you can get material what happens when the part of the sorry on the positive side I can envision only one type of reaction and it is the formation of hydrogen gas that's it all right okay so in more detail if we have you if we have a common here this is a cartoon this model can actually explain the plasma formation of the coma right depending again on put or the abundance of all these gases maybe all the gases are left up so for instance if you have 80 % light abundance you get one particular color but again tensity if you have oxygen a higher abundance 80% the color of the coma and intensive the coma is going to be different well let me see if I can finish this up soon the plasma tail can be explained by the formation of ions the plasma tails most positive ions you can explain here in addition to the the dust tail can be explained by the formation of these solids oxides hydroxides in addition to that also some chunks of minerals and most importantly here is a I wanna start talking about and thinking about this particular model I predicted the formation of hydrogen gas even before I read the literature because I have no background on comets and was able to see here is that I was it was very exciting he's a help Bob for instance comment a hydrogen cloud was actually observed very large hydrogen cloud so this mod also explains that now how can we know it is he like to connect a Prosecco hang on in comments there was this particular exhibition four years ago silent information and not dust formation so what happened here is this in the standard model whenever you have sublimation of a gas dust will always form because the idea is that you have a dirty ball or dirty ice ice wall right so sublimation of say water will actually bring out formation against excuse me of particles in this case we don't see that so how can we how can we explain this electrochemistry two different ways one way is the standards of chemistry where their action actually occurs in the nucleus right you know I was able to see for instance and I'm rushing here because of time was able to see here is that I mean amines I should precursor for signed affirmation provided you have acidic conditions in the presence of protons so that in the solar wind is it's a it's makes it amenable viable so this is a methylamine we have a glycine a more complex it means well so as you have these structures they're in a coma and the nucleus you can get you can get cyanide and I'm going to skip this like ago I just gonna make sure very quick is that this is a way that you can actually do experiments on the lab you can actually have those gases in this container here you have two electrodes tungsten and soon still you apply a potential and you carry the reaction what you have the reaction you apply electric field you push it into a mass spectrometer and you can detect the product and this work has been done already by Navaro Gonzalez in national university of Mexico he was trying to simulate time to simulate the reactions in the atmosphere of Titan and that's what he did so this is elect in 1967 work by Matthew see in Matthews I think was mentioned yesterday that this particular experiment will actually give you amino acids but this particular experiment also give you if you have a combination of methane in ammonium once you give you sign our articles if you have a coronal discharge and this has been done this experimental data you'll also get hydrocarbons in Sinai importantly if you simulate lightning in nitrogen and methane you also get had the carpets in silence so there's two possibilities here and I got a few more slides I think to go here what I'm going to show you here briefly is that you can have a reversibility between CO and in alcohols CO and alcohols Co and alcohols and methane so there's no direct connection between CO and in cyanide which I was looking for it's a two-step process you can have the reduction of CL into into into methane and then this can be - you know maybe electrical discharge form cyanide this is the two-step process I didn't find one voice directly and this is the last slide here so please bear with me I got 17 minutes I think I got one minute left this is a soccer ball tomogram some of you have never seen this before alright so let me see if I can I can help you out follow it this is a graph of voltage in this direction and current in this direction I did I didn't write it here mine my negligence this is current this is voltage if you start up voltage a and I give you the direction over here this is you know you have two electrodes and you have a solution for instance or you have gases if you if you go from voltage a voltage B and you have chemicals in his system you be able to see sort of reduction process here so whatever chemical it is it will gain an electron or several electrons and you move it all the way to bowl touch B and then if you reverse it right whatever compound you you form here by the reduction process we oxidize and it make sure you get to this point so here you have a reduction oxidation this is a typical typical soccer ball time entry process now how can you supply to comments well if you this is the the sound here's the idea about the comment a little bit and this is the direction come if you go in this reaction for instance as the comet approaches the Sun you should be able to see a reaction why every reaction would that be depends on the composition as the comment departs the Sun you should be able to see another type of reaction if it is reversible you should be the reversibility here but okay maybe it's not reversible but you should be able to see a reaction here and no interaction here so this is the prediction that I make a good example here is going between amino and in cyanide right I don't know if NASA had to make these reservations but this should be something that you occur all right so this is the last slide here thank you for your time and well basically saying here is that this is a illustration this is still not a theory this is just an illustration because I don't have four weeks to work on this but it seems to be the distance to chemical model while you have provided you have I said I repeat the voltage difference can account for the hydrogen gas formation the plasma and the coma does tale information and the ionized plasma that you see do you see there and actually these are and also any other reaction that doesn't involve dust dust formation and this model can actually allow us to predict based on the reversibility of electrochemical systems what will happen well thank you for your time for continuous updates on space news from the electric universe stay tuned to Thunderbolts dot info 
You've just entered the theater of an alien sky. If the words and images seem strange to you there's a reason for this. Our world was once a vastly different place. To experience this won't hurt you and there is nothing to fear. Discourses on an Alien Sky With David Talbott The Myth of the Heavenly Twins In recent episodes of this series, we've reviewed the mythic ship of heaven, a vehicle of the ancient sun god. Close to the Earth, a crescent on the face of the immense planet Saturn, turned in the polar sky, brightening and dimming in an archaic daily cycle. Ancient words and symbols for this cycle invariably reflect the symmetrical opposition of the crescent, in it's contrasting phases. A phase of growing bright and a phase of growing dim. Crescent to the left and crescent to the right. Crescent above or below, all in explicit connection to a daily cycle with no counterpart in any celestial behavior observed today. This unique behavior, by it's specificity, gives us an ideal opening to the ancient Myth of the Heavenly Twins. It seems that every well-documented culture preserved memories of the primeval twins, but few researchers appear to have noticed the underlying unity of this theme. The closer we can get to the more archaic cultural expressions, the more clearly the improbable unity will stand out. Some of the particulars are long familiar. Astrologically, the cosmic twins find their most popular expression in the constellation of Gemini. Of course, this story itself is never explained ... and the constellation is just one of numerous echoes of the global archetype in later times. But what inspired the original idea? In our reconstruction of the ancient sky, the answer comes from the fundamental role of the rotating crescent, reflected in the strategic placement and unique gestures of the cosmic twins around a central figure and we see the same geometry in the two faces of the ancient god himself. Two contexts of the mirror images standout. The first points back to the crescent above and below, and the second to the same crescent in it's positions to the left and right in the daily cycle. By far the most data comes from the Egyptian symbolism, expressing the mirror-like aspects of the crescent in the concept of the symbolic Ka, usually translated as a double. But why was the Ka hieroglyph simply a pair of arms? Our explanation is that the crescent-form, when seen behind the polar column that is so fundamental to this reconstruction, readily provoked an imaginative interpretation as two arms or wings. In fact, the Egyptian Ka symbol was the perfect expression of the twin-like aspect of the crescent, one position in the daily cycle appearing as a mirror or "twin" of the opposite position. Upright arms in the phase of growing bright, inverted arms in the phase of dimming. The concept of a "double" in the sense of a mirror image could not be more appropriate. The symbolism is abundantly evident in iconography of the Phoenician goddess, Tanit. In ancient Egypt, the concept also found expression in the oppositely placed twin goddesses Isis and Nephthys, in mirror positions to the left and right of the central sun god Ra or one of his mythic counterparts. This connection to the enclosing crescent will explain why the arms or hands of the twin goddesses so frequently displayed an enclosing aspect in relationship to the king. When paired as twins, divine figures represented the two halves of the celestial kingdom, marked out by a revolving crescent in it's daily circuit. In the Pyramid Texts, the king declares, "Isis is before me, Nephthys is behind me". Or, "The two mistresses of Buto accompany you to the right and left". Or alternatively, the king declares that the goddess "Neith is behind me, and Selket is before me". Again, nothing in natural experience today will account for the pervasive imagery. The twin aspects of the giant sphere of Saturn came to identify that sphere as the vast womb of creation itself. "Oh you two who conceived Ra, you shall give birth to me... The two great ladies (Isis and Nephthys) bore you". "My mother is Isis, my nurse is Nephthys". The king ascends upon the thighs of Isis, the king climbs upon the thighs of Nephthys". Elsewhere, in imitation of Ra, the deceased king aspires to "shine between the two thighs of Nut". Keep in mind, that these roles of goddess figures placed into the service of crescent symbolism must not be confused with the role of the planet Venus, the prototypical goddess, in our reconstruction, a quite different topic discussed earlier, with much more discussion to follow. Our point here is, that the cosmic twins find a persuasive explanation in the twin-like aspects of the revolving crescent. For example, the crescent as the image of a cosmic ship. See that connection, and the identification of the sun god's boat with the cosmic twins comes as no surprise at all. The twins, Isis and Nephthys, were named the "two boats." Or alternately, the Egyptians invoked the two boats as Atet and Sektet. Atet, the descending boat of "growing strong" was linked to the left side of the primeval sun, as we would expect, while the ascending Sektet boat, meaning "growing weak" was linked to the right side. These twin aspects of the revolving crescent give us a key to the larger panorama of Egyptian symbolism. For the Egyptians, the position of the crescent above and below, marked out two regions called the two "Aterts". Chapter 141 of the Egyptian Book of the Dead identifies the upper Atert with inactivity or dimness, usually mistranslated as the region of the Night-ship, but literally meaning the ship in it's phase of dimming or growing weak, at the top of it's circuit. Conversely, the texts connect the so-called "Day ship", literally the ship of brightness with the lower Atert, all in perfect harmony with the symbolism we've already noted in our previous Discourses. Right and left, above and below are the essential qualities of the cosmic twins. For example, in Egypt we see the aspects above and below in the symbolic pairing of the figures Nut and Geb. The goddess, signified the upper region and the male half, the lower portion of this circuit, was defined by the male power Geb denoting also the twin peaks of Akhet, the world mountain. Together the two mythic images meant the unity of the celestial domain, considered as the prototype of Egypt: the two lands, upper and lower, seen as a copy on Earth of the Divine Plan first displayed in the sky. The idea was stated emphatically by Henri Frankfort in his groundbreaking book, "Kingship and the Gods". The so-called 'two lands of Egypt' he said, "reflected the original order of creation itself". "A state dualistically conceived must have appeared to the Egyptian the manifestation of the order of creation." Indeed, every primary interpretation of the revolving crescent was, predictably, linked to the dualities of above and below, or left and right. It was not just as a pair of outstretched arms that we see the twin roles of the crescent, upright in the phase of growing bright and inverted in the phase of growing dim. And not just in the symbolism of the cosmic ship. We've seen the same symbolism of the archaic day and night in oppositely (or symmetrically) positioned horns. And most incongruously, the upright and inverted twin peaks of heaven. In all instances, the upright and inverted forms express precisely the same connections to the phases of the daily cycle. The most fundamental fact about the cosmic twins is that they are not just twins, but they surround and enclose a venerated god, or king, or central star. Confirmed by simply observing how the symmetrically placed arms, or arms and wings, so frequently enclose and protect the king. Amongst the most famous of primeval twins were the Greek Dioscuri who, according to the leading expert A.B. Cook, represented two halves of a celestial circuit. Here we see the Dioscuri in a pose directing us to ancient symbolism of two enclosing arms about a central orb, or star, or divine figure. Since the cosmic twins are mirror images of each other, it's not surprising that the Greeks retained the connection by placing the central star and the two Dioscuri on a mirror. In mythic terms, the contrasting twin-like positions of the illuminated crescent were the two faces of the primeval power Janus, giving rise to the so-called Janiform countenance. Thus, Joannes the Lydian, describes the ancient celebrants honoring the god Janus on the first day of January, his month, "dressed up in a two-faced mask, and people call him Saturnus, identifying him with Kronos (the Greek god of Saturn)." Of course, the entire idea can only appear absurd. But from the vantage point of our reconstruction, it is the predictable, the inescapable, astronomical connection. And by this reasoning from ancient facts, we acquire a starting point for a new and radical interpretation of the cosmic twins, a subject to which we'll return after laying further ground on the visual dynamics of the Polar Configuration.

[Music] [Music] Prior to the launch and successful commencement of operations of the James Webb Space Telescope, I made three Thunderbolts videos in which I discussed  the Webb’s significance in the context of Electric Universe cosmology issues. And I made several predictions of what the Webb Space Telescope would reveal. This is the second episode to report on success in relation to those predictions that emerged in the very first release of Webb imaging. Before proceeding with an analysis of those images, I need to deal with a few matters to set the scene. Redshift refers to an increase in the wavelength of light, measured as a shift in the frequency of spectral emission - or absorption lines that are characteristic of particular elements or chemical compounds, when compared to the wavelengths emitted by those elements or compounds in the laboratory. In Standard Model astrophysics, the redshift of a particular object can be a mix of three separate components. The first component is cosmological redshift. That expression refers to an object's redshift that is due solely to the expansion of the universe, the expansion of space-time itself. This results in a recessional velocity between galaxies that are at rest in their local frame. The second component is redshift arising as a Doppler effect from the object's motion in relation to other objects in their local frame. Such motion is referred to as proper motion or peculiar motion. The third component is gravitational redshift which refers to an effect predicted by general relativity, namely the lengthening of light waves traveling out of the gravitational field of a massive object. The first two components give rise to a level of confusion for laypeople, precisely because the word ‘velocity’ is used by astrophysicists and cosmologists in both  contexts. The word ‘velocity’ is routinely used to refer to the rate at which galaxies and other extragalactic objects are receding on account of the expansion of space, rather than their proper motion. On the other hand, the word ‘velocity’ is also used to refer to proper motions inferred from small differences in the redshifts of, for example, interacting galaxies; or galaxies within a galaxy cluster; or differences measured within a galaxy or a cloud. And in the case of galactic jets, much larger differences in redshift are correctly attributed to proper motion. When an active galaxy with a particular redshift has bipolar jets, one jet will have lower redshift, indicating that matter in the jet is traveling towards us. The other jet will have a higher redshift, indicating matter in that jet is traveling away from us. Nevertheless, in the Standard Model, the redshift of all galaxies and quasars beyond our local universe, is almost entirely cosmological redshift, arising from the expansion of the universe. It was Hubble's observation and the spectral analysis by Milton Humason,  that established the correlation between luminosity and redshift. In every direction that Hubble observed, decreasing luminosity correlated with increasing  redshift. It was the interpretation of redshift as a Doppler effect, arising from recessional velocity, which led to the conclusion that the universe was expanding. Simple extrapolation backwards in time drove Gamow and others, to conclude that the universe must have started with what later came to be called the Big Bang. It is commonly said that Big Bang Theory is based on three main categories of observational evidence, called the three pillars: the expansion of the universe, proved by the Hubble redshift luminosity relationship; the cosmic microwave background; and the abundances of the light  elements. However, it is the first of these that is the essential foundation of Big Bang cosmology. If the universe is not expanding, then the whole basis for theorizing about the consequences of a Big Bang is removed. Make no mistake, it is the expansion of the universe embodied in the Hubble law, that is the essential foundation on which the whole of Big Bang cosmology is erected. If the observed correlation between redshift and luminosity was not due to a Doppler effect, but due to something else, as Hubble suspected and as Halton Arp demonstrated, then that foundational axiom is destroyed and with it, the vast edifice that is Big Bang cosmology  collapses. Galaxies and quasars with significantly different redshifts may appear close to one another on the plane of the sky. However, in the Standard Model, this  must be a chance alignment, because a significant difference in redshift must mean that the objects are in different parts of the universe such that any physical connection between them would be utterly impossible. Similarly, in the Standard Model, viewed from Earth, it would be utterly impossible for a high redshift object to be in the foreground of a low redshift object. This is a bit like the proposition ‘all swans are white’. Just as finding a single black swan would disprove that proposition, finding a single example where objects with significantly different redshifts were physically connected, or where a high redshift object was in front of an object with much lower redshift, would destroy the essential foundation on which the whole superstructure of Big Bang cosmology is erected. Of course that analogy is imperfect. In the case of quasars and high redshift galaxies, the astrophysicists have never in fact seen any of these objects up close. They do not know whether the redshift of these objects represent a distance arising from expanding space. They have never demonstrated that any of those ‘swans’ are white. In my June 21st, 2021 Thunderbolts video, I noted that quote, “Arp's research into high-redshift quasars shows they are local.” Unquote. That is, quasars are not at the extreme distances indicated by the Standard Model interpretation of their high  redshift. I made the following prediction quote, ”So my first prediction is that the James Webb Telescope will support Halton Arp’s research which shows plainly that high-redshift quasars are born in pairs and emitted in oppositely directed jets along the spin axis of a low-redshift active galaxy. They are not at the edge of the visible universe; they are in the neighborhood of their parent galaxy. Therefore, they are not incredibly distant, bright and large. There is no superluminal motion; they are nearby and youthfully faint.” Unquote. A final adjudication on that prediction will require a substantial accumulation of Webb data. That will take years, and yet Webb’s first science images provide a vindication of Arp's basic contention that cosmological redshift is intrinsic, and not due to the expansion of the universe, and its theory of quasar birth from active galactic nuclei. The first piece of evidence arises from the Webb images of Stephan's Quintet, and a quasar appearing in the main field of the galaxy. Quasars became central to Arp's research program. He gave an account of the origins of that research program in a contribution to an edited volume “Against the Tide. A Critical Review by Scientists of How Physics & Astronomy Get Done.” Quote: "Quasars were discovered in 1963 [by radio astronomers] and [optical] astronomers rushed to observe them because they assume their high redshifts meant they were at great distances and that the nature of the universe would thereby be revealed. The Caltech radio astronomer who isolated the positions of the first quasars asked for telescope time to observe their spectra and obtain their redshifts. He was told, only certain of the faculty could observe with the 200-inch telescope. Those select few went on to measure the spectra and reap the headlines and the original discoverer left the field in disgust. As a Carnegie astronomer I was observing on the telescope but the radio positions of the quasars were kept secret and so I did the next best thing - photographing peculiar and disrupted galaxies to see how they were formed and evolved. Ironically, in the end, they turned out to be surrounded by quasars which were  obviously not out at the edge of the universe. That news was not welcomed by the observers who  had inflated their reputations with discoveries of a new quote ‘most luminous object in the universe’ every few weeks.” Unquote. It was ironic indeed because quasars took center stage in the evidence of anomalous redshift assembled by Arp and others over the following decades. This is a Hubble image of Stephan’s Quintet released in the year 2000. It's a composite of three images obtained by Hubble's Wide Field Camera II. Two were in visible light and a third at 814 nanometers in the very near infrared. NGC 7319 is the Galaxy at the top of that image. In the early 2000’s Arp was part of a team that identified an ultra-luminous X-ray object as a high-redshift quasar, apparently in the foreground of NGC 7319. That discovery was announced in a paper published in 2005 entitled, “The Discovery of a High Redshift X-Ray Emitting QSO Very close to the Nucleus of NGC 7319.” It’s required reading for all cosmologists while looking at the relevant  images. This is a portion of the 2000 Hubble image with processing to increase contrast and saturation which appears in that paper. The Galaxy NGC 7319 has a redshift of Z=0.0225, whereas the quasar has a redshift of Z=0.2114, numerically almost ten times greater. On the assumption of the Standard Model's redshift - distance relationship, and using Ned Wright's calculator with default values, NGC 7319's measured redshift  of Z=0.0225, places it at a lookback time, or distance of about 311 million light years when the light captured by Hubble was emitted. On the other hand, the quasar has a measured redshift of Z=2.114, placing it at lookback time, or distance, of about 10.58 billion light years when the light captured by Hubble was emitted on the Standard Model. That is  some 34 times farther away than NGC 7319. Even on the Hubble image, it was  obvious to Arp that the quasar was in the foreground of NGC 7319, and therefore closer than  NGC 7319. Look at the dark dust lane that passes on a diagonal path that visually encloses a portion of the quasar. Not only did the quasar appear in the foreground, as this image plainly shows, there is also a V-shaped jet extending from the core of the galaxy to the quasar. The existence of that feature, previously identified by mainstream astronomers, was confirmed in radio observations by Arp and his colleagues. Arp writes, “This is the only system found so far in which there is the possibility of demonstrating even more clearly that the QSO and Galaxy are interacting.” It was striking evidence that the quasar had been ejected from the nucleus of NGC 7319. Arp's Standard Model critics insisted that the Quasar was at the unimaginably enormous distance indicated by its redshift and therefore had to be a background object, but so bright that it shines through the entire dust and plasma of the disk of the galaxy. And as for the jet, well whatever. Subsequent to that paper in 2009, a further Hubble image of Stephan’s quintet, obtained with Hubble's upgraded Wide Field camera III, was released. Here is  the indicated portion of that 2009 Hubble image with the quasar marked by an arrow. That image did not change the arguments, notwithstanding that it seemed even clearer that a dark dust lane passed behind at least some portion of the field of the quasar. The dust lane has a ragged edge - perhaps there was a deviation of the dust lane at precisely the point where the quasar appears. As we shall shortly see, Webb images of NGC 7319 within Stephan’s Quintet now put the issue beyond any reasonable argument. [Music] 
Hello everyone! So, my title. My talk is titled; Creator's Second Hand but I probably wouldn't be able to explain this title, not until the very end of my talk so I ask you to wait a little bit for it. Now I'm gonna give you some introduction on what I'm going to talk about and that will be, first of all I'm gonna give some general questions, general points about electricity and gravity in space and what we can probably explain with the help of electromagnetism. And then I'm gonna give you a couple of theories by Pavel Mantashyan shine on alternative to dark matter and formation of the solar system. And then I'm gonna give you a promised conclusion about the title of my talk and what is what, what's the point of my talking in general, OK. So now, since I've known, since I've mentioned Pavel Mantashyan, I'm gonna say a couple of words about him. He's an inventor and author of more than 60 inventions, four books and 30 articles, but since they are in Russian, I don't give any names here. It's actually that we've never met in person. It's that I read his books and I really like them and since I've already, I was into Electric Universe stuff at that time, we've agreed that I will come here and give a talk because Pavel Mantashyan cannot give a talk in English, so it ended up like that. Okay now, we've never met in person as I mentioned because he lives in Russia but I live in Belarus and maybe some of you might wonder where it is; so I'm going to show you. Here's a map of Europe with my country. And it just so happens that Immanuel Velikovsky was born in Belarus; he was born in Vitebsk, a couple of hundred kilometers from where I was born and where I live in Minsk. And OK, so that's kind of where it all started right. And so at the right you can see our national flag and I wouldn't put it here if it weren't for this vertical band that you can see on the left. This is a really archaic piece of ornament and I might be a bit paranoid but it looks kinda like Peratt's Squatterman  or something like that, OK. So I'll just give this bait so maybe you would come and search more info about my country. OK, since I've shown you where Belarus is, I'm gonna ask you where we are in terms of theories and ideas and hypotheses, and of course if you look at modern astrophysics you would find that it is pretty much dominated by gravity. OK, so we kind of have this huge thing of gravity and only a thin layer of everything else on the top of it, OK. So just like Don Scott have quoted that "If there is electromagnetism, well, it probably doesn't do anything." OK, it's just a decoration of sorts. And so, there is the principle of charge neutrality of cosmic objects whether it is explicitly stated or implicitly, kind of being there, OK, which states that there are no electric currents there, there is no net charge separation etc etc. But when people try to kind of use this worldview to describe the real data that we have from observations, they have kind of, they get kind of odd results and in order to fit those results into the hypotheses and theories; they have to invent some sort of crutches or even peglegs maybe. Those artificial things like dark matter and dark energy and many, many other things. Well, I'm gonna talk about dark matter a little bit later but I just want to note about the dark energy that when people say that universe is expanding and the space is expanding, in my opinion this is logically incoherent statements. Well if you say that the ether is expanding, well that's ok with me. I find it a good idea but the universe cannot expand. If you try to define all the notions really carefully, you would find that this is a logically incoherent statement. But if you want to discuss this please contact me, I don't have much time to discuss it here, ok? So, since we kinda know where we are now, where can we go from here, OK. So we can we can suggest or hypothesize that there is charge separation and electric currents in space and maybe that would allow us to throw out all of these crutches and go along on our own feet, OK. So maybe we should hypothesize that electromagnetism plays a major role alongside gravity in the universe. And so the central hypothesis of the proposed theory by Pavel Mantshyan, and I'm going to reinstate it a little bit later, is that electric charges do exist in space and he says that they exist actually on stars, OK. And now some general points that I've promised on electromagnetism. I've here listed the field of applications of electromagnetism, of possible applications. Now magnetic fields in space, I'm pretty sure that you are aware that almost every object in the universe posesses at least some sort of magnetic field associated with it whether it is an induced magnetic field like. for example. on Venus or it is an intrinsic magnetic field like in the bar magnets or on Earth etc etc And if you take a look at Maxwell's equations you would find that the magnetic field actually arises wherever we have a changing electric field and the changing electric field means that we have a motion of the source of electric field and the source of electric field are charged particles and when we move charged particles we get electric currents. So, there's a pretty much straight forward connection between the electric currents and the magnetic fields. So if we acknowledge the existence of electric currents thus we can explain the existence of magnetic fields. It's as simple as that, OK. Now solar wind acceleration. I'm pretty sure that you're aware that the fast solar wind that's coming out of a coronal holes is getting accelerated like from 3 solar radii to up to 10 solar radii, from 350 to up to 800 kilometers per second and slow solar wind also gets an acceleration of around 100 km/s. And so, how can we explain this acceleration? Well, the most simple idea that can be probably out there is to suppose that really the Sun possesses some electric charge, and this electric charge just accelerates these photons, excuse me, protons of the solar wind outwards by simple electrostatics, OK. Of course in real in real life so to speak there would be complications with certain plasma effects like Debye screening and maybe some other things but I think it's a good start to start from here, OK. Now sunspots formation, I noted here that there's a theory by Pavel Manteshyan about how vortices form in general. Unfortunately I cannot give many details on this but just in a couple of words, the theory states, well basically, that the motion of charged particles in a magnetic field creates the rotation of these particles due to Lorentz force. And if we have a big quantity of such particles, they start building up angular momentum in this field and thus we, due to fluid dynamics, the whole system starts to rotate. And that's how that's how we get these vortices. Like, for example, tornadoes or cyclones or anti-cyclones on Earth or eddies in the ocean or gyros, and that's basically what is a sunspot from the Manteshyan's theory. And, of course, Ben Davidson has his theory of earth-spots, and this is pretty much it in my opinion, OK. So in sunspots the charged particles on the surface of the Sun move in the magnetic field of the Sun and build up this angular momentum and create this vortex, the circular current essentially, and this current, because the particles are charged, creates a magnetic field of its own, and we get the essentially the sunspot, OK. So that's one of the ways of explaining it. Now lensing, I'm pretty sure that all of you have heard about the gravitational lensing, right, but you might ask what's so gravitational about it, OK. So maybe there is another explanations. I think at the previous EU conference there was Edward Dowdye talking about this about the refraction of light in plasma actually not due to gravitation, and I think that this is a good idea that plasma really can refract the light, in principle, in theory. I'm not saying that it really is doing that but we might suppose that it is doing that and so that this interstellar plasma and plasma around galaxies might actually refract the light and act as a lens. But more than that, I want to add here that we have an electro-optical effects like Pockles effect and Kerr effect, they actually amplify the refractive index of matter due to electricity. So if we have an electric field applied to this plasma, the refractive index might might be bigger than in a sort of an ambient plasma, and we might get stronger lensing. This is also an interesting possibility in my opinion. OK, solar system formation. I'm gonna talk about this later and differential rotation too. Galactic rotation curves, that's where the dark matter comes in, OK. Now, on the left you can see this picture where we have the velocities of stars or molecular clouds or whatever else plotted versus the distance from the center of galaxy, OK. And so we can notice that somewhere around the middle of a spiral arm or maybe somewhere closer to the core, we get this discrepancy between the measured velocity and the velocity that we can calculate through Newtonian gravity and Keplerian motion, OK. And if we look at the bottom to the right, we can see that the measured velocities are getting much, much higher than what we can calculate and on the bottom of the right you can see the simplified form of the Second Newton's Law. And what it states basically is that the square of the velocity is proportional to force, OK. And what does that mean if we have an excess velocity, then we should have some excess force that we cannot account for, OK. And so people are thinking: "Okay, if we have only gravitational force in space that means that we have some extra gravitation we cannot account for. And since we all love our gravitational constant and want to keep it constant, probably right, then it it means that we have extra matter, extra mass that we we we don't see. And that's how the dark matter was invented. But maybe there is another explanation to it. Let's remember what I've said about the magnetic fields, everything possesses some sort of magnetic field. So, let's take a look at magnetic fields of galaxies. Now on the left you can see a view of a really over- simplified view of a spiral galaxy as viewed from, for example, the northern side and the southern side and thus the plane of picture coincides with the plane of galaxy, OK. And these arrows, they depict the direction of the magnetic fields. And we have this picture that, for example, on the northern side of the spiral arm the fields are directed to the core, from the ends of the spiral arms, OK. And on the south, we get the opposite direction. And so, in general, it creates the picture of sort of wrapping around, sort of Birkeland current but with the other geometry, OK. And on the right we can see another component of the magnetic field of galaxy; it is a dipolar type field. L is the distance from the plane of galaxies. So kind of imagine that the vertical line is a plane of galaxy and if we were moving northwards where L increases, the field starts rising and then it starts falling off like a field of a bar magnet. And to the southern side we get the same picture but the sign is inverted, OK. So these are kind of basic components of the magnetic fields of galaxies. And of course, the real magnetic field of galaxy looks much more complex, and I'm gonna show it to you how it should look like, OK. This is the data from ESA Planck mission, of course, what we see here is the direction of polarization of electromagnetic radiation which supposedly coincides with the magnetic field lines and the color depicts the intensity of light which is proportional to the density of matter, OK. So we really can see that we have these magnetic field lines going along the spiral arms in the plane of galaxy, and we also have this dome-shaped bar magnet-type field around it to the both sides of of the plane of galaxies, OK. So how can we create such magnetic field? I told you that the electric current is the most simple way of creating magnetic field, OK. So here's this hypothesis again reinstated: the stars have an electric charge, OK. And let's let's take a look and maybe we can create these magnetic fields with this hypothesis, OK. So, here on the left we again see one of the spiral arms with a piece of a core of galaxy from both sides and on the right we can see a slice of this spiral arm along this red curved line so it's kind of we're observing the array of stars moving along their orbits kind of in parallel but they move on us or from us that really doesn't matter OK. So let's suppose that these stars have positive electric charge. This is to this pretty much arbitrary thing but we should at least make some supposition about it. OK, let's suppose it's positive and the stars move outwards from us into the plane of picture. That would mean that they create the circular magnetic field that is actually clockwise directed, right. Each star creates a magnetic field of its own. But if we sum the magnetic fields from each star, we would get this wavy pattern, OK, going for example at the northern side it goes to the right and at the southern side to the left, OK. So we get really this picture of magnetic field lines going in one direction at the northern side and returning at the southern side. So we get this sort of wrapping around thing, OK. I think this is pretty pretty simple and pretty elegant but let's think about this. Let's think how would these fields act on the stars themselves because the stars as electric currents should, should be I mean the magnetic field should act on these stars because the stars are electric currents, OK, if they move. And so we can apply the left hand rule, for example, of four fingers shows the direction of the motion of the positive charge, which is in the plane of picture and magnetic field lines enter the palm of our hand then the thumb would show us the direction of the Lorentz force that is acting on the northern stars. It would be directed southwards and for the stars on the southern side, it would be directed northwards. So what we get is that spiral arm gets squeezed. Again, the same type of behavior as with Birkeland current filaments, OK. But the geometry is different. And in my opinion, this is one of the explanations of why the galaxies are so flat. Why do they have this pancake shaped form, OK. But let's think about another thing. How would these occurrence, i mean the stars, interact with each other? The parallel currents, as we know, they attract; this is called the Ampere's law. And this is actually how the definition of Ampere as a unit of electric current is defined through this attraction, OK. So this would be of course the different component of the magnetic field, a vertical one but still they would attract and how would this attraction look like in the middle of the spiral arm, in radial terms? In the middle of a spiral arm, we would get pretty much the same quantity of stars closer to the core and closer to the rim so we'd be attracted in both sides with pretty much the same force and it would compensate, OK. But when we are moving closer to the rim outwards from the core, the quantity of stars closer to the core would increase and the quantity of stars closer to the rim would decrease, and we would have this excess attraction to the core. And here on the left, for example, you can see again this is a really simplified version of this graph, this is an Ampere's force, R is the difference from the distance from the core, excuse me, and at some distance you can see that the force is 0 but if we we are getting closer to the rim we're getting attracted to the core and this kind of may give us really this unaccounted for force which people explain with dark matter, OK. And on the right we can see the sum of this force with the gravitational force one over R squared. It gets a little rise on the at the end of the spiral arm, OK. And that can, in principle, this might explain the excess force that we need, OK. So that's that's that would mean that we don't need dark matter actually, OK. So, this is one theory and another theory, of course there are questions because for example closer to the core we would have the force that drags us to the rim but I'll leave this questions this this is sort of a second order problem.  I'm getting the the principal theory and I think it really might account for what we observe. Now about the solar system formation, there are of course a lot of models a lot of theories but they all face the same difficulty, which is explaining the angular momentum of the system. Why is it rotating? And the angular momentum is a sort of a measure of this rotation. If we look at the expression, it says that we should take a sum of all the particles that we have and we should take a product of their masses, their distances from the axis of rotation and their velocities. So the more massive particles we have, the farther out they are from the axis of rotation and the faster they go around, the more angular momentum we would have, OK. And the solar system actually possesses quite a big angular momentum. Of course, everything is relative here but the important point here is that the angular momentum should conserve in the closed system. So if we had, for example, a nebula that did not rotate and it for example would condense by gravitation it wouldn't start rotate on its own, it would need some external driver to make it to spin it up, OK. In the solar system the angular momentum is mostly due to Jupiter. And if we take all of the giant planets, they have like 99% of the angular momentum. So as I've said, we need to have some external driver and pretty much in gravitational paradigm the only driver is probably the passing star. So maybe if some object have passed nearby the solar system it may have spun it up like wind blowing to the windmill makes it wheel spin ok. But is there another explanation? Mantashyan proposes actually another explanation and again centers on the Lorentz force. So if we had an external magnetic field, like for example a galactic magnetic field, and if we had charged particles if the planets and the Sun were charged they actually might get this angular momentum due to interaction with the external magnetic field of galaxy and here's another hypothesis explicitly stated that during its formation the Solar System was exposed to a powerful galactic magnetic field, which was perpendicular to the ecliptic plane. Now I must note here that we don't actually need to have a an ecliptic plane here, what we need is only the charged Sun that is moving in this magnetic field and sort of I'll try to show later how the charged Sun moving in a magnetic field can get its rotation. That's when you get the equatorial plane and the ecliptic plane would pretty much coincide with the equatorial plane. But in this model the planets are being born by the Sun itself, they're being ejected out of the Sun. So let's suppose that young active and electrically charged Sun ejected some plasma in space filled with galactic magnetic field. Those would probably be like a today's coronal mass ejections but much more massive and basically much more intense and those were the proto-planets ejected out of the Sun. So I asked a question, what conditions should be met for the plasma to turn into a real planet? And the answer is that we should eject from the equatorial plane. Because, well, think about the launch of the artificial satellites from Earth, we need to launch them from the equator if we need to get the same orbital direction like the spin of the earth, OK. Because that's that's how earth helps us with its own rotation, it gives us additional velocity, additional energy and additional angular momentum too and thus the external magnetic field that I've mentioned would provide the most angular momentum. And that's what I'm gonna illustrate right now. Now on the left we can see a view from the side of the Sun ejecting some piece of plasma somewhere a bit northwards, OK. B is the magnetic field lines of galaxy, I mean the lines of the magnetic field of galaxy, v is the velocity of this piece of plasma and the Lorentz force would be directed into the plane of picture if we suppose the positive charge. So the Lorentz force would be equal to QvB sin alpha. Now Q is the charge of this ball of plasma, v is velocity as I've said, and B is the magnetic field strength. Now, alpha is the angle between the velocity vector and the vector of the magnetic field. So, if we look at it, when will the Lorentz force be maximal? It will be maximal when we have the sin alpha equals to unit. That would be when the alpha, when the angle would be perpendicular, when the velocity would be perpendicular to the magnetic field and that would be at the ecliptic plane in the equatorial plane of the Sun, OK. Why would we need this Lorentz force? Again, think about how the satellites are launched. They do not fly straight up, OK. They fly straight up to a certain height and then they start tilting the rocket and kind of fly fly up and then they're flying sideways so they get this circular orbit, OK. Because if you fly straight up, what would happen is that upon the return to the Earth at the perigee, you might be too close to Earth. You might actually fall down to the Earth, OK.  So that's what we need, this kind of sideways force that draws us to the side. And here the Lorentz force plays the role of such force, and the Lorentz force provides us the circular orbits, OK. So when we are launched on the right, you can see the view from the North Pole of the Sun. Here is this piece of plasma being launched and then it goes sideways due to the Lorentz force, OK. And kind of upon the next approach to the Sun, it wouldn't be too close to the Sun and would, might survive actually. And and the Lorentz force would help to build up angular momentum of the system and make its orbit to expand its orbit make it more circular overtime, OK. So I promise to explain how the spin actually, is being acquired so the same story would be the same story would actually be for the Sun and the planets so I'm gonna talk only about the Sun today right now. And on the right you can see a schematic of the Sun. We have the rigid solid body core presumably, OK. By by this point, I'm pretty sure that you've noticed that I'm a little obsessed with red color. So we have this rigid core, then we have this liquid layer on top of it if we are to believe Pierre-Marie Robitaille, then we have a charged surface layer where the charge of the Sun is situated, OK. So when the thing moves in the magnetic field of galaxy, what happens is that the charged particles again they start rotating due to Lorentz force and this rotation builds up angular momentum and due to liquid dynamics the whole charged surface layer starts rotating, OK. And what that would mean that would mean that due to friction, the liquid layer would start rotating, OK. And then the core would start rotating and we will get the the magnetic field eventually, OK. So that's how in this theory the rotation was acquired by the Sun and by the planet's later. OK. And I've promised to explain how the differential rotation might appear. Now if you take a look at this horizontal lines in the liquid layer I've drawn there, them there for a reason. You might notice that in the equatorial region actually the thickness of this liquid layer is the smallest and as we get closer to the poles it increases and so it would be kind of easier for this liquid layer to rotate in the equatorial region and it might get a bigger velocity there. And thus we can in principle explain the differential rotation of the Sun and giant planets, OK. So, what factors would be at play in this rotation? The rotation would be the more intense, the more electric charge we've had, OK. So we need to be big and carry enough electric charge; that's first of all. And and then the charge might be diminished by the solar wind or see another CME's or anything like that, OK. So we need to be as far from the Sun as possible to avoid diminishing of, the blowing off of charge due to the solar wind from this charged surface layer, OK. So the farther out we are from the Sun and the bigger we are, the more rotation we would get, OK. So that would mean that the giant planets should spin the fastest in the solar system. And guess what, we get actually that's what we observe. Now Jupiter, take a look at this, this is the biggest planet and has the lowest spin period and the smallest which is somewhat ridiculous, isn't it? So the Jupiter was really big, it had a lot of electric charge and it's relatively far out, OK. Saturn was a bit smaller but it was also farther out, so that this relative solar wind density was smaller at the orbit of Saturn and is to this day. And the same story with Uranus and Neptune pretty much. And with the other planets. Now of course there are concerns about Venus and stuff but I'm not gonna talk about this right now. So now, what about these young planets? They are still hot in plasma but they are already rotating and have their magnetic fields. Why wouldn't they eject some piece of plasma of their own? That might be possible and actually Mantashyan thinks that it's what what was really happening, OK. And so that's how the satellites might have been formed. They might have been rejected out of the planets and gain their angular momentum and their circular orbits in the magnetic field of the mother planet, so to speak, OK. So what characteristics should they possess for us to say that really they were born in such a way? Well first of all, they should have low eccentricity excuse me low-inclinations so they should be pretty much in the equatorial plane of the mother planet because I've shown you before why would that be. And also they should have low eccentricities because Lorentz force gives us circular orbits and also they should have the same direction of rotation because they were launched from the planet itself. Now I mean the same as the spin of the planet. Now I'm pretty sure that you know that there are a lot of satellites that do not possess these characteristics, OK. So how could they form? Well, standard theory says that they are probably the captured bodies. Well, it might be that but in Mantashyan's theory another explanation is possible, is that these satellites actually are kind of a brothers of the the planet. So they might have been born out of the same ejection that gave birth to the the planet itself. Maybe there was not a uniform piece of plasma going around but maybe there was some additional splashes or something like that or maybe there were several pieces of plasma, some of them merged and some of them, was small but they've somehow managed to survive and they could have formed all of these so-called irregular satellites, OK. This is a possibility. Now, let's take a look at some examples. Jupiter, pretty much all of the inner satellites including the Galilean, the most massive ones, have a low inclination and low eccentricities. So in this theory, they were actually born by Jupiter itself, OK. And the outer moons like starting from 9th, they have a pretty high inclinations and eccentricities, and starting from 16th, they have retrograde orbits so they orbit in the opposite direction, OK. So we get this picture, so they are probably either the brothers of Jupiter or they are captured bodies, OK. Now if we're talking Velikovsky by the way I just wanna note that maybe if Venus was actually born out of Jupiter maybe it was from the big red spot where it was born, OK. But this is just a thought. Now Saturn, the same story as with Jupiter but the Titan, of course, dominates the whole system, and it has also a low inclination, low eccentricity so it probably was born from Saturn, OK. And the first 24 moons, they too have low inclination and low eccentricity, and the outer moons mostly have retrograde orbits, high very inclined and eccentric orbits so they're probably either the brothers of Saturn or they were captured bodies. Now the same story with Uranus but the important exception is that the equatorial plane of Uranus is very inclined. It's almost perpendicular to the ecliptic so Mantashyan thinks that what happened is that when Uranus had its spin and magnetic field its orbit, I mean its spin access was inclined due to some reason. I don't know what the reason might be, maybe a collision maybe something else, and that's when it started to give birth to its satellites that we observe today. Because the inclinations are relative the modern equatorial plane, which is highly inclined, OK. So OK now what about Neptune, we get this moon Triton which is really big and it moves in a highly inclined and retrograde orbit. So under this theory probably was born out of the same ejection so it's kind of a brother of Neptune. The other moons possess kind of the same qualities that are for the other giant planets. Now important thing, Mars and Earth, OK. Phobos and Deimos have little inclination and little eccentricity so they were probably born out of Mars under this theory at least. Of course there are other hypotheses. Now the Moon, what's interesting, it has a relatively high inclination, high eccentricity so it couldn't have been born out of the Earth probably. And it also has a lot of mass, it's more than one percent of mass of the Earth and it is a unique case in in our system.  And as Mr. Thornhill noted yesterday, I think, that actually the Sun pulls the Moon more than two times stronger than the Earth pulls the Moon. So actually the Moon is going around the Sun, it's not orbiting the Earth.  The Moon is sort of a sister planet for the Earth and the orbit of the Moon you can see on the right that's what the orbit of the Moon might look like as you might think but I've crossed it out because this is wrong. The orbit of the Moon around the Sun is elliptical, it never does these curls around the Earth, OK. Its elliptical. Of course it has little waves because of the perturbations of the Earth but in general it moves around the Sun not around Earth. So the Moon is a quasi-satellite of Earth. And this is one of the pieces of evidence for  for this theory, I think. You can Google what a quasi-satellite means and compare this to  this elliptical orbit around the Sun, OK. So I'm close to the end. The points in favor of the proposed model is a relatively high angular momentum that we can explain with this external field, the existence of the ecliptic plane, the circularity of orbits due to the Lorentz force, the spin characteristics of planets which are, this is a really interesting point and so the red colored ones they actually cannot be explained through only an accretion, OK. We have some, we should have something something else to it. Of course, there are questions now, where do these magnetic field go, how strong it was, where did the charges go, whether they just whithered away because of the Sun or something else. There are a lot of questions, I admit. And I think for example, if we suppose that the magnetic field suddenly changed or even depolarized to the opposite, there might have been this epic of instability and catastrophes because the Lorentz force would change and the orbits would suddenly change and there might have been all of these catastrophes with charge exchange and electric discharges and everything else. So this is kind of a point where we can dock this into a more traditional so-to-speak Electric Universe theories, OK. Now, if we look at the Sun in a galaxy what we can see, this is what Mantashyan calls the Mathrushka model or a Russian doll model you might call it, OK. The idea is that the the satellites were once embedded in planets and the planets were embedded in the Sun and the Sun work was probably embedded in the galactic core or something so it might have been ejected from the galactic core one day and the galactic core might have been ejected from somewhere else like a super cluster core and it all happened in the magnetic fields of larger and larger scale, OK. So we get this really fractal structure of things, kind of evolving and differentiating on smaller and smaller scale to get this Herbert Spencer type evolution. And here the Lorentz force plays the role of universal transformer of this linear motion into circular rotation. And in my opinion, this is one of the explanations for the ubiquitous character of the circular rotation in our universe. Because in the gravitational field alone you would have an arbitrary eccentricity, you wouldn't have exactly the circular orbits. We don't have exactly the circular orbits but they are too frequent in my opinion to form by accident, OK. So that, this is what I've promised to you in order to understand the Universe we need to observe the work of both hands of the creator, the gravity and electromagnetism. So if we focus on only one of those, we lose perspective and kind of perceive the world with only one eye out of two that the nature gave us. So I hope that it really explains the title of my talk because we should have this linear gravitational attraction and this Lorentzian thing that gives us really all those structures that we observe. OK, you were a beautiful audience thank you for your patience, thank you for your attention. 
You've just entered the theater of an alien sky. If the words and images seem strange to you, there's a reason for this. Our world was once a vastly different place. To experience this won't hurt you,  and there is nothing to fear. The Labyrinth The Crane Dance of Theseus In following the ancient story of the labyrinth, the most obvious question is why? From what human experience did this remarkable ancient idea arise? In our investigation of the theme, the first clue emerges from the archetypal personalities we've come to recognize. Mother goddess, warrior hero, and chaos monster, all with a displaced sovereign power lurking in the background. For several decades, we sought to illuminate such archetypes. In that work, we've described the emergence and progressive evolution of an extraordinary spectacle in the Heavens. A gathering of planets close to Earth. Planets, inspiring the myth-making epoch of human history. A radical claim is that the archetypes, the global patterns, are explained uniquely and concretely by the planetary history we've reconstructed. Specifically, a gathering of planets extremely close to Earth. Yes, that idea will appear preposterous, but preposterous only until one sees that hundreds of archetypes, hundreds of global cross cultural themes become predictable. And not just as general themes but down to hundreds of highly specific details. As newcomers to this topic will quickly discover, it's the apparent absurdity of mythology that ultimately changes the picture, to the extent that things begin to make sense. Nothing in our familiar experience would anticipate, much less account for, the archetypal theme of externalized intestines. A theme we noted briefly in our prior discourse. That theme arose in relation to the remarkable face of the Mesopotamian giant Humbaba displaying nothing else than knotted intestines. But actually, it's this transparently absurd feature that opens the door to a much broader field of evidence. From the Americas to Africa and the South Pacific, we find recollections of the dancing warrior trickster hero either unraveling his own intestines or the intestines of an alter ego figure. That such bizarre imagery would occur from one land to another, surely requires an explanation. And a believable, fact-based explanation must be possible. One of numerous examples will be found amongst the North American Ojibwe whose trickster Nanabozho loses his intestines in his wanderings and hangs them in a tree. Well, that's not an idea one would expect in the normal course of human experience, either primitive or modern. In some tales, intestines are pulled from the trickster causing his death. In closely linked stories, they become food for other creatures, or the trickster himself eat fragments of his own intestines, thinking they are food. Well such absurdities are, as we've repeatedly discovered, the window to the hidden substructure of collective memories crying out for investigation. For those who will follow the logical ground rules of this investigation, the outcome will be a full and convincing explanation of world mythology, down to virtually all of the recurrent patterns. If our fundamental observation is correct, it could not be otherwise. It seems that the labyrinthine dance of the hero Theseus, as cited in our previous Discourse, gives us some powerful clues. The dance had its own unique and awkward form called the crane dance, made famous by the Warrior's successful entry into the Cretan labyrinth. At the level of common perception, the whole thing is indeed ridiculous. But that's why it's so essential to view the story through the lens of our starting point, the reconstructed polar configuration. Suddenly the crane dance of Theseus becomes predictable. A uniquely appropriate visual image of the off-axis movements of the legendary warrior, the masculine power Mars in his labyrinthian dance. This awkward bobbing movement would not even be possible without the off-axis displacement suggested here. Of course, given our overarching interest in the global sub-structure, we could not possibly limit our attention to test one localized idea. Numerous Hindu myths describing the dance of Shiva are complemented by wide-ranging images of a hero or trickster whose arms and legs mimic the whorl- or swastika- form of the discharge streamers we've noted in our previous Discourse. It was said that the warrior Shiva held his consort Sati above his head. Again, as we should expect. And in their violent whirling movements the body or essence of Sati was dispersed in flame. Another seeming absurdity, but a perfect reflection of the discharge activity, we've located at the visual center of the labyrinth. Here's the description of Shiva's dance by Stella Kramrisch in her book The Presence of Shiva, "He danced exceedingly, his arms flailing the regions, The stars were scattered by the swish of his hair. Death, love and despair syncopated the escalating speed of his Tandava dance; the earth shook while Siva went on dancing in frenzy, his eyes whirling... As Shiva danced on and on, the body of Sati became lighter and lighter, and he saw that limbs and parts had fallen from it." In the end, all that was left was the mythic yoni, the core feminine identity of the goddess, which means of course the archetypal goddess, the planet Venus. A comparative analysis will show that the god's forearms, here described as flailing the regions, are beyond any reasonable doubt the arms of the equal end cross. The cross that in prior, more stable phases, marked out the four regions of four quarters of the celestial habitation. In other words, the seemingly outrageous depictions are indeed internally consistent. As noted in our previous Discourse, when the fourfold discharge was set in a whirling motion, the effect was a swastika-like pattern. And so in ancient Sumerian symbolism we see the arms of the swastika in their undeniable connection to the long flowing hair of female figures, reminding us of the words of the Sumerian Inanna, the planet Venus, to her consort Damuzi, "I will whirl my hair in heaven for you." When the mythic imagery is seen in its original context, no image of the swastika makes more sense than that of the goddess's luminous whirling hair at the center of the labyrinth. An obvious complement is the occasional image of the Medusa head with its wildly disheveled hair at the center of the labyrinth giving rise to the symmetrical three legs of the Triskelion. As we previously observed, it was from that chaotic discharge activity that the more stable symmetrical discharge phases emerged. Consider also the underlined similarity of Theseus's archetypal dance to the famous dance of the hindu Shiva also occurring in conjunction with a goddess, who becomes the warrior's consort as we should expect. And not just a goddess, but the goddess Venus in particular, as we should also expect. In the Iliad, Homer tells us that the legendary King Daedalus, quoting here, "once wrought in Knosos broad a dancing-ground for fair-haired Ariadne." Of course the fair-haired Ariadne is a recognized alter ego of the fair-haired Aphrodite, or Venus. But perhaps the best clue is provided by the golden thread of Ariadne, said to have been unraveled by Theseus as he danced through the winding passages. By this identification, the unraveling thread becomes a perfect analog to the unwinding intestines appearing in other variations of the same archetypal theme. As we repeatedly noted, the symbolic spiraling life breath, in its mythic interpretation as a coiled cord or lock of hair, meant nothing else than the cometary essence of the Venus goddess herself. In this realization, it becomes clear that the hero's unraveling of the thread in his meandering dance is in fact a corollary to the Hindu Shiva's whirling dispersal of the essence of his consort Sati, the goddess Venus. To oversimplify a complex story, we can see that the hero unwinding the golden thread means the same thing as the hero unwinding his own intestines, which means the same thing as the hero making his way through the passages of the labyrinth, which means the same thing as the awkward dance or the crane dance of the hero and the goddess. So the seeming competition between incompatible storytelling is instantly resolved by allowing the underlying events to shine through. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts. info Hi, this is Andy Hall with Space News. I'm presenting part nine of my series Eye of the Storm, where we look at electrical scarring on the Colorado Plateau. In the past few chapters of Eye of the Storm, we looked at surface conductive discharge in the landforms it creates. Ground-to-ground surface conductive discharges formed river channels, fractured  the land with arc blasts, built mountains, ripped them apart, and induced electric winds that competed in a global plasma storm on our ancient planet. We've  discussed how surface conductive discharges match the description of  dragons in myth; how they must be discharges from an alternating current, superimposed with the direct current bias that forces its path across Earth's surface electric field, blasting its way in fits and starts, as resonant frequencies built and relaxed, bifurcating the current reactive power  surges. The electric field is from a buildup of charge on continental surfaces, due to capacitance in the continental plates. We've discussed how such discharges emanate from beneath Earth's crust through a continental fringing field. Capacitance dictates there must also be charge built on the opposite side of a plate, which creates that potential difference. This doesn't mean one side of the continental plate is all positive and one side negative. Ionization of native materials generates plasma, which by definition is a mixture of positive and negative charge; but plasma self-organizes, producing regions of high intensity positive or negative bias, surrounded by shells of weaker plasmas. Coherent structures evolve, as waves of energy pass through at varying frequency, forming patterns of compression and rarefaction in the fashion that sonic vibrations produce cymatics. Potentials oscillate between regions of high intensity, sometimes spiking to extreme levels from harmonic feedback and constructive interference in the manner of circuits, commonly  referred to as RLC circuits in electronics. It's the spiky surges that send sparks  flying. We will now discuss the underbelly of North America from where these sparks originated and what we can infer about its features. In keeping with the ionic storm  protocol, we'll use Earth's geology, the planet Jupiter and the fractal self- similarities of charge diffusion as our living laboratory for evidence. As  discussed in the previous chapters, river channels align with faults that are cracks in the earth caused by the intense heat, pressure, and charge depletion of an arc blast from surface-conductive discharges. They are literally the dragon's footprint; but not all dragon prints result in river channels. In some places, surface- conductive discharges created faults that were later buried, or somehow isolated from the watershed, so no river resulted. The San Andreas Fault is one such beast. It was created in the same discharge event that created the Colorado River. A resonant-frequency reactive discharge sent a filament of induced current northwest, while the mainline current of the Colorado filament turned 90 degrees east to the Colorado plateau. This filament is the San Andreas Fault system, extending from the Gulf of California along the western fringe of the continent, to the Juan de Fuca plate. The fault follows precisely a portion of continental plate boundaries, surrounding the Pacific known as the Ring of Fire. What this means is that the San Andreas Fault is the result of a surface-conductive branch filament of the Colorado discharge, induced along the plate boundary. This branch formed a parallel circuit with the Colorado River branch, thus forming a parallel RLC circuit. The parallel RLC circuit has a characteristic ability to amplify frequency, to the point of producing resonant frequency reactive power discharges, which is what we see along the Colorado River. Not all dragons are necessarily parallel circuits. So the Colorado San Andreas system has some exceptional features and may be unique, at least on Earth. The fact that the San Andreas is a filament of current discharging along this path, can be demonstrated by looking at a real-life dragon in action. Of course, this means looking to Jupiter, where a similar circuit is in action right now. Capacitance forces a mere response to subsurface charge accumulation on the continental surface and in the atmosphere. So, the landscape and atmosphere reflect the ground currents. This image of a long oval storm system on Jupiter has been presented before, in chapter 7 as an analog for the storm that created the san Joaquin Valley in California, and its ring of mountains, including the Sierra Nevada range. The red  line traces the San Andreas Fault analog that exists beneath Jupiter's clouds in the same geometry. It rides next to long, thin, dark filaments making French curves in the clouds. These dark filaments are where low-level winds dive beneath higher shelf clouds, to feed the jet stream that follows the discharge, creating the fault. Where it meets the branching Garlock Fault, it created a triangle of Venturi winds. Similar faults, or currents, are embedded in the Sierra Range where you can see dark filaments in the cloud. In other words, you're seeing a dragon from above, the jet stream being a charged plasma wind generated by induction along the path of the ground current, which takes an identical path through the storm system that the San Andreas does, due to the fractal symmetry of charge diffusion in similar circuits. Two  similar circuits will create similar patterns of charge  diffusion; never exact, but similar, like fingerprints and snowflakes. Both circuits create paths of current with capacitance and inductance that form self-similar diffusion patterns in the form of weather and discharge. The difference in size between Earth and Jupiter doesn't matter. The processes are all scalable, and  the difference in chemistry matters little, because the patterns are formed by charge diffusion, which is regulated by the circuit. The circuit dictates the plasma behavior and arranges the chemistry to suit. One could say the circuit creates itself, like Escher's hand that draws a hand that draws itself. That's a big insight, by the  way. I hope you noticed. As far as Jupiter is concerned, what  this means is there are crustal ground currents on Jupiter that form circuits geometrically similar to certain ground currents on Earth. We don't have any direct evidence for what constitutes ground on Jupiter, but the evidence that ground currents are there, is in the shape and actions of the  clouds. Capacitance between ground and atmosphere dictates the presence of ground currents, producing self-similar storms in feedback with currents in the atmosphere. Why Earth and Jupiter should have geometrically similar electrical circuits within their  crusts, may seem a ridiculous coincidence, if you accept the consensus view on planetary formation. So don't. Planets are formed as drops and bubbles, spit out at bigger planets or stars. Drops and bubbles are fractal entities shaped by electrical bonding, surface tension that is. Or as I like to say, spherical capacitance. It should be no surprise that complex fractal bubbles will also have complex fractal surface features. Fractals, being fractal, self-similar that is, and planets everywhere being drops and bubbles, they should all display similar features. But you will not see the similarities, if you categorize and analyze them as solid or gaseous structures, or as thermodynamic or chemical entities, or as gravitational bodies caused by wiggly space-time. They only make sense if you analyze them as circuits. Then it not only makes sense, it yields real useful knowledge, to see Earth and Jupiter with nearly exact fractal symmetries. The presence of the San Andreas Fault also betrays that the plate boundary hides a telluric, or subsurface current, formed by  charge accumulation beneath the plate in the fringing field along the plate's edge. We'll now look at the evidence for this subsurface current. We can't see what's beneath the crust, but we can make some assumptions, based on surface features. We know subsurface currents must generate heat, given  resistance in the ground. So, we cannot expect to find volcanoes and seismic activities concentrated on these currents. And so we do. Charge collapses within and beneath the continental plates, because they present a sheet of dielectric matter to energy flowing in and out of the earth. As charge connects beneath the plates, it migrates and concentrates at the plate boundaries. The fringing field at the plate boundary is the reason. The transition from thick continental plate to thinner oceanic plate, or any cracks in the plate, creates a fringing field that provides better connection for the pent-up charge beneath the plates to escape. But the potential still has to be large enough to make a spark to close the gap across the fringing field. And in the meantime the fringing field accumulates charge. Filaments of current are induced along the length of the fringing fields at the plate boundaries by earth's magnetic and electric fields, forming circuits. You should notice that the plate boundaries connect in continuous, looping  circuits around the earth. To illustrate, one of the better examples is the Caribbean plate, or more precisely, what I call the Caribbean current loop. [Music] 
Notes Toward an Electric Catastrophist Model for Geology Good afternoon! My talk is going to be based on the Venus section of Worlds in Collision. It's not really the words of Dr. Velikovsky but the survivors', that he quotes. And the description of the events that took place. The dates are not important. I'm comfortable with his dates. It doesn't really matter. It could be Nibiru, could be Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, but I'm comfortable with Venus as he thought. Let me get a different image there. The picture that's painted is dust, sand, gravel, rocks, very large boulders falling from the sky, mingled with a river of fire. Dr. Velikovsky thought that was oil. In many cases it might be but it might also be plasma, similar to the Aurora. The dusts and rocks and gravel and boulders were mingled with a river of fire. According to the Mesoamericans, the rocks were glowing red hot. If you can heat a rock to incandescent, incandescence, it would be much easier to heat dust. So you have molten material. The electromagnetism might pull in iron preferentially. It's raining oil for days and nights. The oil's running through rivers, people climb trees to escape it and drowned. According to the Mexicans, I think, it killed more people than the rocks and everything else combined. There's a hurricane going on. Beyond our description, worse than Andrew, which almost killed me, might have actually. The Sun rises where it used to set. That's a tough one. And it could be a tippy-top, but from what I see in the field it really looks like it stopped rotating and went the other way. You can go to the headwaters of the Colorado River. Rocky Mountain National Park, Fraser, Colorado, spend quite a bit of time there. You can see the valleys are full of sediment to a large height. Flat on both sides, equal heights as if water was pushed up from the equator. There's a 13 and a quarter mile bulge of water at the equator because of centrifugal force. If the earth ceases to rotate, according to Dr. Velikovsky, the water would rush north and south. The dust, it's falling, would be part of the flood. That is what I believe is the sediments up at the top of the Colorado drainage. So it's really a mess and it's electrical. Ah, an interesting image from Wiki images, Wiki Maps... The yellow is sediment, I believe that's part of the flood. It was basically under water, being moved around. The part that's not yellow, this area here is circle right there, are mountains in a circular pattern. Within that circular pattern, which I think is a vortex, there are more vortices. Right here and right there, we'll get into those a little later. But what's kind of interesting, we were looking at Valles Marineris earlier, Wal seeing the shape of the galaxy. I see mountains coming up through Canada, curving to the left, they actually go through Alaska into Far East Russia and in an arc of volcanic islands come down. Coming out of the south of this, you have mountains curving to the right! Oh, the Canadian Rockies are a little blip there, you got Baja here, kind of similar to the Canadian Rockies on the right-hand side of this. These mountains come down substantially cut through Mexico, Central America, actually go through Columbia, Venezuela, with an arc of volcanic islands coming back into Mexico! It seems to look a little like a galaxy or a huge low-pressure area, like a giant hurricane. That shows the mountains going through, coming around and back. Again, down, around and back. Could be a coincidence that in an Electric Universe, I picture Venus sitting over here, as it bops up and down. As Dr. Velikovsky thought it would come in close, there'd be a discharge, it would release it and it came back down, during the plagues of Egypt, during Exodus, that's how he describes things. These are volcanic formations. They swing around here, they go up, come around down... A lot of these volcanic formations have something in common; Missing volcanoes. The volcanoes have gone away, they've disappeared completely. The geologists are fuddled, they go out to look for them, they can't find them, they know they have to be there because there's the salt! What else could possibly heat dirt other than a volcano? Except in an Electric Universe, with a river of fire we now have another option for molten rock, heavy with iron. Electromagnetically, possibly, pulling in iron from a dusty atmosphere. As a friend of mine points out, it's dusty plasma. So it's going to be affected by an electromagnetic event hovering over here. 10³⁹ or a lot more than gravity. It could be pulling in dust as we interact with comet Venus from thousands of miles. Shaping it with a hurricane-force wind and accumulating it in mountains. These are plutonic, this is granite and its cousins. It's interesting and that on the left side of this, there's a lot of granite. On the right side of this, there's a lot of granite, it seems like a mirror image. Oh also, this is kind of interesting. This is the Sierras, is a 400 mile long pluton of solid granite. The largest pluton on the planet. Under the pluton of granite is sediment. The granite supposedly bubbled up from below. So how does sediment get in between that? There should be a tongue of granite going down to wherever the granite came from. So geologists have the Pacific plate shoving sediment underneath of the granite because they have to explain it. But if the granite came from the air, it would be sitting on top of the sediment that was there to start with. Now we come over to metamorphics. The Sierras have metamorphic rock but not enough to show up on here dramatically. But the coastal range does. And you can see they're sort of a circle there. And then we have the Canadian Shield with Hudson's Bay in the middle. This is all flat and it's all metamorphic. This might have something to do with that. It could be a positive, negative, negative positive, I'm not sure. I'd like to have EU folks sit around and drink and talk about this in the evening while I can listen. But it seems as if something happened over here. And I'll show later on that it seems to have been rapid and it seems to have been one event for all the mountains. And I don't want it to be that way, I'd like it to be simple and embraceable. But it's not, it looks like it was really a horrible thing, with very few survivors. And in 'Worlds in Collision', the survivors thought they were the only ones. They came out of their caves. They were the only ones that made it. They don't know anybody else in the neighborhood for a 100 miles, there's no communication. That's a recurring theme. It happens in Mexico, it happens a lot. This is on a highway 93, north of Las Vegas. This is welded tuff. It's a wonderful formation. Welded tuff is red-hot dust that comes out of a volcano and blows downwind. It's so hot that it sticks to the windward side of obstructions. Sticks to the windward side of obstructions and grows back and up into the wind. This is an accepted geologic process. The problem is, many times this is 40, 60 miles from a missing volcano. And if you look at a volcano at night when the dust comes out, its incandescent. It blows downwind a very small distance and it's no longer incandescent. So 40 miles downwind, it's not going to make rock, it's going to make dirt. You need something to keep it hot, like a river of fire. It's a close-up photograph of it. It's 30, 40 feet thick on the top. Solid rock, not like partial rock, this is gnarly rock. This is the edge of the formation. We have windward over here and leeward over here. The wind is blowing from here this way. It gets to this Ridge and it goes beyond, it's... At first I thought these were dunes, everywhere. But dunes only happen with dry sand. This isn't dry. This is either wet dirt, clay, mud, sticking or it's incandescent, sticking, sticking to windward and it can't accumulate on leeward because it blows past it. So you get layer after layer building up, and you can see how these layers accumulate it. This is not wild speculation, this is a geologic process that's accepted universally. The welded tuff process. When my friends and I discovered this, it was really convenient, it made everything so much more simple than it had been in the past. You don't need a lot of post- process activity to do this. It happens on its own and it makes a dendritic ridge along the side. That's Mars. That's this process, they kind of, look like cousins. So it's hard, if you can't say that electricity can't make dendritic ridges. It probably can. But there's a lot of other processes that seem to produce dendritic ridges. Mount St. Helens after the landslide of pyroclastic flow. There were explosions in the valley where this material accumulated. After the explosion, the sides of the formation that was created by the explosion started to slough. It created dendritic ridges. There are dunes in San Francisco after a storm. As with the landslides, it created dendritic ridges. There's a number of fact, number of ways to make the dendritic ridges. And this seems to be one. Right along here you can see back here, there's another one, another one back there. This is the area the wind's coming this way and these welded tuff formations go all the way across Nevada. Hundreds and hundreds of miles of mountains made of welded tuff. I think they're external, I don't think they fold it up. I've been looking for folded mountains. They might exist, then I'd be happy to find one. Dr. Velikovsky thought mountains were folded because of the stress of this ceasing of rotation. His advisors gave him the standard geologic model. I hate to disagree with them but it seems like there's other options. So this is an area, west of there. These mountains seem rather circular. And the circularity of them goes back to that point. There are circular mountains over here right at the base of the Sierra. This one here in particular. These are welded tuff but on top of a lot of these mountains is dolomite. And dolomite is a big problem for geologists. If you had googled 'dolomite problem', you'll get page after page of links. It doesn't form at the bottom of oceans the way geologists wanted to. They need it too but it doesn't do it, according to chemists. They've tried to make dolomite precipitate out of ocean water. They can do it but they have to boil it and fill the water with uric acid. So, picture dinosaurs urinating in a boiling ocean. 600 million years ago. And then that dolomite, that can't happen, is thrust up on top of mountains, like the dolomites in Italy. The top of the mountains have the dolomite! Some was like I wrote the reports about the dolomite myself. The beauty of dolomite is when they went to comet Halley. They found 7% dolomite, according to NASA, and they claim it's understated. Because its tiny little crystals (are) microscopic and their spectrometers miss a lot of it. So there's probably more. So you have comet dust that can answer the dolomite problem. All over the world you have this dolomite. It's, it's my best friend. It's just the most wonderful stuff. So this whole thing seems to be a vortex. As part of that larger vortex that we saw earlier, this would be the western part of it. That shows you where the center is, that shows the mountains. There's a dolomite mine right there, I'm friends with the general manager, I think he might give us a tour on our tour. It's the largest one in California but the dolomite seems to be circular. This is Four Corners, we're down here. This red thing here are granitic and metamorphic mountains that seem to be in a circular pattern. This goes over to Highway 93 right there. So this seems to be the eastern vortex with a vortex to the west. And that's where they come together. And if you have two vortices, you might actually have a double layer in between, explaining all that melted stuff. And there's other things going on up here which I'll get to a little bit later. Actually they're right there. Could be a coincidence all this, I really don't think so. This is the welded tuff. This is actually dolomite down here, trending this way. The welded tuff trend were at the, on the leeward side. Welded tuff trends back in the other directions. These seem to have been fairly simultaneous. I would think that these were first and then this covered the area going behind so it gives you a feel for the layers of dolomite, layers of shale, the dolomite comes in layers and it's up to 6,500 feet thick. And then on top of one formation like the Bonanza King, which can be up to 6500 feet thick, there's more dolomite and limestone underneath of this. Limestone comes from comet dust too. From comet Halley. I'll get into the oil from comet Halley a little bit later if I have time. There's cubic kilometers of it on this little tiny comet. This is welded tuff south of Pahrump, gives you some idea. It seems like the current density goes up and down. I picture Birkeland current spinning. One positive filament, one negative filament. They're attracting different things ionically. So they're pulling dust and making layers. Dolomite shale, different types of welded tuff layers. Everything has an ionic nature, it's going to be attracted ionically. But as it spins you get different types of material. These are mountains. I just spent time here recently. This is dolomite and it's alternating layers and it makes dendritic ridges on the leeward side. It's just a natural part of the process, you don't have to add anything. It comes out this way. I've done experiments with spackled wall stuff and it builds back up in the direction that you're spraying it from kind of similar to this. And it makes a cliff on the leeward side This is looking from the side so that you can see the layers go through. They're not just a surface feature. One layer, another layer, all the way through. Dolomite shale, dolomite shale, dolomite shale. I'll get into it all right now. Almost all of the oil we've recovered, up until very recently, has come from dolomite. Because it's porous. We couldn't get at the shale oil. Dolomite, being porous, you should put a hole in, a, earth, open pipe, the pressure pushes it in and because it's porous it can keep pushing. With shale it's a solid rock, you have to frack to get it out. Comet Halley has the equivalent of cubic kilometers of oil. Almost identical to the oil in oil shale. That's really convenient from a little tiny comet, 12 by 8 miles. So think about Venus being 8,000 miles across. Scary comet, eats people, we saw Dave's pictures at all that. It gives you the opportunity to explain the dolomite and the oil. They come together, they're a package, they're part of comet dust according to NASA. If you search shale oil, the last paragraph on Wiki, well it talks about extraterrestrial oil and comet Halley. And the cubic kilometers. Each cubic kilometer is 8 billion barrels. Think of the potential for Venus and think of 'Worlds in Collision'. And eyewitnesses emotionally describing rains of oil for days and nights. And it runs down rivers into lakes. Just north of here, not too far, is the Green River Basin. North of I-70 in Utah. There are 3 basins associated with 3 lakes. (It) has 4 trillion barrels of proven reserves, more than half of the oil in the world. Proven reserves, there is oil everywhere, it's not theoretical. I think, that yellow map shows what caused it. It's where the oil came from. It comes from comets, not dinosaurs. And it doesn't... The abiotic oil people have it coming from volcanoes under the ground. And it gets really complicated. If you listen to our ancestors, it came from above. It's common oil. In my humble opinion. This is Oregon, Smith Rocks. This is welded tuff. That's windward, that's leeward, these are the dendritic ridges. The missing volcanoes (are) over here. They went away. I want to do a charity for missing volcanoes. This is a map showing it, you can see that it makes pinnacles. That's the process. These are individual, they start to grow together over here. That's my photograph. It makes triangles! This is the flat, leeward side, when the current density is high. It seems like this process is exacerbated. And it grows back, the wind's coming towards us. This can't grow because the wind is coming around here and the dust is blowing past it. It blows into water, it gets washed away. Even if it's red-hot, it's now dirt, gets washed away. This is the water line, you can... There's actually a creek that comes by here, must have been flooded during this flooding stage. But these shapes are really important. We're going to see Mount Whitney shortly, which is granite. It has the same shape and a completely different explanation from the geologists. I'll get into some funny stories about that later. This is Mount Whitney. This would be windward, this is leeward, here's the cliff. Here's what I like to call the water-ski-ramp. It's nice and flat, building back and up into the wind. It's hard to see the layers of granite because it's so molten. The layers seem to have blended together. This is looking at it from above. It's hard to see a little bit, here's the ridge line, right there. This goes down to the Kern River. Goes down, empties out down by Bakersfield. And then these mountains start again with a ridge and a windward. This is leeward again and windward. It's like the wind was coming from the West, making these mountains of granite. This one shows it more clearly. Windward, leeward. Same thing there. There's Mount Whitney. Reminds me of welded tuff. And if this is bubbling up from below, it shouldn't look anything at all like welded tuff. Has a completely different explanation. They seem to be cousins. This is Maroon Bells, south of Aspen. This is conglomerate, people try to climb it. They die, their anchors fall. And then the Rangers have to carry them out. They gave me all these descriptions of how difficult it is to carry dead weight out of the mountains. It's not consolidated. This is leeward. This is the other side of the valley. This is windward. The next mountain is the same. They repeat themselves. The wind is from the same direction. Although these are not straight-line winds. In many cases they're vortices. And the trending is different from one side to the other. Which is difficult for plate tectonics to explain. They don't have just one plate bumping into another. They have to have a disappeared plate. Really, oh wow, all right. This is Frenchman Mountain. Just east of Las Vegas. You can see the layers. They all go back. These are the same layers as the Grand Canyon. Right here at a 50º angle, that's one extra layer. This is leeward. It's building back. The wind for this is all from the same direction. If the wind was from the south this would be covered. You won't be able to see it. If the wind was from the west on this side, it would cover it, all that would disappear. Unfortunately, this looks like it's one event. Down to the Vishnu schist. And the granite that's at the bottom is same as the Grand Canyon I don't want to make it so dramatic. But unless the wind was from the same direction for multiple events, you wouldn't get this. And that makes it really spectacular. I'd like it to be less spectacular. It would be more embraceable. But it's as if that happened during the plagues of Egypt while that vortex was taking place. There's going to be a discussion later on, this evening at 6:30. Informal, with a computer where I can use Google Maps and all my images. And we can go through all these things. That's the leeward side of Frenchman Mountain. The Vishnu schist is down there. You can see the layers building back. It makes dendritic ridges. They come ... Five minutes, finished. Cool, it's better than I was hoping for. This is the majestic catalinas, just north of Tucson. This is nice. It's metamorphic, you can see it trends back. This is granite, it's unbelievably thick. This is like a couple thousand feet thick of solid granite. This is the leeward side on the back. You can see the "water ski ramp", it's nice and smooth. The wind was coming towards us. This is Snowdon Peak. It's quartzite, it's metamorphed quartz. There's missing pieces. I think this was electrically removed. You can see the layers, if you look at the photograph where it's clear on a computer, building out back towards us. This is the leeward side, the kind of dendritic. But you can't see those gaps, because the energy that created them, I think, was coming from the windward side. It didn't get through. This is the base of it. It's all dendritic, on the leeward side. This is Zion park. When I talked about Snowdon Peak, when I was writing this, or sort of writing it, there's not a lot of words, I said that I had never seen a canyon that would seem to be excavated electrically. Although I was open to it, I'd love to find them. But they don't seem to be produced that way. But these are, these are three thousand foot canyons that are straight. And it seems as if the electricity went right through it. It goes past the high point where the dendritic canyons, which I think are fluvial, stopped at the high point. They get smaller as they go up. There's less water. They don't go past the ridge, these go past the ridge. This is Snow Canyon. Over here, this is Kolab, Zion. These are all zapped. These are where the two vortices are coming together. And it seems as if something came from the south and ripped these suckers out. This is shale, this is mud. Up at the top of these formations. That's how high it is. These formations have the same mud on the top of them. The current couldn't get to it. But originally, this must have been covered just like that. And then these canyons were removed. It removes the sediments much easier than it removes the welded tuff formations. That's the close-up. Now you can see the slosh here. You can see the depth of the canyons. They go straight, they don't follow the drainages. They don't follow the dendritic paths. There's rivers running through here. They don't go where the path would be easiest. They just rip right through a mountain. So I've been looking for electric canyons. Wanting to find them for 6 years. And finally, I've missed them because I was looking for dendritics. In reality, the key to this is just like the rilles of Mars and the Moon. They're straight. And I think it's like a ray gun, probably electrons, going right through it. Although, I'd like to hear Wal and Don and Mel and folks talk about this. Again with a lot of liquor. This is what happens. This one, last one. This is at the edge. This isn't in the canyon that's removed. This is where the process is slowing down. This is what the process is like. It scratches the material away and disappears it into dust. This is the marks, these are the marks that you look for. They're in Las Vegas, at Red Rock Canyon. You can see how things get affected electrically. This is the Electric Universe version of geology. Please stop by. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe brought to you by the Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info [Music] Victory for one theory should mean defeat for its rival. A European Southern Observatory press release boasts, “Pulsating Star Mystery Solved” Cepheid variables are stars whose rates of pulsation vary with their luminosities: the brighter the star, the longer it takes to complete a cycle of variability. It’s called the period–luminosity relationship. By timing the period of pulsation, the absolute luminosity of the star can be calculated. By comparing that quantity with the star’s apparent brightness, the star’s distance can be determined. Edwin Hubble’s discovery of Cepheids in the Andromeda galaxy in 1924 was the key to proving that the “spiral nebulae,” formerly thought to lie inside the Milky Way, were actually independent galaxies far outside the Milky Way. Until now, two theories that predict properties of Cepheids have been in conflict. The press release explains: “Predictions of their masses derived from the theory of pulsating stars are 20–30% less than predictions from the theory of the evolution of stars. This embarrassing discrepancy has been known since the 1960s.” The newly discovered Cepheid is a member of a binary system in which the two stars pass in front of each other as seen from Earth. This configuration enables astronomers to measure not only variations in their luminosities but also their orbital velocities. From these measurements, the stars’ masses can be determined with unprecedented accuracy. The press release states, “The mass of the Cepheid is now known to about 1% and agrees exactly with predictions from the theory of stellar pulsation. However, the larger mass predicted by stellar evolution theory was shown to be significantly in error.” Also significant is this last result is passed over without further comment. One can presume that the aforementioned “embarrassing discrepancy” has paralyzed advocates’ abilities for critical thinking. The discrepancy can only be embarrassing for an orthodoxy of belief which admits, with false humility, that Cepheids are “not fully understood.” The admission thinly hides the implied obverse that Cepheids are “almost entirely understood,” a scientific conceit rightly deserving embarrassment. That the result confirms the stellar pulsation theory necessitates that it falsifies the stellar evolution theory. If astronomers were philosophically honest, they would declare the theory nullified in accordance with Karl Popper’s 1959 proposal of falsification as a criterion to distinguish a scientific theory from a pseudo- scientific one. Falsification was to be a “convention” that required scientists to agree not to adjust a theory to accommodate test results but, when falsified, to start over with searches for alternative theories. Falsification is not a property of a theory that justifies acquiescence in orthodoxy, but a convention that enables opportunities for discovery of new theories and the overthrow of conceptual monopolies. But in view of past perform- ance, stellar evolution theory will simply be “adjusted.” A substantially different theory will be put forward with the same name in order to maintain the illusion of continuity and the cumulativeness of conceptual progress. The only continuity will be the tenure of advocates; the only cumulativeness will be in their power and salaries. The conceptual claim is fraud- ulent. In the Electric Universe, variations in luminosity are caused by oscillations in the currents powering the stars and are likely “atmospheric” effects. Mass is proportional to the charge on a body and may be unrelated to the oscillations unless they deposit or remove charge. The process is “hardly at all understood” and is an opportunity for discovery and development. When Cepheids are used as indicators for the distances to nearby galaxies, a necessary assumption is that mass is invariant throughout the universe. But if  mass varies with charge, each galaxy—and therefore each star in it—could  have a different charge distribution with respect to the intergalactic plasma. Each galaxy could have an idiosyncratic period-luminosity relationship for Cepheids, rendering them unusable for determining distances to other galaxies. Halton  Arp’s discoveries of connections between high-redshift quasars and low-redshift active galaxies have already brought “ultra-luminous” objects at great distances back to being “normally luminous” objects at much closer distances. The objects may even be “under-luminous” and located at nearby distances. With both redshift and Cepheids thrown into doubt, astronomers are left with no reliable way to determine distances to galaxies. Astronomy is  once again open to new fundamental insights. The ornate knowledge with which the Queen of the Sciences has  proclaimed herself to be draped is turning out to the invisible. Perhaps she should not have paraded herself so far down the street without an alternative theory at hand. [Music] 
You've just entered the theater of an alien sky. If the words and images seem strange to you there's a reason for this. Our world was once a vastly different place. To experience this won't hurt you and there's nothing to fear. In previous Discourses, we've noted some of the remarkable ways the mythic ship of heaven contradicts all of the usual translations of Egyptian texts - the very texts that give us the most concrete information on this vehicle of the gods. Translators sought to accommodate the problem by mistranslating the literal meanings of Egyptian words. But the real problem has its source in the inescapable motion of the ship itself. The ship flatly refuses to cooperate with any solar interpretation. Why, at the beginning of the ancient "day" was the ship described descending, while at the beginning of the ancient "night" it was rising? And why the consistent linkage of the descending ship with the left and the rising ship with the right? In fact, every detail of the cosmic ship becomes absurd the moment we attempt to relate the concrete language to the appearance of the Sun in our sky. In following the literal evidence of a revolving crescent, we've noted the ship above in it's phase of dimness, and below in it's phase of brightness. This consistent language holds vast implications for our understanding of the ancient sky. But it reverses every common assumption about the regions of the so-called day and night journeys of the ancient sun god. Historically, one misconception led inescapably to another. The regions above and below in the cosmic circuit invariably came to be translated as heaven and earth, a mistake that precluded any useful understanding of the ship of heaven. The two most frequently used Egyptian words for the regions above and below can be seen in the pairing of the concepts Pet and Ta. When standing in combination, Pet always meant "the upper region" and Ta always meant the region "below". These are the accepted literal meanings of the combined words. In the Pyramid Texts, we find Night-bark of Ra sailing over Pet, the upper region. But what is this sun god doing above at night? "Thou sailest on high in the evening barge" means literally, in the phase of dimming (above). It's not literally our night, the ship was depicted above in the literal phase of dimming, mistranslated as a night journey. The upper region Pet was also represented by the arching body of the goddess Nut, and we see the ship in it's so-called night journey, moving up and across the region of Pet, the region above. And it's a wonder that virtually no one has asked why is the ship above in this phase of the daily cycle when the solar mythologists have claimed for a century and a half that the god crosses below the land at night to the place of sunrise. In contrast, the so-called day ship occupied the lower region - contradicting all standard treatments of the subject. The best way to test an extraordinary idea is to force the reasoning to it's extreme where logical implications can be confronted in the most explicit terms. If an idea is fundamentally incorrect the extreme cases will invariably reduce the idea to absurdity. In fact, the ship of heaven gives us some excellent examples of the logical tests. Just imagine the situation faced by ancient sky worshipers looking back to the age of the gods, but with inadequate conceptual tools to comprehend the symbolic language. The crescent above, when interpreted mythically as a ship, would surely have provoked some enigmatic Egyptian responses to the afterlife journey of the king in this cosmic ship. How would the celebrants of this journey, regard a ship that was inverted - upside down - as it traversed the upper region. In fact, to the Egyptians the journey above, the so-called night crossing was fraught with peril. But why? There's an irony in the way the Egyptian priests sought to protect the king, upon his death, from things clearly remembered about this envisioned voyage with Ra across the upper region. Exactly as we would expect, the texts convey a fear of traveling upside down during this passage. So there's a spell for not traveling upside down in the realm of the dead, and one says simply, "Not to walk upside down" ... "I will not be head downwards amongst those who are head downwards", reads another text. "The king will not be hanged head downwards". The deceased declares, "It is the Night-bark and the Day-bark ... I am not upside-down in the presence of Ra". The idea of a ship sailing upside down is well worth tracing to it's origins, and the artistic traditions do not disappoint us, but they must be followed back in time to their archaic roots. In later times, when texts describe the ship's journey above, in the literal phase of dimming, the words were mistranslated as a night journey, a blatant contradiction. For us however, the problem is that the ship was shown upright, not inverted, as our reconstruction requires. But the more archaic tradition we are looking for comes from the Papyrus of Amen-Hetep in the Cairo Museum. In the second scene depicted on the papyrus, the goddess Nut is shown in the usual arched or semicircular fashion as representative of the upper portion of the ship circuit. And the ship of the sun itself is depicted in it's night journey crossing the body of the goddess. But here, unlike the more familiar versions of later times, the ship is not upright but inverted. And so we ask, is it possible that the graphic image speaks for an original tradition, later distorted out of a royal fear of "traveling upside down"? The answer comes from hieroglyphic evidence that preceded by many centuries the more familiar artistic portrayals of the night journey. In Spell 211 of the Coffin Texts, this voyage, literally the phase of dimming, is described in the instruction to the newly deceased king. He has to learn the path of the right (Amentet, the ascending path), then to "ferry across the upper region when the divine land is turned upside down". The position of the ship at this moment is presented in the hieroglyphic text: not just the land of the gods, but the ship itself is upside down. Perhaps the idea that the land of the gods could be turned upside down is no less mystifying than the inversion of the ship. But when we realize that the crescent-ship is the brightly illuminated portion of the divine land we see that the inversion of the crescent in it's so-called "night" position, literally the phase of dimming would be viewed as an inversion of both the land and the ship. In our reconstruction of this ancient imagery, we've suggested that the ship revolved above and around a visible, axial column, remembered as the world mountain ... known globally under many names and mythic interpretations. If this conclusion is correct, we should expect a direct confirmation of the ship's connection to the mountain of the gods. Call it an inescapable prediction of the reconstruction. The Egyptian sources speak eloquently in confirming this very connection. In the words of the deceased king, the texts say, "I assume my pure seat which is in the bow of the Bark of Ra. It is the sailors who convey Ra round about the Mountain of Fire and Light, and it is they who will convey me around about the Mountain of Fire and Light". Hail, Only One! Behold, thou art in the Sektet boat as it goeth round about the Mountain of Fire and Light". In these quotes, I've used the literal reading of the Aakhut the cosmic mountain, not the inaccurate and highly misleading translation of the mount as a mere "horizon". That allows us to see the underlying symbolism in it's integrity. As we have previously shown, the pillar and crescent mean that revolving arms of the pillar god, the horns of the Bull of Heaven and the twin peaks of the world mountain, all predictably equated with the cosmic ship. So once more, we're brought back to our earlier admonition: do not believe in coincidences. The ability of a concrete reconstruction to predict explicit details, when the details are simply absurd under common suppositions, is not to be taken lightly. In fact, the contrasting phases of the ship of heaven in it's daily journey, will give us an ideal introduction to an even broader mythic theme - the cosmic twins as figures of the revolving crescent in it's archaic daily cycle. That will be the subject of our next Discourse. 
Welcome to the Electricity of Life, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info What is the role of electromagnetic fields in health and healing? Today, various electromagnetic therapies have gained unprecedented acceptance and use, and scientific studies continue to affirm the influence of electromagnetic fields on life. In Western medicine, the tradition is for various specialists to treat supposedly disconnected parts and organs. But the leading proponents of electromagnetic healing propose a new way of seeing the human body and all living organisms. One of the leading pioneers in this rapidly growing field has been Dr. Jerry Tennant, an ophthalmologist whose book series 'Healing is Voltage' describes his groundbreaking research into the electrical circuitry of the human body. Today, in part 1 of this two-part presentation, Dr. Tennant begins by sharing his own remarkable challenges which catalyzed his scientific journey. I always begin my discussions with the disclaimer that I'm not speaking with my Texas MD license. I'm speaking with my Arizona MDH license. Arizona and Nevada have special medical boards for Integrative Medicine and homeopathic medicine and I'm licensed under that Arizona Board of Integrative and Homeopathic medicine and that's the license that I have this conversation under and not my Texas license. Well, I'm trained as an ophthalmologist and did traditional ophthalmology with a focus on cataract surgery for 30 years or so. I had a lot of fun being an ophthalmologist, I was able to do a lot of things that changed the way off the ophtalmology is practiced. I had a great deal to do with bringing intraocular lenses into this country, and the use of them. When I was trained, we would simply take the lens out of the eye and people would end up wearing really big thick glasses. Of course, those allowed you to see but they were fairly disabling because everything looked 30% too big and 30% too close and it was hard to walk or drive or whatever. So I was one of the early people that put lenses in eyes after cataract surgery and then there were some problems with the European lenses that we used in the beginning, so I modified those and got lenses to work better and then began to teach others how to do that. So that was one of the fun things I did. When I was trained, we kept patients in the hospital for two weeks with both eyes blinded, and of course the elderly tend to become disoriented and even psychotic if you keep them in bed and blind them for a couple of weeks. So I developed a way to make a watertight incision so that they didn't have to stay in bed and we could actually get them up and walk them immediately from the surgery table and that changed a lot of things as well. And also we had a problem with people, the elderly going into the hospitals. You know, elderly people have a tendency to get a particular pattern of living, they eat certain things that agree with them and that keep their digestive and urinary processes working. There are foods that upset them and so you put them in a hospital and change all of that. They commonly get sick just from being outside their normal environment and often fall and hurt themselves. One of the things we began then to work on was outpatient surgery. So being able to operate on cataract and then have people go immediately home was a great benefit. And we helped, along with my anesthesiologist and internists developed the techniques for that and taught how to do that. And I guess, the next thing I did in ophthalmology that was kind of fun is, I did the majority of the research for the laser that's used in LASIK surgery. So I did about 90% of that research for the company called VISX. But during that process of doing the laser surgery, we didn't know that the laser wouldn't kill viruses. And so I was using the laser to carve the scar off of the cornea of a fellow from India that had leukemia. And it carved the scar off well enough but it also released viruses from his cornea. And that went into my nose and into my brain and I got encephalitis. And so I got to where I could see a patient, know what was wrong with him but I couldn't remember how to write a prescription. I also developed spastic movements, so I'd be sitting there and all of a sudden I'd do something like that. Which doesn't work really well if you're operating inside somebody's eyeball. And I had overwhelming fatigue. And so for all those reasons, I had to quit work at the end of November of 1995 and so I slept 16 hours a day, had two or three hours a day in which I could understand a newspaper and then like a light switch, it'd go off and I couldn't understand it anymore. I went to the best doctors I could find in Boston and New York etc, etc and they all said well, you have three viruses in your brain, we don't know what to do about it, good luck! So during that two or three hours a day I could think I had to figure out how to get myself well and so I began the journey of trying to figure out how I might do that and one of the things that resonated with me was that every cell in the body had the same hardware. Even though cells look quite different, just like a laptop looks different than a desktop computer, they still have all the same basic parts. And I thought well, if I can figure out how to make one cell work I can make them all work. And so I started down that road and I bought a bunch of cellular biology books which I hadn't read in 30 years and began to read through them and one of the things that resonated with me it said that cells have to run at a pH of 7.35 to 7.45. Well, I didn't really remember much about pH except it was acid-base balance, but as an eye surgeon I didn't really need to know much about that for 30 years. And so, I began to study pH and discovered that pH is simply the measurement of voltage in a liquid. If you think about a copper wire used to turn the switch on and electrons flow; you turn the switch off and they stop, but in a liquid it can either be an electron donor or an electron stealer. And by convention, if a liquid is an electron stealer, you put a plus sign in front of the voltage. And if it's electron donor, you put a minus sign in front of the voltage. By convention also, you take the voltage and you convert it to a logarithmic scale from zero to 14 and call it pH. So plus 400 millivolts of electrons stealer is the same as a pH of 0 and minus 400 millivolts of electron donor is the same as a pH of 14. When you read then that cells have to run at a pH of 7.35 to 7.45, that's a synonym of -22 to -25 millivolts give or take a millivolt. So I said oh, cells have to have voltage to work, that makes sense. And so all of a sudden, this new way of thinking about things was obvious to me. The next issue was how do you measure it. Well of course, if you take a standard pH meter, it has a switch on it, you can switch it from pH or millivolts, whichever one you want to to have it read out and you simply stick the probe in a liquid and it'll tell you what the pH is or what the millivolts is and/or convert it to the logarithmic scale of pH for you. So I said well, how do you measure it in the body, and I found that a chap named Nakatani was the first person to use modern electronics to measure acupuncture circuits and published it in 1951. So I got his rather rudimentary equipment, started measuring and where my brain should be running at -25 millivolts, I found it was running between  -2 to -4 millivolts. So then I knew why it didn't work, it didn't have the juice to do it. So the next issue is well, what am I going to do about it? So I began to do some more reading and found that a Russian chap had figured out the waveform that would more efficiently transfer electrons to cell membranes. I began to try to learn about that and discovered that there was a Russian pediatrician named Zulia Valeyeva-Frost. Zulia Veleyeva married the chap from London named Frost and moved to London. And she was in the process of teaching people how to use this Russian device to transfer energy to cells. So I called her and I said hey, I'm interested in what you're doing. And she said well, as luck would have it, I'm teaching my first seminar in San Francisco in three days. I said, sign me up, I'll be there. So I went to that seminar and I got the Russian device and began to recharge my cells and in about six weeks or so, things began to get better. The other thing that happened about that time was that I was on an airplane and there was a nurse sitting next to me from the Dallas area. And she began to tell me that she had lymphoma, had this big tumor around her neck and scattered throughout her body. And that she'd gone to Mexico and in a matter of days the tumors were gone, even though MD Anderson had told her to go home and die. So I went down to visit with the docs that helped her to see how in the world they did that and that was sort of the beginning of my journey along with this other business of the electronics to figure out how to get well. And one of the things they taught me was that essentially all tumors are associated with infection in your teeth, particularly root canal teeth. And so she had gone down and they had pulled her root canal tooth and cleaned up the infection in her mouth and in a matter of days her tumors were gone. And she sent me not only photographs but she sent me her medical records from MD Anderson when she came back and they proved that her tumors had disappeared. So I had a root canal tooth here in what's called the spleen stomach acupuncture circuit and so my Docs here in Dallas said there's nothing wrong with that tooth but I had also developed a bleeding disorder and so I went back down to Mexico and had the dentist, that had operated on this nurse, work on me and when she pulled that tooth, there was so much infection in the bone, it splattered all over her mask. And yet I had no symptoms as far as the tooth was concerned. But 48 hours after she pulled the tooth, my bleeding disorder was cured and that was rather amazing. And then over the next six weeks or so, my brain started to work again. And so that's how I started going down this road of figuring out how the body really works and what the role of voltage is in the body, because it's obviously so different than what I was taught in medical school. One of the things that I was led to try to understand was acupuncture. Actually, that was part of a bigger picture in that I was sitting in my chair at home and I said to myself well, obviously traditional medicine that I was taught, told me go home and die. And so that obviously wasn't working so well. But sometimes chiropractic works, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes acupuncture works, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes essential oils work, sometimes they don't, etc etc. So there are all these various medical models that sometimes work and sometimes don't. So my thinking was, if I could figure out, there has to be a common denominator that goes through all of these. Otherwise, because I mean if things work, there's, it's because it's following some basic laws, some basic rules of how things are supposed to work. If I could figure out what that common denominator was running through all of these different , then I knew how to get myself well. And it began to become apparent to me that the voltage piece was the common denominator for all of these things. Now, obviously it becomes very complicated when you start, particularly someone like me who has no background in electronics or even in physics, I had, you know, freshman college physics and that was my background. The issue is how do you figure out what the common denominator here is and I began to go down a different road in that, I began to understand that there's no such thing as a bunch of little balls of electrons spinning around a charged ball in the center. It's been known for probably 75 years or so that that's really not what an atom is but we still teach that. And so I began to read and talk to, I fortunately was able to talk to some various people who had gone down that road before me and began to understand more about what an atom is because if you don't understand what energy is, what an atom is, even how the universe works, you can't understand how a cell works. And so I began to consider that there were alternatives. So one of the things that was a great influence on me was the work of Schauberger, the Swiss water specialist who had figured out how to make a flying saucer that was fueled by water. And he was captured by Hitler as you probably know and made to make as, you know, work in there that in industry for the Germans. He understood very well that there are things that spin right and concentrate into a point, concentrate the energy into a point which of course we call implosion and there's something that spins left that starts small and gets bigger and then disappears we call an explosion. And that those are the two basic kinds of energy. Schauberger's work with water and energy was very influential on my road down trying to figure out how the body works. The other thing that was very powerful was to read the work that cells, I mean that muscles are piezoelectric. And so I began to consider and in a and I was initially wrong. I thought our muscles were wired up the way 12 volt battery is, you know, you take the cover off of a 12 volt battery and there are a bunch of one-and-a-half volt batteries all wired together in there. And I thought, that's the way our body was wired up, that we had our muscles were just one big battery that provided power for the cells to work. But then I began to notice that there were patients that had normal total body voltage, as I measured it, but there would be one circuit out or one organ out. And I said well, then I have to be wrong about how we're wired up. And I began to consider that acupuncture meridians were stacks of muscle batteries wired together into one single column that provided power. And I was talking with one of my colleagues, Dr. Evans, about this and he said well, have you read Tom Myers's book Anatomy Trains? And I said no, I never heard of it, and he said well you should read it. So I get Myers's book and Myers is a massage therapist who had access to cadavers. And he would use blunt dissection and started dissecting the fascia and discovered that it would go all the way from the toe to the head or all the way from your hands to the head and surrounds muscle, a battery stacked one on top of each other which is exactly what I had come to the conclusion we had to have in the body, but he'd already done the dissection. So I started with Myers's work. Now, unfortunately he stopped at the neck and a lot of the stuff I was interested in like the eye was obviously above the neck. So, but I started with his work and I got anatomy apps which fortunately allowed me to look at if on an acupuncture 2D drawing, there's a line that goes from here to here, what muscle goes from here to here? And I could go to the app and figure that out. So what I was able to do was to develop a road map, an atlas of the muscle battery packs and come to the conclusion that acupuncture meridians are simply stacks of muscle batteries surrounded by a common sheath, or as common stocking, of fascia. And the other thing that had been reported is that fascia are simply semiconductors. So of course, you know better than I, a semiconductor is a collection of molecules that moves electrons at the speed of light but only in one direction. So that made a lot of sense so then the fascia that we have surrounding our stacks of muscle batteries is simply the body's wiring system. So now we have a battery system, we have a wiring system. And that helped me begin to understand why things that didn't seem to make sense actually made perfect sense. So for example when I was sick, I felt like somebody was sticking an ice pick in my left big toe. My spleen was swollen and hurt, my stomach hurt all the time. I lost the vision in my left eye, the macula of my left eye and I couldn't think. Well, in any other form of Medicine you'd never put all those things together, but it turns out that that everything I just described has the same power supply. Duh, all of a sudden things make perfect sense and that same circuit goes through, guess what, this root canal tooth. So it became apparent that dead teeth in a circuit act like a circuit breaker and just shut the circuit off. Root canal should never be done. The dentists are the only physicians that think you can get away with leaving dead tissue in the body. No other doctor believes that. And that's what you do with a root canal, you drill a hole on the tooth, you reach in with an auger, turn it, rip out the artery, rip out the nerve and kill the tooth. Then you stuff it full of putty and assume that it's going to stay sterile. Well, that's nonsense. It's still attached to the blood supply and lymphatics at the roots, so there's certainly a way for bacteria to get in there and a root canal tooth is no different than having your big toe die. If you leave it there, you die of gangrene. Your appendix dies. You leave it there, you die of peritonitis. A root canal will kill you just as certainly, it just takes longer. So the fellow that popularized root canal procedure was a dentist named George Meinig and I think he spent the last years of his life trying to get dentists to quit doing them. He wrote this book called 'The Root Canal Cover-Up' and even before Meinig came along and wrote his book, Weston Price would take in, pull teeth from somebody who was sick, embed it under the skin of a rabbit and within the week the rabbit had the same illness as a person who owned the tooth. And he did that hundreds of times. And so, the concept that dental infections cause systemic disease has been known a very long time but the dentists have done a good job of trying to keep that covered up. There's actually a popular Netflix movie that's running right now called 'The Root Cause' and this fellow catalogs his journey of being an athlete and then being disabled after he gets a root canal and then doing all this stuff trying to get well. None of it works until he goes and gets rid of the root canal and then he's back healthy again which is exactly what happened to me. 
Welcome to Space News from The Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project at Thunderbolts.info. In Part One of this presentation phycicist Wal Thornhill began laying the foundations for a new theoretical understanding of our sun and all stars. Standard theory remains that stars are born due to the gravitational collapse of material in nebular clouds over vast spans of time. We're told that stars die when they inevitably exhaust their fuel, or simply explode. But for many years countless discoveries have contradicted these fundamental concepts. In this episode Thornhill further explores the Electric Universe predictions and explanations for a variety of stellar phenomena. So, let's return to the declaration of our esteemed internet lecturer that our sun was born about 5 billion years ago. There is no evidence whatsoever for this categorical statement. With the thermonuclear model discredited by the observational evidence, the complex life story of stars is exposed as fiction. Two recent reports support this judgment, out of a countless number of others, expressing surprise at unexpected discoveries. On March 6, (2017) phys.org headlined a report, “Star clusters discovery could upset the astronomical applecart.” It begins, “The discovery of young stars in old clusters could send scientists back to the drawing board.” Because models of stellar evolution are based on the assumption that stars within star clusters formed from the same material at roughly the same time.  However “back to the drawing board” always means embroidering the set of beliefs permanently inscribed on the board. No physicist shows the intellectual integrity to wipe the board clean of its own scientific Big Bang myth and start afresh; it's all too hard and scary. So, Dr. Kenji Bekky from the International Center for Radio Astronomy Research says, “The formation of these younger stars could have been fueled by gas entering the clusters from interstellar space.” However, observations showed “that there was no correlation between interstellar hydrogen gas and the location of the clusters we were studying.” “We believe the younger stars have actually been created out of the matter ejected from older stars as they die, which means we have discovered multiple generations of stars belonging to the same cluster.” The words “We believe” are accurate; the discovery of multiple generations of stars is not. The notion of the age of a star is based on plotting a point on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram where the star leaves the main sequence after the exhaustion of its main fuel. But we have shown that stars do not exhaust their fuel any more than an electric light does. Stars don't die because their fuel runs out, or mysteriously explodes. The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is simply a plot of points, and not an evolutionary sequence. Stars have been observed to change swiftly and inexplicably from one location to another on the diagram. When viewed correctly as a mirror image, the diagram represents the change in color and brightness of a star as the electrical energy focused on it, increases along the x-axis. Sharp discontinuities exist in experimental gas discharges between dark mode, glow mode and arc mode. These discontinuities simply explain the sharply different appearances of faint white dwarfs, bright sun-like stars and red, so-called dwarfs, and red giant stars. The red color is due to an extensive anode glow and the faint white color is simply a coronal glow of a normally constituted stellar body lacking a bright arc mode photosphere. No imaginary ultra-dense dwarf object is required. There is no need to invent an ad hoc requirement for stars to have exploded and then somehow gather their widely scattering dust gravitationally to give birth to younger stars in the cluster. Stellar explosions are often invoked to clear dust and gas from star clusters. Astronomers can't have it both ways, but critically, none of this complicated ”ad-hoc-ary” fits the observations of filamentary star birth inside molecular clouds. The second report appeared on May 18, last year in phys.org, titled, “Stellar mystery deepens.” A Monash University-led research team made an unexpected discovery that a large group of stars are dying prematurely, challenging our accepted view of stellar evolution. Their results revealed that large numbers of helium burning stars are dying prematurely in the M4 globular cluster. Professor Lattanzio from the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics said, Globular clusters are some of the oldest objects in the Universe. Although we have some ideas for what is going on in them, every time we look carefully we find something unexpected. They are both fascinating and frustrating at the same time.” The international team found that about half of the stars tend to skip the red giant phase, instead becoming white dwarfs, millions of years ahead of schedule, demonstrating once again what's wrong with the modern scientific method characterized as shut up and simulate. Professor Lattanzio continued: “Computer simulations do not agree with this observation; so as well as continuing observations, new computer models will need to be generated to better understand what is taking place in the cores of these stars.” But the computer models are built on missing or invalid concepts: there's nothing going on in the cores of stars, and globular clusters are not understood. So, the mathematical computer simulations produce a virtual, unreal cosmos that, like the movies, can be programmed to produce anything you can imagine and the artist's impressions we see in science reports are little more than glossy advertising material, but much more deceptive, because it is falsely labeled ‘real science’. There is no real mystery here. With no nuclear fire inside, stars don't die by bloating to a red giant and collapsing to a white dwarf as their fire goes out. The life and death stories of stars are fictional: the bloated appearance of red giants is not due to internal pressure caused by hypothetical helium burning at 100 million degrees in the core of a star. It is a purely electrical effect, witnessed in laboratory low pressure gas discharge tubes. Red stars are those that satisfy their need for electrons from the surrounding plasma by expanding the surface area over which they collect electrons, by growing a large plasma sheath that becomes the effective anode in space. The growth process is self-limiting, because as the sheath expands, its electric field grows stronger. Electrons caught up in the field are accelerated until they become energetic enough to excite neutral particles they chance to collide with and the huge sheath becomes a uniform red anode glow: it becomes a red giant star. The electric field driving this process will also give rise to a massive flow of positive ions away from the star, or in more conventional terms, a prodigious stellar wind. Such loss of matter is the characteristic feature of red giants; standard stellar theory is at a loss to explain this, since the star is said to be too cold to boil off a stellar wind. Arthur Eddington himself expressed his puzzlement about white dwarfs, “Strange objects, which persist in showing a type of spectrum entirely out of keeping with their luminosity, may ultimately teach us more than a host which radiates according to rule.” He was right: a white dwarf appears extremely hot, white and under-luminous because it is a faint, white coronal discharge. As usual, a thin plasma sheath will be formed between the plasma of the star and the plasma of space. The electric field across the plasma sheath is capable of accelerating electrons to generate ultraviolet light and X-rays when they hit atoms in the atmosphere, and the power dissipated is capable of raising the temperature of a thin plasma layer to tens of thousands of degrees. The spectral lines are broadened, sometimes to the point of disappearance, due to the coronal electric field. This gives the misleading impression that hydrogen, whose spectral lines are smeared the most, is missing in many of these stars and that therefore, they are remnants of larger stars that have conventionally lost or burned their hydrogen fuel. So, globular clusters are not some of the oldest objects in the universe. Their spherical shape of a dense collection of stars, and their elliptical orbits about the galactic center, hint at a quasar style birth process from the plasmoid at the heart of the galaxy. If so, the electromagnetic environment inside the globular cluster is different to that in open clusters of stars. So we should expect an unusual distribution of white dwarfs and red giant stars and the puzzling observation that some globular cluster stars have 100 times more iron than others, could also be explained by electromagnetic sorting of elements within the globular cluster at its birth. The fact we don't understand stars in the 21st century, highlights what Arthur Koestler wrote in The sleepwalkers, “The history of cosmic theories, in particular, may without exaggeration be called a history of collective obsessions and controlled schizophrenia; and the manner in which some of the most important individual discoveries were arrived at reminds one more of a sleepwalker’s performance than an electronic brain’s.” Science is still in its childhood and we behave as infants. We give far too much credit to scientists for knowing what they are talking about. For continuous updates on Space News from the Electric Universe, stay tuned to Thunderbolts.info. [Music] [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info New scientific reports provide yet another devastating blow to the standard theory of planet formation. In recent years, we've reported on a stunning series of discoveries that completely confound the more than two and a half centuries old nebular hypothesis. The Electric Universe theory has always proposed that planets do not form from accretion in gravitationally collapsing nebular clouds. Rather, The Thunderbolts Project's chief science advisor Wal Thornhill has always proposed two mechanisms of planet formation. One is the formation of planets by the electromagnetic z-pinch effect along the same filaments where stars are now known to form. And other planets are later ejected from the cores of the gas giants. The accretion hypothesis has failed both experimentally and observationally. As noted in a recent news report, "According to the traditional story of the origin of the solar system, the planets formed slowly from accretion, as particles in the circumstellar disk clumped together to great pebbles, then slightly larger spheres, on and on until they reached their current size. But when scientists try to re-create this story with computer models, it breaks down. Rather than growing, these incipient planets tend to splinter after reaching pebble size." And today, new scientific research into the planet-forming conditions in so-called young star systems has delivered another shocking blow to standard theory. In a paper published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics, scientists describe their attempts to determine how much material is present in the disks around stars that are thought to be only one to three million years old. When they compared their estimates to the masses of star systems that have fully formed planets, they realized that the so-called young stars did not have enough matter in their discs to eventually form planets. The conundrum is described in a recent phys.org report which states, "Until now, space scientists have believed that star systems form due to space dust coalescing into a star. Once the star gets going, a protoplanetary disk usually forms around the star. It is believed the gas and dust that make up the disk are leftovers from material involved in creating the star. As more time passes, the material in the disk tends to clump together until gravity takes over, attracting more of the material in the disk. Eventually, most of the material from the disk is incorporated into planets that orbit the star. But this new evidence suggests that there is not enough material in the disk of the average early star system to create the average number and size of planets that come to exist a few million years later." A very similar conundrum has been posed for the standard theory of star formation. In our Electric Universe, it is not a coincidence that stars tend to form in groups along spectacular snake-like filaments. Standard theory had originally proposed that massive stars would form in individual proto-stellar clouds. But consider these images of a stellar nursery in the aptly named Snake Nebula where a number of stars are forming along the filament and the stars themselves break up along a cylinder. This is in stark contrast to gravitational theory which predicts that a center of mass exists toward which all of the surrounding material in the cloud tends to move and to congregate to eventually form a star. What's more, just as a fatal deficit of matter is observed in the disks about stars to form a typical number of planets, scientists studying the Snake Nebula found that the material needed to be drawn in to form massive stars is far less than gravitational models predict. In 2014, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics issued a press release which stated, "Previous theories proposed that high-mass stars form within very massive isolated 'cores' weighing at least 100 times the mass of the Sun. These new results show that that is not the case. The data also demonstrate that massive stars aren't born alone but in groups... The team also was surprised to find that these two nebular patches had fragmented into individual star seeds so early in the star formation process. They detected bipolar outflows and other signs of active, ongoing star formation." Of course the detection of bipolar outflows does not match a gravitational infall model at all. However as Wal Thornhill has proposed in his theory of electrical star formation, when material is drawn in radially into a filament and begins to form a star if the energy stored in the material falling towards the star exceeds a certain amount, it will discharge causing proto stellar jets which go out along the axis of the filament which has also been observed. Yet another aspect of star formation that fits far better with the Electric Universe is the astonishing abundance of binary stars, an admitted intractable problem in standard astronomy. In the next episode of Space News, Wal Thornhill will explain why the double-lobed form seen throughout the cosmos is the product of the predominant electromagnetic force shaping matter at all scales in the universe. We now offer this brief preview of his presentation. On August 24th, phys.org published The Origin of Binary Stars. It makes the admission that "The origin of binary stars has long been one of the central problems of astronomy." It's been found that protostars and young stars are more likely to be found in binary pairs strung at intervals along a filament inside a molecular cloud. "About half of the binaries are in elongated core structures, and they conclude that the initial cores were also elongated structures... One of their most significant major conclusions is that each dusty core of material is likely to be the birthplace of two stars, not the single star usually modeled." This raises the real issue that astrophysicists don't understand how either the filaments or the stars are formed, something that plasma cosmologists have shown for half a century or more. Here's an image taken at submillimeter wavelengths of a star-forming core showing that it contains two young stellar embryos. The caption says, "Astronomers have concluded from a systematic study of very young cores that most embryonic stars form in multiple systems, and later some of them separate." The problem is that astrophysicists are using a gravitational accretion model based on the concept of a center of mass which doesn't lend itself to preferentially producing pairs of stars. Meanwhile, the plasma cosmology model is electromagnetic driven by a linear twisted pair of Birkeland current filaments. It's an inherently binary phenomenon. In the Electric Universe, stars and planets are formed along the Birkeland current filament by a powerful and long-range 1/√r electromagnetic scavenging force acting on the diffused dust and gas in a molecular cloud. This compares to the puny short-range 1/r² gravitational force which cannot form a filament anyway. On the basis that nature doesn't do anything the hard way, gravity just isn't the answer! 
I think as many of you know a couple of years ago three maybe three years ago I was able to fortunate enough to be able to develop a model a mathematical physical description of the structure of what berkland current should look like has to look like if the assumptions that led to the model are correct whenever we talked about force free fields and things like that if all that stuff is right then I know that mathematically my model is correct what we don't know is does that model does are the outputs what you think you're seeing does it correspond to reality I have a quote here from another electrical engineer who I very much admire and his name is dr. William Hughes he passed away and I think 2008 something like that was head of department in electrical engineering it I think in University in South Dakota and I think Oklahoma but his quote is all such models like mine our only models of reality rather than reality itself the final arbiter of the value of any hypothesis is and always will be experimental evidence numbers does it jibe or you it does your models suggest any predictions and if it does go see if they if they're born born out so that's what I've been doing for the last couple of years is to look for evidence of what the look at the berkland current model says and so let's see if I can get this to go there it is like what I've entitled my talk is this morning is the next step and what it is that next step is simply to get some new evidence that my model predicts reality and you've you've seen some evidence of that in the last couple of years yeah last night Jim Ryder presented a picture much like this one of the the galaxies the Galactic web the Galactic Network and all the galaxies as far as we can tell are connected and the question is what are they connected by and I submit they're probably connected by berkland currents well if they are then there should be evidence of Scott's model in what we observe well what kind of evidence can that be well my model of the berkland current has several different properties but the the most important one really is that the berkland current and I've put that in in emphasis font is a structure that is a collection of hollow counter-rotating concentric cylinders some of you have seen the example of the counter-rotating props on a ship that's exactly what the berkland current according to what my work came out with should look like so if a berkland current impinges on something like the North Pole of a planet or a galaxy or wherever there should be some sort of evidence of things going in different directions and the question is are there and also the final note on there on that slide is that in berkland currents electrical current will spiral in many different ways it spirals this way and it spirals back at you this way and current can go in both directions there is a preferred direction and I think Jerry Pollock not last night but a couple of times ago I think Jerry said that that water bridge is at least it shows evidence of twisting and it shows evidence of current going in both directions more easily in one than in the other but both directions that's the kind of evidence that I'm looking for to see that my model is right well what I'm about to show you is a video that was produced by the thunderbolts group Michael Goodspeed and these guys and it brings I know that many of you have seen that already but for all anybody here who is new I think in a few minutes just a couple of minutes it will summarize everything I know up till now as to the supporting evidence for this this model of mine welcome to space news from the electric universe brought to you by the thunderbolts project at Thunderbolts dot info at the recent Thunderbolts project Conference of teen paths of discovery professor Donald Scott presented new groundbreaking evidence of the electromagnetic connection between the Earth and the Sun the electric universe theory states as the Sun is in essence an electrical discharge phenomenon powered by electric currents flowing along the arm at the galaxies electrical circuitry connects the Sun and all planets including the earth driving climate weather and Earth's Aurora's the tell-tale sign of berkland currents at the poles of planets counter rotational motions in atmospheric phenomena today dr. Scott discusses the new visual evidence that Birdland currents from the Sun are the cause of Earth's Aurora's the Earth's Sun connection which of course is I think the primary basic foundational idea of the electric universe at least historically that this marvelous investigator a region investigator Kristian Birkeland literally put his life in danger to go out on the North slopes of Norway in in the Norwegian winter and take measurements out there his idea was of course the theorem were caused electrically after a number of them when he did this is around 1902 1903 I think the idea of an electron had just been postulated two or three years earlier so it was not a very it's the word ubiquitous idea that these electrons were flying around and he was that his burglar who was roundly chastised by the astronomical community it's ridiculous no none of these corpuscles I guess berkland called them and also other investigators call it call them corpuscles as it's well but they could never make it to hold 93 million miles in the Sun of the earth it's ludicrous idea and of course later on to make the long story short after world war ii and we sent rockets up into the upper atmosphere we found that indeed that's exactly what what was going on and Sidney Chapman the prime what should I say antagonist still a berkland was certainly shown to be all wet so from there it went on I got into the active very late just a few years ago my contribution really was I completed the derivation of a mathematical physical model of a berkland current what would this thing look like at NASA now calls them magnetic flux ropes and actually Hannes Alfven was the guy who coined that phrase I don't really like it very much because it kind of obfuscates the the idea that it's electrical all these these folks nowadays NASA professional astronomers they are okay with the word magnetic that's fine they kind of pull that out of there and the bottle is so like a genie and oh if they there's something they don't notice that was most due to a magnetic field you hear ludicrous things like well there was a lump of magnetic field because that they don't still like to use the word electric although they're coming around even on that one but anyway this model that I I derive finished the derivation of it this derivation was really started by fella by the name of Lundqvist in 1950 but it was in his paper was very incomplete Oh coefficients were not evaluated and the structure those equations implied was not discussed and anyway the one of the primary properties of that model is this idea of counter rotation if you think about a steel rod then you surround it with a a pipe a hollow pipe and then surround that pipe with a bigger pipe and then yet surround that whole thing with a bigger pipe to keep on doing this for a number which I say pipes a number of radii and have each one of those pipes pick one of the pipes the the pipe above it and the pipe below it would be going in the opposite rotational direction from its rotation so that's what I mean by counter rotation sort of if anybody's familiar with counter-rotating propellers on a ship that's exactly the way the tail shafts would work but anyway that's that's what five model at least came out with is that should be counter rotation and most people in well anybody who's interested in the electric universe I think realizes that water one and a half conferences ago I presented a I thought a mind-blowing video my NASA video showing exactly that happening at the North Pole of Saturn one of the things that kind of bugs me a little bit is that astronomers are reluctantly agreeable to talking about berkland currents when it comes to the earth even there they're trying to call him some by some different names I favor an article you there what in the world is this guy talking about he's talking about a berkland current he didn't call it that I think maybe they are a little bit ashamed of the shabby treatment that berkland got from professional astronomers but anyway this is video from NASA was was just mind-blowing thing and this at this past comfort just last week's conference I was fortunate enough to find another NASA video this time of the planet Jupiter everybody's a big brother planet here and sure enough just blatantly there was these counter-rotating cylindrical I mean when you looked at them down at them like the North Pole Jupiter their circular of course please remember this we will see I'll be referring back to this picture and a man's first saw the video and actually counted or tried to count the number of these counter-rotating concentric cylinders and I got up to 15 before I ran out of steam and then when you got 15 different counter rotating cylinders that mean the pesticides really it's a lot of counter rotation and then I thought about well you know what about the earth I mean everybody knows that the berkland currents do power the Earth's Aurora is there any evidence of counter rotation there's I guess I proudly the internet and I came upon several people who had tried to video the Aurora most of them didn't know what they were looking for most everybody was looked at it says oh isn't it beautiful it's because marble is always gorgeous unlike me they were not looking necessarily for evidence of counter rotation of these hollow cylinders until I came up on one polishing fellow I guess his nice bike ethnicity his name is I think my check an ERCP and he had a fantastically high risen resolution video camera placed it on a very firm tripod and the north tip of Scotland he took these this this video and I just I just marveled at it and I if you asked my opinion does it show counter-rotation I would quickly answer you betcha especially right at the opening of that video and in the closing scenes it is undeniable in my opinion in this singularly and my one man's opinion it is obvious that there is counter-rotation going on there there's also evidence of course that they do occur and possibly at least on Neptune and Uranus not particularly so mercury for several reasons one of the what's required is to have we have the planet having a reasonable magnetic geomagnetic field by christos Jupiter has one in Spain so that's why I think of all the planets the Jupiter's most obviously on the receiving end of a berkland turn so that's where we or at least I am at this point and I conclude from that that we now have evidence that several planets have Aurora's that are likely created by berkland currents feeding electric charges into their poles the Sun's heliosphere is probably inside of an interstellar berkland current we're not sure about that yet but those as Jim Ryder said last night that that evidence coming back through ibex showing the tails on the heliosphere those tails may indeed be at least remnants of a berkland current we don't know but they are we get to the nitty-gritty we've postulated the idea I have a lot of people have that galaxies are also connected by berkland currents and seeing the evidence of counter rotation in galaxies would indeed be the next step and that's why I called this little talk this morning the next step so the question is do we see it any observation of counter-rotating bands of stars in a galaxy would be difficult for astronomers to explain reason I say that is think of it yourself are there any thermodynamic or hydrodynamic fluid dynamic causes for counter rotation there's plenty of causes of rotation there's Coriolis effect and all that sort of thing that's all in one direction but what can cause things inside of one another to rotate in opposite directions the answer is as far as I know one berkland currents if you come up with another one let me know I will make sure that I don't say that again but I think that's correct until a few years ago there was only one galaxy that's M 64 M Messier and the Messier Calend a catalog number 64 was described as exhibiting any kind of counter rotation that's what M 64 looks like and in 1992 there was an Australian astronomer who announced that they had found evidence that the area within the dust Lane of M 64 was counter-rotating from the outer spiral that was explosive a lot of people didn't believe it that was must be wrong eventually that just sort of quieted down and nobody said anything else Vera Rubin the famous astronomer I think was Harvard College Observatory I think I'm mature finally came up and said yes she saw she observed that counter rotation too and the only possible explanation astronomers had for this was a collision with another galaxy remember astronomers have not one arm tied behind their back they've got one arm and and four fingers tied behind their back they only have one tool gravity it attracts what what does when you attract pretty good you get collisions so collisions must be the cause of everything also remember that gravity does not mean inherent spin gravity means crash together nothing about gravity says it should spin as it comes in nothing so but they were sort of between a rock and a hard place and finally there was this paper in 1996 and if you look very carefully I don't know if you can see it the the authors there are fella by the name of kiken Fisher and I called Merrifield will hear mera field in a couple of slides from now talk about this and what he said if I can I think I have a quote from that paper yeah he said that he was in response to this announcement by Bromley as the Australian guy that said that this thing was counter-rotating he said that well alright the goal of the present study has been to search for the presence of counter-rotating stars no new cases of stellar counter-rotation have been found no more than approximately 5% of the disk stars in our sample galaxies are counter-rotating with 95% confidence with 95% confidence we can say that no more than 10% of galaxies contain detectable counter-rotating stellar disks galaxy mergers provide the most obvious explanation crashing together because that's the only Omega so astronomers have only one tool available to explain new observations collisions and mergers and I'm gonna show you a clip I think it's the next slide is say another video clip of Merrifield himself talking about this and I want you to listen very carefully he's he's very British and he would speak very very fast so one of the things he said a couple of things he says I think you should grab ahold of and hang your hat on number one he says that 90% of space is empty it's not 99 as Jim said last night 99 I remember 99 percent Jim said 99.99% his plasma and plasma is not empty that's the reason they laughed at berkland right I can't put that stuff across through an empty space sure he can because it's all full of plasma also he suggests that counter-rotating stars are caused by at the very end of his talk hot gas means plasma pouring into a galaxy from some unknown source and in the opposite direction from the way the galaxy is rotating all right and that's how you get the counter-rotation doesn't say where the hot gas comes from or why it should what why it should cause counter rotation of stars anyway here's the video so if you look in the disk of the Milky Way all the stars go around the same way it's kind of a one-way system everything's going around in the same direction in almost every galaxy you look at that's what you find this one is kind of unique because it's actually exactly 50/50 as half a stars going one way half the Stars going the other way we're in the Virgo cluster so the NIR is big cluster of galaxies it's one of these galaxies called a lenticular galaxy it was like a lens or an s0 galaxy so it's one of these things which has a disk which we clearly see more or less edge on which is why it's very skinny like this but doesn't have spiral arms or any other features we typically associate with the spiral galaxies the original discovery was something that Vera Rubin and her collaborators discovered in the early 1990s she was doing a big study of all the galaxies in the Virgo cluster what they were doing in their survey is they were taking things called long slit spectra so basically they were taking and putting a slit of a spectrograph along the galaxies and measuring spectra all along that slit and what you expect to find for a galaxy like this is you expect to see absorption lines due to the various chem the stars are made of but the absorption lines are all bumper shifted a bit that some of them are shifted towards the red end of the spectrum which means that those stars are moving away from you some are shifted towards the blue end of the spectrum so that means those stars are moving towards you so what you expect to see in a galaxy like that if it's an edge on disk is either rotating one way or the other so what you'd expect is all the stars on one side are red shifted and all the stars on the other side a blue shifted or vice versa depending on which way it's rotating so we can expect to find is that the dark bands for example here's one of these dark bands you'd expect it to be shifted slightly towards the blue end of the spectrum at one end and shifted slightly towards the red end of the spectrum on the other side so you'd expect to see a kind of an S shape in there and what you actually see is not these S shapes but if you look closely you can see there's one going that way there's one going that way as well so it's kind of an X shape and that means that as well as the disk rotating one way which is what gives you this signature here the disk is also rotating the other way which gives you this signature here and because those lines are kind of roughly equal strength what you can sort of infer from that is that this is a very strange disk in the half the stars are going around one way and half the stars are going around the other way the obvious first question is well don't the stars just bash into each other if they're doing that what you got bear in mind is that a galaxy is mostly empty space so again if we come back to the Milky Way for a second if you made the Sun this big then the next nearest star would be about 50 or 60 kilometers away so that means that really you've got one lot of empty space and another lot of empty space with a few stars dotted around in it the simplest idea but sort of most obvious thing to think of is well maybe the way you make a galaxy like that has these two town of contra-rotating this because you just have one normal dislike this and another normal dose like this and they just crash into each other and they end up merging to form one of these systems aware of the Stars go one way half to go the other way unfortunately that doesn't work because what you find is if you start doing simulations of crashing disks into each other these as soon as you start smashing them into each other that destroys the disk structure and actually you are not forming a thing like an elliptical galaxy so that's where we came in one of the things that's happened since their Aruban first discovered this galaxy is that we've got much better at actually analyzing the properties of spectra and in particular we can look at the strength of different absorption lines in spectra and use that to figure things out about the properties of the stars that that populate maydel so that's what we did we took some more very very deep spectra of this particular galaxy and what we found is that the absorption lines in one still a population are different from the absorption lines or the stars going around the other way and in particular those hydrogen lines are much stronger in one of the disks than they are in the other from which we can infer that that disk has to be much younger than the stars are going around the other way what we were able to show is that actually the dew populations have to be different one of them is younger than the other and that's exactly what you'd expect if an old disc formed and then gas started flowing in orbiting the other direction which would then form a second generation of stars which would seem younger than the stars that were already there so probably the likely scenario here is this was a disc galaxies that formed formed with a whole bunch of stars all orbiting around one way that's a little bit of gas left over from the stars that are orbiting that way later in its life gas thought is flowing in in the other directions are rotating around the other direction the first thing that happens is that any gas that's coming around this way will bash into gas that's going around the other way because gas unlike stars is very collisional so actually it'll smack into it that'll all fall into the middle what you know sort of sweep up what guess there wasn't leftover from the first generation then if you keep feeding in gas in that direction you'll form a new disk of gas which is rotating in the opposite directions of the stars and then over time that new disk of gas will start forming stars of its own and eventually it'll use up all the gas and form a second stellar disc that rotates in the opposite direction I think probably the reason why this was the first one that was discovered is that when you do end up with exactly half the stars going either way it's very easy to find if it were only like 10% you might not notice so actually you could have you know all the stars and you'd analyze it and you wouldn't notice the fact that there's a small fraction that seemed to be going around the other way if the disks were very different sizes so if there were a tiny little disk in the middle going around one way and most of the stars going the other way you might not notice that either so probably you know this was the first one that was discovered because it's the most blatant example subsequently we now know there's probably at least half a dozen other galaxies where there's at least some stars going around one way and some going around the other way so it's not a unique system it does happen from time to time but of course that's half a dozen now are the many what tens of thousands of galaxies are those kind of sizes that we know about so it clearly whatever the process is that makes this happen that's very unusual it's not the common way of making the galaxy wrong it's probably the way most galaxies are made and the fact that he hasn't found any is probably indicative of the fact that he hasn't really looked very hard so if you don't want to see something you probably aren't going to expend a lot of time or effort looking for it and it's very difficult to explain this stuff you notice he didn't say well this hot gas was coming from and the idea that no the space and gal inter-galactic space is is empty it's wrong it's just plain wrong they also the idea that the hydrogen he's quite good inspector octopus I mean he the idea that he found that the hydrogen was on the outside of that that's galaxies hydrogen rich stars is probably correct but for anybody who's looked at the work of Guren Markland there's a thing called Markland convection Markland is a Swedish engineer scientists physicists I guess and he studied this and discovered that in berkland currents that the elements will distribute themselves radially in proportion to their ionization potential so sort of I guess to some people at least anti intuitively counter intuitively it sounded thing what we find is that iron and carbon find themselves at the middle of the galaxies of the berkland current and if the berkland card is feeding the galaxies would be at the center of the galaxy and the farther out you get I have a list of them here's some place the the oh yeah the list is iron sulfur carbon nitrogen oxygen helium hydrogen and those last two are very difficult believe it or not to ionize I guess because they have very few electrons to ionize but it's easy to ionize iron and so you find iron at the center of this thing so his discovery that there is indeed hydrogen-rich a band of hydrogen-rich stars on the outer edge is again confirmation that this thing is a berkland current because Markland predicted and saw that hydrogen goes to the outside it has nothing to do with the age of the stars the reason he says there young stars and that formed last that's the stoppers I think in correct stellar model there's nothing that says that a hydrogen rich star has to be younger than a carbon-rich star so it's it was it was kind of interesting I thought that he's of course his explanation of this stuff but when we tried it it doesn't work so the only thing left is gas comes from someplace the little green people come and pour it in and but they really have no explanation for this it's kind of like what Jim said last night here is that I'd like you to make sure you understand what what's going on here let's see if I can if I can do this yeah what everyone got the wrong thing I just wanted well I'm playing around with this I shouldn't the the the the X shape that you see there the star grouping that's in magenta or purple is if you notice very carefully what you what we got plotted here the upper half of that plot is where the light is longer wavelength this is the wavelength is is vertical and it's flooded if you can read it it says velocity in kilometers per second so they're they're saying that the redshift is proportional to velocity that doesn't that doesn't contradict Halton ARP at all ARP is perfectly willing to say that redshift can be caused by recessional velocity it's not the only way to form redshift but it is one of the ways so they're right in this case and so they on the upper left corner of that picture what you are our redshifted and the higher up you go the more redshifted stars each star is a point on that diagram and so and then you look over and they on the right side you see oh yeah but there's another bunch of guys out there that are blue-shifted and so I'm sorry yeah that the other ones are also red shifted and they're on the other side of the galaxy and therefore they're going away and these guys are going away from you and then when you come down through the middle the middle is when you're looking at the center of the galaxy and stars are just going this way or that way and they're not coming forward toward you were away from you so there's no redshift and as you get to the bottom of the diagram you can see that they're ours that's blue shift the the wavelength is less the velocity and the recessional velocity is is less so what it's notice one another thing on the on the compare the purple curve at the upper left to the black curve at the upper right and you notice that the purple curve extends farther it is it has a higher redshift than the other one then the black woman at the upper right hand corner and it doesn't the it extends farther out that he the distance east to the north distance so it goes faster and it's farther out so that shows yes that the outer ring of that galaxy is the one that's plotted in purple do you follow me and the bottom diagram is just dispersion of the data but anyway see if I can continue on that's what I just said so Muirfield explanation of this was right on spot-on he knows what he's talking about when it comes to spectroscopy it just he doesn't really analyze it I think well this is and any who have seen me talk here before that's a typical diagram that I always put up what a berkland current looks like and you can see the counter rotation and the the shading the salmon color very dense in the middle and the outer the middle ring is a little less denser than the outer ring it's even less dense it indicates that there is there's collection of matter at various discreet radius values and what the the rest of this going here the slide shows is that if you analyze this in in great detail you will find that it it is very probable to see in a situation like this something that looks like spirals spiraling inward not just going around but spiraling inward I submit those are almost optical illusions those spirals exist the shape exists but if you notice the little tiny black arrows that form those spirals some of the stuff is going in one direction and some of the matter is going in the opposite direction so those spirals are not spiraling in there they're like tattoos if you will on them on the face of the galaxy well that's not a very important point but it's a it's a point ok I'm gonna go I think fairly rapidly through the next few slides these are all galaxies which have been reported as showing counter-rotation NGC 3628 contains a band of gas plasma that counter rotates with respect to the Stars and it looks just I think like a berkland current but it it is perhaps caused by a berkland cart it's another 130 608 the maximum rotation velocity of the inner core was low but it's going the opposite direction from the outer parts of this of the group of the galaxy here's another one 57:19 so we've discovered in the last I think about 15 years about seven of these seconds seven or eight of them which are proven measured counter rotational galaxies oh well here's the previous one I think it was reported that only way the excuse was that for 57:19 which is this one it's the galaxy on the left of course it has been disturbed perturbed by its neighboring galaxies 57:13 that's the one on the right now I submit to you that that's a stretch those galaxies are light-years apart they're not the same kind of galaxies and they're not in the same plane of rotation such that one can be going one way when the one is this way and one is this way it's very unlikely that those two guys are in communication with each other except maybe a berkland current that might twist through there but one is not I don't say it's it's a tough sales pitch to tell me that this guy is affecting that guy directly and causing stars to go backwards in the other galaxies I just don't believe it another one was reported have counter-rotating rings of both plasma and stars I see 719 3595 again all of these are definitely measured counter-rotation galaxies 4550 well that's the one that you can see those vary if you look carefully you can see some of those things that look like spirals the dark lanes I don't think those are really indicative of motion I think you're indicative of a structure that's inherent in the berkland current that's formed this um another thing to keep in mind I don't know whether I have a slide on it or not but who says that berkland currents can't yeah this is the one that Muirfield talked about who says that berkland currents can't get weaker with age they can and so perhaps if you think of blong the lines of what Halton Arps it how these things are ejected from mother galaxies as they age they may mature their umbilical cords make because that's a sort of gross way to put it but that's what a berkland current is probably like to a galaxy and here's a I think a beautiful shot this was taken by an acquaintance of mine I wouldn't say a friend but acquaintance said that about lemon Observatory in Tucson in Oro Valley if you look at this thing it's almost unmistakably the shape of a berkland current it has contains several different rings and there counter-rotating yes by Adam and a blog if you just keep your eyes on that picture and compare it with the picture of a berkland current that tony peratt gave me we superimpose the two what do you think so it's I think it's fairly certainly what we're looking at here is a shape at least of a berkland current I just want to make sure I say everything that I want to say yep yeah what about it yeah well anyway many galaxies have been shown to contain the counter-rotating stars many don't this is what I was leading up to before that they the berkland currents can change with time and therefore these structures can change with time but of course over millennial time over astronomical time and as I say it's even easier not to look for something you don't want to find so anyway closer to home sort of along the lines of what Gerry was talking about last night we consider the idea of a hurricane now I've long laughed at the fact you probably saw me chuckle and howl at the NASA description of that Saturn hurricane the counter rotation at the top of Saturn is North Pole a hurricane at the North Pole you got to be kidding hurricanes eat hot air from warm water that's the reason that when hurricanes come ashore they fall apart so that's not a hurricane I said also it's locked in position at the North Pole of Saturn we know that hurricanes move around like crazy so there's a couple of reasons for not calling that a hurt hurricane but mainstream science claims that hurricanes rotate because of the Coriolis effect you know you take two guys on a on a merry-go-round and one has a basketball and he throws it directly at the other guy but by the time the basketball gets there the other guy has moved and can't catch the ball if you're a if you're a marksman and you want to shoot at the enemy airplane or something you lead it you don't shoot it where the enemy is you shoot it where he's gonna be when the bullet gets there that's the Coriolis effect but the mechanism cannot produce counter rotation even if Coriolis is the reason that hurricanes rotate on earth it the Coriolis cannot produce counter rotation and that's all right because hurricanes on earth don't show counter rotation or do they I got really shocked when I saw the next slide this is a hurricane I should know the name of this it perhaps it's on the slide but it's a fairly recent one there's in the foreground as the coast of South America and this is a slice taken through the hurricane and what you will notice is when I start this up this is a video is that the inner regions of the hurricane go the way we normally think hurricanes in the northern hemisphere do they rotate anti-clockwise counterclockwise the famous northeasters on the coast of Maine always come in from the Northeast because they're rotating around storms that are coming up the coast and those are counter clockwise rotations but if you look at the outer regions like out here and out here when this thing starts this middle guy is going to be going around counterclockwise but if you look out here all of a sudden you realize these guys are moving clockwise see the clockwise movement here and out here it'll happen again when it gets closer they take another shot of it closer to the United States it can you notice these clouds sweeping up that may be the end of it I'm not sure no one more okay if there's plenty of kind of rotation in downand is in this right hand area anyway that's not it set me back kinda edgy they do kind of rotate and then I set back with a glass of wine and said does that mean the astronomers are right hell no it means that this hurricane may be fed electrically as well as by hot air from the ocean below and it may well be that a small berkland like current is coming down on the top of this storm forming that shape we know that electrical currents from space power thunderstorms the famous elves and sprites and when is it blue nuns or something and what they clearly there's a circuit that comes right down from space through into thunderstorms that power those and give those thunderstorms the electric charge that Jerry was talking about last night so red sprites recently photographed into a thunderstorm and so maybe this guy who said it was a hurricane and Saturn's North Pole was correct but he didn't know how hurricanes work that hurricane has made strictly from there's no hot ocean at Saturn's North Pole believe me but he didn't know where that hurricane was getting his power or its form anyway tornadoes often exhibit that sort of concentric cylinder look and I was talking to somebody yesterday who said that they knew a friend I think who had looked at one of these guys straight up the barrel and did indeed see counter-rotation and a light in the middle of it the light of course being probably electrical like lightning the main blast of current coming down the middle of it and if I would give my eyes teeth to come to get that thing to be a video if it turns out to be you know in counter-rotation then I would be very happy by the way one way when we saw that picture of the North Pole of Jupiter and there were 15 of these things counter-rotating that can be and certainly is the way of berkland current works but it can be the explanation for what puzzles Merrifield as to why these guys don't hit into each other it's because there are in the case of Jupiter 15 separate concentric racetracks and the runners are going in opposite directions on each one of these tracks so the stars are not colliding unless you get some guide like happens here in Arizona go the wrong way in the wrong direction on highway if if they stake in their right lanes there can be all sorts of indoor reaction of counter rotation and with no collisions at all oh by the way another one thing he said which is wrong all plasmas are collisional no that's right right the the corona of the Sun is not the collisional plasma okay here's a picture the fellow I felt my name last name is Gould are you here in the audience tonight this morning he dedicated he you type and eats wrote me an email and said Don there's a website called null school dotnet and he learned about it from Ben Davidson and it's it's a I think it's an excellent site and it shows counter rotation you can look here at the course the South Pole of the earth and you can see the counter rotation that's going on notice it's moving very slowly but what you're looking at are the ocean currents and so the if I can see you here the that's that's the equator goes around there and so all of this stuff inside here is in the southern hemisphere anything outside of that line is northern hemisphere but there's a tremendous amount of counter rotation where does it come from well I know it's not Coriolis this Coriolis can't do that so here's a again this is a little video of that null school net site and you can see again there's those are the ocean currents they're not it's not so obviously counter rotation at that point but if you go if you go down to the lower left like this is a video I can't do it in life you get this control and the height there's a 10 hecto Pascal's I hectopascal it's like a millibar I think so if you go way up in the atmosphere way high up see any counter rotation you betcha and there's also well see in a second there is a diatom instability there just off the south tip of tasmania and one of those if you go down deeper into the atmosphere the circularity begins to lose its beautiful symmetry and it begins to get crunched and smooshed and in fact you go down deeper and deeper and the land masses begin to interrupt those those flows which tells me one thing the counter rotation the beautiful circularity comes from outside not inside the earth there's nothing to do with stuff going around inside the this molten center of the earth or whatever's there empty service or whatever's in there the circularity I maintain points when you get down on the surface it's almost impossible to see anything and it doesn't move very much but if again if you go out to that 10 Mille bar height there's what you see and you under feeding and you see the this a little see that good thing right that's as Tasmania off the south coast of Australia and right there there's a counterclockwise flow it's sort of it's a daikatana instability between this clockwise and this counterclockwise flow anyway that's the evidence that I have at this point and I think I'm confident that if astronomers are willing to look for more counter rotation in galaxies they will find it let's see if this observation of counter rotation is two more bricks in the wall of evidence and scientists who claim that electricity doesn't do anything will live to eat their words perhaps some of you know this fellow and he was here and this is what he said yes yes we know there's electricity in space but it doesn't do anything [Applause] [Music] [Music] you [Music] 
extraordinary ideas have driven the greatest advances in science and in human knowledge the electric universe is the gateway to the science of future in order to progress we need to think the unthinkable in the history of scientific ideas there is a pattern of how new ideas merge but if we can overcome our self-importance we are poised now to understand the Earth's electrical environment in a way that will relate to the park to the hole we are exploring a world of new meaning and that is very exciting discovery by discovery one surprise at a time all of science is coming into the electric universe 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info Where did asteroids come from? For decades, in the standard story of our solar system, we have been told that asteroids, as well as comets and meteoroids, are the so-called leftovers of the early solar system. In this view, comets and even asteroids have been proposed as a possible source of our planet's oceans. Of course, when spacecraft have visited comets they've not found anything like the dirty snowballs of conventional theory. In this conclusion to his three-part presentation, physicist Eugene Bagashov explores the latest scientific papers into the evidence for the water of the asteroids Bennu and Ryugu, respectively, and what it means for an understanding of the solar system's history and origins. Spectral data from both Ryugu and Bennu seems pretty similar. One of the prominent features of spectra of these bodies is the high absorption at the infrared wavelength of about 2.7 microns, and the researchers acknowledge that it must be associated with the OH- groups in the minerals on the surface. However, their idea of how it got there is pretty peculiar. They think that it's the remnants of the water that formed in the inner belt together with the parent asteroids of Bennu and Ryugu and later was evaporated when they migrated into the inner solar system. Now of course, we are well aware of another process which is considered to be fundamental for the electric comet hypothesis, the idea that hydroxyl groups and water itself might be formed due to the electrochemical interaction between the protons from the solar wind and oxygen in the minerals on the surface of an airless body, such as a comet or an asteroid. A few years ago, this process has been confirmed in the laboratory experiments that were simulating the interaction of the solar wind with silicates. For more details, I'd recommend watching Thunderbolts Project documentary The Electric Comet and brilliant Franklin Anariba's talks available at the Thunderbolts Project YouTube channel. So in principle, the detection of OH signal should be considered trivial and not really indicative of anything in the EU perspective. These bodies might have been formed anywhere, including the inner solar system itself, and still demonstrate the same spectral absorption line. Nevertheless, with regards to that, even in research papers the scientists from both teams keep repeating the mantra that it was the asteroids and comets that brought water to the Earth whereas it is already known that there is at least as much water in the mantle as on the surface of our planet. How would Ryugu and Bennu keep any significant amount of water ice anyway if the temperatures on their surface are higher than the sublimation limit for water? It's probably important to emphasize here that what Hayabusa2 and Osiris-Rex are observing is only structural OH- groups, not the water itself. Even more so, they have to go quite a long way to somehow get rid of the water in their scenario. In particular, Hayabusa2 scientists have to imply a significant radioactive heating of the parent body of Ryugu asteroid in order to heat it up enough to produce the water-poor minerals that are observed on its surface. And on top of that, they have to imply impact scenario as they note that in order to produce the observed spectrum of Ryugu, a short-term catastrophic heating is also needed. But at the same time, they note that impacts would heat only a part of the surface, so they need a lot of them. So maybe in this case a single short-term electrical heating would be more appropriate. Otherwise, the spectra of both Bennu and Ryugu are more or less consistent with the high abundance of phyllosilicates, that is essentially sedimentary rock. Now, how would sedimentary rock end up on a tiny asteroid otherwise than as a result of its ejection from a much larger planet, is a good question that we should address to the Astrophysical community. Moreover, the present data from Osiris-Rex shows that the specific spectral feature of magnesium-rich Phyllosilicates at 16 micrometers is not observed, from which the researchers conclude that the minerals should be iron-rich instead and that's not all there is. "... spectra of Bennu also exhibit two features at 555 and 340 cm^(-1) that are probably attributable, at least in part, to magnetite." In my opinion, this is a potential indication that this asteroid was once part of a larger planet such as Mars, although I wouldn't discount Venus and Earth or Moon and Mercury, too. In previous decades, there has been some debate regarding possible formation of nano crystals of magnetite in Martian meteorites due to the influence of hypothetical bacterial life, though the shapes of crystals don't seem to match the ones produced by bacteria on Earth. I think it would be very funny if the samples collected at Ryugu and Bennu would show these biogenic crystals of magnetite instead, proving that these rocks originate from Earth. But that is only one of many possibilities, of course. Most likely the minerals would be transformed too much during their excavation process anyway. Last thing I wish to mention with regards to the spectrum of these objects is that it demonstrates reddening at large phase angles, that is when the detector is placed far away from the line connecting the Sun and the asteroid. At the moment, scientists cannot explain this peculiar property, but perhaps it is caused by a much higher degree of ordering of the material on the surface, which would be consistent with the scenario of their excavation under the influence of extremely strong electric fields but probably pretty hard to explain from a rubble pile standpoint. Speaking of the electric comet ideas, a recent press release by NASA states that some unexpected dust particles were observed near the asteroid Bennu. Now, I would envision two scenarios here. First of all, those might be some sort of electrostatic dust fountains that are produced due to the potential difference across the surface of the asteroid. It is well known and acknowledged that the dayside of such objects should be charged positively with respect to the nightside. There are two primary causes of that effect. Firstly, the photo ionization of the surface on the dayside makes it more positively charged and secondly, the solar wind is blocked by the asteroid itself, so that it's night side is experiencing a plasma shadowing, so to speak, and the solar wind protons cannot expand into this shadowed region as quickly as electrons, so together this might cause potential differences of the order of a few hundred volts between the day side and the night side. But of course, so more localized potential differences on the surface are also possible due to some topographic features, different elemental composition and albedo across the surface, its potential local magnetization, and so on. It's interesting that the researchers themselves note some peculiar reflectance differences across the surface of both asteroids and they also note that it might be produced through some process of dust transfer, the nature of which "remains unclear". However, to be completely fair, the gravity on these asteroids it's so weak that according to the researchers, at least on Bennu, "...material can achieve orbit through downslope migration." So dust particles might just be rolling downhill and end up in space. That is if we assume that no other forces are acting upon this dust, which is obviously not the case. But anyway, the second scenario I would envision is, that these are not dust particles in the first place. Unfortunately I don't know all the details of this detection, as the only information we have on it is basically one paragraph from NASA press release. So perhaps the option I'd like to propose might be ruled out, but from the publicly available data it still seems to be a viable option. So I'd propose that these bright dots that we see on the NavCam images might actually be just charged particles emanating from the vicinity of Bennu, and picked up by the camera. What exactly these particles are, ions or electrons, or maybe even photons, is not clear yet but any of these, as far as I understand, could trigger the camera matrix pixels. And it is clear, I think, that in this case, whatever they are, their production should be caused by some electromagnetic interaction of the solar wind plasma, or maybe the cosmic rays with the asteroid. Continuing this topic, it's quite a shame that both Hayabusa2 and Osiris-Rex are very poorly equipped to study the really important properties of Ryugu and Bennu, that is their interaction with space plasma. It might sound ridiculous, but none of these spacecraft have Langmuir probes, plasma wave suits of instruments, or any detectors of charged particles whatsoever. The only thing we have in this department, is the magnetometer on Mascot lander that spent some 17 hours on Ryugu in early October of 2018 and then died when its batteries ran out. Well, hopefully we'll see some data from it eventually, as so far I've seen none. I suspect that the instrument might show some remnant magnetization of Ryugu, as if it represents a piece of planetary crust it should bear some imprint of its magnetic field. But also, if it was excavated electrically, the currents running through and around it would also generate some fields that might be retained in the asteroidal rock. Perhaps this magnetometer might register some other interesting effects, for example the changing magnetic fields during the progression of day and night cycle, as the surface of the asteroid charges and recharges positively and negatively, or the variation of the magnetic field due to the interaction of the asteroid with the solar wind plasma. There is a slight hope that Rex's X-ray spectrometer on board of Osiris-Rex at some point might detect soft X-rays resulting from Bennu's interaction with the solar wind. The hope is only slight, because the lowest value of energy it might detect is 700 electron volts which might be a bit too high, as for example Rosetta mission has shown that the negative electric potential of Comet 67P nucleus with respect to the ambient solar wind is only about 200 to 400 volts, and only about 200 volts of potential difference were detected by Cassini spacecraft at the Saturnian moon Hyperion, and Pluto emits X-rays charge exchange with the solar wind at only 300 to 600 volts of potential difference. Summing it all up, I would say that the data that has been released so far does not contradict the scenario under which the asteroids Bennu and Ryugu represent a relatively homogeneous, internally strong but highly porous rocks that have been electrically excavated from the surface of one of the bodies in the inner solar system during a relatively recent planetary catastrophe. Their complex surfaces indicate that most likely this material does not originate from the asteroid belt. However, as I've noted in the very beginning, the so-called rubble pile scenario also does not directly contradict the Electric Universe paradigm. But, my personal opinion is that these bodies are most likely internally homogeneous and strong. As the instrumentation onboard of both Hayabusa2 and Osiris-Rex spacecraft is very limited in terms of studying the plasma environments of Ryugu and Bennu, we're left with only observations of secondary evidence for their electrical activity, like these dust particles or whatever they are, that were spotted in the vicinity of Bennu. But hopefully, we'll be able to draw at least some conclusions from these missions. It would be especially interesting to see the results of the analysis of collected samples when they would return to Earth, but that is still quite a long time away. 
EU 2017 Future Science Phoenix 17-20 August What Can Matter Be? Peter Modell Good morning to all! This is really a special opportunity and a privilege to be able to learn and share learnings here at EU 2017, and I'm coming in deep gratitude to all those at Thunderbolts who made this possible. My lifelong passion for astronomy found its reward a few years ago when I discovered the Electric Universe and The Thunderbolts Project and I count myself very very lucky. This talk's aim is to answer the question 'what can matter be' but not too quickly. In the speeded up times of ours, we are quick to give solutions, questions, trigger responses, usually from what we know already. And quite often our blogs turn into pillow fights where we're tossing opinions back and forth. In contrast to this, resting with unknowns without immediately reaching for solutions has a completely different effect. It tends to bring out hidden lines of reasoning that have their source in intuition. Contradictory facts can be resting places where we take our bearings before moving forward, and that's important in what follows. A familiar example to us, of contradictions of course, is the dinosaurs. On one hand, it's obvious that they existed on the Earth. On the other hand, biology and physics shows that it couldn't have been like we imagined. The, for instance, their frail bone structure couldn't have held such a massive body. And do we take the empiricist's stand and say well, they existed, and go on and make dinosaur movies? Or do we hold to the contradiction and allow for a solution to emerge in its time, as it has in the case of the Electric Universe. You know the story well. With reduced gravity on the Earth, life forms grew to different proportions than today. Reduced gravity means reduced mass and mass is a variable that depends on (the) electric environment. So it was possible that the mass of the Earth was much lower, while the matter remained the same. Now, the hard problem is understanding what is mass, and we have an elegant response to that, as described by Wal Thornhill. The easy problem, what is matter, is left for us to ponder on. But is it easy? What are the characteristics of matter? It seems so evident it shouldn't be a problem. By matter, we refer to objects we encounter with our physical bodies that is, our physical senses. On the scale of the macro world, matter is what we bump into. And why the bump -- because material objects occupy certain space at a certain time and this implies that matter subsumes space and time. Another fact we associate with matter is unequivocal, present. It's either there or it's not there, there's no in-between. If you want the piano to go in the corner, well, the pot with the ficus tree has to go elsewhere. This model of reality works well in our macro world and it works too for cells under the microscope. But shift down to the scale of the atom within the subatomic, and the model doesn't apply. For one on this scale, objects apparently don't touch. They, or the particles, have an electric field and this is equivalent to having a distended body which is less present at the distance from the center. It's not necessary for me to describe this world, you know it well, but to accommodate the subatomic world, do we need to construct a separate different model of reality? Probably not, and why not? The incongruence between the two worlds results from not taking into account the description of perception. Our first step should be to grasp how perception gives rise to the world we know. To make my point, here's an anecdote. Once a group of specialists came before God and said, you're not needed anymore, we know how to make matter, how to create life now. And God, ever accommodating said, certainly, you just show me that you can make life and I'll graciously leave. Well, the experts bent down, took up a handful of dirt and started, and proceeded to make life. Wait a minute, said God, that's mine! You take your own dirt! Our search for matter begins not with a description of the already present objective world, but prior to this, at the pre-conceptual state. And to go there seems all but impossible, but we can give it a try. Here's an experience for you to test right now in your mind. Imagine you get a whiff of a magnificent, strange, beautiful scent and this fragrance, you don't know what it is and where it's from, just stay with the experience. Fully absorbed by the experience, it's possible to lose the sense of self and other and just be the mysterious feeling that arises with the fragrance. That suspended state then gets broken, the moment the conscious mind enters and forms concepts. At that moment, Nirvana's lost and you say hmm, I smell something special. The encounter between our body senses and whatever is, does not create the world. There's no perceived object and no perceiving subject until the mind steps in and formulates the experience in this way. So we can define the process of perception in three stages. One stage is the precognitive of which we can say nothing, then comes the out-of-conscious moment, where there's an integration of multiple elements which lead to the third stage, the object of perception and awakening of consciousness. To understand the middle set, the moment of integration, is crucial and was the subject of The Thundebolts video that introduced this talk. I give two further examples now. Looking at a mountainside, diverse features catch our attention. Rocks, cliffs, glaciers, streams... However, all these individual items exit from a conscious mind for the split-second that the global understanding ‘mountain' arises. A hidden act of integration brings together features that fuse to produce the recognition -- mountain. And in addition to this, there are personal features, attitudes, experiences, knowledges and feelings, that also enter that moment of integration and influence the impact and meaning that the sense 'Mountain' has to us. And there's more than this in that, in the moment of integration. For example, light intensity is variable. The brightness we observe of any one area in the field depends on the surrounding areas. In order for the image we see to form, a scale of intensities of luminosity has to be established for the whole scene. Various processes such as this take place in that split-second before the image forms. It's amazing, isn't it? The second example, I'd like to take a set of depth vision, something that's commonly explained as a, when you take the parallax difference between the views of the two eyes, you can calculate the distance of an object. But this is not at all the experience of depth vision, which is a way of being in the world and a way of connecting with our surroundings. You know well, when an image passes from two dimensions to three dimensional, it can give a kind of a jolt and quite often there's a kind, it is an experience of elation that comes with that change. Calculation with an algorithm is a sequenced process and will not explain the simultaneity of presence. By holding steadfast to the contradiction that arises between the two views when they are superimposed, each element in the field vies for its place in a coherent single unified view, and resolution comes with the third dimension or with depth vision. And without this, would we imagine a three-dimensional world and without the sense of volume, could we imagine physical objects? We couldn't. Now we've got a conundrum. On one hand, we personally enact the process of integration that generates the objects we perceive. On the other hand, if we're not there, then what? Shouldn't things disappear? Here's the response of a baffled philosophy student. There once was a man who said, God must think it exceedingly odd if he finds that the tree continues to be when there's no one about in the quad. Dear sir, your astonishment's odd. I'm always about in the quad and that's why the tree will continue to be observed by, yours faithfully, God. Yes yes, we're caught in a contradiction! Do we take the empiricist's position and say well, the world obviously exists, ignore the contradiction and go on, or do we ignore the physical side of the contradiction and come up with a glibly claim that all is non-material spirit? An answer will come in its time, we just need the steadfast determination to hold the contradiction without jumping to conclusions as this limerick rhyme did. Let's linger a little bit with that moment of integration. I choose to emphasize just three points. Firstly, an empty center. Objects we perceive have no central something that makes them what they are. They are not built lego-like from component parts. Instead, they arise out of the communion between multiple features that, in a timeless moment, integrate. That's the empty center. Second point, timelessness. The integration is achieved through a simultaneous interchange between all that gives meaning and form to the perceived object. It is the simultaneous interrelationship of many, that forms unity. The third point, non-conscious. The integration happens in an out-of-consciousness moment. It's achieved through the activity of the non- conscious mind, what I call the expanded mind. Alright, here we can arrive at the first conclusion about materiality. This integration forms everything we perceive. It requires an act of mind to form an object. Realizing this fact bursts the mind-matter duality and signifies the counterintuitive conclusion that matter, as we know it, is a product of mind. How strange this may seem at first. Matter is born in the mind, can it be so? If physical objects are merely concepts formed in the mind, this raises a very serious question. Would you trust the chair you're sitting on to all your weight, huh? Despite the fact that you are sitting on the chair, it is a mind object. Contradiction? No, not if we unravel it carefully. Physical experience, as we noted, is the unthinkable exchange between body and all that is. We had the example of fragrance and now the example of material objects, there's no difference. The pre-conceptual ongoing experience that's neither subjective nor objective, is inaccessible to the conscious mind. Then in steps the mind, breaks the hallowed state and codifies it into chair, body, sitting. The conscious mind knows only that which becomes codified in two objects. Sitting on a chair is the mind's formulation of a physical encounter. We have absolutely no knowledge of what that encounter consisted of. We only know what it is after applying the codification system we habitually use, that matches our present understanding. Now let's go to the question 'what can matter be'. Is the question 'what is matter made of' or is it 'how do we recognize matter, what is it'? We'll look at these two questions separately. Firstly, 'what is it made of'. The moment we ask of some object 'what is it made of', we've abandoned that object and we're looking for the matter that fills it and not what it is itself. The matter of a mountain is being a mountain. To look for matter on the inside, regresses to the ever more minute till soon we're asking what's the matter of subatomic particles. Here, below the threshold of the periodic table of elements, what kind of matter do we expect? Some cosmic dust? And then we finally realize we've gone astray. Because we're actually looking for something to fill the object that's a concept we created in the mind. The question we meant to ask then is, what makes matter what it is? Or simply, how do we recognize matter? But this detour through the wrong question bears its fruit, if I'm not mistaken there's a restatement here of Goedel's incompleteness theorem, though in a different form. Can we really build an integral whole from within by assembling component parts? It's impossible. The complement of this, of course, is how through integration we build a whole from without. So back to the question how do we recognize matter, whether matter in general or the subset of matter we know as physical matter. Let's keep in mind what was already shown. Matter is what the mind creates when it breaks off a piece of the continuing experience, the continuing flux of experience, and allows it to form a self-contained unit. It then has otherness or what we know as objectivity. To be called matter, an item has to have an identity. It's recognized as some thing. For example, oh dear what can the matter be, Johnny's so long at the fair. The matter is the whole problem that the distressed young Irish lass has formed in her mind. And she's surely right, Dublin's Donnybrook Fair was infamous. But for us, 'matter' is the fact that something takes form as a separate entity and becomes an object of attention. Physical matter is when the object related to our experience, the experience of our physical senses, is recognized as present in the three-dimensional world. Physical matter can be auditory, visual, tactile or strange fragrance. Matter is not a particular substance. It's a particular, yes, a particular anything. A particular particle, for example, or a mountain. Now, this came rather subtlety and among you there may be those who want to say, but nothing has been answered! Not so, there is an answer. Matter is anything that has an identity. Thoughts and concepts are mind matter attributed to the mind only. Material objects are attributed to the physical world we experience through our bodies. So far it's in perfect accord with our intuitive understanding, the only difference and this makes all the difference, is that the material object we recognize is empty inside because it's formed from without through a process of integration. Here we could come back to the idea of a, the model of reality on the macro scale and on the subatomic scale using the same model. I just touched very quickly on a couple, on three points. One is the empty center of all objects, as we noted. Maybe the same is true of on the subatomic scale and an electric field generates the impression of a central object. The Boscovic atom was an early proposition in this direction. Second point, the timeless moment of integration, in which everything interrelates simultaneously. Could the same immediate connection be true in phenomena we observe in the universe on all scales? Gravity's connection tends to be immediate and is probably just one example of such immediate connection. The third point goes a little further. It's the tendency of the mind to produce independent units, concepts, objects, and this is something that is not just the mind but we observe throughout nature, both animate and inanimate, in the formation of cells, crystals and more, and of course the plasma. Is the mind responding to a universal tendency that is present in nature? This thought then gives answers to diverse questions. For instance, if the subatomic particles are substanceless, then what holds charge to a position in space? Well, fields on their own tend to form separate units. Or another question, how does the tree continue to be in the quad when there's no intelligent observer? The answer -- both mind matter and physical matter participate in the same proactive movement that creates independent intelligent units. And with this realization, dualism vanishes. In less than a minute, I'll give a recapitulation of the main theme. So what is matter -- it's anything that's gone through the process of integration to become a particular thing. Sense organs don't know an object is present, for that we need the intervention of mind. A good example is warmth. You feel warm but you have no concept of any thing and no sense of it being other. Warmth can just be an experience until, in our mind, we form the concept, warmth, then we can talk about it and then it becomes the matter of our discussion. There's no more substance to matter, or should I say, there's no more substance to the matter of a mountain than to warmth. All objects are equally real: matter, love, warmth, beauty... Of course, we differentiate what we encounter with our body senses as physical matter but 'the matter' part is not substance, but the fact that it formed a self-contained unit. It could be our cultural heritage, with its emphasis on objectivity, makes telling this tale more difficult. And finally, all these observations come to broaden the dialogue between scientist and philosopher, the one in search of facts, the other in search of meaning. Do they contradict? Probably, the two aspirations arrive mostly in the same person, the philosophical scientist or the scientific philosopher. In holding with steadfast determination to the contrasting views, we allow for a deeper understanding to emerge. Maybe we did that a little here, I hope so. Thank you for your participation! 
Well, what is that strange extraterrestrial-looking figure, rising above the horizon of Easter Island? It's actually an electric discharge formation. It was pointed out to me by  Tony Peratt, about 12 to 13 years ago, when he was one of the most distinguished plasma scientists on the planet. And when people come to The Thunderbolts channel on YouTube, sometimes they're looking for information on aliens and UFOs and so on. And they hit upon “Symbols of an Alien Sky” and they get something much different. All right. So, to pose the question, ”Has our sky changed completely in the last few thousand years?” We're addicted to projecting our sky on the past, but the truth of the matter is that the sky has changed dramatically, and these changes had a huge impact on the early cultures. And this is a testable claim. The formation seen in the ancient sky can actually be reconstructed by a systematic use of a protocol. A protocol for extracting reliable conclusions from global witnesses, despite the fact that the witnesses, individually and locally, are not reliable. This has to do with the convergence of global testimony on highly unique details, where the convergence would not be possible in the absence of an extraordinary globally witnessed provocation. So, I hope everyone can kind of come to grips with the inherent logic of a historical detective adventure, where patterns lead you into an entirely new world of ancient experience. It happened just a few thousand years ago, when we lived in the presence of the gods. Planetary powers ruled the celestial theater in the lost age of gods and wonders. [Music] Planets gathered in close congregation as if alive, engaging each other electrically. [Music] But then the gods grew violent and they went to war, driving human witnesses to take shelter in caves and rocky enclosures. [Music] Humans left to remember. To remember the powers of the gods. Formations and cosmic events not to be forgotten. Well, I have to take you back to the inspiration for a life's work that came to me from Immanuel Velikovsky and his book “Worlds In Collision” published in 1950. In 1972, I began publishing a series on Velikovsky. It culminated in ten issues that achieved a great deal of scientific interest around the world. And it was the number one best seller on more than one college campus. And this series on “Immanuel Velikovsky Reconsidered” led directly to a confrontation between Velikovsky and Carl Sagan in 1974, in February, in San Francisco. And this taught me a lot about the power of institutions to frame narratives. “The question that science forgot to ask” was never addressed. And that question is, “Have planets always moved on their present courses?” Now, Velikovsky has the centerpiece of his presentation in “Worlds and collision.” He said, the planet Venus appeared in the ancient sky to people around the world, as an earth-threatening comet. What a preposterous idea. But he didn't pull that out of thin air. He based that on global testimony that identified Venus as a comet, wearing all of the symbols and hieroglyphs and all of the stories that were attached to comets in the different cultures. You cannot ignore the power of that kind of convergence. Well, here's the toughest question, and that's the meaning of myth. Is there a meaning to myth that is completely obscure, completely forgotten in our time? And the answer is, absolutely so. The myths were born out of a myth-making epoch. Human imagination responding to extraordinary natural events. And that's where archetypes come in. Because it's the global patterns that actually point you in the direction of an ancient experience around the world. And we have these different archetypal themes - the fall from heaven of a celestial power. That's a global idea. It has no roots in any experience that we can identify today, and the idea of a cosmic catastrophe, a deluge, a rain-of-fire. The doomsday event giving rise to universal doomsday anxiety. And why is it that a little wisp of gas comes into view as a comet, we begin thinking of the end of the world? That's the power of the archetypal theme on human imagination. And the story, occurring around the world, of a dying god; and the story of an ensuing cloud of chaos that overwhelmed the world. Clouds of chaos, armies of darkness in the sky, throwing the world into confusion. And then there is this incredible archetypal theme of the mother goddess. And why would it be of five visible planets that goddess is universally identified as Venus. There are patterns that must have an explanation. And the greatest surprise will come when we see that these patterns are inseparably connected to each other. And this includes the dark aspect, the terrifying aspect of the mother goddess herself, her terrible aspect. Now here's a theme that you'll find around the world and it probably involves the most active archetypal figure in all of world mythology - the cosmic warrior. And why did it happen that astronomers in different lands, when they looked out at the planets, consistently identified the planet Mars as a great warrior in an ancestral time? And of course the warrior is intimately connected with other themes. And that includes the defeat of a dragon, a ludicrous monster said to have attacked the world, and threatened to destroy the entire world. And then we have, very closely connected with the dragon of chaos, we have a serpent figure that is so completely preposterous, there's no conceivable basis for the inspiration of the same features around the world. That's a huge mystery. Feathered serpent, long-haired serpent, fiery serpent, fire- spitting serpent, these are all ludicrous ideas. And yet, there is one theme that I don't believe anyone has noticed in the conventional study of cultural themes globally. And that is the association of that serpent or dragon with a 'Stairway to Heaven'. And this actually is an incredibly inspiring theme and the details can be pieced together through the points of agreement from the ancient cultures. And what you will find is a direct convergence with the story that plasma science can give - highest energy plasma discharge producing the very forms that connect a serpentine upward spiraling form to a stack of toruses. A stack of toruses being exactly what was anciently identified as the stairway of heaven. So, why a dragon figure? Why a serpent figure, globally associated with a ladder or steps to the sky? Now this is where Tony Peratt's work (which many of you are familiar with) comes directly in to verify the sequence of events that is involved in this. In terms of the common human memories, perhaps the most common is the ’tower of heaven’, the scaling heaven - that was the ‘tower of Babel’ I suspect most people here know that. And then the theme that just caught my imagination, and caused me to live off of adrenaline for two or three years. Until I realized that it is possible to reconstruct a completely different story - Saturn as the founder of a primeval paradise, for example. And Saturn, enigmatically as the primeval Sun. Now many people here may not even know this that that the name ‘Helios’, the Greek ‘Helios’, was archaically a name for Saturn. The Latin ‘sol’ was archaically a name for Saturn. Well, these acknowledged connections have one thing in common, and that is that they are all preposterous. Not one finds an explanation in anything in our natural world, anything occurring in our time. And that includes this power, Saturn - founder of the golden age - becoming the devourer of its own children. Now, I just want to acknowledge that my interest in Saturn began with an outline I received of a hypothesis that Immanuel Velikovsky had developed - unpublished - relating to a prior age of the planet Saturn. A very unusual idea and one that he wanted to develop more completely. But I grabbed ahold of that and two or three years later, I got a contract with Doubleday when it was the largest publisher in the world, for my book “The Saturn Myth”. There are people here today who were very much inspired by “The Saturn Myth”. That reconstruction was just a narrow snapshot of a particular configuration, and then my explanation for the configuration changed as well and this is the centerpiece that I will draw upon, to establish a reference point - to go backwards and to go forward in time. Because this is a complex dynamic configuration in the sky, involving planets very close to the earth, and putting this configuration in three-dimensional space, is the key to testing the implications of the model. The sizes of the different planets, their colors, their relative motions to each other, and most significantly, the appearance of a bright crescent on the great sphere of Saturn. This is a polar configuration. Standing at the pole, means that the axis of the earth was aligned - in effect ran right through - the hearts of those bodies. Now, you cannot entertain that configuration without including the rotation of that crescent with the cycle of day and night. And that is a very profound implication, or prediction of the model. Because the daily cycle - particularly in early cultures, and most particularly in Egyptian cultures - was the heart of their sacred rites, celebrating a daily cycle which is supposedly of the Sun. And here is a model that is saying that that crescent revolved with the cycle of day and night; there must have been a huge echo of that into Egypt with its daily cycle celebrations. ”The Great Conjunction of Primeval Times” takes you to the ancient imagery of the sun wheels. ‘The Great Conjunction’, I've used that phrase a lot, but that principle of conjunction - a line running right through the hearts of the planets - that actually is part of the remembered tradition. Again, a ludicrous idea and what, in the motions of planets today that never stand in perfect line, what would have provoked that idea of a perfect conjunction? And we have these engravings on stone that only accentuate the improbability of all of this. Cultures around the world presenting the same, unrecognizable form? The only response has been to call these drawings of the Sun. But if you actually examine these images, globally, you find they have nothing in common with the Sun. And more than that, as I intend to make clear here at this conference, these images involve cultures, naming the particular planets producing the images. Now, follow the ‘Sun wheel’ and you'll get to certain stylized images. These stylized images - if you're going back through cultural history, you'd still be after the rock art carvings - there's a stylization that occurs in which concepts begin to influence, because the apparition itself is no longer present. But this stylized image of the Great Wheel of Shamash, the “Sun God”, is very telling. We have to ask ourselves, does the Sun and our sky look like this? And this is actually requiring, I think, a brutal honesty and that honesty can be helped along by explicit statements of the astronomical texts - ”Shamash is the planet Saturn”. The story of mythology is in fact the story of what happened to these bodies. And there's too much specificity in this, to think that you could just toy with different ideas and make something up that would work. Make something up and it would be refuted in five minutes. The players in this configuration are named. Saturn as primeval Unity, creator, central sun, when heaven was close to the earth. Venus as star of glory, mother goddess and in the removal, the unraveling of that configuration becoming the great comet. And Mars, the universally celebrated warrior-hero, warrior-king, and the essential identity of the cosmic thunderbolt. What I want to draw attention to always, is specificity and utter uniqueness. There is not an archetypal theme on the planet, to the best of my knowledge, that would ever be expected by anything we ever experienced. How does it happen that the world presents to us hundreds of archetypes, and they are connected inseparably to each other? Each archetype being illuminated by the network of archetypes and each helping to illuminate the others. We're using then a a body of evidence that reaches beyond the historical testimony, into perspective from earth. Three-dimensional perspective is incredibly demanding. Physical analogies in the laboratory where exotic configurations are proposed in plasma events between planets. And then we discover that those are exotic, highly specific, forms that are in fact available in the laboratory. And yes, consistency. Contradiction is the signature of a mistake. If there's a mistake, it will show up in the inconsistency between those levels of evidence. Now, I want to talk about a convergence of myth and science which has already been acknowledged by David Novak. And this occurred primarily when in the mid-1990s, I had the privilege of meeting Wal Thornhill and he stated to me how electric phenomena would create the forms that I had reconstructed. That led, just a few years later, to a convergence in 2000 with Tony Peratt, again a leading plasma scientist in his time, and this meeting with Tony Peratt was an astounding juncture for us. He had identified ”the Christmas tree”. [interruption] [interruption] What he called the Christmas tree, I identified as the chain of arrows, and that set in motion one of the most memorable conversations in my life. He asked me how that configuration evolved and I described the filament up the polar axis that divided into a stack of toruses. First, conic embedded cones form, and then flat toruses that were seen as the “tower or ladder of the sky”. When Tony returned to Los Alamos, he asked me to send him the rock art. Instead of sending him hundreds of rock art images, I just sent him this one. Now, the reason I sent him just one was that I was certain that that eye-mask form (that's what we call it - it's a a global image), I was certain that it was a plasma form and the “ladder of Heaven” I had identified as toruses and he had said that's the evolution of the Peratt instability in the laboratory, an intimate connection with the chain of arrows or the Christmas tree form. So, I was confident that when he saw that, he would recognize it as a plasma form, and he even identified the parts there. And then he sent me this very unique plasma form and that is the eye-mask form that I just referred to. The eye-mask will be found on virtually every continent. It has no meaning, no explanation in any conventional terms. And yet, it is the explanation for the owl-eyed form of the mother goddess, and for the owl-eyed or eye-mask form carved on stone around the world, and enigmatically connected to the ‘stairway to the sky’. That eye-mask beneath those toroidal forms of the Kayenta pictograph is just a variation on this. And incidentally, there's no up and down in this configuration. This is actually a phase of wandering. It's not a polar configuration. That eye- mask form was seen in Easter Island. It had a lot of aquatic elements attached to it because it just rolls right up out of the surrounding sea. So, thank you all very much. [Music] 
[Music] Where exactly is cosmology headed? Can it change without actually changing? Can you save a house with a crumbling foundation by adding a new roof, or might it be time to look for a new home? The Standard Model of cosmology is in a state of crisis and inevitably heading towards revolution. Let's delve deeper into Thomas Kuhn's criteria for revolution and explore if there are currently any cosmological models that meet  his criteria. When a scientific model is in crisis, i.e. plagued by mounting anomalies and contradictions that the model cannot resolve, then it can no longer be considered a reliable guide to problem solving and will eventually be replaced by a different  model. This is the model revolution stage of the paradigm shift cycle. it begins with the emergence of a new model, or models, that speak a fundamentally different language, making the old and new models irreconcilable and incompatible. Which means that they cannot co-exist. Simply  put, the main criteria for model revolution is a new model that speaks a fundamentally different language and is incompatible with the existing model. For the purpose of this analysis, I use the word ‘language’ to refer to ’paradigmatic language’ by which I mean how a paradigm talks about and describes the things it observes in nature. A change in paradigm is ultimately a change of world view. So, are there presently any cosmological models that speak a fundamentally different paradigmatic language with a different worldview? In order to explore this question, we must first establish the lexicon of the Standard Model. To put a complex subject in admittedly reduced terms, I have distilled from the Standard Model lexicon the following three foundational concepts and assumptions in order of significance. Gravity, as the principal cosmological force; General Relativity, as defining and/or in relation to gravity; and the Big Bang, meaning an expanding Universe , birthed by a Big Bang. These concepts are complementary and interdependent, while also engendering the majority of other concepts and hypotheses contained within the Standard Model. So, are there presently any models that deviate from one or more of these foundational concepts and assumptions? Let's look at what the mainstream has to say about alternative cosmologies. In mainstream science, alternatives are sometimes described as physics beyond the Standard Model or BSN, which quote, “...refers to the theoretical developments needed to explain the deficiencies of the Standard Model” - end  quote. According to mainstream scientists, theories that lie beyond the Standard Model include various extensions of the Standard Model, as well as what they describe as ‘entirely novel explanations’ such as string theory, M theory, and extra dimensions. Examples of extensions include ‘eternal inflation’ theory and the ‘oscillating’ model of the Universe. I will leave it to cosmologists and astrophysicists to explain and explore the details of these hypotheses. For the purpose of my analysis, what matters is that both of these theories rely on the Standard Model's foundational assumption and lexicon about a Big Bang and are therefore not sufficiently different. Even early Big Bang rivals, such as Steady State theory, rely on foundational assumptions and concepts such as gravity, is the driving force of the Universe as well as expansion. Another mainstream alternative is Modified Newtonian Dynamics or MOND. MOND quote, “...proposes a modification of Newton's law of universal gravitation to account for observed properties of galaxies....It is an alternative to the hypothesis of Dark Matter in terms of explaining why galaxies do not appear to obey the currently understood laws of physics.” end quote. In other words, MOND and its variants, are an attempt to address one of the many anomalies and crises of the Standard Model. While it is touted as an alternative that can eliminate the problems created by the hypothesis of Dark Matter, MOND is still gravity-centric and actually increases the galactic effects of gravity. It also relies on many of the main assumptions and concepts of the Standard Model with the obvious exception of Dark Matter. Thus, as is the case with the other extensions, MOND is also not a viable alternative in the Kuhnian sense. Overall, an extension to the Standard Model by its very definition could never be seen as containing a fundamentally different paradigmatic language. While these extensions arose to address problems and deficiencies in the Standard Model by further contributing to the complexity of the model, they ultimately exacerbate the crisis in contemporary cosmology. Let us recall that increasing complexity is an indication of crisis. Moving on to the so-called entirely novel explanations such as string theory M theory and extra dimensions, the main thing worth noting for our purposes is that these still treat gravity as the main driving force in the Universe. They too cannot be seen as speaking a fundamentally different paradigmatic language and do not qualify as serious theoretical considerations for a new model. These are but a few examples of the mainstream alternatives that exist. Again, I leave it to those more versed in the hard sciences, to sift through or evaluate all of the possible add-ons and extensions to the Standard Model. As a critical discourse analyst, working within the Kuhnian framework, I am interested in identifying alternative models that meet the criteria for model revolution. Ones that self-consciously and directly espouse a fundamentally different language with a different view of the cosmos. One model that I'm familiar with and that also stands out for speaking a radically different paradigmatic language is the Electric Universe model of cosmology, or EU model for short. Proponents of this model subconsciously espouse a completely different language and world view. Let's look at some examples in the words of its advocates. In an introduction to an essay in The Secular Heretic by EU physicist and pioneer Wal Thornhill, the magazine's editors describe the EU model as the science of the 21st century, telling its readers quote, ”Set aside everything you think you know about all things great and small because the ideas presented in the Electric Universe  overturn it all.” End quote. Referring to the EU model's take on the suppositions of standard cosmology, they note the following. Quote, “Was there a Big Bang? Not likely. Einstein's Relativity? Doesn't hold up. Is the Sun a thermonuclear fusion reactor which will eventually run out of fuel and burn out? Nope. Are there black holes? No such thing. What about dark matter and dark energy? Forget about that nonsense and start learning about the science of the 21st century.” End quote. Implied in this statement is the idea that the EU calls into question most of the foundational concepts and assumptions of standard cosmology. So what about gravity? This is arguably the most important point of  departure. For the EU model the Universe's nature cannot be explained by gravity alone. Moreover, according to Thornhill quote, ”Unlike the Standard Model, the EU model has a physical model for gravity as a manifestation of the electric dipole force.” End quote. In the Standard Model, gravity is the fundamental organizing force in the cosmos. On the macro scale the Universe is dominated by gravity, but in the Electric Universe model the electric force is the fundamental organizing force at all scales. According to EU advocates, quote, “...the gravitational theorem does not single-handedly provide all the answers required by physical science, particularly in deep space.... gravitational theory struggles to explain many anomalies in observation.... Today's most vexing scientific anomalies point to an unexpected - at times dominating - role of the electric force.” End quote. The EU model does not deny the role of gravity in the Universe. On the contrary, as the model explains, quote, ”The Electric Universe concept emerged from the principles of empirical physical science as expressed by such pioneers as Galileo, Kepler and Newton... However, there's an important corollary to the gravitational theorem and that is the electrical force.” End quote. Due to the hierarchical structure of the gravity - relativity - Big Bang lexicon that I identified at the beginning, if the first foundational concept, i.e. gravity is the organizing force in the Universe,  is compromised, then it stands to reason that the other two would also be called into question. if the Standard Model’s views on gravity as organizing force are wrong, then General Relativity would be rendered irrelevant, and the Big Bang improbable. For instance, based on what the EU model has to say about gravity, the question of a Big Bang becomes moot. According to Wal Thornhill, quote, “There was no Big Bang and we do not know  the origin of the Universe.” End quote. What about theories such as dark matter, dark energy, black holes, gravitational waves, etc.? While they are presented as declarative truths or foregone conclusions by mainstream science, EU advocates would caution that these concepts are physically undefined and remain ad hoc hypotheses. This is because paradigmatic lexicons can trap scientists in a discursive prison that limits the way they can talk about, or even think about, what is observed. In a paradigm shift, the new paradigm typically understands the language of the old or existing model, but does not agree with it. The old paradigm, however, is restricted in its ability to understand, or even consider the language of the new model. For example, because the Standard Model does not allow for cohesive electrical effects in space, they are limited to describing much of the interstellar medium as gas, whereas  the EU model describes it as plasma. Not least because over 99% of the known Universe is made up of electrically charged plasma. Standard Model scientists know what plasma is, but given their paradigmatic assumptions, they default to language and therefore, the physical properties of gas. In exploring some of the most important differences between the two models, I do not claim to assert whether or not the EU model is poised to replace the Standard Model. As Mel Acheson has noted, the EU model is still evolving and remains a work in progress. However,  looking at the paradigm shift framework, one could not ask for a better example of a model that meets all of the requirements of the model revolution stage, embodying what it means for a model to speak a fundamentally different language, and be incompatible with the dominant, or existing model. Moreover, as I have discussed elsewhere, the EU model is also arguably less complex, thereby satisfying part of Kuhn's requirement for paradigm change. In this respect the Electric Universe model cannot be seen as an add-on or extension to the Standard Model. It is by the aforementioned measures a fundamentally different cosmological paradigm.

The Pulsating Universe and Planet Earth Okay well, hello everybody! This is a real honor to be participating in a historic conference. Let's see. So, 'The Pulsating Universe and Planet Earth'. So, right. Right here we have the Crab Nebula which sends out energetic pulses 30 times a second. So I've chosen that as my iconic image of the pulsating universe. And here of course, we have the Aurora Borealis which is the electric current coming into the earth so that's my symbol of how planet Earth is affected. So, there are discharge events occurring all the time on all kinds of scales, on a whole range of scales in the cosmos. This one is 30 times a second. Here we have a supernova remnant so there was a supernova which sent out a tremendous burst of energy when it happened. And here we have even larger scale, this is a stellar nursery. So we have a cathode object here which is being impacted by an incoming current and every one of those strands is creating stars so that's a huge scale discharge event. And all of these discharge events are sending spikes of energy, spikes of energy down galactic currents. Whatever current they're on, gets a spike of energy whenever there's an event like that. And those energy spikes reach planet Earth. Here is an image that, here's Don Scott's image of the Birkeland current that powers the Sun so that current is going to get its share of energy spikes. And then those are passed on to the earth proportionally so the current coming into the earth is a spiky current, it's not a constant current. It's going to get spikes whenever there's a discharge event that is connected to our circuit. And that's going to cause heating. So the reason we see the Aurora Borealis is because the ionosphere is being heated to glow mode. In this particular report from THEMIS they call it a hundred thousand amps circuit coming in. And I think on an earlier talk it was an even larger amount of amps. Doesn't really matter, it's a lot of amps, that's what we care about. And it's not just the, I call this the entire ionosphere. I suppose I should call it the plasmasphere but the Van Allen belts, these radiation belts, that's because of current flowing through them. And that's being heated. Plus the atmosphere is being heated by discharge from the ionosphere to the surface. It's like a 250,000 volt difference between the ionosphere and the surface. And these weather events are a discharge across that potential. So, the whole Earth system is being heated by the current that flows through it. The earth is basically a resistor for this, for the current, and resistors heat up and it's proportional to the current flow. So that an energy spike is going to create a heating spike. So there's no question that the earth is heated electrically, the question is how significant is that heating. So to get a handle on whether that has any significance to it, let's take a look at the climate record. So what we have here is the last 400,000 years as recorded in the ice cores in Antarctica, in Vostok. I just downloaded this data from the official website and charted it out. So what we see is about every 100,000 years there's a major spike and that's how ice ages are ended, and then we see little spikes about every 10,000 years. So basically the temperature record is nothing but spikes. There's no level periods, it's all spikes. And they are, and they occur on a cyclical pattern. So let's look at this, let's talk about climate a little bit while we have this slide here. The earth is, 90% of the time, is in what we call an ice age. It's unusual to have an interglacial period so ice ages are normal. And when we think about ice ages, we think about people wearing skins, hunting mastodons, woolly mammoths. Well that's not what ice ages are like. Yeah, there are more, a lot of the northern hemisphere is covered with glaciers but that doesn't mean the earth is cold. I mean, the difference between an ice age and a non-ice age is only ten degrees. A place like Phoenix would be much more livable if it was ten degrees cooler. And also because all the water is taken up in the glaciers, the sea level is about 200 meters lower which means that what we call the continental shelf becomes the shoreline. So in the tropics it's more livable and there's a lot more land. So an ice age isn't, it isn't really that the earth is cold. It's just colder but there's nothing to prevent life or agriculture or civilization or anything else during what we call an ice age. So actually, ice ages are normal and an interglacial period is a crisis time because of this huge energy spike which ends it and suddenly then all the glaciers are melting which means tsunamis all over the world. I should see what's next here. Right, okay. So now what we're going to do is we're going to zoom in on the interglacial period. So we're zooming in on this little part here and what do we see, more spikes! So the heating pattern of the earth is a fractal, a spiky fractal pattern. We're having spikes at all scales and that's what a fractal pattern is. It's very distinctive, it's not random. It's not at all random, it's a very distinctive non-random pattern of cyclical spikes. So what we have, we have fractal energy spikes from the cosmos and fractal heating spikes in the temperature record so basically we have a unique fingerprint match between heating caused by discharge events and the cosmos. So we have a pattern match that that doesn't really, but we don't know about the magnitude. I mean, it conceivably could be a coincidence that the patterns are the same so what we need is some direct evidence. Is there any direct evidence for an electric effect on climate? And there is, thanks to Ben Davidson because he showed that solar activity, variations of solar activity are correlated, strongly correlated with significant climate change. And variations in solar activity are of course due to fluctuations in the Birkeland current that powers the Sun, which is proportional to the current that comes into the earth. So, my hypothesis then is that climate variation is due to fluctuations in the current flowing into the ionosphere. Now, I really should say it's a current flowing into the Earth's system so it's not just the ionosphere, it's the whole Earth system. And I think it's a strong, I mean, I've given a very sketchy rendition of this, but I think it's a strong hypothesis. But I think what's even, so if we, if we have, if this is what causes climate variation, of course, that's interesting to know how something works though what's even more interesting is the implications of the hypothesis. So here is the first implication that we have a seismograph basically, or a voltage graph of discharge activity into the past. So this is a new window onto the cosmos. We can learn things from this that we couldn't learn any other way. And in particular let's take a couple, there we go. We can, we can look for correlations between heating spikes in the record and things we can see, things that we can see astronomically. Like the Crab Nebula which was a pulsar, it also, it's a supernova remnant. And we know from records that were kept that that occurred in 1054 AD. Well, that exactly matches one of our spikes. So what that would indicate is that the spike of energy that caused the supernova was the same spike that caused the the heating spike on the earth. Do you think what causes the supernova? Well, supernova happens when the double layers break down. What's going to break down the double layers is going to be a surge of current which overloads them. It's just like a circuit breaker or a fuse. If you put too much current through it, it goes. And then here we have the Vela supernova remnant which astronomers tell us happened 12,000 years ago which is the spike that ended the last ice age. So again, of course you might say well actually, it didn't occur 12,000 years ago. The light got to us 12,000 years ago. Well, what that's saying is that the voltage spike got to us at about light speed at the same time the light did. Now, so that was one... One implication of the hypothesis is that we have this record of this window onto the cosmos basically like a seismograph. There. A second implication of the hypothesis is that discharges seem to be always cyclical. Now we know with pulsars that the discharges are cyclical because it happens fast enough that we can observe it. But we would have no way of guessing that other that 100,000 year discharges are cyclical or 1000 year discharges are cyclical. So we're getting information about the cosmos that we really couldn't get any other way. I really, by the way, while we're on, while we, I should've really said this when this particular chart was bigger. This is a good time to talk about this global warming nonsense. Notice starting about 1000 BC, we have a heating spike of about a degree or degree and a half. And then we have another one at Year Zero. And another one at AD 1000. So every thousand years... So, at 0 and at 1000 we got this one or one and a half degree rise. Now this particular chart stops at 1800. So what would you expect to have next? Well, we'd expect a one or one and a half degree rise peaking in the year 2000 which is exactly what we got. So yes indeed, there's been two centuries of global warming and it's completely natural. Now the next implication, the third implication of the hypothesis is that ice ages are ended by an electrical energy spikes. Not a collision with an asteroid, not orbital variations, not volcanoes, it's an energy spike. Now, in the ice age we have glaciers that are miles high and they melt in less than a thousand years. I mean, this chart is Vostok and it looks like that's a steep spike but actually there's another chart which I unfortunately didn't include, and it shows that the the northern hemisphere came out of the last ice age much quicker than the southern hemisphere did. If you effect, if we stretch out the graph starting at 50,000, starting back here and we bring in Greenland, suddenly this spike that looks so steep, it becomes a gradual ascent. And the one in Greenland is really steep so like the glaciers melted in less than a 1000 years. Now what, how much electrical energy would it take to melt the glaciers in such a short time? So what we have then is the interglacial spike is rising in intensity for centuries and that's what melts the glaciers. Well, what would that mean for the rest of the... What effect could that have on the rest of the solar system and the other planets? That intense amount of energy. So what we're getting is a constantly increasing potential in the heliosphere. So that the potential difference between the Sun and the heliopause is rising, that potential difference is rising for centuries. So that's going to, what could that lead to? Well, the first thing that's going to happen is there's going to be extreme planetary weather events. Because, I mean, now we have 250,000 volt difference, and we're now at the quiescent top of the spike. But while that spike was rising, then that potential gradient between the ionosphere and the surface is going to be always rising so you're going to have amazingly powerful weather events. Now, we also know from the electric model that planetary spacing is electrically determined and I mean, just this morning Wal was telling us that if the, if you had twice the voltage gradient, the planets would be twice as far. So we're going to get, planetary orbits are going to be shifted. And we're going to have violent interplanetary discharges. So what we're going to have for centuries then is, oops let's go back, we're going to have the Thunderbolts of the Gods going on for centuries every 100,000 years. So, now obviously this is, this is different than what the Saturn capture hypothesis says right now and it would be really good if we could somehow reconcile the ice core record with the Saturn capturing hypothesis. And conceivably, that could be done if, if this huge spike which ends the ice age, what if it turns Saturn temporarily into a brown dwarf? Say, now of course I'm totally speculating here, it's way over my head on what's possible. But I can't, it's not easy to just dismiss the ice core record because there are other temperature records like for instance in the Caribbean you can look back at temperatures based on what kind of sea shells were being deposited and what kind of species could survive on what temperature so there are, there are corroborations for the ice core record. We can't just totally dismiss it and we certainly can't dismiss all the wonderful things that David and others have discovered. So it'd be nice if those two things could be reconciled. Anyway, to summarize, we not only have a pulsating universe, we have a rhythmically pulsating universe because the spikes are always occurring in cycles. So climate is Gaia dancing to cosmic rhythms. And the last slide is if we compare the interglacial temperature record to a clip of Irish music, we can see that these discharge events that caused these spikes, those are the instruments of the cosmic orchestra. So, thank you very much! 
Welcome to the Electricity of Life, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info Beings like ourselves, birthed in an oxygen-rich atmosphere, may casually understand the requirements of life in terms of the creatures we can see. Air is breathed or extracted from water in the case of fish, water is drunk or retained for weeks and months by hardy life-forms. The oxygenated environment around us informs our schemas. It is wise to remember that life is not ultimately defined by water and air. It is defined by the molecular electronics in an organism's biology. There are a great many microscopic life-forms here on Earth that can or regularly do thrive on substances that baffle human beliefs. 370 miles off the shore of Newfoundland - Canada, the ship wreck of the Titanic was found. It lay almost two-and-a-half miles deep or 12,500 feet below the saline waters' weight. Growing on the hull of this historic vessel was a fairly historic biological discovery. Giant mats of microorganisms were moving along the surface of the ship reducing it to rust. Within their protective film, pulses of electrical communication allow highly diverse microscopic creatures to move as a coordinated superorganism. Among the colony are life forms from all three domains of currently known organic life including ancient archaebacteria. Using chemical electrical signals the organisms can communicate some of their growth needs to each other in an impressive show of cohabitation. In our human terms we might say that some of the tiny life-forms are not at all eating the metal but practically breathing it. This idea owes its strangeness merely to our familiarity with the experience of breathing-in air as a necessity for every moment of our life and our unfamiliarity with the molecular electronics that it actually involves. Our body, during its generation of vital energy, uses the oxygen we breathe as an electron receptor at the end of a process of splitting and recombining molecules. Some microbes use iron or sulfur for the same purpose. Here we can see one plugging in to a microscopic surface of basalt. In fact, there are actually species which, in the wild, naturally use uranium. They are highly resilient at proofreading and repairing their DNA from frequent damage by radiation. They are an apt reminder of the diverse electronics life can have on this planet or others. And when a large colony of different microscopic creatures is carrying out sophisticated alchemy upon one of our industrial, seemingly impervious objects, it reminds us of how much of ecology we do not see. Diatoms are microscopic jewels of the sea, photosynthesizing organisms which absorb silicon dioxide and combine it with water molecules to fashion shells of glass. There are at least 100,000 different species of diatom, each one can have wildly creative shells grown from combining these raw molecules of reality to form designs with intricate features measured in nanometers. Imagine we've prepared a microscope slide with some pond water with a few small visible specs. Looking through the lens, those specs of matter are revealed to be tiny islands in their own right made of rocks and indeterminate plant pieces, surrounded by unicellular life. Seeing such tiny specks of familiar debris at this layer of magnification gives us a sense of scale and with that a more accurate understanding of the sheer amount of life that is thriving all around us inhabiting and often interacting with the matter we see. In every inch of dirt and every ounce of wild water there is life in all its chemistry. Built from and manipulating the electricity of the physical world. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info In part 1 of this presentation, physicist Wal Thornhill began his analysis of one of the most significant space discoveries in recent memory. The history and origins of the gas giant Saturn, and indeed the entire solar system, including our own planet is not what we've been told. Planetary scientists recently made the astonishing discovery that water in Saturn's satellites and rings is remarkably similar to water on Earth. As Thornhill explained, this discovery was explicitly predicted nearly 3/4 of a century ago, by the scientific heretic Dr. Immanuel Velikovsky. It was Velikovsky's claim that, only a few thousand years ago, a period of chaos reigned in the solar system. One of the planets closely associated with Earth was Saturn and watery filaments rained on our planet following Saturn's violent flare up. Decades later, based on the respective research of Dave Talbott and Dwardu Cardona, Thornhill developed his own model of a primordially close relationship between Earth and Saturn which was the source of all the water in our oceans while leaving remnants in its rings. Today, Thornhill continues his presentation shifting his focus to his own successful predictions for the Saturnian system, including the mysterious moon Titan. Before I tell the epic story, a warning! Our education systems train students to memorize a litany of facts which produces global groupthink. Students are not given the time or encouragement to critically examine the history of ideas. A leading researcher in to the learning functions of the divided brain, Dr. Iain McGilchrist, has shown such blinkered left hemisphere training renders students functionally blind to alternative ways of looking at a problem. The left hemisphere simply blocks out everything that doesn't fit with its take. It doesn't see it, actually, at all. Societies with their narrow specialized training may look at but cannot see what to a non-expert may seem obvious. They will be the last to see a paradigm shift in the making. This is particularly evident for electrical phenomena in space. Even the Nobel Prize winning founder of the idea of an Electric Universe, Hannes Alfven, was ignored when he warned in his 1970 acceptance speech of an inevitable crisis in astrophysics if electric circuits in space are not recognized. Houston, we still have that problem after almost 50 years. I have lived since a teenager with uncertainty about accepted truths and learned to have the courage to challenge them. The result is not chaos but a synthesis of ideas that explains the old ideas better and finds new ways of incorporating what seems a chaos of anomalies and the best test is that of classical physics, simplification. The resulting paradigm shift is not a threat but an invitation to the greatest adventure we may ever know; to begin to understand our real place in the universe for the first time. In our Electric Universe, stars and planets are formed at the same time inside molecular clouds along a snaking cosmic lightning bolt. Gravity plays no role in the process. Since cosmic lightning takes the form of a twisted pair of current filaments, it is found that most stars are in pairs or multiples. Planets will tend to do the same: Like the snaking filaments in a novelty plasma ball, the star-forming filament moves on leaving a string of massive objects behind to gravitationally form the weird and theoretically challenging zoo of exoplanetary systems recently discovered. Some gas giant planets are subsequently formed in close orbits about a star that has ejected charged matter to achieve stability with a changed electrical environment. The ejection flares may account for the flickering of newborn stars which can't be explained by gravitational accretion. This explains the unexpected hot Jupiters seen in large numbers closely orbiting other stars. The most numerous stars in the galaxy, brown dwarfs, which would appear reddish if they could be seen with the naked eye, are generally classed as failed stars yet they have the baffling ability to produce massive stellar flares. This is simply explained because red stars don't have the ability of main-sequence bright stars to control their current by a transistor-like action in their photospheric plasma. A brown dwarf can only respond by discharging matter electrically. The capture process of a brown dwarf star involves flaring and ejection of charged matter by that body, in order to achieve a new electrical equilibrium in its adopted family. That acounts for the large number of close orbiting moons of our captured gas giants in remote orbits. With this in mind, I want to take you back to just before the famous Cassini-Huygens space probe was to arrive at Saturn on July the 1st, 2004. In news reports, Saturn was dubbed 'the original Lord of the Rings'. There is a profound truth behind such a glib turn of phrase but it wasn't until the advent of the telescope, that Christian Huygens in 1656 was able to suggest that Saturn had a ring. So how do we explain the Saturnian ring symbolism that pervades our cultures? The halo of the saints, the royal crown and the ring given in marriage are Saturnian symbols as are the circled or celtic cross, the Egyptian ansate cross or ankh, the eye of Ra and the astronomically baffling star inside the crescent. The star at the top of the large Christmas tree is pure Saturnian imagery. It is truly amazing that we are still haunted by prehistoric archetypes. It helps us to understand the extraordinary archetypal attraction of Tolkien's fantasy of Lord of the Rings. He was well versed in mythology. The following description of events is based on the surprisingly detailed and truly remarkable scholarship of Talbott and Cardona which required explanations with the physics of an Eectric Universe. Let's call our primordial star Proto Saturn. It was an independent brown dwarf with its own entourage of satellites including the Earth, Mars and Titan. Proto Saturn's dim reddish light was due to a glowing red anode plasma sheath, much larger than the Sun, enclosing Proto Saturn and its inner satellites in a radiant cell. The term 'dwarf star' is purely theoretical since they are difficult to see and measure. In fact, NASA reported a brown dwarf which was radiating as if it had twice the expected surface area. The environment inside the radiant red shell is most hospitable for life on any enclosed satellites because there are no seasons and water is conspicuous in the spectra of such stars. Water misted down on this planet continually and red light is ideal for photosynthesis which explains the abundance of ferns and other vegetation globally in the Carboniferous era. But there is a catch. Brown dwarf stars are known to flare, sometimes to the extent, as one astronomer commented, that any satellites would suffer a very bad day. Such flaring by Proto Saturn accounts for the geological strata and the fossil record of a number of global mass extinctions and instant burial of dismembered plant and animal remains. As we approached the Sun from deep space, our plasma sheath flickered like a faulty electric light when the two stellar plasma sheaths or magnetospheres began to clash. Proto Saturn's galactic electrical power was usurped by the Sun and its appearance changed dramatically. Before dimming forever, the dwarf star proto Saturn would have flared brilliantly like a comet, ejecting charged matter to relieve the electrical stresses caused by the sudden change in environment. Even now the former star has not completely cooled. Saturn still radiates more than twice the heat it receives from the Sun. And we have a simple explanation for the origin of Saturn's mysteriously short-lived water-ice rings. As the Proto Saturnian system approached the Sun in the outer solar system, our minor star's gravitational sphere of influence steadily shrank and its outer satellites were progressively stripped away. This, and the earlier capture of the other gas giants provides the source of 'Trans-Neptunian Objects' as they're known, including Pluto with its unexpected geology and atmosphere and its peculiar moons. There is a simple physical characteristic that links a captured star with its offspring. It is the axial tilts. Like our close-orbiting Moon, satellites tend to orbit their primary with the same face always turned toward it. If they orbit in the equatorial plane, their spin axis will be aligned with that of the primary. As gyroscopes, the satellites will retain the same tilt even if jolted from their orbit although the process may induce a wobble of the spin axis. It is therefore highly significant that the two key planets identified in the ancient Pantheons, Saturn and Mars, have axial tilts closely similar to that of the Earth. The tilt of Saturn, at 27 degrees to the ecliptic plane, is itself an enigma unless it formed independently from the Sun. Venus was described as a spectacular discharging body in the ancient congregation of planets. It can be explained if Venus was ejected in the flare-up of Proto Saturn and the in-fall of the stream of ejected matter from swiftly rotating Proto Saturn gave Venus a slow retrograde spin. The magnitude of the axial tilt of Venus to the ecliptic is much less than Saturn's which suggests that Venus was ejected from a low latitude. This accounts for the hellish temperature and new surface of Venus having been recently spat from the mantle of a brown dwarf star, its filamentary equatorial scars caused by spectacular radial discharging and its thick atmosphere inherited from the brown dwarf and subsequently modified by interplanetary and cometary discharges. Venus still has a cometary magnetotail stretching to the Earth's orbit and its mountaintops glow with plasma discharges which return Magellan's radar signals as unexplained shininess. Magellan's radar also showed Venus has a surprisingly young surface that gave rise to ad-hoc theories of resurfacing events. They're unnecessary. Venus is a baby. Since my predictions were written in 2004, the electro gravity model has been further developed and it explains electro-gravitational capture and the rounding of cometary orbits by electrical discharge. It explains the huge capture cross-section of stars and why the observed phenomenal discharging of cometary Venus caused it to finally have the most circular orbit of any planet. The Electric Universe conceptual model can claim a number of successful predictions. Significantly, it was the only model to predict the surface features of smog-shrouded Titan before the Huygens probe revealed them in detail. Titan, which is 50% larger than our Moon, is an enigma for astronomers having a global orange haze that has prevented us from seeing surface features. It has a massive atmosphere, mainly of nitrogen, with the pressure at the surface like that at the bottom of the swimming pool. The atmosphere also contains methane and at least nine other organic molecules. The methane is being continually destroyed by solar radiation which raises a further problem about its source of resupply if the moon is 4.6 billion years old. This has led to widespread speculations of Titan possibly being covered by an approximately one kilometer deep ocean of liquid ethane. However, radar infrared and radio observations of Titan have not found signs of a hydrocarbon ocean. In fact, one radar return was of a type that we would expect to get back from Venus. But Titan is not 4.6 billion years old and the Earth did not form where we find it today. Instead, Saturn's largest moon Titan is a child of Saturn and a sibling of Venus, Earth and Mars. I wrote just before Cassini arrived at Saturn, "...we should be alert to similarities between Titan and Venus." On November 29, 2006, the Dallas Morning News reported, when the 3 billion-dollar Cassini spacecraft sailed past Titan three weeks ago, it was supposed to clear up many of the mysteries about Saturn's largest moon. Instead, it has left scientists more befuddled. The new Cassini images do not support previous theories about Saturn's moon. In New Scientist of November 6, 2004, 'Titan images add two moon's mystery' Steven Battersby reported, "The world got its first peek at the surface of Saturn's moon Titan last week. The images were taken as NASA's Cassini-Huygens spacecraft swept past the moon... The images show a landscape that is clearly still being shaped. Although Titan must have suffered numerous meteor impacts in the past, its surface today is largely crater-free. Somehow these scars must have been eroded or filled in. "We are seeing a place that is alive, geologically speaking," says Charles Elachi, head of the team running Cassini's radar instrument. I commented at the time, that is precisely what was said about Venus when the Magellan orbiter revealed that planet's surface. It is only supposition that Titan's surface is still being shaped. It's based on the belief that Titan must have suffered numerous meteor impacts in the past and therefore something must have occurred from within the moon to fill the craters. However, like Venus, there may have been no impact craters to fill. For that matter, no one has witnessed a large crater-forming meteor impact. The report continued, "Suggestions of an active, dynamic surface on Titan are beginning to emerge. Not a single crater has been identified yet, which means the surface must be young and active... One large circular feature, suspected of being a crater until closer examination showed it to be flat, closely resembles the pancake domes seen on Venus that are produced by magma welling up to produce a bubble that then slumps down to a nearly flat profile... Other features resemble the lobes of some surface lava flows... We don't understand what we're looking at. Titan is going to be a real challenge." My comment was, the surprise about the lack of craters and Titan's apparent active dynamic surface mirrors the comments made about Venus when radar images were first returned. The large flat circular feature on Titan does resemble the pancake dome seen on Venus. However, these domes were not formed by volcanic action. It would require an unacceptably large number of coincidences to produce such circularity in just one of these domes. The surface must be absolutely horizontal and the flow from the central vent must be perfectly even in all horizontal directions. But there are many domes on Venus. In the Electric Universe model, the domes are more simply explained as the raised blisters, sometimes caused by lightning. Small-scale circular-raised blisters have been found following a negative cloud-to-ground lightning strike to a lightning conductor cap. They're called fulgamites. A test of this hypothesis would be to determine if the surface around these domes is sunken. Fulgamites show this characteristic burrough pit effect where the material has been drawn inwards and upwards by the intense discharge to form the raised blister. It is not something to be expected from a volcanic upwelling. Inexplicably in terms of the volcanic model where two domes overlap, the relief of the underlying dome doesn't disturb the overriding dome. This, and the chain formation seen above is typical of electrical scarring in general where one crater is often centered on the rim of another, with little disturbance of the existing crater. With fulgamites, one mound often occurs on top of another as a result of multiple strokes within the lightning flash. So it seems that the images of Titan's surface returned by Cassini so far, are predictable based on forensic evidence that we should be alert to similarities between Titan and Venus. This brings us to the other major puzzle about Titan, its atmosphere. Titan's atmosphere is believed by many scientists to be similar to Earth's early atmosphere billions of years ago. Toby Owens, principal scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory said, "What we've got is a very primitive atmosphere that has been preserved for 4.6 billion years. Titan gives us the chance for cosmic time travel... going back to the very earliest days of Earth when it had a similar atmosphere." From New Scientist, November 6, "Titan appears to have lost much of its original atmosphere. The moon has an unusually high abundance of nitrogen-15, compared with the lighter isotope nitrogen-14. That could be explained if most of the atmosphere had evaporated into space, a process in which the nitrogen-14 would have escaped more easily than nitrogen-15." What could cause such a loss is unknown, but it would mean that Titan once had an atmosphere 40 times as thick as Earth's - making it a dwarf version of a gas planet. This bizarre world may be far more complex than we have begun to imagine." Says Larry Soderblom of the US Geological Survey in Flagstaff, Arizona. My comment was, Titan's atmosphere is primitive but not in the sense that it remains 4.6 billion years old. Instead, there has not been time for young Titan to lose much atmosphere. If Titan, like Venus, is a young recently-ejected body, it may still be cooling from its natal heat and, like Venus, it has a super-rotating wind. The striking disparities in nitrogen isotopes is telling us something about the way planetary atmospheres are formed rather than how they evolved. There are several processes during birth in an electrical discharge that will have significant effects on planetary atmospheres, including that of Titan. The primary effect comes from the source and depth of the ejection from the flaring parent dwarf star or gas giant. The chemical elements in the discharge are then sorted according to their critical ionization velocity. Also, isotopes will tend to separate in the magnetic field of the plasma discharge. Lastly, the plasma gun effect, seen now ejecting material from Io's so-called volcanoes into space, is known in the laboratory to be a copious source of neutrons. The neutrons may be captured to form heavy isotopes and radioactive elements. The variable combination of all these effects suggests that it would be unlikely for any two bodies in the same family to have identical initial atmospheres. Subsequent electrical interactions between planets and moons would also serve to transfer surface materials and atmospheres, transmute elements and further complicate the picture. That fits generally with the irregular elemental and isotopic signatures found in the atmospheres of our planetary system. For example, nitrogen in lunar soils is 10 times more abundant than one may expect from the concentrations of solar wind rare gases. There are some other mechanisms that could also contribute to the lack of nitrogen-14 in Titan's atmosphere. For example, nitrogen-14 can capture an electron to become carbon-14. Carbon-14 decays by very weak beta decay back to nitrogen-14 with a half-life of approximately 5730 years. If the age of Titan's atmosphere can be measured in tens or hundreds of thousands of years instead of billions, then a significant amount of nitrogen-14 may still be locked up as carbon-14, contributing perhaps to the hydrocarbons in Titan's atmosphere and on its surface. To suggest Titan once had an atmosphere 40 times as thick as Earth's making it a dwarf version of a gas planet, only complicates the plainly impossible Standard Model of formation of the solar system. Why don't other large moons in the outer solar system have substantial residual atmospheres? It seems far more plausible to suggest that Titan is a much newer moon than Jupiter's Ganymede or Callisto. Titan simply hasn't had time to lose its heavy atmosphere, just as Saturn hasn't had time to lose its rings following its last discharge. In this picture, "we now have the key to understanding what shapes Titan's landscape", said Dr. Martin Tomasko, principal investigator for the Descent Imager-Spectral Radiometer, adding, "Geological evidence for precipitation, erosion, mechanical abrasion and other fluvial activity says that the physical processes shaping Titan are much the same as those shaping Earth. These comments demonstrate the problem of interpretation when the model is geocentric. Methane is a non-polar molecule which doesn't form clouds and rain like electrically polarized water molecules do. So, precipitation erosion and other fluvial activity will not occur much the same as those shaping Earth. Finally, returning to Venus, why is its atmosphere so different to the other planets and Titan? The atmosphere of Venus is mostly carbon dioxide, 96.5% by volume. Most of the remaining 3.5% is nitrogen. This inhospitable mix is accompanied by clouds of sulfuric acid. I explained in my 2004 article, Venus probably began with an atmosphere more like Titan's and the Earth's where nitrogen dominates and with more water. On the Venusian surface, nitrogen molecules require very little energy to transmute to carbon monoxide molecules by a catalytic surface nuclear reaction in the presence of red-hot iron. The brilliant French chemist Louis Kervran when investigating carbon monoxide poisoning of welders, discovered this surprising transmutation. The carbon monoxide then reacts at the hot surface of Venus with water vapor to form carbon dioxide and hydrogen in a well known industrial process. The hydrogen produced escapes from Venus. This process explains the puzzling discovery made by Venus Landers that the water vapor concentration diminished as they approached the Venusian surface. But decisively, it explains the heavy carbon dioxide atmosphere and little remaining nitrogen on Venus. It also explains the steady stream of hydrogen escaping from the top of Venus's atmosphere at present, and the phenomenally high proportion, 120 times that on Earth, of heavy hydrogen or deuterium left behind in its atmosphere. What I've attempted to show here is a coherent story using forensic evidence stretching back into prehistory of celestial events involving planets and their electrical thunderbolt interactions. A new picture of the universe results from paying heed to Alfven's warning to introduce electric universe science into cosmology. This is a fundamental shift from the ad hoc theoretical approach which has no theory explaining the force of gravity and so, unsurprisingly, no success trying to introduce order into a chaos of anomalies. It has no chance of ever discovering that we are children of the planet and former brown dwarf star, Saturn. This is an invitation to the greatest adventure, to begin to understand our real history and place in the universe for the first time. And that must bring about a much needed cultural change that may dwarf the scientific revolution. That change is essential if we are to have a future because the post-traumatic stress disorder we've inherited threatens our very existence on this planet. It manifests as a desire not to know the shocking truth because it exposes our existential fears. As Roger Wescott overtly expressed it, "Man is a wounded animal. His survival is astonishing. But his inability to heal his wounds is tragic. It is tragic because, as Velikovsky argued, being descendants of the survivors of great paroxysms of nature of the past, we are possessed by the urge inherited through racial memory to repeat the violent performance. And it was his greatest fear that we now had the destructive capability to produce our own doomsday. Along with that genius Carl Jung, he warned that mankind is its own worst enemy. So the cultural change offered by Electric Universe cosmology is essential for our survival. By offering a real understanding of the universe and our history, it offers hope and inspiration where presently there is none. There is far more to life in the electric universe than is dreamt of presently. We are all intimately connected with each other and the Earth. Enjoy the Saturnian festival of lights and the New Year. 
Order Out of Chaos Dwardu Cardona (presented by Wal Thornhill) I was pleased when Dwardu asked me to do his presentation I've done this once before in London, when he couldn't attend but I'm pleased because Dwardu's work I've followed avidly since the 70's when he published in Pensée and then following that in Kronos and his work fascinated me because it was well documented it was extremely well researched and it provided me with the raw material that I needed, the input, the data, I needed to try and figure out what happened and then to try and explain it in terms of Science and as I found, science need a great revision to be able to withstand the input from Dwardu, I mean a sis- kebab of planets is a hell of a challenge. So, I'm very pleased to be able to present his presentation called Order Out of Chaos. According to various translations of the Old Testament an entity named Elohim is said to have been responsible for the creation of heaven and Earth. This is not only being one of the most revered dogmas of the Judeo-Christian faith it is likewise to be found at the root of just about all religions, old and new. it's interesting... I think this is one of the problems of compatibility between picture files because there is or there was last night when I looked at it on my computer a picture of Marinus van der Sluijs, he's down here and we'll be presenting later. So, anyway, Marinus van der Sluijs has gone on record in stating that not all mythology is creation mythology, which is quite true. Even so as Fred Bratton rightly stated, creation myths are the most widespread of all myths. That picture worked. David Talbott hit the nail right on the head when he additionally wrote that a review of the oldest versions of creation will show that few, if any mythical themes have been more misunderstood. The only thing I will add is that this does not only apply to the oldest versions of creation, but just about to all of then. One complicated problem that this involves is that these myths are believed to refer to the creation of the Earth or what is even worse, the Universe. One need not be the proverbial rocket scientist to realize that man who was not around when Earth came to being could not have seen it form. Let alone the Universe! Why then, as David Talbott noted, did ancient man describe creation as if he had seen it unfold with his very own eyes? Most people might find it hard to believe, but as far as ancient sources are concerned reports of the creation that unraveled out of nothing are somewhat rare. As Stephen Langdon rightly noted, in Sumerian mythology, which constitutes the earliest recorded samples of traditional law at our disposal, there is no evidence of the considered theory of the creation of the world. If by the world is meant the Earth on which we live. Similar examples can also be found in the literature of latest civilizations from the same general region and additionally vouched for those who came later. Thus, sometime in the first century BC the Sicilian historian, Diodorus Siculus, could write that the Chaldeans say that the substance of the world is eternal and that it neither had a first beginning nor that it will at a later time suffer destruction. In India, Jain doctrine contains that the world is uncreated as so is time itself both of which are without beginning or an end. And while there is more than one version of creation to be found in the intricate mythology of Hinduism few of them actually claimed that the world had been created out of nothing. The Roman poet Lucretius was adamant that even when it comes to divine power nothing can be created out of nothing. What can we, however, say about more ancient times. Was primitive man capable of realizing that the world he lived in had always been there? Was such a sophisticated concept really beyond the mentality of ancient man? We cannot unfortunately trespass beyond historic times, but we can extrapolate from the traditional law of presently existing tribal groups. And, as it turns out, the concept of a non beginning was not beyond the comprehension of some of the world's primitive cultures. Thus, all over Polynesia, Micronesia and Melanesia, including the Hawaiian Islands and New Zealand, the upper or heavenly world and the terrestrial world are thought to have existed forever. Creation, according to most Australian Aborigines, merely molds or molded what was already there. The idea that the land may once not have existed seems quite simply unimaginable. One can hardly find a race more different from the natives of the Pacific Islands and Australia than the Eskimos of the Arctic regions. And yet they too held to similar beliefs, although there was disagreement among these Arctic people concerning the manner in which the world had been formed a fair portion of these indigenes continue to believe that it always had been there. So likewise with the primitive ancestors of the Tongas in Siberia who were also of the belief that what is usually mistranslated as the universe had always been around. If such primitive cultures could grasp the philosophical notion of there having been no Genesis to existence so could our ancient ancestors come to the realization prior to the sophisticated civilizations that rose in the fertile crescent, the Nile Valley, the islands of Greece and elsewhere around the world. Even so, creation was believed, by some, to have transpired out of nothing just as in Christianity it still is. Most of these beliefs, however, are based on a series of misinterpretations one of which concerns the mistaken belief that Elohim created whatever he did create out of nothing which is neither stated nor even implied in Genesis. As it happens, ancient man more than hinted at a pre-existing, even if chaotic, substance. Obadi Kim from India states that this all, which is often misconstrued to mean the universe, was indiscriminate chaos. As it is there maintained, all that existed then was void and formless. Void and formless it might have been, at least in the eyes of ancient man, but it still existed. Thus the Laws of Manu rightly inform us that, despite being without form, the world or what was later miss comprehended as the world was believed to have already been in place. Half a world away, the Incan God Veracocha was burdened with regional variations of the manner in which he had said about creation. And yet in all these variations he always comes out as a God Creator who intervened in a world that was already in existence even if still an organized. Veracocha's role was to transform chaos into cosmos, and since cosmos originally meant order, harmony or an orderly arrangement it can be said that creation consisted in the formation of order out of chaos. As it has been attested, all of these creations were mere arrangements of existing matter rather than creations out of nothing. The main pre-existing item from which creation was said to have unfolded was the May em. Usually translated as waters over which the so-called spirit of Elohim him is said to have moved prior to creation. The validity of this inference is evidenced by the fact that nowhere in Genesis is Elohim said to have ever created the May em nor is this concept to be found only in Genesis. The Babylonian version of creation, known as the Enuma Elish, is given in a series of seven cuneiform tablets. As in Genesis, the waters are given the honor of having been the primordial element and also as in Genesis they are proclaimed to have existed before anything. In Sumerian mythology, water is not only said to have preceded creation it was held to have been responsible for it. Thus in a tablet that contains a list of deities we encounter the goddess whose Nammu whose name is written with the ideogram for sea. And it is this Nammu that is this sea that was described as the mother who gave birth to heaven and Earth. As elsewhere, the origin of this primeval sea is not accounted for. The Egyptian myth of creation also ascertains that water and chaos were the pre-existing elements from which creation was said to have developed. Let it not be thought that we are making too much of this through a survey of myths dealing with creation from around the world it is easily recognized that one of the most noticeable of motives is, in practically all of them, is the idea that what is usually misconstrued as the universe unfolded out of chaos, from primeval water. We must, however, travel away from the preachings of the biblical world if we wish to illustrate the universality of this team. In India we encounter one version out of many in which Narayana lifelong ages floating on the primeval waters we've been discussing before proceeding to create what, as usual, has unfortunately been misconstrued as the universe. Later myths ascribed creation to Brahma, who is said to have hatched from a cosmic egg as it lay floating on the same primeval waters. So similarly outside brahmanic India among the nation's other tribes we come across the belief that in the beginning nothing existed, but the waters. Among the Eskimos of Alaska, or the Inuit as they are now called, we also find a creation myth that presupposes the preexistence of a watery abyss from which all existence came into being. Farther south, but still in North America, creation out of water continue to be told by most Amerindian nations thus the Hopi have for long insisted that the creator gathered, something, from endless space that later manifested as the waters. So also was the sea, but one that floated through space said to have already been in existence when the Hearon deity, known as the spirit of all, commenced on his creation. Likewise among the Iroquois with the same spirit of all was already in possession of the gentle swishhing waves from which to create whatever needed to be created but according to the Yuma this is how it all began, there was only water, then out of the waters rose a mist but deep down in the waters lived the creator. It is the same in Central America where we come across Nahuatl creation myths in which the primordial substance also seems to have been water. Although the Mayan Popol Vuh describes creation in a rather convoluted manner is still describes the original state of the heavens as a void with what has been translated as the tranquil sea already in existence. Thus the creator was described as having being in the heart of the still dark sky and in the heart of still dark sea or in the depths of the water in which he seemed to shimmer. Following the Mayan, the Azteks were no different in this respect according to them the world was a huge flat space surrounded by the sea and at a certain point the sea curved up to become the sky. The upper air consisted of sky waters I could go on and add much more to the list, but I believe I've made my point. The question that all this raises is, why did ancient man resort to the idea of a world having been created out of a watery chaos? Why water, why chaotic water? And why was it not thought necessary that this water should also have been created? In Egypt not only was the creation believed to have unfolded out of the primeval water the creator was himself believed to have risen from the water. In digging deeper, however, we find out that as far as the Egyptians were concerned it was actually the creator himself who was the very waters out of reach creation was said to have unfolded moreover the rising of the creator out of these waters was accompanied by the shading of light from that very source. In fact, as with other ancient civilizations, this form the very starting point of all conjectures relating to creation. This first burst of light is congruent with the light that was said to be shed by Elohim in the very first lines of the book of Genesis. Throughout the years it remained emphasized in rabbinic belief that creation was made possible by the advance of the primordial light into the darkness of chaos. In Egypt, the god Osiris was likewise acclaimed as the sheder of the primordial light but then a spell from the pyramid texts towards the same Osiris as having been synonymous with the sea and or the ocean. That this watery chaos or primordial ocean was celestial in origin is evidenced by being referred to as the watery abyss of the sky. Even the great god Ra or Re was known as the god of the great celestial waters. So similarly in Hindu mythology according to which the god Varuna is not only said to have appeared in the seas gathered waters and have been crowned by Brahma as the lord of the waters but to have been himself the waters. As to be expected when such waters are equated with the god this particular sea or ocean was located in the sky. But who or what then was this creator? Primitive as they might have been and long after the migration from their original Northern homeland the Kawesqar Indians of southern Chile continue to remember the creator as having being Xolas which name translates as star and they were right on the mark. But let's backtrack a little, one particular item that has confused mythologists throughout the years is the identity of the creator in most of the ancient world as the God of the planet Saturn. Indeed as David Talbot noted, the consistency with which astronomers identify Saturn as the former creator king is extraordinary. Cutting straight across the lawn I need to only point out one of the best-known creators in the Western world the one referred to in the book of Genesis as it is their stated, in the beginning God created the heaven and the Earth the Hebrew word that has been translated as God, however, is Elohim which is the majestic plural of the Semitic deity know as El. The Greek transliteration of this name is Helios the very good that Philo of Byblos proclaimed to have been the same as Kronos which was the Greek name for Saturn. Besides Philo of Byblos other classical sources as well as inscriptions in Greek and Latin all establish the identity of a El as the Greek Kronos. The same as the latin Saturnus. William Albright was therefore right on track when he identified El as the Latin Saturnus, without much ado. I point next to the Zoroastrian myth in which Zurvan was said to have provided or emitted the original unformed matter. This ancient deity was regarded as the first principle the original seed and the father of the cosmos and yet once again as we learn from various ancient texts Zurvan was also identified as Kronos the Greek god and planet Saturn. In ancient Chinese sources chaos is equated with the being known as Huangdi the Yellow Emperor of dim antiquity. In different versions of the myth this yellow Emperor was responsible for having brought in order to the Elemental Chaos as the beginning of creation. Huangdi, however, also originated as a cognomen of the Saturnian planetary god. The Huangdi was regarded as the creator, it's also well known and that is tantamount to proclaiming that creation was the work of the Saturnian planetary deity. By the time of the Greeks and Romans, to say nothing of those who came later, the conception was so ingrained in the minds of scholars and those of religious disposition that they could spell it out in no uncertain terms. Thus, in that mysterious work of this popularly known as the "Great Magical Papyrus" of Paris the Greeks actually addressed Kronos outright as the founder of the whole world we live in. Among the Romans the god Janus was considered a god of beginnings and described an essential role in creation. This same Janus was also known as the chaos out of which creation was said to have unfolded and yet as Alexander Hislop noted Janus is easily identifiable as Saturn and so likewise down into modern times. Although mainly whole was more concerned with mystical philosophy then he was with the verity of mytho historical content he was as David Talbott notice till cognizant of the fact that the planet Saturn looms as the elementary power of creation. Despite all that, the creative was not merely planetary since the planet in question had formerly been a brown dwarf star in close proximity to Earth before it degenerated into the gaseous planet we now know as Saturn. It was in the early 1940's that Immanuel Velikovsky posited that the planet Saturn had once been much larger than at present. Although he turned to be out to be an error on many an issue he was definitely vindicated on this particular one. That the planet Saturn is the relic of what had previously been a brown dwarf star is now an accepted tenet of mainstream astronomy. As Maria Zapatero Osorio reported at the turn of the present century in time the evolving brown dwarf stars will look like Jupiter and Saturn and as other astronomers found reason to state at around the same time sub-brown dwarfs give us a golden opportunity to see what Jupiter and Saturn were like in the youth. What the scholarly world also had to finally admit is that humanity has known and has kept track of the planet Saturn since prehistoric times. As far as we're concerned this would not have been all that difficult since our hypothesis demands that Earth was actually a satellite of this proto-Saturnian dwarf star which loomed large in close proximity. It was in effect Earth's primordial Sun in a system that had originally been floating freely outside the demarcation of the present solar system. As Vladimir Damgov amongst others has indicated brown dwarf generate enough heat to shine, but only dimly and in infrared light. They also radiate in the ultraviolet spectrum that together with the infrared would have been needed for the inception and sustenance of life. Proto-Saturn that were there before have been hotter than the planet that it is at present and to be sure it has not yet had enough time to eliminate all of its primordial heat. Even after the Cassini spacecraft had time to study the planet at close quarters Saturn was still being claimed to be a world that is hotter than it should be. Brown dwarf stars have also been discovered to be surrounded by circumstellar disks identical to, even if much smaller than, the ones that are detected around stars. Judging the water our ancient ancestors passed on to their descendants such a circumstellar disk was remembered as having surrounded their primordial proto-Saturnian Sun as a nebulous entity. Needless to say ancient man had no way of knowing what this nebulosity really was. In ancient Hebraic nomenclature this nebulosity ended up as the Tohu wa- bohu of the book of Genesis which phrases traditionally translated as without form and void or voidable empty in relation to whatever it was Elohim was said to have created. Tohu wa-bohu, however, can also mean out of chaos which conforms with the chaos that presided as the ruling principle before creation in various ancient cosmogonies. Among the Chinese the same chaotic or nebulae cloud said to have revolved without fail became known as Tao. In North America the Iuke spoke of this fog and or foam that was said to have moved round and round continually which fog was also described by certain tribes in Indonesia to the Pima it was like a fluffy bit of cotton in the breeze to the Phoenicians it was Môt which is normally translated as mud that can also connect water which conforms with the source from which creation was said to have unfolded. This revolving chaotic fog or foam is not a species way in which our primitive forefathers chose to describe the indefinable world that was seen circling around the nearby Sun. That under certain conditions and scintillating eliminations elimination such a nadie could also mean visualize the swirling water a whirling ocean is all also understandable. This is brought into prominence by the Heliopoliten system in ancient Egypt in which the immense chaos that existed in the beginning was believed to have been a celestial ocean in which the germs of creation lay embedded. And since creation was vouched to have sprung out of the celestial sea it can be stated to be developed out of proto-Saturnus circumstellar disk moreover very much like stars which in fact they truly are brown dwarf stars are also known to flare up in an intensity that to say the least is taken astrophysicist by surprise. If we are now to believe that the mytho-historical record after having shown dimly in the sky for untold ages Earth's primordial proto-Saturnian Sun also flared up in a blinding light to their ancient ancestors remembered as the inception of creation. This was the Fiat Lux, the let there be light that is said to be shared by Elohim. No Earthly description will ever do this event and all that followed justice. We who did not see it will never be able to fully appreciate the impact it must have had on the primitive human psyche. Were something similar to occur in the present sky, and granted that we would survive it, we would now view it with scientific eyes Our primitive forefathers had no science capable of explaining that overpowering event. All they had at their disposal was fear, reverence and awe. Following the sheding of the light it became apparent to our forefathers the Sun above them had changed its appearance. Not only had it suddenly become much brighter it also seemed to be slowly organizing its surroundings. Due to proto-Saturn's plasmatic paroxysmal eruption its circumstellar disk had compactly shrunk leaving a wide gap between its inner edge and its stellar orb. There will be those who will hate what all this leads to, but as Talbott expressed it when asked what it was that our ancient forefathers meant by creation, he replied that the idea is remarkably simple. The creator fashioned a celestial band or circle around himself and this band became his cosmic dwelling. Basically that's all there is to it. Judging by the very words that our ancestors utilized that is exactly what they attempted to describe. As is widely known, the climactic entity of Elohim's creation went down into Western thought as the garden East of Eden. In reality, however, the book of Genesis states that Elohim planted the garden eastward in the Eden and I stress the word in rather than of. But even that is a mistranslation since the Hebrew word translated as eastward actually means ancient. And the phrase in question should be read as 'Elohim planted a garden in ancient Eden' were 'Eden' translates as a 'pleasurable place'. The word translated as 'garden', however, more correctly means 'an encircled area'. The word is derived from the Akkadian 'gana' which refers to 'an enclosure'. The Greek - that is Septuagint - version of the Old Testament uses the word paradisos for 'garden', which word is now rendered into English as 'Paradise'. This word is derived from a Persian one that also translates as an enclosed area. The same concept as aptly illustrated through persian belief which dictates that it was Hima who ruled paradise and he did so from an area known as a Vara which he circumscribed with a golden ring. Although I do not wish to stress it judging by their resultant illustrations there even these among modern artists who seem to have understood this concept quite well. Such for instance where William Blake and his description or depiction of the deity's creative effort and Giovanni Di Paolo in his depiction of the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the garden, both of them envision Elohim's created effort as a circular enclosure. Whether this resulted from mankind subdued nostalgia I will leave others to decide. I could go on forever and a day on this particular subject but time does not permit. Let me however clarify that, and this is most important, that following its abrupt flare-up the proto-Saturnian Saturn did not take long to develop a set of radiant plasmatic beams that continued to mesmerize mankind to no end. And although Talbott may have changed his mind at least to an extent on what the result amounted to, I present the manner in which he pictured it back in 1980 to which I personally still hold. It was this entire apparition that actually went down as the deities ordered arrangement out of the previous chaotic cloud that had originally surrounded him. And Dwardu says thank you for listening. 
[Music] A new study recently revealed the best evidence by far, of the cosmic filaments that connect ancient galaxies to what is called the cosmic  web. Mainstream scientists think these filaments in the cosmic web are  created by the elusive dark matter which clumps together into filaments, and causes normal matter to clump along these. Now so far, we have not been able to detect any of this supposed dark matter. The more we look for this dark matter, the more normal matter we find often in the form of plasma. For the first time, scientists have spotted what they term ”a pipeline gas filament” feeding an enormous galaxy that they believe formed  when the universe was only 2.5 billion years old. This discovery seems to support a long-standing model that suggests star-forming material is delivered to huge galaxies via these cosmic filaments. They have previously detected these filaments connecting the galaxies, but those were not able to capture detailed chemical information of this stream. Fu and his colleagues were able to identify the chemical signature of the gas streaming into the galaxy, thanks to a very rare and fortuitous alignment of some quasars. They believe these quasars are situated far behind the galaxies and could be used as a light source to help see the details in the gas stream more clearly. They were able to probe the abundance of chemicals in the filament using the light from the quasar. These showed that the stream lacked heavy elements such as aluminum, carbon, iron, and magnesium. This implied  that the gas had to be flowing in towards the galaxy, because if the gas was flowing out of the galaxy, it would have been enriched with heavy elements  which are produced by the stars in the galaxy. These filaments seem to  be the only way that this cold gas could get pumped into the galaxy, without being disrupted by the hot atmospheric surroundings of the galaxy. They believe that this is a process that is important in understanding how these massive galaxies formed in the early universe. Let's just take a step back here, as there are many aspects to this report which would lead to a very different conclusion. We will start with the fact that this bulk of work focuses on what they consider massive starburst galaxies, at high redshifts in the vicinity of background quasars. Add into this the fact that they  detect gas around these quasars, that appears to connect them to the galaxy  itself. Many of you will be familiar with the brilliant Halton Arp and his extensive work looking at exactly these scenarios. He found a clear correlation to the proximity of quasars and the host galaxy, and speculated that these quasars were ejected from the host galaxies, and would continue outwards from these and slowly develop into a companion galaxy  later on. He also saw very strong evidence of this ejection process occurring in an X-pattern  through the center of the galaxy. Here are some examples from the many, many images that Halton examined. Let's just take another look at this galaxy. We can clearly see the quasars, that they identify, seem to be strung out below the galaxy. Not in a perfectly straight line, but more an arc shape. Halton felt that this arc curve may be caused by the galaxy rotating by up to a quarter of a turn. We also see a companion galaxy off on the other axis, situated some distance from the host galaxy. Halton was also able to find examples of quasars that were clearly embedded in gas material, that connected all the way back to the host galaxies. This is exactly what we are seeing here as well, when Halton made these discoveries they were ignored as the redshift of the quasars would place them much further back than the host galaxies. Despite the connection via the gas cloud, the redshift of these objects is not  solely related to the recessional velocity, and hence their distance from us. Halton viewed that the redshift was instead an intrinsic component of the object, that as the object aged, would reduce. So quasars are initially born as high redshift objects, and then slowly reduce their redshift. Once they evolve into a companion galaxy, their redshift would be almost the same as the host galaxy. The important point was the redshift of the quasars was always an offset of the original host galaxy. And when  we look at the redshift of the object, we do indeed see  that the redshift of the quasar does reduce as you move further out.  So the first quasar would have a 0.242 higher redshift than the host galaxy and the second quasar only 0.075. So again, as we're moving further out, this is reducing. If we examine the two companion galaxies that they have identified, again here we see a much lower value for the redshift, as these in Halton's view would be more mature. Now these steps also fit quite closely with the quantization that Halton Arp saw for these types of objects, as they  move further out from the host galaxies. This galaxy also reminds me of NGC3067 and the quasar 3C232 which Halton Arp looked at. Here there was a quasar embedded in a hydrogen filament. Astronomers claimed that the quasar had to be situated behind the filament and  could not be embedded within it. The argument was that the filament at  the same redshift of the galaxy absorbed continuum light from the quasar, but did not show excited optical emission lines, proving that the quasar was much  further back than the hydrogen filament. Halton however, pointed out that in order to get to this conclusion, they needed to make a short extrapolation. The photons needed to ionize the hydrogen in the filament, and make it fluoresce, were at a shorter wavelength than those in the spectrum. The actual amount needs to be determined by the amount of hydrogen at redshifts intermediate between the quasar and  the hydrogen filament, the degree to which the filament was composed of small dense clouds, and the relative beaming angle between the ultraviolet and radio wavelengths of the quasar. These are all values they do not know, so they have to guess in order to derive their value. Now one important point to realize is that they see a direct link between these star-forming galaxies and the neutral gas reservoirs that may fuel the future star formation. Again, here  we must consider the type of galaxy. These are considered to be active galaxies and once more, these are exactly the galaxies that Halton had identified. These types of galaxies often had quasars associated with them and companion  galaxies. We know that these types of galaxies also output vast amounts of materials from massive jets that they produce. It was along these jets that Halton found many of the associated quasars. The material was not flowing inwards but was flowing outwards in his view, forming a sort of umbilical cord back to the host galaxy. Another important point to realize is that if you accept the idea that redshift is largely an intrinsic component of the host object, then  this too would apply to the galaxy. This immediately would mean that this too is not a distant massive old galaxy. Instead, it is a younger more active one in the  process of creating newer younger galaxies through the emission of these quasars. The increased activity will also lead to more energy within the galaxy, and hence a higher current density, leading to rapid star formation. They identify interesting absorption structures towards both quasars, which include variable metallicities and what the author sees as a filament structure which will eventually collapse to form a cluster of galaxies. This, and the  unexpectedly large covering factor that they have identified for the quasars, is much easier to explain if you take the bold step to see that these quasars are instead embedded within the filament. Where they identify a filament structure which is associated with the quasar, this is actually the umbilical  cord connecting the quasar back into the large filament  extending from the host galaxy. Galaxies undergo a life cycle which includes the ejection of material which forms quasars, which  eventually forms companion galaxies. We see all these phases in this galaxy and its surroundings. We see clear evidence of the existence of filaments connecting to the galaxy. We see companion galaxies located along two of the axes of the galaxy. And  most importantly, we see two quasars embedded within the filament and  these have a delicate filament structure that connects them back into this filament. At some point coincidences cease to exist. You  must start to see the data in a new light. Halton Arp was  a pioneer in this field. Our universe is electric and screams this at every possible opportunity. You just have to be willing to shake off the old paradigms to see it come to life. [Music] 
[Music] [Music] good morning ladies and gentlemen thank you for coming this morning to have it early to listen to my lecture on the logical inconsistencies of that special theory of relativity Einstein wrote a paper in 1905 that is heralded as a turning point in our understanding of the nature of space-time in the universe it's true in a sense but in the reality it's unfortunate because it's introduced the an element of mysticism into physics so so although it did have this effect it's been quite a disaster for science so first I'd like to start off with a bit of a discussion on dimensions in units because they're quite different if we call time T where we can measure the time T in any kind of unit we could use it in seconds or years so or hours and days and lengths if we call length L but we don't worry about the actual units that we use we just talk about length and other than that and we denoted by L and we can measure that in measures or meters have feedin light-years four inches and we have from our common experience three length dimensions length breadth and height for instance in a box we have the length of the box the width of the box the height of the box now the obvious thing about is that if you have a length can you add to it a time hello oh yes we're back the first thing is that if we consider now units we might measure length in meters and time in seconds can you add meters to seconds obviously you cannot so you have to be able to add it seems that we're working again so and you can't add or subtract meters from seconds and vice versa you can only add the same units in mathematics they're just numbers so if you've got no units to them you X's and Y's etc but in physics we want units there are unit unitless quantities constants and such but there are also constants that have units so units are very important to physics and strictly speaking an equation needs to be the left hand side and you in needs to have the same units as the right hand side and diligent engineer and scientist would make sure that they've got meters on one side if they'd want meters and the other side of their equation has also got meters because if they have meters equal to seconds there's a bit of a problem so ultimately they're different dimensions so if you go back to our generic dimensions length can't be met added to time and vice-versa but we already live in a four-dimensional world because we've got length three you three sets of them length breadth and height all units of length and we have time so we already live in a four-dimensional world in this sense but in Einsteins world length and time the three lengths XY z-- and Zed's for instance and time are jumbled up together so that you have a four-dimensional time which in which you can add and subtract all of these quantities in one equation so let's have a look at how we can denote a position in place and time where we'll have X is the length Y is the breadth and Zed is the height and we'll have T is time so a time and place can be specified by a set of coordinates X Y Zed in time for instance if you say to your friend I'm going to meet you at the cafe for a coffee at one o'clock well if you go there at five o'clock are you likely to encounter your friend probably not and if you decided that you didn't like the cakes can Y Zed coordinates you went to a different place you probably wouldn't make your friend either so you have to go there X Y Zed the right coordinates for the place and at the right time so we already live in a four-dimensional world so there's nothing new in Einstein's idea of a well not nothing new in the idea of a four-dimensional world in the terms of Einsteins conception of the universe because we already have that what is different is that the you cannot jumble up XY z-- ins Ed's and T's jumbled up time and space together which is what he has done so for instance the distance between two points depends on X Y Z and Z it doesn't depend on time the difference between Phoenix and I don't know LA the distance between there is XYZ and Zed's but it's not a question of time now that means that the four-dimensional world in which we live has modeled by Newton is consistent with Newton so we'll have now looking at Cartesian coordinates I'm sure you're all familiar with this from school usually we'll have the Cartesian plane x and y here we've had added the Zed so we have space but it's just like the corner of a room if for instance if you look at any corner of this room because it's a rectangular building we have an x y&z set of coordinates immediately before us and they are all perpendicular to one another not only that they're independent of one another so that any distance along well XYZ it's been purpose because they don't have components in each other's directions because their definitions so now I want to look at a right triangle when we see how the jumbled up nature of time and space is based on an error utilizing right triangles so we quickly revise the the theorem of Pythagoras and I'm sure you will remember that if you construct the square on the x axis as I've drawn it in this diagram in a square on the y-axis we have areas of those squares x squared + y squared from simple geometry and then you'd construct a square and the hypotenuse of the right triangle then we find that x squared plus y squared equals R star squared well that's just the area of - trying to two squares rather added together give you the area of another Square and usually in geometry in school the squares are dropped off and we just say x squared plus y squared equals R star square or what if you want to give a label to the hypotenuse of the right triangle but this is the theorem of Pythagoras but I ask you is asked well let's consider this R star is not a new dimension because it's composed of X's and Y's so it's not a new dimension it's not perpendicular to x and y it's a function if you like of x and y it's determined by x and y now we'll consider a circle and we'll draw the circle around the right triangle the right triangle hasn't changed but now we can reinterpret the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle as the radius of a circle it goes through the end of the hypotenuse where the hypotenuse is has its origin at the origin of the coordinates where x and y is 0 and again by the theorem of Pythagoras because it's a right triangle x squared plus y squared equals R star square now you can see why I label that R star because to give you the idea it's also the radius of a circle in this circumstance now is the hypotenuse of the right triangle in this instance perpendicular to X and y know it's still the right triangle and can x squared plus y squared minus r squared equals 0 never B not equal to 0 this is the important point we can see that it must always be 0 because x squared plus y squared equals R star squared so if you subtract R star squared from each side you must have 0 on the right side that's always 0 unless of course you're a cosmologist which I'll come to shortly so X&Y stay perpendicular to one another and even in this last equation x squared plus y squared minus r star squared equals zero the R star is not perpendicular x and y now let's go from the 2-dimensional to the 3-dimensional this is a sphere again our right triangle is present notice that in this case by the theorem of Pythagoras if you look in the xy-plane there x squared plus y squared equals R star squared that's the same triangle we've been talking about now if we go from the tip of the hypotenuse and go into the Z direction the lengths are from the origin to the surface of that sphere is R star squared plus Z squared and we know what R star squared is so we'll put that into the equation and we get x squared plus y squared plus Z squared equals R squared again we've applied the theorem of Pythagoras so the quantity R in three-dimensional space is not perpendicular to x y&z either and again if we take R star R squared from both sides of this equation I get x squared plus y squared plus Z squared minus R squared equals not can it ever be anything other than that of course it cannot again unless you're a cosmologist which I will show you shortly so but before I go to that interesting point let's revise what we know about speed what do we define a speed it's the distance that something moves in a certain time and we take the ratio of the distance the time that gives you a speed so in the case of the hypotenuse of that right triangle in the sphere that I drew in three dimensions the distance from one point to the other point or the from between the two ends of it is the square root of x squared plus y squared plus R squared because sorry x squared plus y squared plus Z squared because R squared is the square of the distance so the length of the hypotenuse is not R squared that's the that's the area of the square that we drew on it so the length of the side of the square is R so we take the distance x squared plus y squared plus R squared said sorry I'll say that again x squared plus y square plus Z squared take the square root of it that's the distance we divided by time and that can give us a speed in again whether we use if we use that the distance that for instance that light travels some distance and the time that light travels that distance and we take the ratio of that we have the speed of light just as though you had the speed of a truck if a truck goes from A to B and it travels it that distance in a certain time T well you can calculate its speed what's the same with light instead of the speed of the truck we put in the speed of the of light so we conclude from this that for so that neither VT nor CT now VT is a distance so if I say to gyro traveling at 60 miles an hour for one hour how far did you go well you take the speed you multiply it by the time and you get the distance you know it's simple instance it's 60 miles per hour times one hour the hours cancel out you've got 60 miles so VT and CT is not an independent fourth length dimension it's just how long did it take to travel along the hypotenuse of a right triangle unless you're a cosmologists because the space-time concept associated with Einstein and Minkowski it was actually introduced by Minkowski in 1907 and enthusiastically adopted by Einstein and all his followers ever since so now you've got a four-dimensional space-time continuum that just has curvature so space-time requires CT to be in an independent fourth length dimension because C times T that's a distance now we can add that distance to other things if you have a distance you can add it to distances this is how time is snuck in to an equation two jumbled up space and time and give you the idea of space-time well it's not it's just some kind of space with all length dimensions so mathematically treating C times T or V times T is the speed of a truck times the time had traveled does not make it but mathematically treating it as such does not make it so and does not make T an independant for that length dimension C T is not 1/4 length I mentioned V T is not a for think I mentioned and T on its own they can't even be a length so we going to go to the truck that I was talking about let's consider a truck moving along the hypotenuse of the right triangle form A to C now there are two ways you could get the right from A to C you could go along the x-axis at some speed you can go then along the y-axis at some speed and you get there but the shortest distance of course is along the hypotenuse as we know from elementary geometry so let's have a look at this a truck has a constant speed along R star is V in time T it travels from A to C along this hypotenuse of a right triangle then the theorem of Pythagoras applies and we say R star squared is equal to V times T squared and that's equal to x squared plus y squared and that means that V times T is equal to the square root of x squared plus y squared that's the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle and still our star equals V times T is not a new dimension and it's not orthogonal to X and Y so we write the equation of this right triangle as x squared plus y squared equals V squared T squared well recall we could draw a circle around that and that would make it the radius of a circle and if we subtract V squared T squared from both sides we still get x squared plus y squared minus V squared T squared equals 0 can it ever be other than naught well it's the right triangle the answer is it cannot again unless you're a cosmologists so now we'll go to the three dimensional analog because it's actually the same diagram except of draw or a spheric sphere around the right triangle and everything else applies in the same way as we did with the right triangle in the sphere before so instead of our we're well a truck travels from ADA to D at some speed V and so the distance along there is V times T and the x squared plus y squared plus Z squared equals V times T or squared well as we had before x squared plus y squared was equal to R star square or V Star V squared T squared that was the equation also of a circle so the equation for the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle also gives us the radius of the equation for a circle here we have the length of the hypotenuse is also giving us the equation for a sphere so right triangles are very important and again we can write x squared plus y squared plus Z squared minus V squared T squared equals naught it's always annoyed and it's not orthogonal to x y&z unless you're a cosmologists so we see that space time is not a 4d continuum let's replace the truck that was moving along from A to D by a light rain everything is exactly the same as before except now the speed is not the speed of a truck it's the speed of light so the trucks not going from A to D a light ray is going from A to D does anything else change not at all and so now we come to what the cosmologists do following Minkowski and Einstein so for the right triangle x squared plus y squared plus Z squared minus C squared T squared equals 0 always so it can never be not equal to 0 and it can never be orthogonal to x y&z it's always the right that's always the hypotenuse of a right triangle so if you take away the sides of the triangle and just leave the radius line does it change anything no it doesn't it's still the hypotenuse of a right triangle but we don't have the right triangle there anymore and with the right triangle disappeared magic is done because cosmologists write x squared y squared plus Z squared minus C squared T squared equals s squared it's not equal to know it and equal to know it is a special case according to them according to Albert Einstein and Hermann Minkowski but this is clearly a violation of elementary geometry all right now the fundamental reason why they start writing this their squared not equal to zero is because they mix it up incorrectly with what's called Riemannian geometry but if you want to have a four-dimensional space in pure mathematics you have to have four independent quantities well x y&z as we see by looking up at say the corner of one of these roots corners in this room you'll have x y&z they're independent of one another but we see that the speed between any points in that space is not independent because you need the XYZ and Zed's and the time to be able to calculate the speed so it's not independent the speed is not independent if I multiply speed by time the very same time I use to calculate the speed that's not independent either because it's the length of a right or the hypotenuse of a right triangle so to do four-dimensional mathematics you need four independent quantities well C times T is not an independent quantity treating it as an independent quantity by saying well we'll make it equal to s squared not equal no it doesn't make it true it means you made a mistake the length C T well what is it what its units or rather what is its dimension its speed times time so speed is length divided by time and then we multiply that by time well T cancels out ones in the numerator ones in the denominator and we're left with length obviously so just because you've got lengths out of some quantity doesn't mean that you've got a new dimension for instance if I multiply X by Y I get length squared and if I divide it by Z I get length squared divided by length that gives me length is X Y over zero you dimension not at all similarly with X square x squared over y or x squared plus y squared well x squared plus y squared still has the units of length squared or the dimensions of length squared so if you had meters squared plus meters squared you still got meter square or if you got length squared plus length squared you're still at length squared because it's not a change in any unit and if you divide length squared by length for instance x squared plus y squared Y divided by said you get length did I just make a new fourth independent dimension orthogonal to the x y&z not at all and finally if I take x squared plus y square plus Z squared and divided by X or Y or Zed I still get the dimensions of length but I did not create a new dimension it's not a new dimension that's not orthogonal to x y&z unless you're a cosmologists I know it's a bit of a tiring refrain but we need to remind ourselves what because ma leaders do so we never lose lose track of that so I ask you now if I have XY over Z is that the length of anything what is it the length of we've got our x y&z coordinates I take XY and I divide it by said what's that the length of it's not in the length of anything it has dimensions of length there's a formal mathematical relationship but what is that what is it the length of it's not certainly not the length of a hypotenuse of a right triangle then it's not the length of X or a wire it's just some combination of X Y Z and says to produce length but it's not a new dimension and it's not orthogonal to anything of those or those new dimensions it's just nothing it's not the length of anything and is it perpendicular to the XY z-- and Zed's well no so it's neither perpendicular to anything and it's not the length of anything even though it has the units of or the dimensions of length and it's made up of the XY z-- and Zed's so combinations of XYZ and says don't give us new dimensions so we come now to Einstein's fantastic clocks now will bear in mind the things that I've covered here when when we get to space-time it's off but before we do that we want to talk about I like to talk about Einsteins fantastic clocks and in his famous 1900 and what five paper Einstein defined time by means of these fantastic clocks that he concocted I'll read to you what comes from his 1905 paper the so called seminal work to turn physics into a completely new paradigm that changed our conception of space and time well it ruined our conceptions of space and time by turning it from from physics into a Fantasyland here's where Einstein says thus with the help of certain imaginary physical experiments we have settled what is to be understood by synchronous stationary clocks located at different places and have evidently dub tained the definition of simultaneous or synchronous and of time the time of event is that which has given similar tennis with you with the event by a stationary clock located at the place of the event this clock being synchronous and indeed synchronous for all time determinations with a specified stationary clock well if you can make sense of that you know it's that would be a miracle but you know let's see now there are a number of points I want to make about this the first thing is he wants systems of stationary observers holding clocks that can all be synchronized in other words they all read the same time so he wants systems of clocks synchronized stationary observers that's what he's saying there the other thing is he says he defines time well I'll ask you something do clocks define time do they did find time clocks no more define time than a pressure gauge defines pressure a speedometer defines speed a thermometer of the fine speed or a spring defines gravity because if time is defined by a clock wall all those other things must be defined by the measuring instruments but measuring instruments a measure are they were invented to do what to measure something other than themselves if a measuring instrument measures only itself it's pretty hopeless Einstein's clocks measure only themselves he has dispensed with physics something external to the measuring instrument and defines time in terms of his clock now he's fantastic clock can do whatever it likes independent of any physical reality and there boy warp stuff let's have a look at how he sets up clock synchronizations we're in from Einstein so there's no doubt we have so far defined only in a time in a B time he's got I'm T a time at a time in right oh we have not determined a common time for a and B this is where he wants to get he synchronizing clocks right for the ladder cannot be defined at all unless we established by definition that the time required by light to travel from A to B equals the time it requires to travel from beat away you go from A to B then you travel from beat away at the same speed well it should take the same time let our light little ray of light start at the direction of a and arrive again at a at the a time T primed a in accordance with the definition the two clocks synchronized if TB minus ta equals T prime de minus TB in other words if you go from A to B and you go and it takes a certain time you go from beat away at a certain time traveling at the speed of light they must read the same times that's his way of setting up clocks in that little diagram you go from a you go to B then you go from B backed away and you see that at a you start at TA you get the T you get at B you get TB and then when you get back to a you're at t prime day now he goes through as you see a great pains to define what he means by clock synchronization this is only part of it this is the part that I wanted to talk about now to emphasize again his systems of observers what do we see from his earlier statements he wants systems of clocks synchronized stationary observers okay that means everybody in this room who's sitting there you're not moving anywhere and you're all holding a clock and we want to make sure all your clocks are synchronized so that everybody says yes I've got the same time even though you're in different places well that's reasonable we want that experience tells us that's what we need Weinstein says let the time T of the stationary system now he's got a system of stationary observers and they're all got the same time so he's got now let the time - of the stationary system be determined for all points thereof at which there are clocks by means of light signals in the men are indicated in section one that's his elaboration on how he's going to synchronize his clocks send the light ray from A to B everybody comes back we have this relationship and that's it similarly let the time tour of the moving system so he's got first a system of stationary observers and with all their clocks and then he's got another system over here ones t and ones tour for their times so he's got now okay he says here where we are I've got my place I'll go epic and read anyway similarly let the time tour of the moving system be determined for all points of the moving system at which there are clocks at rest relatively to that system by adopting the method given in section one of light signals between the points at which the latter clocks are located - any system of values X Y Z and T yes one system which completely defines the place and time I'd event in the stationary system Einstein calls that a stationary system there belongs a system of values see e de xira int or determining that event relatively to the system K so if we have x y&z associated with a system big K and the Greek letters and for the system little K his big case systems moving and his little K or his big day system a stationary in his little K system is moving but according to him you can switch it around the little system guy could be stationed here and the other one could be moving because it's only relative motion now however as we know how to judge whether two or more clocks show the same time simultaneously and run in the same way we can very well imagine as many clocks as we like in a given CS CSS coordinate system each of them will help us to determine the time and events happening in its immediate vicinity the clocks are all at rest relative to the coordinate system they are good clocks what is a good clock maybe they were made by the Swiss they make good clocks and synchronized which means that they show the same time simultaneously well this is all of this long-winded stuff it says you're all sitting in the room and you've all got a clock where you're going to watch that's a clock and you've all got them synchronized so you read the same time that's all it means all of this just means that but you've got two systems so there's another set of people in another room the same size as this they call their clocks readings tour you call your clock readings too they call their positions see either and in Zita and you call it x y&z that's all so now we have his systems Einstein systems have observers there are two systems all having the properties we just spoke of big guy and little code Einstein likes to keep his little K the moving system and he's big K the stationary system but as I said you can switch it around it doesn't matter so in the left-hand diagram K and K there's no motion between these two systems of stationary clocks synchronized observers and in the other two they are moving well Einstein keeps the K capital K as his stationary system and he says that the little K is the moving one well if it's moving to the right in the middle one K is moving to the right with respect to K big K and on the other final diagram little k system the whole system is moving along to the left at some speed V well that's minus V according to K because it's in the opposite direction and Einstein systems of observers K and K are both clocks synchronized and stationary within their systems right they are not clock synchronized and stationary with respect to the one another those those systems because one systems moving with respect to the other ones so it's not stationary but if you're in one of those systems all your points are stationary and all your clocks are synchronized so if you're the one in little K and I'm the one in big K or my clocks are synchronized and all the points on the x axis are all stationary and in your system all your clocks on the z axis are stationary and all your x tour are synchronized Einsteins systems of clocks synchronized stationary observers are now an essential feature of special relativity he holds that the Lorentz transformation associates coordinates X Y Z T of a stationary system K yeah we'll look at the bottom the system of observers they're all stationary and they're all reading the same time with the coordinates see either Zeta and tour of the moving system that's the little system little K system at the top so the little K system is moving producing time dilation and length contraction a system of clocks synchronized stationary observers little K when at rest is not clock synchronized when they are all moving together or all move together with respect to a clock synchronized stationary system okay so in other words if you're in the case sister the big case system where all your clocks are reading the same time and you look at the clocks as they all pass you held by other stationary systems in their system it all goes haywire all the clocks are all reading different things so it becomes mind-boggling so now we're going to look at the Lorentz transformation the Rhenish transformation is on the left this was first introduced by Valdemar void in 1887 he didn't have the term bead oh that's the only difference the beter term which is one over the square root of one minus V squared over C squared this term did not occur or did not appear in Voight's transformation so if you take beter out you have voids transformation subsequently Poincare the French mathematician Lorentz the Dutch physicist and Einstein they adopted Lorentz transformation modified by this effectively constant beta because V is moving or the value of V is a constant it's the Russian ship between the two moving systems is such that the speed views are constant that means beta will be a constant for any given value of V will see is fixed because the speed of light so V over C and V squared over C squared that's some constant and we have a constant beta now let's eliminate from the from the X from the equations for the Greek ones a little key T we eliminate X so we solve this equation here the second equation for x we get the result and we stick it into the top equation and we get tor is equal to T over beta minus Z V over C squared it's just a simple bit of algebra you could do it but we won't bother with that the details here is because you could do it yourself and if T equals zero tor equals zero so in other words if tor is equal to t over beta that happens when Z is zero because if you look at the top equation sit z equal to 0 you get tor is equal to t over beta and then if tears nought torres naught so if you've got Z equals naught then you're gonna have T 2 as naught and toric wasn't that's what Einstein wants to do he wants to make sure that the two origins coincide at the time Teague was not as they go past one another but if tick was not so a but if Teague was naught you can just put in Teague was not in the top equation you get towards equal to minus C the over C squared professor Wolfgang Englehart wrote a paper in 2016 late last year and where he points this out and you see that well tor now is a function of position Z that's supposed to be the time of all the clocks in the stationary system so if torres if tears nought torque does not necessarily know it which means that since we're talking now here only about the system itself all the coordinates in the moving system itself all the positions in that system have different times right so that means einstein's idea of having clocks synchronized stationary systems actually fails because he wants to have T equals naught that toric was naught but if we make T equals not we don't necessarily get toric was not why because you also have to specify that Z was not but that's the position in the moving system so you see that the idea of having clock synchronization in the moving system fails because in that instance as Engelhard has pointed out all the tours are different depending on different positions so we see by using the Trent Lorentz transformation on the previous slide Einstein's clock synchronization doesn't hold unless tore mystique was not and Zeke was not well that's a special case here's his logical error now when I read Engle Hart's paper I could see immediately that I could generalize it because professor Englehart just had Teague was naught I said well let's make tor equal naught then we find for any time T in the movie in the stationary system there is always a place Z and the moving system where the time is always naught well that violates einstein's idea thus for every T greater than naught of the stationary system K there exists the point Z greater than 0 in the moving system little kaiware torres know it but they're both supposedly starting in offered zero and Counting well if you're both counting you get bigger than nought but here we show that you can always find a place where it's still nought but according to Einstein's clock synchronization this must be impossible Einstein's synchronization is inconsistent inconsistent with the Lorentz transformation this is a logical inconsistency in the theory if you have a physical theory that has logical inconsistency is it valid no if you have a physical theory that doesn't accord with the experiment is that valid no so there are two things that a physical theory must have it must have logical consistency and accord with experimental reality if it files on either one of those it files absolutely well here's a logical problem it gets worse this is just the key to the door so we see that by instance clock synchronization is inconsistent with the Lorentz transformation but he wants to make everything consistent with the lens transformation he didn't let's have a look at a systems of stationary observer so I ask a question our systems of stationary observers satisfying the Lorentz transformation clock synchronized in other words if I set up a system of stationary observers I make them satisfy the Lorentz transformation must they necessarily come out to be clock synchronized as Einstein wants them the answer well that's been the answer is no because we just proved that in the previous two slides now we can construct some counter examples let's construct a system of stationary observers which means that they don't change with time all the X's are not dependent on time they're stationary I'll take a real number Sigma and I'll put a subscript on an X and I'll say X sub Sigma equals Sigma X sub 1 X sub 1 greater than naught so if I give you an X sub 1 and you have the Sigma which is a real number you can say X sub 1 is located here on the x axis and all the others are now specified immediately by some value of Sigma that you can put in because Sigma is a real number so we have a system now of observers that we have labeled each one of them and so we can refer to each one of them as what they see as opposed to just calling it X and never knowing which one we're talking about it which is what Einstein does each observe a Sigma at position X sub sigma reads its own clock time T sub Sigma so X sub 1 you see there X sub Sigma they're located on the x axis and they're stationary so if we use X of Sigma equals Sigma X sub 1 and the first equation of the Lorentz transformation which was three or four slides ago and we stick it in there is only one way we can ensure that we get consistency that our inch transformation and we get this equation for the times t sub sigma equals t1 plus sigma minus 1 3 x 1 over c-squared if I put Sigma equals 1 what do I get T sub Sigma equals T sub 1 that's one case if any other value of Sigma the times are not the same in other words if they are systems of stationary observers that satisfy the Lorentz transformation they cannot be clocked synchronized here's an equation that I derived in a paper that I write but I have just given you the result rather than a derivation if you put Sigma X up Sigma equals Sigma X sub 1 and in T sub Sigma into the second equation of the Lorentz transformation that we saw earlier slide we get this complicated looking expression and again if we make Sigma equals 1 in that bottom sight equation Sigma equals 1 then we get 1 minus V squared over C squared plus V squared over C squared that's just 1 and that produces X 1 minus V a t 1 multiplied by beta that's exactly the Lorentz transformation in one particular case Einsteins case so we'll draw up here real graph here a little table of things we've got Sigma on the Left various values you can put any values you like I've put in a few except Sigma T sub Sigma Z sub Sigma and tour what will you see tour comes out to be the same but that's not synchronized in the moving system that's what the stationary system sees when it looks at the moving system the moving systems going past it looks at the system and says well all those clocks are in sync but all the clocks in my system or your system that's watching it are not in sync a copy clock synchronized now it can revert it because it's symmetric in the other system where you looking at the clocks they're all sync if you're in that system looking at this system you say well all my clocks are not sync but the ones in the other one that's moving past me are in sync well that's completely opposite the Einsteins remember the diagram all the ones on the bottom were all in sync and the ones that were moving past all right I think here we got the opposite so this is the stationary Lorentz transformation in other words this is a system of equations that is that's is for stationary systems of observers that satisfy the Lorentz transformation you can see here that the time cannot be synchronized but if I make Sigma equals one everything reduces to the simple expressions that we started with so I said here setting Sigma equals one in the stationary Lorentz transformation the Lorentz transformation used by Einstein is recovered however a system s that contains only one observer cannot by its singular character synchronize its costs with anything or Judge Samuel taneous of ncns Einstein incorrectly permitted his privileged observer Sigma equals 1 to speak for all observers thereby violating the fundamental tenets of his theory that no observer is privileged in other words he had a tested assumption that he could construct systems of clocks synchronized stationary observers with the Lorentz transformation we see that it's only a true in one sort of in one case Sigma equals one but in that case it's the only one in the whole system there are though others in the system can it synchronize with anything no there's only one clock in the system itself can it measure distances no because it's only one point it's like taking the point out of the whole x axis and looking at the point itself the other XS the rest of it has disappeared so it can't measure this or anything and it can't be privileged because Einstein requires that they're not privileged that's why once whole systems of clocks synchronized stationary observers no ones privileged this is the inverse transformation I just put it there for content now we look at clocks synchronized systems so I asked the second question our systems of clocks synchronized observers satisfying the Lorentz transformation stationary the answer is no we can construct counter examples here by we making taking the Lorentz transformations and we insist that all the clocks in the capital K system read the same time T so that's on the left and the only way to do that is using the kawrench transformation is by setting that equation up then we ensure that every clock in the in one system is synchronized so they read the same time can they be stationary well we see here that when we solve it all we get for X sub Sigma there are all functions of over time X sub Sigma equals 1 minus Sigma C squared T over V plus Sigma X 1 where X 1 is greater than 0 but arbitrary now we see that X sub Sigma is a function of time that means it's not stationary so although observe all observers in K o'clock synchronized through a common time T only x1 is not a function of the time T if I put Sigma equals 1 in I get X sub 1 is equal to x1 that's not a function of time that's Einstein's privileged observer 1 in a set of how many well they're infinite sets so he has one element out of an infinite set not the infinite set and he takes that one element and allows it to speak for the whole infinite set of observers that's wrong here we see counter examples here's their orange transformation for clocks synchronized observers notice that Sigma can only have limited values it's not a it's not the whole set of real numbers it's only one minus V over C is less than Sigma is less than 1 plus V over C and if V is nought we get 1 is less than Sigma is less than 1 that just means it's 1 Einstein's observer again so if we set Sigma equals one in the clock synchronised system we recover the Lorentz transformation used by Einstein it's a privileged observer he's not allowed to have that because he says we don't have privileged observers it pertains to only one observer in system K and one observing system K the little K by tacitly assuming systems of clocks synchronized stationary observers consistent with the Lorentz transformation Einstein incorrectly permitted he's privileged observer Sigma equals one to speak for all observers thereby violating the fundamental tenets of his theory that no observer is privileged this is the set of equations for the inverse clock synchronize Lorentz transformation they're going for content now Lorentz invariance according to the cosmologists in Einstein and Minkowski remember when we did the right the right triangles in this end in the spheres and we had x squared plus y squared minus s squared plus said squared minus C squared T squared equals zero well Einstein requires that no matter how the systems are moving they all must come out with exactly the same equation the only change being the symbols any cause this well this is called Lorentz invariance so they require this top equation so when you change from the XYZ and T to the Greek ones for the moving system you get the same equation well we remember that that's always at naught cosmologists think that that's not always not so but by the Lorentz transformation we have x and y not sorry y&z don't appear there zero because everything's moving along the x axis so we can make that zero and we can therefore reduce the equation to a simpler one x squared minus C squared T squared is equal to the C squared minus C squared 2 squared but if we substitute now the findings of the previous slides for the stationary system we get this complicated expression and this is true for all values of Sigma so Lorentz invariance is maintained by the counter examples that I've constructed well we expect that because I constructed it using the Lorentz transformation so we would expect that they have a Lorentz transparent invariance that satisfies Einstein's requirement but again this is not a single this is not a single observer it's many observers infinite set now here's the same relationship for the clock synchronized Lorentz transformation and we get that expression I'll go back to the other one there is that expression for this and there's the expression for this system and again we see when you put the nut put all the things in there you get Lorentz invariants the only change in the equation is the symbols that's what he wants so the counter examples satisfy that condition now we compare the observers let's take the the stationary Lorentz transformation relation that before in equator to the clock synchronized Lorentz transformation they're not the same unless Sigma equals 1 so if I put in Sigma equals 1 this becomes an identity because in any other case they're not equal they satisfy the renze invariance individually but when they're equated they only hold when Sigma equals 1 that's Einstein's privileged observer which he allows to speak for all elements of the infinite set of observers that's his mistake so Einstein system of clocks synchronized stationary observers holds holds for only one observer no other observers are equivalent thus Einsteins tacit assumption is false in the special theory of relativity is false here's a wave equation this is a simple wave equation sine wave this is a little bit more complicated because we now we have a differential equation the wave equation the standard wave equation electrical engineers I'm sure are familiar with this because it's related to electromagnetic radiation so if you have a wave polarized in the Y Direction traveling in the X direction with speed C this equation describes it it's called the standard wave equation right this is a one-dimensional wave equation as opposed to a three-dimensional wave so I don't expect you all to understand that but the point of it is we have a nice little sine wave here that's a wave equation it's a plane wave so now special relativity requires the wave equation to be invariant under the Lorentz transformation in other words the equation when you put in the Lorentz transformation on the left hand side equation you get the right-hand side it's exactly the same equation except that you've just changed the symbols so now the standard wave equation becomes invariant between moving systems systems that are in constant rectilinear motion this is what Voigt wanted to do in 1887 for reasons that are only known to avoid because it doesn't make sense so using the standard or using the stationary Lorenz transformation I take the counter examples that I've constructed and I put it into the standard wave equation and I get the thing on the right this is invariant only when Sigma equals 1 again Einsteins privileged observer if you put one in there you see comes out to be the standard wave equation otherwise it is not so the idea that the Lorentz transformation makes the standard wave equation invariant under its transformation is patently false Voight was wrong and hence pancamo was wrong Lorentz is wrong and Einstein wrong but this is central to special relativity without at all special relativity is a dead duck here now I'll use the clocks synchronized Lorentz transformations we get exactly the same equations again Sigma equals 1 is the only one that makes it invariant that's Einstein's privileged observer he doesn't know that what he's done he takes this privileged observer and he lets it speak for all of them so now he thinks he's got clock synchronized systems of stationary observers when he doesn't he only has one and one is meaningless so we compare the wave equations they are the same only when Sigma equals one comparison of positions and times they are the same only when Sigma equals one so we now conclude systems of clocks synchronized stationary observers are inconsistent with the Lorentz transformation Einstein's theory of relativity is therefore logically inconsistent it is therefore force and the Lorentz transformation is meaningless because it does not matter it does not do what it says or already claims that it can do it does not and so that concludes my rather technical discussion proving that the special theory of relativity is a fairy tale thank you [Applause] [Music] [Music] you [Music] 
Preparing to the today's talk was a bit of a challenge because we now have a worldwide audience and many viewers probably have never heard of the Electric Sun Model or the SAFIRE experiment. SAFIRE experiment is charged with the task of exploring the theory that our Sun, all stars, are electrically powered. To do this we have a chamber with a little ball in the middle, this is our little Sun. Then we fill the chamber with various gases, apply various voltages and create an electric plasma discharge. We then must design experiments and collect data and that data will be compared with the wealth of NASA, the European Space Agency, other agency, data and ideally SAFIRE experiments will replicate the type of measurements done of our Sun so that we can have an apples to apples discussion with their scientific cousins in these organizations. And if I do my job well we'll also be able to suggest new ways of looking at the existing satellite data that will highlight electrical aspects of the Sun. Designing experiments to prove scientific theories is difficult. There is no instruction manual for how to do it. I recall vividly my teachers who studied with the generation of Schroedinger and Durac trying to impress upon us young physicists that the data you collect in any experiment can be interpreted in many ways. And if one which is to create a new scientific model, as they had helped to create quantum mechanics, then you need to think big. And they were clear to tell us, the struggles you will end up facing will not only be scientific. You will also find yourself fighting political battles and sometimes even religious battles. To look at the difficulty of verifying new scientific models we can look at another instance in history where they were disagreements about the fundamental electrical nature of our universe. A short story about the vision of one scientist and the data he collected. In the late 1800's Kristian Birkeland had an intuition that the Earth and the Sun were electrically connected. Now this was not the prevailing idea at the time. The prevailing idea was that the Earth and the Sun were electrically isolated from each other. So we have two theories, on the one hand the Earth and Sun electrically connected, on the other, the Earth and the Sun electrically isolated. So how would you prove which theory is correct? Birkeland made many excursions into the Arctic regions of Norway and with hand held magnets he measured magnetic fields on the ground while the Northern Lights blazed over head. So on the left of this figure we have Birkeland's theory that the Sun and the Earth are electrically connected, in the middle a little schematic of a model, showing electrical connection between the Sun and the Earth and down the bottom there you can see Birkeland walking around the Arctic with his hand-held magnets. Now the data he collected on the ground actually matched his model and he took that as support of his theory. Now on the right hand side of this drawing you can see the prevailing idea of the time, no electrical connection between the Earth and the Sun and a well-known mathematician of the time created an elegant theory to show that all you needed was heat from the Sun and that would generate local convection currents above the Earth's poles and this then would generate the same exact compass measurements on the ground. And that second theory is the one that won out. Now the passage of a hundred years has somewhat blunted the story for you and me and we don't know anybody personally connected with it, just an anecdote in the history of science. But it bothers me and I often think well could those measurements taken beneath the Blazing Northern Lights could they really not tell us which theory was correct and the answer is no, they could not. As all too often happens the data works equally well in both models and one theory prevails usually more for social or philosophical reasons than scientific reasons and Birkeland never got to see his ideas accepted. The isolationists won out until about the nineteen seventies when satellite measurements were good enough to actually show that there are indeed electrical connections between the Earth and the Sun. You saw this earlier, this is one of the beautiful discharges from our chamber, we'll call this one the flower discharge and it's actually not spherical it's more disc shaped and it's not clear what the conditions are that produced this. So we're now at a time where there is the real possibility for a paradigm change in astronomy, enough data has been collected that probably future astronomers will grow up studying such concepts as electrical double layers, electric potential over large distances of space and cosmic Birkeland currents. The study of the Sun is a particularly fruitful area for studying electricity in space. Here is a short list of observations collected over many years by many different people in the EU community. Not to read them all, just to give you an idea that t'was quite a bit and with each within each one of these there are actually thousands of papers and conference proceedings so the good news is there's a lot of material for us to choose from. Now for the point of view of where we're at currently with SAFIRE here's a short list that I will be talking about, of specific areas to focus on. So I'll talk about each one of these in course. This is one of the, lot of us have seen this one, of the very confusing diagrams about the Sun, a plot of the Sun's temperature as a function of height above the sun's surface. So at 0 height on the left hand side there in the photosphere about five thousand degrees and as we move away from the Sun the temperature increases in very specific jumps as you move away and then at a certain point the temperature shoots way up very quickly through the transition zone up to millions of degrees. Now with this, if the SAFIRE experiment sees something like this, in our Chamber, that's a major win for the electrical model of the Sun. And just to be clear, no one has yet flown a thermometer into the Sun. When you see statements about the sun's temperature like these, those statements are made by looking at light emitted from the Sun. Some of the light emitted from the Sun is in discrete spectral lines and scientists can use spectral lines to measure temperature. For example we might be measuring just one line from one element on the Sun, say neon or measuring one color of neon light from the Sun. And we can examine the details of how that line changes as you move away from the Sun so here's a short diagram to say what I mean here. You can imagine three different cases, in the top diagram this one here, the width of the line, the size of your spectral line is broadest close to the Sun and then it gets more narrow as you move away from the Sun and you, if you do if you're using line width to be a proxy or an estimation of temperature you would say, well things are cooling down as I move away from the Sun, sometimes that's called the campfire model that things get colder as you move away from the campfire. Now we can imagine a different case, this middle one here, where the width of the line stays the same as you move away from the Sun. Now if we saw that then we would say well by using line width as a measure of temperature, it stays the same as you move away from the Sun, OK, and then the last example, one down here which is more like our real Sun, the line widths increase as you move away and so again using this as a proxy for temperature you say, things must be getting hotter as we move away. So using this as just one principle, just one of the many principles we have at our disposal, we can look at some movie of some actual, the SAFIRE spectra which you saw earlier but I like watching it ok. Real-time, this is what it looks like.. That's when all the USB ports blew up on the computers. Now there is a wealth of information as you could imagine in this spectral data, we can just choose one, one slice one snapshot from that and we can just choose one of the lines in one of the snapshots and we can look at that line from different points in the chamber so here's a picture of the chamber and you can see the center glow is the anode right this part here and then down here do you see these cylinders, those are fiber optics, that's what's collecting the light, collecting the light in the chamber and you can see how they point in different directions so one, you know, one we can point where we want, one just grazed the anode, one of looked at halfway out, maybe one looks towards the cathode, so this is a way that we were exploring that how, can we measure line widths and other properties at different points in the chamber. It actually was not obvious when we started out if it was even possible. So we can look at that again just one line, one spectral line. Here's a plot that shows just looking at, actually this is more than one line, several different lines and looking at their widths, so all the ones over here these are all red and these are blues. There are, these are blue spectral lines in our discharge and over here the reds like a rainbow, over here are red spectral lines in our discharge and you can see that here's like for example, you know, 12345 different points up here, they have more width to them, so the vertical axis on this graph is how wide the line is, so this group here has more width to their lines than this group down here. So that was great so we verified yes, we can show that we can distinguish different line widths in different parts and then I went back and I said, wait a minute which which which groups are these, and this whole group up here was all from fiber optics looking at the anode or close to the anode. Sorry, backwards, this group down here was all looking at the anode, close to the anode, this group here was all looking away. So again, if we use this as a proxy for temperature which, I'll say it more later there's other ways to look at it, then we've got already here some kind of strange result where it looks like, even in our chamber, temperature might be might be higher as you move away from the center. Now here is, looking at one particular point, it's not only there's no there's another way that this we analyze the data it which is the shape of a line, not only how wide it is but the shape of it and it actually tells us a fair amount about the physics so for example if your line width, your line shape is fit by Gaussian statistics then you're probably looking more at temperature and indications of temperature. If your shape is fit more by a different kind of statistics, Lorentzian statistics, then you're probably looking more at electron density in the chamber. And so again, our job was to say well, can we measure these differences and yes we can measure these differences within our Chamber. Alright, moving onto the next item on the shortlist, coronal streamers. It's gonna be a movie of SOHO, ultraviolet data, so the Sun is in the center there these are coronal, called coronal streamers flying off. Now people at the Catania observatory in Italy, Ventura and Spadaro, they looked at these coronal streamers and they wanted to examine things like temperature, how does the temperature vary inside of these streamers. Ok so that white line there shows you like an example of where they were sampling data and they found some pretty strange results. Here's here's some of their data, they were using line width, the width of the spectral lines as a measure of temperature. What they found unexpectedly was that it depends upon what element you're looking at and so all of these upper plot points here these are all from oxygen atoms inside the streamer and as you move away from the Sun those oxygen atoms get hotter and hotter and hotter okay, these down here are all using the same method, looking at line width as a measure of temperature but for hydrogen. Hydrogen is a hundred times colder, this is a logarithmic plot. A hundred times colder and it gets cooler as you move away from the Sun. So, needless to say, there are unexpected results, and it's not at all clear what this, why this would come about. It also makes me wonder if we really can make such simple correlations between line width and temperature. Cause one person would say well clearly your oxygen is hotter than your hydrogen. Someone else might say well, you know what, maybe we don't really understand the connection between line width and temperature. I would be one of those people. It gets even better, now they're gonna look at that temperature profile as you cut across a single-streamer ok, so that line there shows slice perpendicular to the streamer we're gonna look at the data across that, look at that oxygen and hydrogens again. So here's a plot of the intensity as you cut across the streamer and that makes sense, it's, there's more intensity coming out of the streamer in the middle, right. Quiet, then it gets intense than it's quiet again. Now let's look at what happens if you look at the temperature of oxygen as we cut across. Well it is hotter outside the streamer, then it cools down in the streamer, and then it gets hot again, right. Look at hydrogen, just the opposite. It's cooler outside the streamer, the temperature goes up as you get inside the streamer and then it's cold again as you go on the other side. So these were extremely strange results. Now I think this is a, could be as a consequence of electrical activity on the Sun but again we have to design experiments that can verify this. This is one particularly beautiful discharge. So whether or not these discharge structures that we see, whether or not they correspond directly to photosphere granules, whether they correspond directly to coronal streamers ok, all this is yet to be established but the approach, again to emphasize, the approach of SAFIRE is that we need to mimic the types of measurements that are done of the Sun, OK. So we would use our fiber optics to look inside of these structures here, the same way that the people in Catania used the STO data and we'll see if we have measurements that correspond. Now we have the added benefit of having additional instruments, like for example a Langmuir probe which can measure the plasma characteristics, voltage potential, ion, electron temperatures, so we can take that data then and then suggest back to other people new ways they can look at the existing satellite data. So now given all this is how we gonna go to Monty and I say, Monty we need to be able to move the fiber optics across the anode tufts, the anode tufts are about two millimeters across, I need a positional fiber-optic that's down to about point O five millimeters, can you do that for me? And as you heard earlier today he comes back eventually and goes, yes I can do that for you can do it. And I asked Lowell, I say Lowell, do you think, can you look at the Boltzmann equation for our situation, see what you think that the temperature, the measured temperature of oxygen and hydrogen would be, do you think we would see the same sorts of things that we see around the Sun? OK, under the next item in the list, that was the first ionization potential anomaly. The first ionization potential anomaly is a well known but unexplained observation of our Sun and other stars and an analogy will help a lot here so imagine that you are throwing a very big party, hundreds of guests there from all walks of life some rich, some poor, some men, some women, married, not married and imagine that you notice a pattern, you notice that there's always the same set of 12 people that go outside and talk outside for a while. And amongst those 12 it's a mix, some are young, some are old, some are married or not and they're not smoking, so what would they have in common, why do they go outside? So when you're thinking that over, now we can switch to the astronomical case, something happens very similar to this party example, to the chemical elements on the Sun and a certain group of elements are much more likely to be found outside the Sun than on the surface of the Sun. So for example on the photosphere we see about 35 magnesium atoms for every million hydrogen atoms but in the solar wind leaving the Sun there are four times that many magnesium atoms. Another example, we see about forty seven iron atoms for every million hydrogen atoms on the photosphere but a solar flare might have a hundred times that much iron and for helium it's exactly the opposite, there are fewer helium atoms in energetic particle emissions from the Sun than there are in the photosphere so what makes these special, why do some of them tend to be found outside the Sun, why do some of the guests tend to go outside the party. So it seems that it all comes down to, how easy it is to pull an electron off of that element. Now if it's easy to pull an electron off of an element then we find more of that element outside the Sun like in solar flares or the solar wind and physicists have a name for how easy it is to pull an electron off of an atom, it's called the first ionization potential. So here's a plot of various chemical elements, the horizontal axis, horizontal axis here is how easy it is to pull off an electron, you can see over here on the left, about four volts is what you need to pull off the first electron off of potassium then there's a progression and when you get out to here like neon and helium it's really hard to pull off an electron off of those elements. And the vertical axis here shows is how much more likely it is to find that element outside the photosphere so you can see the elements on the left, the ones where it's easy to pull an electron off. Those are the ones that you find more abundant in emissions from the Sun and elements on the right with the higher ionization potential are less likely to be found outside the Sun. So going back to our analogy, we found a property that tells us why, might tell us, why these twelve people keep going outside the party. Now why this one property of first ionization potential should lead to all of this is not at all clear from the standard model of the Sun where you only get to use hot gases and magnetic fields. It is explainable from the electric Sun model but the main point is, we need to design an experiment that will measure it. So like NASA, we would use spectroscopy to remotely deduce the abundances of different elements close to our anode and like NASA we would use a mass spectrometer away from the anode to measure the elements far from the anode. So now I have more requests for Monty, Monty can we coat the anode in magnesium, magnesium has a low ionization potential then Paul if I give you fiber-optic data and mass spec data what other factors do you need that will give us good statistics on the DOE. So I hope you can start to see the flexibility of the SAFIRE chamber, that we can ask such a wide variety of questions and actually stand a good chance of running experiments to look at them in the laboratory. Next on the list. So sometimes it's important to step back and look at the forest, not the trees and as many have heard here, one of the outstanding features of the Sun is its discrete layers and their very very different properties. So here's a combination, on the right there the photosphere, we see a lot of that, then just just a hair's breadth hair's breadth above the photosphere is the chromosphere which if you look at it closely looks a lot like a fur coat with clouds floating over it, very strange. And then you move out a little bit more, the lower Corona, that's where you see all this incredible loops and x-ray emissions, lot of dynamic activity, pulling back further you see the upper Corona which again has a very different properties, these wispy hairy filaments that extend out for long long distances. Then there seems to be a long stretch where things don't change that much in the solar atmosphere, until you get to the heliosphere boundary and right now the Voyager satellites, as we know, are out there going through some boundary of some kind what it is, is now been thrown up into question, this is an artist's rendering of the Voyager satellites out of the boundary of the solar system. Now these probes are returning very interesting data, on the left it shows a plot of Voyager measuring the electron density as it's passing through the boundary, on the right is a plot of the density of positive ions as it's going through this boundary and the main point is these rapid fluctuations that we see at the boundary. Are these rapid fluctuations due to bow shocks and supersonic flows or we all know that these rapid fluctuations are actually a quite natural consequence of electrical double layers. So the Voyager data is taking place far out from the Sun right, so that's not us measuring close to our anode that's measuring us far away from the anode in our chamber. So again I could ask Monty, I need a Langmuir probe, it also has to have sub millimeter resolution cause I need to see the fluctuations in our chamber and compare them to the data we're getting back from Voyager and see if we see something similar. Next item It's coronal, I call it the coronal jolt. So, CME-s, coronal mass ejections, are spectacular emissions off the surface of the Sun, they're sometimes associated with the solar flare, a solar flare is an eruption that's very localized on the Sun, very small spatial location solar flare and one of the main unanswered questions about CME-s is still, are they large-scale events or are they small-scale events. Now the small scale camp says CMA-s start from a solar flare, they start from a very small part on the Sun which then blasts out and fills space around the Sun and goes away and that's how you get your CME and they have some data that supports their model. There is another camp that says no CME's are actually a large-scale event that the eruption that we see is taking place over such a large area there is no way that a single point on the Sun can lead to all that and this camp also has data to support their theory. So now we're gonna look at, so this is the Sun in UV extreme UV and I want you to look at the lower right side of it. Pulse, pulse, pulse can you see how that, the outer atmosphere, can I draw on this, the outer, we're looking here primarily you'll see it here, the outer atmosphere of the Sun and I want you to look for pulse down pulse down.. So it, that may look like not much going on but that is billions of cubic miles of plasma that is behaving all as a single unit over about 40 minutes so that's actually a very big unified action from the Sun, the coronal mass ejection is taking place on the far side of the Sun here, so we don't see the coronal mass ejection. We only see from the back side, we see the whole atmosphere of the Sun pulsing like that. So do we see something like this in SAFIRE, and yes we do and probably you've seen this a couple times over this weekend, this is our anode and then periodically there's a buildup of energy close to the anode, then it will release explosively and then the anode is notably dimmer afterwards ok, here's a little video which you saw already but it doesn't hurt to see it again, buildup, release and then dimmer. So once again the commissioning phase of SAFIRE exceeded our expectations, not only can we resolve high-speed plasma discharges from the anode but we already have data indicating a direct correlation with existing NASA data. And lastly, comets. As many people in EU community have said, there are many aspects about comets that only make sense if the electric Sun model is true. Here is a couple of photos of 67 P, so in conjunction with Franklin Anariba SAFIRE group working out some very specific experiments to examine the electric comet hypothesis. You saw this little while ago. This is one of the ways we're gonna examine it is to place different materials, possible materials on the end of our probe and then send those materials in various orbits around the anode. So that blue line is tracing out the orbit, just an example, sample orbit that we could send something on inside the chamber. This is one of the materials we're going to start with, more of this is again from Franklin's suggestions of type of material to start with and so for example, one set of experiments we could run, see on the left there, I have a column for what's the cometary feature that we are mimicking and in this case it's certain materials that we know are on comets, of course there's a lot of disagreement about how much of the materials are on comets, whether comets are ice, whether comets are primarily rocky but on the left camp column there you see various rocky elements that we'll start with. And in the middle, it's kinda what what's the SAFIRE example of that, well it's it's a piece of rock, like you can see there in the photograph, and then what will what kind of measurements will we make that will mimic existing measurements of outer space. And so for example, and there's a lot of detail to this if you saw Franklin's talk, he'd predict to see the certain gases, certain organic compounds coming out of this, and in particular, you know, if we see a increase concentration of water in our chamber, as we're zipping this rock around, then we know it's from electrochemistry and not from a dirty snowball. So that would be an example of how we could mimic existing data with a different model. Dustification. I think he made up that word. Dustification of the comet nucleus is also something we can look at. Here's a picture of 67 P so the fact that 67 P was rocky is not a surprise to EU theorists but the presence of dust, large amounts of dust, not so obvious. So if 67 P was blasted off of Mars, yes there would be a lot of dust created right, but it's so small the comet, would it really attract all of that just back to itself, you know, I don't think so. So how would we explain something like this where not only do we have a lot of dust, these lanes of dust throughout the comet, but if you blow that up it actually looks like it's been a dust landslide ok, so this begs the question, maybe dust is being continuously created on the comet, OK. So this is another thing we can do, we can, over the course of time, look for the type of dust if any that's created. Franklin Anariba thinks that the electric discharge will break down the larger silicates structures into smaller silicat dust but this remains to be seen through an experiment. And hopefully the folks at ESA will publish some data about 67 P's dust composition. Another example of how we can look at our situation to examine comets, we're going to look at all the properties around our little comets, electron density, the temperature, elemental analysis and so will you see here this sketch on the, on the right here, this is an analysis of the comet Hale-Bopp, it was the Swan telescope in 1979 I think 97, returned some UV images of Hale-Bopp and then if you use a certain reasonable assumptions about the nature of the coma around the comet and you compare your observed UV emissions to your model you get this, these interesting set of plots for the temperature. As you move away from the comets, so here according to this model, the temperature should drop as you move away from Hale-Bopp and then go up and then drop and go up etcetera. Now this is very reminiscent already of measurements that we are collecting inside the SAFIRE chamber, electrical double layers have a lot of these kind of oscillatory qualities to them where something is, like electron density, will go up and down up and down as you move away. And of course, the filaments. Here's a wonderful gallery, I love this, of its different filaments around 67P and I realized as I was listening to my introduction that we should, we should carve our little rocks into the same shapes as various comets and then see if we can replicate simply the morphology of the discharge around the comets. Alright so that's the end of my presentation, thank you very much for sticking with me, couple of meaty ideas out there, but it gives you a taste I think, of the SAFIRE chamber and how versatile it is. The number of different questions we can ask and actually take actual measurements to verify, so thank you very much and wanna explicitly thank the people who are making this experiment possible. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project at Thunderbolts.info. Quantum experiments have long demonstrated that subatomic particles somehow know about each other instantly and at great distances. Institutional science utilizes terms such as "quantum entanglement" and "spooky action" to describe the phenomena. But the Electric Universe theory offers a very different perspective. The speed of light limit to communication imposed by the Theory of Relativity is not a universal speed limit. Physicist  Wal Thornhill  describes how this can be observed in our own celestial neighborhood. He writes: "If gravity traveled at the slow speed of light, the Earth would be pulled to where the Sun appears in the sky and not the Sun's real position in space. This would result in a slingshot effect and toss planets out of the solar system in short order. Observations of close binary stars where the effect would be extreme and quickly noticeable show that gravity must operate at a speed in excess of 20 billion times the speed of light to prevent spiraling orbits. The Sun and the Earth have instantaneous information about their locations." In this Space News episode Nicholas Sykes elaborates the fundamental differences in this regard between the Electric Universe and standard cosmology. In my Thunderbolts' Space News video, "Are the Dominoes Falling?", it was argued that since the gravitational attraction between the Sun and the Earth must operate almost instantaneously or else the Earth and the other planets would be slung out of their orbits. This fact was, irreconcilable with the dictate of the Theory of Relativity that the fastest possible messenger between one point and another was light or, to be more accurate, the electromagnetic radiation of which visible light might be a component. This is because if the supposedly fastest possible messenger between the Sun and the Earth travels at the speed of light, then the gravitational attraction that exists between the Sun and the Earth could not be messaged between them any faster than light can travel between them. Since it is known that light takes 8.3 minutes approximately to travel from the Sun to the Earth, it would have to be presumed that the gravitational attraction is messaged from the Sun to the Earth and vice versa within a period of time no shorter than 8.3 minutes also. However, such a deduction must inevitably bear with it the conclusion that the Earth is actually being attracted to some point in space that was the location of the Sun's center of gravity 8.3 minutes of time in the past, rather than where that center of gravity actually is when the Earth experiences the attraction. But that conclusion bears with it a number of fatal contradictions. Contradiction Number One: let us regard the planetary orbits of the solar system as circular, which we may do without prejudice to the argument. A centripetal force upon the orbiting Earth must be orthogonal to the motion of the planet. However, the gravitational force transmitted from the Sun to the Earth at the speed of light will, when it reaches the Earth, be displaced from the path it would have taken if the force had operated instantaneously. It is no longer orthogonal to the Earth's orbit hence is no longer centripetal and would influence the planet over an astronomically short time to leave the orbit, yet this does not happen. Contradiction Nmber Two: there is no time lapse term in Copernicus' or Kepler's equations for their observed planetary orbits, which do not therefore anticipate any time lapse such as gravitational attraction functioning as slowly as the speed of light would necessitate. Neither is there a time-lapse term in Newton's Third Law, which we interpret as "Action and reaction are equal and opposite." In a Newtonian heliocentric system, we understand the forces of attraction that the primary and its satellite exert upon one another to be equal and opposite. A reaction that was caused by an action 8.3 minutes beforehand, in the case of the Earth and the Sun, would no longer be the opposite that the law describes. The effect of this can be seen from my diagram of the Sun as the reference point or frame of reference for an orbiting Earth. The issue is very well dealt with in the Thunderbolts Forum of October the 22nd 2016, in which reference was made to work by Tom Van Flandern, in which Sir Arthur Eddington was quoted: "As having exposed, by 1920, the issue in terms of the couple, which a lightspeed gravity between Sun and Earth would exert." This is the same argument as I am using, employing a slightly different viewpoint. I have not actually read this work before my video was produced. It is left to others to account for the fact that Eddington became a great proponent for Einsteinian relativity, in spite of his work on this issue. The connection then between the Sun and the planets should be envisaged as an ether tightrope. In the current EU Model, the ether of space is understood as Wal Thornhill describes it "to consist of a plenum of neutrinos." In our experience a rope may carrier a transverse wave caused by moving one end of the rope, perhaps from one side to the other or perhaps up and down. After some time that transverse wave motion will reach the other end of the rope. However, if the rope is made of barely extendable material and if one end is tugged, that tug will be felt at the other end, very much faster, almost by comparison, of the time the tug is made. This comparison may be likened to the relationship between the transmission of light by transverse electromagnetic wave and the very much faster gravitational attraction between two massive bodies. Electromagnetic radiation is by its nature transverse but gravitational attraction or, indeed if it is so interpreted repulsion, is longitudinal. Kepler's and Newton's laws may be thought to assume any time factor to be so vanishingly small that it can be neglected altogether. The EU Model of gravitation requires an almost instantenaity condition too, though that almost is not claimed to be collapsed into absolute instantenaity. There is, after all, the possibility of a correction of planetary orbits that start to go astray by extra Newtonian electrical attractions and repulsions for Newtonian physics does not account for the orbital stability that is observed or the small corrections that are from, time to time, manifest. Such corrections, however, could not prevent the first-order steady propulsion out of any orbit that a lightspeed gravity would inevitably produce. There are many other arguments against Einsteinian relativity, some of which declare that the great story of the ether drift experiments of the last century is commonly misreported. The light exceeding speed of gravity by far is but one more falling domino collapsing a credible Theory of Relativity.

Welcome the Space News from the Electric Universe brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at thunderbolts.info On February 15th 2013, a large meteor exploded violently in the sky over the Urals region Russia. Thousands of homes and buildings were damaged and more than 1,400 were injured by the explosion which produced as much energy as two dozen Hiroshima sized atomic bombs. The object was the largest to strike the Earth in over a century since the Tunguska meteor of 1908. Astronomers tell us that meteors are electrically neutral rocks that sometimes explode due to heating and pressure in Earth's atmosphere. But when we examine the Russian meteor, does this explanation fit with the facts? Well, it was big, they say it was the biggest thing to hit the Earth in 100 years. It didn't really hit the surface of the Earth because it exploded high in the atmosphere and this itself raises an important question because it's not actually understood how all this happened. Ironically the event was caught on many cameras because Russian drivers, in order to defend themselves in court or to collect insurance, had installed dashboard cameras. So many were driving eastward in the vicinity of Chelyabinsk, Russia, February 15th, and suddenly they and their cameras had a perfect view of an incredible spectacle as this cosmic intruder lit up the dawn sky. Based on infrasound data from around the world, NASA scientists now say that the meteorite was more than 1,000 times larger than originally believed this modified conclusion reveals the difficulty for astronomers in explaining the extraordinary energies of the exploding meteor. The evolving scientific interpretations during the day are interesting particularly the interpretations of size based on visual data. Initial estimates, coming from the Russian Academy of Sciences implied a small body weighing perhaps 10 tons but just a bit later in the morning astonishing infrasound data from stations as far away as Greenland and Africa came in at the low frequencies of infrasound well below human hearing the event was heard around the world. NASA then released new estimates of size, not 10 tons, but 10,000 tons! The implied energies were incomparably greater than the visual trail in the sky had initially suggested. In fact, that trail alone made it look as if the bolide was fully degraded before reaching the ground. Complicating this question of size is the fact that the envisioned 10,000 ton body failed to create any impact site on Earth. But if the picture is left in confusion that's because no one has addressed the evident electrical component of the event. Infrasound is the efficient vehicle for sound transmission from electrical blasts such as lightning from the upper atmosphere. It's electrical energy that fills in the missing pieces of the story. Scientists loosely concluded that the rock was perhaps 55 feet in diameter arriving at 40,000 miles per hour, producing a trail some 125 miles long. A huge explosion high in the atmosphere produced a shockwave injuring 1,400 people, largely from flying glass. That explosion makes this an unprecedented event in modern times. This entire display occurred in just 30 seconds, and it's been assumed that the explosion occurred because of internal heat and pressure. But how likely is it that in just 30 seconds the center of the rock could be heated to the temperatures required for it to explode? When larger meteorites have landed on the Earth very quickly, they became stone-cold due to the freezing internal temperatures. If you're wondering about this you might try an experiment. Take an acetylene torch to a good-sized rock for 30 seconds, you'll create a surface temperature over 1,600 degree Celsius, more than 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit, you'll see that the heat from melting rock has not been transferred more than a few inches at most. But somehow due to energies inside the Russian fireball, it exploded so violently and so completely that only tiny gravelly pieces could be found. And incidentally it was briefly thought that a 20 foot hole in the ice of a lake west of Chelyabinsk was caused by residual chunk of the bolide, so divers investigated, they could find nothing. Disintegration began some 30 miles above the Earth then in just half a minute it released the energy of some 20 or more Hiroshima sized atomic bombs including a blinding flash that was described by one observer as bright as 10 Suns. Onlookers had to turn away from the glare. It's hard to see how the common picture could even work. Heat the leading edge of the rock just to a melting temperature and every bit of melted rock would continually be blown off the object by the winds at thousands of miles per hour. How could this spectacular blaster of light by this object be produced in such a way? The blinding flare-up saturated the cameras, a perfect analogy to the electric glare of an arc furnace or an arc welder. One video in particular requires closer examination, because it's suggestive of exploding material much like you see in arc welding projected in the direction of the objects flight. We can't vouch for the authenticity of this video, nor should we ignore it. We can only hope it will be scrutinized up to the level it deserves. What is certain is that the meteor did explode and in the manner expected of a charged body disintegrating under electrical stresses. You see this in an exploding capacitor as non conductive material violently breaks down, that's the electrical interpretation of this Russian meteor explosion. Another example in the electrical viewpoint would be the sudden flaring and disintegration of negatively charged comets, as occurred in the cases of the comet Elenin, comet Holmes, comet Schwassmann-Wachmann, comet LINEAR and others the demise of the comets occured not due to warming from the Sun, but in response to charged particles from the Sun. Astronomers now suggest that the Russian meteor should serve as a catalyst for developing anti-asteroid and meteor defense systems. But to proponents at the Electric Universe, the Russian meteor validates the notion that the Earth possesses a natural defense against impacting bodies. Celestial intruders such as asteroids and meteors are more likely to produce catastrophe, not from the kinetic forces of impact but rather from electrical discharge explosions. Not to be forgotten in this connection is the famous predecessor event, the Tunguska explosion in 1908, when a cometary or asteroidial body exploded above Siberia leveling 800 square miles of forest, some 80 million trees, breaking windows more than 100 miles away, but leaving no appreciable impact crater. Both the recent event and the Tunguska event remind us of Wal Thornhill's suggestion, that the Earth has a natural electrical defense system, one that would cause a larger bodies to disintegrate on entering the charged region of Earth's upper atmosphere. This wouldn't eliminate the catastrophic effects, but it would surely displace the most popular image of asteroidal catastrophe on the Internet today. So perhaps one fact is more significant than has been acknowledged: despite hundreds injuries, not a single individual died in this event. Something far more devastating would surely have occurred if the object had released the energy of its explosive blast by striking the surface of the Earth.

[Music] Men are from Mars and women are from Venus. Most modern readers are familiar with this adage, but very few, I suspect, are aware that such ideas were already commonplace by the time of  Homer. Thus it is that a famous passage in the Odyssey tells of the illicit affair between Ares  and Aphrodite. In the song in question, the two lovers are entrapped while making love in an invisible net devised by the lame smith Hephaestus, much to the amusement of the other gods who are witness to the entire scene. For well over 3,000 years now, scholars and laymen alike have been scratching their heads, trying to figure out whence Homer derived this body tale, one  which the ancients themselves found more than a little blasphemous. Was  the love affair between Aphrodite and Ares a product of the blind bard's vivid imagination? On the contrary, there is much reason  to believe that this particular vignette, like so many other famous scenes in the Iliad and the Odyssey, represents a vestigial remnant of an age- old oral tradition and as such was deeply rooted in ancient religious ritual, especially marriage ritual. Our earliest and likely most reliable witness of ancient Greek wedding practices is the melancholy poet Sappho, who wrote about 700 BC from her island homeland Lesbos. For Sappho, Aphrodite represented the archetypal bride. The raging  war-god Ares in turn, she describes as the divine prototype of the bridegroom. Thus a recently discovered fragment reads as follows: quote, ”A bridegroom will come equal to Ares , bigger by far than a big man.” According to Sappho, the Greek marriage ritual held that the bridegroom was somehow infused with the divine charisma of the celestial goddess. Gregory Nagy summarized the available evidence as follows: ”In the wedding songs of Sappho, the god Ares is a model for the generic bridegroom who is explicitly described as ‘equal to Ares’ in  Sappho Song 111. Correspondingly, there are many instances of implicit equations of the generic bride with the goddess Aphrodite. In Sappho Song 112, for example, the  bridegroom is said to be infused with the divine charisma of Aphrodite evidently by way of his direct contact with the bride.” End of quote. A number of questions present themselves at this point. The most obvious perhaps is the following. To what extent, if any, were such traditions inspired by the actual appearance or witness behavior of the planets Mars and Venus? To even pose such a query, is to risk ridicule in classical circles, not to mention in astronomical departments around the globe. As it turns out, Sappho’s peculiar report that Aphrodite imbued her Ares-like bridegroom with charisma, offers a decisive clue. For as we have documented elsewhere, analogous traditions surround the planet Venus and other cultures. The testimony from ancient Persia is especially instructive here. According to The Zend-Avesta, the planet Venus was identified with the goddess Anahita. Anahita, who was intimately associated with ancient conceptions of sovereignty and kingship, was believed to invest the king with charisma. Quote, “She legitimated the enthronement of the king, providing him with charisma.” Strangely enough, such ideas were surprisingly widespread throughout the ancient world. Analogous conceptions are commonplace throughout the various cultures of Inner Asia, where the charisma imparted by the planet goddess was a favorite theme among the Huns and the Turks, for example. Quote, “To become a real ruler, the Hunnic supreme ruler had to possess sacral grace. Through it, he ensured the welfare of his people, as well as fertility, successful  military campaigns, etc. Among the Iranians, the notion of sacred charisma is expressed with the concept of hvarna, farn, and among the Turks with the concept  of qut... Thus, the Iranians and Turks both believed that the most important quality a ruler need to have to be able to govern was the result of the blessing and support of the Great Goddess.” End of quote. To reiterate, in order  to assume the throne and ensure general welfare and fertility, the king must first  receive the charisma of the Queen of Heaven, the planet Venus. This is getting curiouser and curiouser, as they say. In what sense is it possible to understand the planet Venus is infusing the ruler or bridegroom with charisma? What exactly is charisma? The Greek word ‘charisma” comes from ’charis’, a word often translated simply as ‘grace’ or ’splendor’ but attested in a wide range of different, albeit related meanings. Thus ‘charis’ denotes not only the beauty of Aphrodite, or any other young woman, it can also describe the glory or undying fame awarded to a winning athlete after some great contest. It is possible to be more specific here; ’charis’ describes an effulgent aura or corona-like crown, encircling another object. Indeed, according to insightful analysis of Richard Onians, Homer conceptualized ‘charis’ as “a wreath or crown about things.” Additional insight into the luminous charisma associated with the planet Venus can be obtained from the religious traditions of the ancient Near East. For the earliest cultures of Mesopotamia, the union of Inanna and Dumuzi represented the paradigmatic model of marriage, much as the union of Aphrodite and Ares did for the Greeks. In dozens of ancient hymns, Inanna-Venus is represented as the exemplary bride and Dumuzi as the prototypical bridegroom. Famously, an archaic Sumerian ritual found the king impersonating Dumuzi and engaging in a sacred marriage with the planet Venus as Inanna. In order to legitimate his hold on the throne and secure fertility throughout the land, according to various early literary accounts of the right in question, a key episode found the planet goddess imbuing her royal bridegroom with radiant power. This idea is evident in an old Babylonian hymn. Quote, “Oh Inanna, a husband worthy of your splendor has been granted to you... You, oh mistress, you have handed over to him your power as is due to a king, and Dumuzi causes a radiant brilliance to burst forth for you.” Francoise Bruschweiler in her masterful analysis of the symbolism associated with Inanna, offered the following commentary on this particular hymn. Quote, “This passage is interesting due to the way in which, in the context of a sacred marriage, the luminous essence of the goddess is passed over to Dumuzi.” End of quote. It will be noted that sacred marriage culminates in the luminous essence of the goddess being given to Dumuzi. Equally instructive is a testimony provided by an early Sumerian epic poem entitled ‘Enmarkar and the Lord of Aratta’, described as quote, ”...probably the finest piece of storytelling ever produced by the Old Babylonian authors.” In the epic in question Enmarkar is repeatedly brought into close association with the planet Venus. Most telling for our purposes here is the following passage where an Enmarkar  kingship is explicitly credited to the planet, quote, ”The ever-sparkling lady gives me my kingship.” End of quote. The word translated as ever- sparkling here is mul-mul-e=”to shine, or radiate,” a verb form from the Sumerian word for ’star’ mul, and hence referring to the luminous splendor of the planet Venus itself. The clear import of this passage accordingly, is that kingship itself is a gift of the planet Venus. Far from being figurative in nature, the  language of Enmarkar and the lord of Aratta, is best understood in literal fashion. It is the planet Venus who makes the king by enveloping him with a radiant crown of glory or charisma. With regards to the specific astronomical details of the planetary conjunction,  commemorated in ancient traditions of Aphrodite imbuing Ares with charisma, it is important to understand that our model requires that the red planet be positioned squarely in front of the larger Venus within the so-called polar configuration of planets. It was this decidedly extraordinary conjunction of planetary powers that was conceptualized as Aphrodite enveloping Mars with charisma during their sacred marriage. Or alternatively, as Inanna’s imbuing of Dumuzi or Enmarkar with the luminous crown of kingship. As a result of these awe-inspiring natural events, the red planet was viewed as having gained sovereignty as king of the gods. Indeed it is precisely because the marriage of Venus and Mars is functionally analogous to the crowning of Mars, that we would understand the fundamental connection between the sacred marriage right and kingship. Thus it is that, from the standpoint of historical origins, to be king meant nothing less than to be married to, or conjoined with the planet Venus. It goes without saying that the unique conjunction of planets described here is quite impossible in the current solar system due to the fact that Mars being a superior planet, can never appear in front of Venus, an inferior planet. Hence the bold challenge to conventional ideas of astronomy presented by a radical historical reconstruction based largely on the written testimony of the ancient sky watchers themselves.

today individuals who wish to learn about unconventional or unpopular theories face an enormous obstacle before determining the theories validity one must first gain an accurate understanding of what the theory actually proposes for individuals seeking to learn about the electric universe this task is remarkably difficult due to rampant misrepresentations of the theory both by uninformed or sensational would-be proponents and critics of the theory alike a surprisingly prevalent tactic against the electric universe is the characterization of its proponents as quote conspiracy theorists let us lay aside for the moment the question of the prevalence of actual quote conspiracies both throughout history and in the world today let us explore instead why is this accusation made specifically against proponents of the electric universe I want to talk today about why it is that people who believe that there is some problem with scientific theory are frequently labeled online as conspiracy theorists what this talk is not about are people who actually talk about conspiracies I'm specifically referring to the situation where one person is talking about science and the other person is calling that first a conspiracy theorist this happens enough online that it demands some sort of an explanation I would argue that this practice is enormous ly destructive to society's ability to talk about lesser-known innovative ideas in science if every time that people want to talk about an idea in science which diverges from the textbook theory there is this societal reaction to isolate and label that activity is something it is not even intended to be I think there needs to be a very strong reaction to this subtly destructive behavior Michael as you very well know plasma cosmology is a topic that has been published in I trip believes transactions on plasma science for many years now in a sense it is classical science insofar as the theorists have traditionally sought out inferences for astronomical observations which pertain to classical physics principles electricity magnetism plasmas double layers and so on in the methodology itself is really quite scientific insofar as observations within plasma laboratories like tokamaks of filamentary electrical structures have inspired theorists to suggest that cosmic plasma behaves in similar ways it's a perfect example really of what is meant by empirical science so why is it that when people refer to the electric universe are more more appropriately plasma cosmology online these people are commonly labeled as conspiracy theorists the fact of the matter is that there isn't a trace of conspiracy within the thunderbolts groups publications these theorists are talking about plasma science astrophysics and cosmology and their thesis is that academic institutions should be modeling the cosmic plasma to better match our observations of laboratory plasmas there should be no confusion that there are mistakes in the textbooks right now and history is just littered with spectacular examples of mistake and expertise and Michael they all have something important in common try to see if you can pick up on what I'm referring to as I run through four significant examples number one when radio waves were first observed coming from space by radio engineers the astronomical community assumed it was either a mistake or a hoax second when the maser the lasers microwave precursor was invented the world's most prestigious quantum theorists claim that the prototype which was already created was impossible due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle third it wasn't that long ago that the scientific community regarded meteorites in the same way that modern scientists regard UFO abductions and psychic phenomena quaint superstitions only believed by peasant folk and fourth rocket-powered spacecrafts were ridiculed virtually all the way up until 1944 when they started raining down on London during World War two the common aspect that people tend to miss with these stories is not the simple fact that the entire scientific community was wrong I think the most people generally understand that this is happened the key aspect to realize is that the scientific community does not today strive to teach these stories as less which students of science and the public can learn from on the nature of scientific consensus and so they're evolved zapper dicta bollec perception that these kinds of fundamental mistakes are rare in our modern times one a quote bill Beatty he says intellectual suppression has a long history involving an eccentric but revolutionary science throughout the history of science famous researchers who eventually created an entire new fields of science initially found it nearly impossible to publish their research some didn't succeed for years even decades the scientific community ignored them but eventually they were heard eventually they conquered the suppression but only after a major fight the journal editors rejected their papers because the new research results were in conflict with common knowledge it was too eccentric yet the eccentric ideas were right and common knowledge was not skipping ahead note well that nobody can inspire to silence these revolutionary researchers editors and fellow scientists simply assume that the eccentric papers were misguided so that is the vital context for the question that I want to pose if we don't need conspiracies to explain like experts and textbooks have even in modern times been wrong then why do people commonly conflate those who disagree with textbook scientific theory with conspiracy theorists here is my unexpected answer to this tricky question the story more or less starts with Edward Bernays the relative of Sigmund Freud who showed American corporations for the first time how they could make people want things they didn't need by linking mass-produced goods to their unconscious desires quoting Pat Jackson Rene's colleague and public relations adviser what Eddie got from Freud was indeed this idea that there is a lot more going on in human decision-making not only among individuals but even more importantly among groups than this idea that information drives behavior so Eddie began to formulate this idea you had to look at things that will play to people's irrational emotions so where am I going with this the point is that here in the United States we are already accustomed and actively encouraged to behave irrationally all the time it's just an aspect of how businesses sell things so given this history which clearly has nothing at all to do with a conspiracy here's what people need to ask themselves does this subconscious aspect of the mind simply shut up when the subject switches to science or alternatively can we think of this ideal of thinking like a scientist in part as a process of keeping these natural subconscious tendencies in check fast-forward more than half a century to 2002 when Daniel Kahneman was awarded the Nobel for taking Bernays ideas to the next level for many years the practice of marketing weather for a product or an idea was considered a sort of fluffy black magic by CEOs and others because it lacked an actual model for what what was happening in the mind in regards to human decision-making that all changed with Kahneman's contributions to decision science whose work has come to affect all of the social sciences my own suggestion will will be to propose that Kahneman's work can naturally explain this conspiracy theorist labeling and the implications are enormous if I'm right for the way we talk about science online because it ultimately points the way to how we might design Future Sight social networks that aim to make online discourse more scientific Kahneman's claim is that when a person encounters complexity they will either consciously or implicitly realize they lack both the time and inclination to research this claim if he's right then that realization arrives as a feeling which makes it faster than any rational thought and therefore our initial reaction that feeling then Prime's whatever rational thought that follows the subconscious is a natural reaction to everything that happens to us based upon the patterns we've formerly experienced the key is to realize that you don't intentionally think it it happens to you this process more formally known as associative coherence appears to the rational thinker as believable narratives as probably most adults would acknowledge these seemingly fully formed ideas just pop into our heads the thing about associative coherence that is not widely understood by the public is that it benefits from a lack of detail as details are added in what happens more often than not is that the believable narrative turns out to be wrong so what I see a lot of online is that people have formed a system of beliefs about science which they subconsciously use as a filter to limit the effort of rational thought and this is a natural response to information overload these largely sub conscious decisions to refuse to learn about something can create significant ignorant of that particular thing and this can happen even if the person is extraordinarily intelligent in other aspects or activities much of the news media by the way actively encourages and reinforces this filtering behavior so here is the important bit this empty cognitive space becomes a playground for associative coherence people who have not actively sought to teach themselves about certain things in science must fall back onto these far simpler patterning based processes for evaluating claims about those things my own personal observations online confirms for me that Khan Amon is right that this behavior is extremely common even amongst academic researchers so what I'm saying is that when a person does not actively seek to develop a new instance understanding of academic research things like how it works the limits of scientific methodology and domains critiques by whistleblowers critiques of peer review and historical examples of failed expertise the people who refuse to actively learn about these things are more prone to simplistic associations of those who disagree with textbook theory - conspiracy theorists I see it all the time people who label others that are actually talking about science as conspiracy theorists will completely ignore the scientific arguments being made and project their own lack of understanding upon the very person that is trying to educate them about some innovative scientific idea as Kahneman's model continues to disseminate throughout our culture I believe that it is just inevitable that we will build communication systems which help people to see their only tendencies towards associative coherence by exposing it in the others they are talking - we cannot see in ourselves but we can see it in others and in that indirect way we can make online scientific conversations more scientific [Music] [Music] you 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info Human beings around the world may be witnessing one of the most significant dramas in the modern history of the Space Sciences. The European Space Agency's Rosetta mission to the comet 67P has shattered the theoretical predictions of standard comet theory. For many decades we were told that comets are dirty snowballs which formed billions of years ago, tracing back to the solar system's origins. If comets are indeed primordial aggregates of ices and dust, then they should have very smooth nuclei covered with abundant water ice. Several previously imaged comets had already falsified this expectation. Nevertheless, Rosetta scientists fully expected the nucleus of 67P to be cold, smooth and covered with ice. In November, the team will attempt to use harpoons and ice screws to secure a lander on the Comet's dry, extremely rocky surface. As millions of observers around the world can see with their own eyes, 67P provides a stunning refutation of the standard comet theory. Not a single trace of water ice has been observed on the Comet's surface. Instead, it's burnt black, as cold terrain is tortured with numerous cliffs, pits, craters, rocks and boulders. It is as far from a dirty snowball as one can imagine. For decades, the prediction of the Electric Universe has been that comets, asteroids and meteors were excavated electrically from planetary surfaces. Consider this side-by-side comparison of Comet 67P and the Sawtooth Mountains in New Mexico. Let us ask ourselves, which of the competing comet theories most closely predicted the features of 67P. We asked Wal Thornhill for his summary of the Rosetta mission to date, beginning with the most fundamental flaw in standard comet theory, the notion that comets are primordial. The European Space Agency, ESA, named the Rosetta mission after the Rosetta Stone, a key discovery in human history that allowed us to unlock critical components of our own history. ESA chose that name because they wanted the mission to provide a bridge to the past of our solar system. The same way that the original Rosetta Stone provided a bridge to an ancient culture that had previously not been understood. Now, there's some irony in this because the ancient Egyptians remain misunderstood because we project onto them our unquestioned belief that their environment looked the same as our environment does today. As a result, many mysteries about their astronomy still beg explanation but are ignored. The same is happening with comets where we have an unquestioned belief about their origin, which renders researchers blind to anomalies that should consign comet theory to the trash bin of history. A NASA news report in August titled: 'To Catch a Comet by the Tail' 'Rosetta's historic meet and greet with Churyumov - Gerasimenko' highlights the problem in its introduction, and I quote: "Scientifically speaking, comets are complex remnants from the very earliest times in our solar system. They accreted, or grew, out of the same spinning gas cloud that gave rise to the Sun." End of quote. This statement is not scientific! It's merely a, once upon a time long, long ago and far, far away bedtime story. No one has observed the stars or planets forming in such a way. In fact, the most recent evidence shows stars forming non-gravitationally along glowing filaments in molecular clouds. And thousands of exoplanetary systems make our solar system look the odd one out. We're also told, in this report, and I quote, "Because of their stealth and seeming unpredictability, comets have traditionally invoked terror, suspicion and awe in human kind." End of quote. What research shows this? All forensic investigations into the earliest references to comets identify the archetypal doomsday comet with a highly visible planet, Venus. Space scientists know nothing about history and so fail to learn from it. Stealth and unpredictability are no answer to our fear of comets. The possibility that within human memory the planetary system has been unstable and nonetheless achieved clockwork stability within that brief period, challenges Newtonian dynamics and is dismissed without a moment's thought. But the singular defining feature of a comet is its elliptical orbit. Its motion toward and away from the Sun. It requires an electrical model of the solar system to explain a comet's appearance and non-gravitational orbital changes. Clearly, a comet nucleus the size of Venus would invoke terror, suspicion and awe in human kind. But NASA's misinformation doesn't end there, and I quote, "Previous comet-centered missions have revealed just enough to allow us to unseat prevailing theories, but not enough to firm up new ones." End of quote This is pure spin doctoring. There has been no change in the prevailing theory of comets, just ad-hoc adjustments to a centuries-old story. Tradition dies hard! And as for new theories about comets, what are they? But for me, this statement takes the cake, and I quote, "In 2005, NASA threw a coffee-table-sized spacecraft at comet Tempel. The resulting Deep Impact explosion was shallower than anticipated, but nonetheless implied that comets may be more porous than previously thought and not armored with an icy exterior or shell." End of quote. So the flash before the main outburst didn't happen?!? The ad-hoc explanation at the time was that the impactor must have hit a hard shell before burying itself in softer material, and causing an unexpectedly dazzling outburst to follow. I alone predicted both the initial flash, the energetic outburst and a shallow crater due to hitting solid rock. "The impact/discharge wil be into rock, not loosely consolidated ice and dust." Now NASA scientists tell us that the crater is shallow because stuff fell back and partly filled the crater. This assumes a half-witted audience that thinks of the Earth's gravity operating on the comet. But even on earth, how much debris from a massive ground explosion falls back into the crater? If NASA's researchers were asked to give evidence in court as expert witnesses, they would be a laughingstock. Their stories make no sense whatsoever. So what of the Rosetta mission so far? The Rosetta mission to comet 67P is providing us with unprecedented close-up images of a comet's surface, but the most remarkable thing to see is the selective blindness of researchers caused by prior beliefs about what a comet is supposed to be. A primordial ball of dust and ice. And I quote, "It was so surprising to see that this is not a smooth, hummel-shaped body as we've thought it would be," said Holger Sierks, the lead scientists behind OSIRIS, Rosetta's 4 megapixel camera. The scientists are still putting together why the comet might have such an odd shape. "One possibility is that 67P is actually two comets that have been fused together," he says. "Although it's also possible the comet was somehow carved, through impacts or some other unknown force, into this strange figure." End of quote. It seems we're about to have another concocted explanation that leaves the scientists comfortable with the old story and business as usual... That there is no surface ice is a big surprise to the scientists, many of whom expected to find a glassy clean surface of crystal ice to screw the lander harpoons into. But they say, the comet still is icy below the surface. - We see water coming out. So there must be a way for the water to escape. These are statements of faith in the old dirty snowball model, not facts as we shall see. The rubber-duck-shaped comet is clearly rocky and complex. It shows stratification, craters with fluted walls, areas that seem to have been formed by a flow of some sort and peaks aligned like part of a broken-off mountain range. In other words, the comet looks more like a scarred fragment of a planet surface than a dirty snowball. And despite the absence of ice, there are faint jets just over the horizon, that show the comet seems to be suffering a form of surface erosion at the neck of its odd rubber-duck-shape. But there are no signs on the comet neck of neat holes forming venturis needed to produce narrow vertical jets from sublimating subsurface ices. This complex scenario follows the tradition of astrophysicists invoking hidden activity within stars and planets, to explain awkward observations. Many features on the nucleus appear to be the result of electric spark erosion which forms scalloped or fluted cliffs about an edge depression or crater. This process can be seen clearly in action on Jupiter's moon Io but then there's the question of why the jets seem to be issuing preferentially from the neck region. Spark erosion takes place in the form of vertical cathode jets which are initiated where the electric field is strongest, on sharp points or edges, and where the surface composition is most readily ionized. This suggests that the mineral composition in the neck of the comet may be different to that in the attached lobes. And such preferential erosion may be responsible in part for forming the neck and rubber-duck shape. Talking about composition of the comet. The Comet's density measured by its gravitational influence on the Rosetta spacecraft will give an entirely misleading idea of the Comet's composition. The reason is simple, although inexcusable in the 21st century. It's the confusion by physicists of mass with quantity of matter. For more than a century scientists should have known, according to E = mc², that the mass of subatomic particles is an energetic variable dependent on the local electrical environment. That is why the so-called universal constant of gravitation is so maddeningly inconstant. The comet's environment is quite unearthly. As a result, I confidently predict that the chemical and physical makeup of the comet will confound researchers. The nucleus looks like solid rock because it is solid rock! The failure to observe a single trace of water ice on the surface of Comet 67P has not deterred investigators from the assumption that substantial water ice must still be present, but is hidden from view under the comet's surface. Proponents of the standard theory point to evidence of water detected in cometary comas as proof that comets are indeed icy bodies, slowly sublimating from solar heating. However, what is spectroscopic analysis really telling us about comets? A clue to this question may be provided by recent scientific papers. In a 1998 paper on the formation of Mercury's ice deposits, the authors write: "Oxygen-containing surface rocks could release water through sputtering by protons from the solar wind." On October 7th of this year, phys.org featured the headline, 'Study shows most water in lunar soil generated by solar wind'. The article states, "A pair of researchers... has determined that most of the water in the soil on the surface of the moon was formed due to protons in the solar wind colliding with oxygen in lunar dust...". Institutional science has never explored electrochemical processes creating the signal of water in cometary comas. Indeed as Wal Thornhill tells us, the science of electro-chemistry may reveal that spectroscopic instruments are not detecting water at all. So what about the measurements that are interpreted as several liters of water issuing from the comet per second? The cathode jets strip and ionize atoms of oxygen from minerals on the comet and accelerate the negative ions away in a fine jet. The oxygen ions then combine with the protons in the solar wind to form the hydroxyl radical OH, which is mistakenly assumed to be evidence of an ultraviolet breakdown product of water molecules from the comet. Oxygen and hydrogen have both been found in the comet's coma by the Rosetta ultraviolet spectrometer. It should be noted that the earlier Stardust mission supported this by finding surprising high temperature minerals in comet dust. This fits the picture of comets as highly modified planetary debris rather than being primordial. There is no need to invent ever more special conditions and add-ons to the age-old solar nebula story of solar system formation. That story has been discredited both theoretically and with each new discovery about comets, asteroids and weird extrasolar planetary systems. One planetary scientist admitted that he needs a separate theory for each planet in our own solar system. The double-lobed form of Comet 67P is considered one of its most extraordinary and baffling features. Indeed, this basic form has been seen on several comets, including comets Halley, Borelli and Hartley and additionally numerous asteroids. As described in several previous videos, this form is no surprise to proponents of the Electric Universe. Several years ago, plasma scientist C. J. Ransom replicated this form in the laboratory with a high-energy electrical discharge to a mineral surface. Scientists have proposed that a low-velocity collision between two comets occurred in the past, then mysteriously melded together to create 67P's double-lobed body. But as Wal Thornhill explains, this ad-hoc theory stretches credulity beyond any reasonable breaking point. According to the old solar nebula theory, comets are far-flung leftovers from the birth of the solar system. They are supposed to have formed by accretion in a hypothetical Oort Cloud but this imaginary Oort Cloud is unlike any cloud we are familiar with. The cloud is about 1,000 times further out than the orbit of Pluto and the mean distance between comets is about 1 billion kilometers, so collision and accretion have negligible probability. Yet we look at Comet 67P and its surface cratering would appear to require countless impacts. What's more, its shape is entirely unaccountable by accretion. The impact of two largest chunks would rather disintegrate them instead of somehow welding them together to form a rubber duck. The problem for planetary scientists is that their expert advice from astrophysicist is based on another old and flawed story about star formation that has also been discredited by recent observations. Stars form deep inside molecular clouds, like beads strung along glowing cosmic strings. The cosmic strings are the galactic equivalent of earthly cloud-to-cloud lightning. The powerful electromagnetic pinch acts to compress and heat matter along the lightning channel. The result on Earth is merely a thunderclap but you can't hear a thunderclap in space. Instead, we see a string of stars. Of course, smaller bodies will form planets which, when the lightning has subsided, form gravitational partnerships. This simply explains the weird exoplanetary systems with hot Jupiters swinging around their star in hours or days, and planets with backward orbits and orbits over the stars' poles. As Hannes Alfvén, the father of modern plasma physics, remarked, "Gravitational systems are the ashes of prior electrical systems." The old nebula accretion theory of planet formation is long dead and must be buried. As for Comet 67P, arc welders know that an electric arc can transfer matter against the ultra-weak force of gravity. So if the Philae landing is successful, it will be important to examine the mineral composition of the comet and compare it with Martian meteorites, since Mars bears colossal recent electrical scars. Even with Rosetta information, we will not understand the Egyptians and their pantheon of weird celestial gods, much less what comets are, until we leave our comforting bedtime stories behind. Newton's law of gravity does not guarantee a peaceful clockwork solar system lasting for eons. Astronomers know, but can't accept the unsettling idea, that Newton's solar system is chaotic on a very short timescale. The reason is simply that gravity alone provides no restoring force when one planet disturbs another. Astronomers also know little about history. Clearly, they are missing something very important. And ironically, the answer has been hidden in plain view of those who study the oldest human histories which tell of planetary wars involving Thunderbolts of the Gods. That these ancient stories did not relate to everyday lightning, is shown by the many images of those Thunderbolts. The implications for the recent history of the planets are paradigm shattering. It seems that charge exchange plays a significant role in stabilizing orbits. And in close encounters, the effect is to electrically gouge surface material from one planet and transfer it to the other. In the process, a great deal of debris is lost to space where it becomes asteroids, comets and meteoroids.

Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info It has been one of the greatest surprises of the Space Age - powerful magnetic fields pervade the cosmos. Mainstream astronomy and astrophysicists do indeed acknowledge pervasive cosmic magnetism, but they did not predict it, and the realization has come begrudgingly. Some perspective into these ideas can be gleaned from an early online NASA feature from the 1990s, which asked the question, “Do magnetic fields exist throughout space?” It states, “On the cosmological scale, there is no data to suggest that magnetic fields are present. They certainly are not important in the dynamics of the universe for any reasonable range of field strengths consistent with present observational constraints.” Of course, like countless other consensus ideas in cosmology, discovery has shown no regard for these commonly held beliefs. The now unavoidable problem of cosmic magnetism in astronomy is acknowledged in a 2011 Universe Today piece, which states: “The mention of cosmic-scale magnetic fields is still likely to be met with an uncomfortable silence in some astronomical circles – and after a bit of foot-shuffling and throat-clearing, the discussion will be moved on to safer topics. But look, they’re out there. They probably do play a role in galaxy evolution, if not galaxy formation – and are certainly a feature of the interstellar medium and the intergalactic medium.” The reason magnetic fields in space are so problematic for standard, gravity-only cosmology is self-evident – possibly apart from bar magnets, only electric currents produce magnetic fields. And for many decades, plasma cosmology had proposed that electric currents over vast cosmic distances play a significant role in the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies. Plasma cosmology predicted that stars would be found to form along vast networks of filaments, like pearls on a string, an outrageous prediction that discovery confirmed. The plasma scientist Dr. Anthony Perratt of Los Alamos laboratories demonstrated experimentally that galactic structures can evolve under the influence of electric currents. Through what is known as the pinch effect, parallel currents converge to produce structures identical in form to spiral galaxies. And well over a century ago, that Norwegian experimentalist Kristian Birkeland predicted that electric currents from the Sun were the cause of our planet’s auroras, a claim that astronomers almost universally rejected until it was finally proved in the 1970’s. In fact, with no official pronouncement, within some circles in the space sciences, the recognition and study of electric currents in space appears to be slowly growing. Consider the recent article, published by the American Geophysical Union’s Earth and Space Science News, entitled “Electric Currents in Outer Space Run the Show”, which is a summary of the new book, Electric Currents in Geospace and Beyond. The article states bluntly, “It is now understood that outer space is fundamentally electrical in nature,” a type of statement that critics of the Electric Universe have long decried as preposterous and pseudoscientific. On the extremely challenging task of observing and measuring electric currents, the authors state, “Since electric currents are comprised of moving charged particles, such as ions and electrons, the most direct way to measure currents is by probing and counting the individual particles. Highly tuned instruments that fly on board satellites do exactly that. While particle counting is quite challenging, as one might expect, one can also make use of the fact that electric currents generate a magnetic field around them, which in turn can be measured, more easily, by instruments, called magnetometers. From these magnetic fields one can then infer using Maxwell’s equations the underlying currents.” But the inference of underlying electric currents as the cause of magnetic fields in space remains a shockingly rare practice in the astronomical literature. Thus, the processes astronomers and astrophysicists have invented to try to explain cosmic magnetic fields have only grown increasingly weird, encountering greater and greater problems in the face of ever finer technological data. Consider the discovery reported last year of galactic magnetic fields with “astonishing order.” As reported on Phys.org, “Galactic magnetic fields are formed through numerous stellar explosions, the effects of which last for hundreds of millions of years. The energy bursts of all supernovas put together produce a galaxy's magnetic fields. Due to the fact that stellar explosions are chaotic processes, scientists had not expected them to generate a magnetic field with an orderly structure on a large scale. But this is exactly what they have now proved to be the case in several galaxies – even though the orderly structure did not manifest in every single object. The underlying mechanisms have not yet been fully understood.” However, plasma cosmologists have hypothesized for decades that the “underlying mechanism” is cosmic scale electric currents. More recently, in 2018, retired professor Dr. Donald Scott published his scientific model of galactic scale Birkeland currents as the cause of so-called anomalous stellar rotation profiles in galaxies — an anomaly that astronomers to this day believe can only be resolved by the influence of invisible dark matter. However, as seen in this graph, the predicted stellar velocities based on Dr. Scott’s model and the actual stellar velocities measured over nearly a century, compare remarkably well. It is then not a coincidence that galaxies, like stars, form along vast networks of filaments, the form taken by electric currents flowing through plasma which connect the bodies across cosmic distances. If electromagnetism rather than gravity is the organizational force creating structures in space, then both the imagined need for dark matter and the intractable problem of cosmic magnetic fields can finally be resolved. In our own celestial neighborhood, in the solar system, space scientists have had the opportunity to more directly test  the long-held models of planetary magnetic fields. Let us consider NASA’s recent Juno and Cassini missions to the gas giant Jupiter and Saturn, respectively. In both instances, the scientific data has shattered the belief that the source of the gas giants’ respective magnetic fields is internal dynamos deep within the planets. As Juno principal investigator Scott Bolton stated, of the findings at Jupiter “I didn’t expect all the theories to be wrong, but there’s motion going on in the planet we did not anticipate.” In a 2017 report, New Scientist.com outlined the conundrum as follows: “Another shock is that Jupiter’s huge magnetic field is even stronger and much more irregular than expected.” However, rather than questioning the theoretical foundations that led to the predictive failures, the scientists propose the ad hoc theory that Jupiter’s hypothetical internal dynamo must simply be much closer to the planet’s surface than was believed. The New Scientist report states: “The irregularity of the field so far is a sign that the dynamo driving it may originate higher up in Jupiter’s interior, perhaps from a layer of metallic hydrogen….” …“the dynamo driving the field is close to the surface over the entire planet, not buried deep within it like Earth’s core.” But the most important clue to the actual source of the planet’s magnetic field is in the incredible electrical potentials at Jupiter that have now been confirmed by the Juno data. As described in an Earth and Space Science news report on Jupiter’s incredibly powerful X-ray auroras: “The data revealed particle signatures of parallel electrical fields over the poles of Jupiter that forced electrons near the poles upward, away from the planet, while protons and other ions moved downward into the atmosphere. This massive electric potential – upward of a million electron volts – provides a possible explanation of where the X-ray auroras get their energy….” In the Electric Universe, the assumption that all celestial bodies must carry no net charge cannot be correct. – a fact that scientific discovery routinely affirms. Jupiter is an electrically charged rotating body, and any such body can produce its own magnetic field, with no need for internal dynamos. Electric currents flowing from the Sun impinge on its poles, modifying its magnetic field, inducing its stupendous X-ray auroras and powerfully influencing its super-fast winds and cyclonic storms. As we’ve outlined previously many times, the aforementioned Dr. Scott recently published his mathematical modeling of the structure of a Birkeland current, which is identified visually as counterrotating concentric cylinders. Critically, this counterrotation is clearly seen at the poles of the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. In fact, at Saturn, the crisis for the standard dynamo model for the planet’s magnetic field is even more brazen. In 2018, Cassini scientists were astonished to discover that Saturn’s magnetic field appears to have virtually no tilt. The crisis is explained as follows in a phys.org report: “It was thought that magnetic fields around planets can only form when there is a discernible tilt between the rotation axis of the planet  and the magnetic field axis.” What the investigators actually found is that the tilt of Saturn’s magnetic field is “smaller than a hundredth of a degree.” As principal investigator Professor Michele Dougherty lamented, “…it looks increasingly likely we will have to rethink the ways different kinds of planets can form magnetic fields. As we’ve also noted previously, in 2016, planetary scientists were amazed to discover that so-called magnetic ropes from the Sun stretch nearly 900 million miles to Saturn, and interact with the gas giant in much the same as they do with the Earth. We again note the aforementioned material published by the American Geophysical Union, which states that “electric currents generate a magnetic field around them… From these magnetic fields one can then infer using Maxwell’s equations the underlying currents.” Make no mistake, institutionalized science does now recognize the so-called magnetic universe. If and when space scientists begin widely inferring the electric currents that pervasive cosmic magnetism requires, it can only be inevitable they will reach the same conclusion as the aforementioned authors: That “outer space is fundamentally electrical in nature.” 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info In part 1 of this presentation, physicist Wal Thornhill began his analysis of the recent remarkable update by the team behind the groundbreaking scientific experiment, the SAFIRE project. For the first time, an independent experiment has been conducted to audit the Electric Sun model, first proposed by the engineer Ralph Juergens in the 1970s. At the recent University of Bath Electric Universe conference in the UK, SAFIRE's principal scientist and chief engineer Montgomery Childs said of SAFIRE's results; in all our experiments and discoveries, we have found no disparities with the Electric Sun model. We believe the SAFIRE experiment validates and supports the Electric Sun model. Childs is president and founder of the engineering firm Aurtas International Incorporated, which was contacted by the International Science Foundation to experimentally test the Electric Sun. As noted previously, Aurtas International Inc. is an independent body which has no affiliation with the Electric Universe or The Thunderbolts Project. In this episode, Thornhill continues with his thoughts on some of the most stunning SAFIRE results to date. This famous photo of settled science will be recognized in future as the moment we stopped doing physics in the 20th century. Quantum theory discarded the physics principle of cause followed by effect. Einstein didn't like it but he had already done the fatal damage. He isolated his arbitrary inertial observers from the rest of the universe, discarded the absolute standards of length and time, invented an imaginary proper clock, which doesn't exist, removed the ether, and the effect of gravity became an illusion, all unforgiveable nonsense to the great physicists of the past. We were propelled back almost 2,000 years to the Greek Ptolemaic era, when geometric symmetry and mathematical beauty dictated that endless ad-hoc epicycles be added to perfect circular planetary orbits in order to match appearances. That dogma lasted for over 1500 years. How long will we allow relativity dogma and its taboos to persist? It should be no surprise that since that conference, science has failed to produce fundamental breakthroughs, anything like the 19th century, when some of the finest experimental physicists: Weber, Ampere, Gauss, Faraday, were discovering the secrets of electricity and magnetism. For example, Wilhelm Weber produced an electrodynamic orbital model of the atom in the 1870s, 40 years before it was experimentally discovered by Ernest Rutherford. Weber's electrodynamic law will form the foundation of future physics. The Electric Universe follows the lead of those experimenting electrical pioneers. The SAFIRE project shows our century-old understanding of stars, and therefore the universe, is fundamentally wrong. There is no mention of electricity in space in any textbook on astronomy or cosmology. The Electric Sun model accepts and extends electrical Plasma Cosmology, the only experimentally tested and predictive cosmology today. The Nobel-Prize-winning plasma physicist Hannes Alfven developed it based on a universal network of Birkeland current filaments connecting and driving the rotation of galaxies, which matches modern observations. 50 years ago, he predicted a crisis in astrophysics because theorists chose to misunderstand his pioneering research in Plasma Physics. The SAFIRE project proves he was right. Galaxies are an electrically powered phenomenon, and electric stars light their spiral circuits. It shows we have wasted more than 60 years trying to produce energy "like the Sun," based on the unshakable belief that stars are isolated thermonuclear- powered campfires in the sky. The SAFIRE project exposes the complicated untestable life-and-death story of thermonuclear stars as fictional. Plasma Cosmology has a long history of peer-reviewed literature in the nuclear and plasma sciences society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, the IEEE. The dysfunction of modern institutionalized science is epitomized by the absence of astronomers at the IEEE conferences. In my experience, there was one notable exception, the radio astronomer Gerrit Verschuur who used his expertise to map local interstellar Birkeland currents. He wrote, "The role of large-scale currents may be far more important in defining interstellar structure than has generally been recognized within the astronomical community." Plasma Cosmology supports the Electric Sun model in another crucial aspect. It successfully predicted that stars are formed by powerful electromagnetic pinches strung along Birkeland current filaments inside molecular clouds. The electrical formation easily accounts for the observed but unexplained flickering of newborn stars, and witnessed in SAFIRE. The electromagnetic accretion process is called Marklund convection, which deposits heavy elements at the cool center of the star, and hydrogen and helium in the outermost atmosphere. There is no thermonuclear core in a star. Of course, the evidence has always been plain to see in the fact that sunspots are dark and cool compared to the surrounding bright photosphere. Astrophysics and particle physics are the two pillars of cosmology. The SAFIRE project knocks down both pillars. The two disciplines have fed off each other's misinformation for decades giving birth to futile and hugely expensive projects; fusion power unlike the Sun, the Large Hadron Collider in a futile attempt to explain mass independent of the matter exhibiting mass, and the baseless quest for imaginary dark matter and dark energy. As one theoretical physicist admitted, we gratuitously blow the public's mind with our crazy ideas. As for the Big Bang, it is plainly unscientific. There is no idea how matter is constructed, let alone created, which defies a principle of physics. And thanks to Einstein, mass and energy are physically undefinable, and we have no physical idea how gravity works. Einstein's universal speed limit of light is applied to the electric force and gravity, despite the inverse square law applying to them, both being independent of time. Introducing a speed of light delay renders orbital systems like those in the atom and the solar system incoherent and unstable. This also reveals that gravitational wave detectors are not detecting gravity signals because their coincident detection assumes gravity operates at the speed of light. As for super-collapsed gravitational objects like black holes and neutron stars, Plasma Cosmology explains in detail the phenomena associated with them, both by theory and experiment, and has no need of them. The SAFIRE project exposes the misbegotten taboo by fusion researchers against low energy transmutation and energy production. That has held up progress in nuclear power for more than 60 years. In 1979, Juergens asked, "Could it be that the search for thermonuclear energy is a false trail that has been followed all these years with no real hope of success? If the Sun and the stars indeed succeed in fusing lighter elements to form heavier ones, are the relevant activities carried out more or less in plain sight -- in their atmospheres?" Supporting evidence has since been found of an anti- correlation between sunspot number, a photospheric effect, and neutrino count from the Sun. In about the same year, 1979, I read the work of a noted French scientist, professor C. Louis Kervran, who in the 1960s published important research demonstrating low-energy biological transmutations of the chemical elements which, surprise, surprise, "...falls outside mainstream physics and is not part of the scientific discourse..." according to Wikipedia. However, the SAFIRE project is now verifying low-energy nuclear transmutations. In 1981, I read a small pamphlet titled 'Electron Structure' by Ralph Sansbury, an independent researcher from New York. He proposed an orbital model of the electron which, when applied to nucleons, provides a simple alternative model of nuclear reactions involving resonant catalytic nuclear chemistry at low energies. It provided a real physical basis for understanding quantum mechanics. It shows, the picture of fusion requiring high-energy particle collisions to overcome a high nuclear Coulomb barrier is too restrictive. Weber's electrodynamics shows a short-range resonant attraction between two like-charged particles, such as two atomic nuclei. With this in mind, I spoke to Monty regularly in the design stage about the requirements for the experimental star and the detection of elemental transmutation. My friend and Thunderbolts colleague, professor Donald Scott also extended Juergens' Electric Sun model by recognizing the PNP transistor action of the anode tufts or photospheric granulations, which was successfully produced in phase one of SAFIRE's proof of concept. This mechanism was important in the model to steady the radiant output of the Sun, while in X-rays the Sun is a variable star. The steadiness of starshine from billions of stars is one of the disparities of the standard thermonuclear model. Don also provided electrical engineering advice in the construction phase. Don's most recent contribution to understanding the electromagnetic structure of Birkeland current filaments, promises a deeper understanding of the connection between an electric star and its interstellar circuit, as well as many mysterious phenomena in deep space and within the solar system. The Thunderbolts team are grateful to Monty and a remarkable dedicated team who successfully designed and built the historic experiment, then devised and performed the SAFIRE experiments employing the latest Design Of Experiments methodology to independently test the Electric Sun model. Their professional investigation and results change everything we thought we knew about our place in the universe. That, I hopefully predict, will have a beneficial effect on all of us. It is a far more inclusive, coherent and hopeful, big picture than we have ever had. Best of all, responses show, it inspires people and just makes sense. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info Today, to an unprecedented degree, technological advances are bringing the nature of our solar system's Sun into clearer focus. With ever finer data, the ability to test competing theoretical models, and hopefully to resolve mysteries, becomes greater and greater. One such mystery is the unexpectedly hot temperature of the solar wind as it extends away from the Sun. Recently, a team of scientists from the University of Wisconsin-Madison performed a study to try to find an answer to the puzzle, and their search led them to the field of plasma physics. A phys.org report describes the standard interpretation of the hot solar wind conundrum: “With more negatively charged electrons streaming away, the Sun takes on a positive charge. This makes it harder for the electrons to escape the Sun's pull. Some electrons have a lot of energy and keep traveling for infinite distances. Those with less energy can't escape the Sun's positive charge and are attracted back to the Sun. As they do, some of those electrons can be knocked off their tracks ever-so-slightly by collisions with surrounding plasma.” The lead author of the aforementioned study states: “There is a fundamental dynamical phenomenon that says that particles whose velocity is not well aligned with the magnetic field lines, are not able to move into a region of a strong magnetic field. Such returning electrons are reflected so that they stream away from the Sun, but again they cannot escape because of the attractive electric force of the Sun. So, their destiny is to bounce back and forth, creating a large population of so-called trapped electrons.” At first glance, such language might seem resonant with the Electric Sun model first proposed by engineer Ralph Juergens and later developed, and in some respects modified by Dr. Donald Scott and physicist Wal Thornhill. However, the University of Wisconsin-Madison scientists propose that a theoretical magnetic process is the mechanism behind the mysterious solar wind heating. We asked retired Professor of Electrical Engineering, Dr. Donald Scott for an Electric Sun explanation of the aforementioned phenomenon. As time goes on, we here in the Electric Universe, are hearing more and more often about these ”new astronomical discoveries” that are not really new at all. What is new is there's the recent increase in the inclusion of electrical ideas in these astronomical press releases. And a good example is what you just quoted from the University of Wisconsin's press release. But, although more references are presently being made by astronomers, electrical topics like electrons and positive ions and their flows and movements and then separation, astronomers never used to admit that electrons and positive ions can be separated. But charge separation in space? No, that can’t be. But I still would remind everybody that the words “current”, ”electric current” and “electric fields”, are almost always completely absent. And a case in point is on our Electric Sun model, which has been around a long, long time now, we do have in the model, inherently, there is charge separation. And I thought, when I read what you just read, I whimsically went back in my mind and said, well how did all this Electric Sun thing get started? These guys never heard of it obviously. Actually it got started back in 1908, when Kristian Birkeland hypothesized that our auroras were caused by streams of electrically charged particles coming from the Sun. And everybody, certainly at least in the EU I think, knows that ad nauseam by now. He was adamantly opposed and ridiculed by astronomers for these ideas. This went on for decades, even after the poor man had died. But Birkeland was not forgotten, at least not by us. But this press release says that the solar wind was ”discovered” in 1959. Now, that got my attention. I wouldn't mind if they'd said its existence was verified in ’59, when we sent some Rockets up and saw that, yes there indeed were charges floating around up there and coming into the North Pole of the earth. But they act as though Birkeland had never proposed it. They almost act as though Birkeland had never existed and nobody ever knew about it, and I kind of resent that. Our present Electric Sun model is the direct result of Birkeland's original insight, that the auroras are caused by cosmic flows of electricity. But this model is the result of the work of many researchers from Kristian Birkeland to Hannes Alfvén, and I humbly add my own name at the end of that as well. The prime organizer of these ideas about the Sun, was the late civil engineer Ralph Juergens; and he had carefully studied the earlier plasma research of the Scottish mathematician and physicist whose name is C.E.R. Bruce. Bruce had made the first major change in the theory of how lightning paths function, since their description by Benjamin Franklin, way back in the dim distant past. And this work and then Bruce's attendance at Sydney Chapman’s 1941 Kelvin lecture on the Sun, led Bruce to apply these ideas to cosmic phenomena, and to a new electric vision of the universe. And that has eventually developed into the Electric Sun model. In 1970, I read a paper by Juergens about the electrical properties of the Sun's photosphere and it was published, would you believe, in a chemical engineering journal by Juergens, who was a civil engineer, about an electrical phenomenon. Everything Juergens said there, in that paper, was completely consistent with what I had been taught earlier as a student, and then taught myself as a professor, about electrical engineering having to do with plasmas, a good portion of electrical engineers, at least in those days, were into plasma research. Anyway, reading that paper, I was hooked. I worked for several years, studying and adding, and trying my best to add to Juergens basic ideas, and the point being that the Electric Sun model is the product of the dedicated work of a long, long string of many people for many years. And these people, like the ones who wrote this memo, never heard of it, I guess. Anyway, it turns out our present Electric Sun model inherently explains many, if not all, the solar phenomena that astronomers cannot explain. And they continue to absolutely ignore its existence. We often hear the phrase ”That process is not completely understood”. Actually, what they mean is, what they should have said is, “We have no idea why this is going on, but send us more money and we'll invent another invisible mechanism, or force, to explain it”. A prime example of these processes that they don't know too much about, is the solar wind, which they do mention in this press release. But Birkeland suggested its existence and the Electric Sun models gives us a clear explanation of the structure and exactly where it comes from, and why it behaves as it does. And, for example, the article does not mention the fact that the solar wind comes in - and it’s well-known - two different varieties. There's the fast solar wind and the slow solar wind, and they're two different manifestations, two different varieties of the same animal, the solar wind itself. The fast solar wind is a flow of ions and electrons that has high velocity, but it's not very dense, there are very few ions in it. And it comes out of the tops of the photospheric tufts, which make up the surface of the photosphere, which are highly charged regions that hold back the flood of ions that would otherwise result. In other words, you've got this bunch of things that are positively charged. They repel other positive charges and these positive charges within the Sun are trying to escape. These tufts line up, almost like a bunch of soldiers, and prevent the escape of these other inside ions. Ions that do get over the top of the tufts though, then fall through the energy drop of the voltage of the tufts, pretty much like the water that falls over the top of an overfilled dam. There’re not too many of them that manage to do it. to get over there, but the ones that do, fall the whole distance, all the way down the face of the dam. And this is what gives them their high velocity. But relatively few of them can make the trip, and so that's why the fast solar solar wind is very low density. On the other hand, the slow solar wind, has only about half the velocity of the fast wind, but it's quite dense; many more particles per unit volume. And it comes from sunspots and other disturbed regions on the Sun's surface, where there are no tufts to hold them back. So it's like somebody poked a hole in the dam, and therefore this flow is very dense, many ions per unit volume, nothing to really prevent their escape. But, since they're not accelerated by falling through a large voltage drop, their maximum velocities are only about half of that of the fast wind particles. Anyway, this explanation of the two varieties of the solar wind is inherent in the in the Electric Sun model. It mimics the operation of a PNP transistor. I'm an electrical engineer and I understand that. It's no wonder astronomers shun our Electric Universe ideas and they find that the explanation of this mechanism is not well understood, because they don't know anything about electrical engineering. Anyway, I hope that everybody knows that the SAFIRE project, which most people, I think are beginning to have heard about, was organized, funded and manned through the kind generosity of the patrons who support the Electric Universe, for one major purpose. The purpose of SAFIRE was to test the validity of the Electric Sun model in every possible way. Montgomery Childs, the director of SAFIRE and chief investigator, has publicly announced that this has been done and that the Electric Sun model has passed each and every test they could throw at it. Yet it is ignored by astrophysicists. Also, some peripheral results from SAFIRE are interesting to note. For example, many astrophysicists have claimed for years, that there cannot be any strong electric fields within cosmic plasma. That they would be shorted out by the near-perfect conductivity of the plasma. Plasma is very highly conductive in certain directions. But one day, the SAFIRE team measured electric field strengths in the SAFIRE chamber of over 8,000 volts per meter; and they maintained it, it was were static, and it lived happily inside the plasma, held in the SAFIRE project. Anyway, this shows that the observed acceleration of the fast solar wind particles, which cannot be explained by any other mechanism, can easily be explained by an electrically charged Sun. And I make reference to that first sentence in that quote of the press release. It says, “With more negatively charged electrons streaming away, the Sun takes on a positive charge.” Yes, yes, they got that right: it does take on a positive charge, not for the reasons they suggest, but that positively charged Sun is responsible for the acceleration of the solar wind, which they didn't really mention. The strength of the required electric field to accelerate the fast solar wind, has been calculated - I did it, and other people have done it - to not be greater than about seven tenths of a microvolt per meter. Seven tenths of a millionth of a volt per meter and this only requires the solar voltage to be around 2,700 volts. So Juergens, in his first paper, was thinking about 10 to the 10th volts or some monstrous voltage on the Sun. From our observations, at least other than observations of the solar wind acceleration, it doesn't have to be anything even close to that. So, the Electric Universe ideas, of which the Electric Sun model is one of the most important, I submit, is getting to be like the elephant in the room. They know about it, they don't want to see it, and they don't want to discuss it. I hope that soon they will have to. [Music]

Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info NASA's Juno mission to the gas giant Jupiter has provided data that could rewrite much of planetary science. According to NASA scientists, the conventional theoretical models on the planet’s auroras, its atmosphere, its interior and its magnetic field have found no support at all in the mission’s findings. The consistent theme in all of the surprises is the extraordinary and conventionally unexpected electromagnetic energies the spacecraft detected. In this episode, Thunderbolts Picture of the Day Managing Editor Stephen Smith offers a succinct overview of the most significant discoveries from this historic mission. NASA launched the Juno mission to Jupiter on August 5th, 2011. After travelling out past the orbit of Mars, the spacecraft returned for a gravity assist from Earth on October 9, 2013, and then headed out to deep space. Although Juno was invisible to the naked eye, its arrival allowed scientists a unique opportunity. Since it was only 600 km above Earth, NASA was able to track its passage through Earth's electric field using the Van Allen probes. Formally known as the Radiation Belt Storm Probes, the Van Allen satellites were launched in an effort to understand how the Sun and near-Earth's space interact. They do this by interpreting the behavior of Earth's radiation belts and the way that high speed electrons and ions, otherwise known as plasma, are guided or confined by magnetic fields. The two spacecraft are in highly eccentric orbits, passing each other and dipping in and out of the belts many times, allowing them to understand and disregard effects of their own presences in orbit as well as filtering out spatial anomalies. It was the small electrical effects of the Juno probe on the belts that allowed the Van Allen mission to see it passing by. Plasma is often described as the fourth state of matter. However, since observations confirm that it makes up more than 99% of the universe, it should be reckoned the first state. It is only been in the last one hundred years that scientists have given credence to the possibility that we might be living in a dynamic solar system where electricity plays an important role. It is evident that the Sun's electric field extends for billions of kilometers influencing the planets in their motions as well as how they interact with each other. Since plasma is a charged substance in motion, it generates an electric current. An electric current flowing through plasma creates a magnetic sheath along its axis. If enough current passes through the circuit, the plasma sheath will glow, sometimes creating a number of sheaths within it. The sheath is called a double layer. According to Electric Sun theory, an electric field focused on the Sun accelerates charged particles, the faster they move, the stronger the field. However, the interplanetary electric field is extremely weak. No instrument is yet able to measure the voltage differential across 100 meters but the solar wind acceleration over its tens of millions of kilometers does confirm that the Sun has an electric field. The Van Allen detector showed that over time, the capabilities of future space missions will increase; taking detailed measurements of interplanetary electric fields may not be so far off after all. Juno entered orbit around Jupiter on July 4th, 2016. Jupiter is the largest planet. It is so large that all the other planets could fit comfortably inside it. Jupiter rotates in 9.9 hours, causing its diameter to be 9,275 kilometers more than the distance between its poles and this is due to centrifugal force. Since there are radiation belts around Jupiter similar to the Van Allen belts that surround Earth, but thousands of times greater in strength, Juno's electronics are housed within a titanium shell so that the energetic particles trapped around Jupiter won't interfere with its systems. As previously reported, Jupiter's moon Io dissipates more than 2 trillion watts as it revolves through Jupiter's electromagnetic fields. The electric charge flow creates lightning in the planet's upper atmosphere as well as intense aurorae at the poles. Recently, mission scientists announced that Jupiter is even more electrically active than they predicted. Instead of a 5-Gauss magnetic field, Jupiter measured levels as high as 9 Gauss and this is compared to Earth's 0.5-Gauss field. The field is also quite irregular, suggesting to astrophysicists that there might be a non-conformity in Jupiter's core. According to a mission team member Jack Connerney, "Jupiter's magnetic field is spatially complex, and there were deficits of up to 2 gauss elsewhere. We may need many more orbits to resolve this." Conventional theories assume that the universe is electrically neutral, so when observations confirm electrical activity, localized phenomena are invoked. So called 'tidal forces' and 'volcanoes' are said to cause the activity on Io, rather than the several million amperes charge flow between it and Jupiter. In the case of Jupiter's rings, charges detected in the ring plane were said to be caused by sunlight shadow rather than by an electric circuit between Jupiter and the Sun. According to a 2008 press release from JPL, Jupiter's rings are electrically charged. However, astronomers proposed that Jupiter's moon Io is kneaded like dough by Jupiter's gravity causing charged particles to be ejected by its volcanic plumes. The ion flow is an electric circuit, to and from Jupiter. More than 8 years ago, TPOD addressed Io's 'volcanic plumes'. It was shown that they're actually plasma discharges from the moon to the gas giant. Some planetary scientists have begun to acknowledge an electrical connection after Io's footprint was seen in Jupiter's polar aurora. All four of Jupiter's largest moons were discovered to leave their marks in the aurora, in the shape of tails flowing within the plasma column. Later, when NASA launched New Horizons on a mission to study Pluto, the plumes of Tvashtar, a gigantic volcano supposedly, were found to be filamentary in structure with indications that they are actually coronal arc discharges from electric hotspots, linking Io with Jupiter. One of Juno's most important discovery was that Jupiter's atmospheric bands are deeper than previously thought. Those cloud bands cannot be penetrated by visible light. However, microwave detectors allow Juno to see as deep as mission coordinators want to look. The satellite is currently searching a little over 400 kilometers below the surface of the cloud tops, and as mentioned in other pictures of the day, the slight differences in layers suggest that they are dynamic and constantly evolving. During the same flyby while observing Jupiter's aurorae, Juno's electromagnetic data began to diverge from what NASA team members predicted. It was nuch stronger. Jupiter's magnetic field is far more complex than they previously assumed. That flow of electric charge causes aurorae at the poles. Since Jupiter is obviously electrical, the basic physics of charged objects in motion generating electromagnetism should be the focus of study. Jupiter's magnetosphere is so powerful that it extends for nearly 650 million km reaching even beyond Saturn's orbit. The most energetic of the trapped electrons in its magnetosphere emit radio frequencies. In 1955, that radiation led to the discovery that Jupiter has a magnetic field. It should be noted however, that the maverick scientist Immanuel Velikovsky predicted the electric field of Jupiter in October of 1953. As mentioned, rotating charged bodies produce dipolar electromagnetic fields. Whenever there are regions of opposite charge, double layers form and electric fields develop. An electric field, no matter how weak, accelerates charged particles. This could explain why the atmospheric bands are so deep. Jupiter's electric field accelerates plasmas at different rates. Rather than a theoretical liquid metallic dynamo inside Jupiter, it is more probable that the planet is acting according to other well-known principles of physics. Rotating charged bodies produce dipolar electromagnetic fields, whether they are gas giants or rocky planets. Why some planets like Earth and Mercury possess magnetic fields while Venus and Mars do not, demands further investigation. However, the basic physics of charged objects in motion is not debated. What is debated by Electric Universe advocates is what drives the Jovian powerhouse. According to a recent press release, "...convection currents...stir the interior and produce the swirling clouds and storms... they are strong enough to generate Jupiter's magnetic field by a process called dynamo action." Dynamos were described more than a century ago and fluid dynamic equations are inadequate when electromagnetism and plasma environments are considered. Using models that are kinetic in nature, with activity limited to induction of the movement of solid matter, solves none of the enigmas Jupiter presents. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project at Thunderbolts.info. Where does gravity fit in the Electric Universe? Contrary to a somewhat common misperception, the Electric Universe does not deny gravity's existence, nor its role in the cosmos and our own world. Rather the Electric Universe theory as proposed by physicist Wal Thornhill suggests that the fundamental mysteries of gravity may be explained by the electrical structure of matter. In his 2008 article “Electric Gravity in an Electric Universe,” Thornhill asks, “When we apply force to a body, how is that force transferred to overcome inertia? The answer is ’electrically’ by the repulsion between the outer electrons in the atoms closest to the point of contact. The equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass strongly suggests that the force of gravity is a manifestation of the electric force.” Today, Bishop Nicholas Sykes further elaborates the query he first posed in his previous episode: ”What is the speed of Gravity?” and he elaborates the explanations for gravity that the Electric Universe proposes. My last Space News video about the light exceeding [the] speed of gravity, titled “What is the Speed of Gravity?” provoked some reactions. Someone wondered if I have never heard that gravity was not a force, but the bending of the fabric of Space-Time. Another argued that gravity did not need explanation, because it was something that was “just there” Einstein's proposition that nothing can travel faster than light, has become so entrenched that even some of us identifying with the EU model as a whole, find it difficult to give fair consideration to the claim that gravity, operating as a real force, requiring a real explanation, necessitates a real transmission, far greater than the speed of light. Yet, even if we are only at the beginning of providing such an explanation, it is important for the integrity of the EU model, to adhere always to a simple force-based model for gravity, because gravity does, when all is said and done, manifest itself to our senses as a force. The Electric Universe model is constructed with explanations that invariably exclude “just there” formulations, which are in effect widely used agreements to discard the need for rational explanation. As a result of such agreements, the scientific landscape is littered with such follies as black holes, dark matter, dark energy, multiverses, and magnetic reconnection, all of them being “just there” formulations, without rational explanation, designed to plug the holes in popular science theory with the unexplainable. Sir Isaac Newton understood that he was unable to formulate an explanation for gravitational attractions, even while he described the behavior mathematically of bodies under gravitational influence over vast distances with astounding accuracy. He speculated on gravity’s cause, but decided to leave that issue to a future generation, who might bring better tools than his, to master the task. Our own generation does indeed have better tools than his, but we have become distracted from the task he and others bequeathed to us, by a multitude of follies. These consist of the extraordinary plethora of the “just there” formulations that prevent us from accomplishing what Newton and others bequeathe to a future age. If one reads the book “Relativity” by Albert Einstein published for example in 2004 by the Folio Society, one will see that he develops the concept of light or electromagnetic radiation, being the fastest possible messenger, merely by assuming that, since nothing was observed to go faster than light, then there is no credibility to the idea that anything could go any faster than light. In chapters 7, 8 and 9, for instance, he assumes that information from two simultaneous flashes of lightning could never by principle, reach an observer any faster that light speed in a vacuum. From that simple idea, the whole theory of relativity was developed, starting with the deduction that two simultaneous events in one frame of reference, might not be simultaneous in a different frame of reference. The theory of relativity as conceived by Einstein depended therefore entirely on the idea that one could never make deductions about space and time that might ultimately rest upon anything going faster than the speed of light. It is, therefore, illogical to assert, without any other reason for doing so than the theory of relativity itself, that nothing can go faster than the speed of light. To make such an assertion would be to engage in a tautology, i.e. circular reasoning, because the theory of relativity is founded upon that assertion in the first place. Only if the theory were independently and incontrovertibly verified by observation or experiments, might this be reasonable. And such is often assumed to be the case as Einstein himself hoped that it would be. But so far as I'm aware there is not a single case of this theory’s verification that may not reasonably be disputed. Under these circumstances therefore, it is entirely scientific to consider the possibility that there may well be something observable or reasonably deduced traveling at a speed faster than light. As has already been indicated in my videos, the motion of the planets in the solar system requires that the force of gravity between the Sun and its planets, assuming as we must, that this is a real force and not a mental construction of some kind, must be transmitted between them at a speed of many orders of magnitude faster than the speed of light. And the physicist Wal Thornhill shows also that such speeds of force transmission are just as necessary within what we call the fundamental particles of matter for the stability of those sub atomic structures, as it is for the stability of stellar planetary systems. Indeed, by such concepts, the physical foundation of the mathematical structures of quantum mechanics may yet be revealed and made clear in a way similar perhaps to the clarification of the physical foundation to Sir Isaac Newton's “Mathematical Principles” of gravitational action that great task that he and others bequeathe to generations yet to come. In such manner, the Electric Universe model holds out a great promise; the promise of a physics and a cosmology that rest upon a secure foundation to replace what is taught in our prestigious schools, the current model, which as Einstein himself discerned, relies upon two foundations: the Theory of Relativity and Quantum Mechanics that are themselves mutually irreconcilable.

Earth's Primordial Stellar Host Dwardu Cardona escaped the cage of answers at about the age of 15, growing up in Malta in a highly defined Catholic environment, he wanted more. And so he entered into a life of curiosity. And he came to Canada, now I got to know as an aside; What's... How did we start slipping up in the U.S.? All these guys are going to Canada! What, what, what, it's... Yeah, I mean I like Canada. But, come on, really? Well, he's in Vancouver now, and that's still pretty close to the U.S. there. Okay, was a little, we'll grant him that, in between Alaska and Washington. But the former editor of the Journal Aeon, co-editor of the journal Kronos, author of many books, four of which are available here on our, at our bookstore and they are excellent, really fascinating. So this morning Dwardu is going to pick up where he left off last year. Welcome Dwardu Cardona! EARTH'S PRIMORDIAL STELLAR HOST Thank you! Actually, I had no idea when I prepared to talk I am about to give that my good friend Wallace Thornhill would be presenting a paper that touches on exactly the same series of events that I am about to discuss, which he did yesterday morning. That said however, it does indicate, actually it stresses the importance of the events in question. As pointed out in the paper I read at last year's conference, there are still those on Earth who are adamant in stating that the Sun that shone above the heads of their ancestors was not the present one. And judging by the way it is described in mankind's Universal mythohistorical record, the ancient Sun that shone above our ancient ancestors' heads appears to have been much too close, even if somewhat dim, and yet exceptionally warm for it to have been the one that presently shines above our heads. What such a Sun best fits is what is known as a brown dwarf star. There was a time when brown dwarfs, who are believed to fail as stars because their low mass prohibits them from attaining internal nuclear reactions; but if astronomical bodies achieved the stellar qualities to spatial electrical energy, bodies with lesser mass than normal stars could still exhibit astral characteristics even if in a minor way. As it is, brown dwarf stars have now been found to be produced in all possible masses between planets and stars. By the end of 2004 it could be additionally reported that there is no longer any doubt that these substellar objects exist throughout the galaxy numbering as much as 100 billion members. In fact, brown dwarf stars are as common as stars and not only do brown dwarf stars look like stars, they behave like stars as well. On the basis of detections by the Hubble Space Telescope the conclusion has now been reached that brown dwarfs form the same way stars do. In fact, they are presently considered to be bonafide stars. There are various incidentally mythological expositions from around the world that proclaim the manner in which God's creation is said to have unfolded. In quite a few of these narratives, we come across an attempted elucidation of a mysterious substance that seems to have existed before whatever God commenced to create whatever it was said that he created. In the biblical book of Genesis, this entity is described as "Tohu wa-bohu", which is traditionally translated as "without form and void" or "void and empty" but which better translates as "utter chaos". And it was out of this very chaos that God is said to have organized whatever it was that he created. This belief incidentally is not unique to the Old Testament. It was no different among the classical Greeks as recounted by no other than Hesiod. The Chinese called this chaos "Tao," describing it as having not only been chaotic but also nebulous in its nature while it constantly revolved. To the Yuki Amerins it was an indistinct something that they likened to fog and/or foam that will drowned in round continually. A similar primordial foggy substance is also mentioned in oceanic mythology while the Pima compared it to a fluffy bit of cotton that drifted to and fro. Others compared the material to a stretch of whirling slime or mud, an eddying of waters, a whirling ocean in the sky. One can brush these descriptions aside as being nothing about the mythological ravings that would have originated in early man's ignorance of nature. And, to be sure, I myself was somewhat confused as to what these mythological reports were alluding to until I happened to glance at one of Chesley Bonestell's paintings illustrating the placental cloud of matters surrounding Earth in its early formative period. Needless to say, man could not have been around during that early time on Earth so he could not have based his reports on that manifestation. However, similar so-called placental clouds now refer to as circumstellar disks are also known to girdle stars. Could ancient man have seen such a circumstellar disk whirling around Earth's previous stellar host? Do brown dwarfs even harbor such disks? In 2001, a team from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics discovered what they termed "Warm Dusty Disks" around some of the free-floating dwarf stars that were by then being detected in ever growing numbers. A year later gas and dust disks around substellar objects were being written about as a matter of fact. And to be sure, as time went by more than a hundred brown dwarf stars were discovered in the Orion Nebula alone, 60% of which turned out to be surrounded by nebulous clouds of warm dust. That such disks encircle brown dwarf stars is now universally accepted. More than half the brown dwarf stars that have been discovered display such discs and the friction may be as high as 80%. In fact, brown dwarfs are girdled by disks just as often as stars are while their disks have been calculated to last just as long. As is usual in such cases, astronomers were astonished, not to say perplexed, that these disks behave so much like the ones around much more massive newly forming stars. In the meantime, modern mythologist should not be blamed for being at a loss in attempting to understand what our forefathers were alluding to. Giving the nebulosity of such a disc, to say nothing of the difficulty it must have presented to being conferred to terrestrial substances, the vagueness of its various descriptions is understandable. Even so, judging by the overly dusty and gaseous nature of such disks, it is hardly surprising that ancient man would have described the one seen around Earth's primordial Sun as a nebulous substance comparable to fog, foam, fluff, eddying slime, or mud; all of which have been added to what was later simply alluded to as a chaotic substance. In addition to this circumstellar cloud, ancient societies also described what appeared to them as a twirling column of wind associated with that very cloud. This can be gleaned all the way from the beliefs of the Canaanites, across those of the Egyptians to Buddhist countries, the Americas as well as the South Pacific. Not only was this wind described as having been cyclonic in nature but to have also acted as a column supporting the sky. Such for instance was the Egyptian Shu as well as the Mesoamerican Ehecatl. Since this columnar entity was seen emanating from Earth's primeval Sun, it was also thought of as the celestial gods' single-leg as in the Hindu case of the one foot of Brahma but also Vishnu and the Daramulum of the Australian aborigines. To others this appendage was remembered as god's supporting phallus that was also surprisingly described as the downward flow of light from above. The most descriptive aspect of this appendage, however, was as a sky pillar that has gone down among mythologists as the axis mundi concerning which entire books can be written. Additional to that was the associated description of the cyclonic wind, single leg, phallus, and other items as having had the appearance of a whirling ray from above. What could this brilliant whirling ray have been? There has been and continues to be more than one interpretation of the effulgent, effulgent ray of light that ancient man saw stretching between the primordial Sun above and the land beneath his feet. One of these was Ralph Juergens. Whose theory that the column like structure might have been in the nature of a steady electric discharge. As time went by, Juergens' concept was lent validity through the discovery of so called astral jets of plasma that are ejected by galaxies as well as stars, along the rotational axis. One can argue that the colossal size of these jets would eliminate their possible occurrence in association with the much less massive brown dwarf stars. But as I reasoned right from the start, if these jets can stretch in size between galactic and stellar magnitudes, the difference in size of which is enormous, what would keep them from existing in lesser dimensions? After all, the difference in scale between brown dwarfs and regular stars is much less than that between stars and galaxies. Or, if brown dwarf stars can be surrounded by a scaled-down version of a circumstellar disk, why cannot they emit a scaled-down version of a stellar jet? Wallace Thornhill, who was not adverse to this concept, indicated that this jet would have been a sustained plasma discharge in the form of Birkeland current, which claim was upheld by the plasma physicist Anthony Peratt. The problem with all this stem from the fact that at the time I came to this conclusion jetting brown dwarf stars were still unknown and yet, when I discussed this problem with the astrophysicist Doug Lynn, his verdict was that jets from brown dwarf stars were not only possible but very probable. Lynn's privately tendered personal opinion was lent probability less than a year after he had voiced it, when spectral lines that are normally observed in stellar jets were actually detected in brown dwarf stars. As time went by, other than spectral lines, actual jets and even violent ones were depicted spouting from these brown dwarf stars. As Emma Whelan from the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies has stated, "Jets are confirmed to flow from a huge range of objects from the largest galaxies to tiny brown dwarf stars." Meanwhile, that brown dwarf stars can be accompanied by planets was proven in 2005 when a planet was actually imaged in association with such a brown dwarf star. Not long after that, more of the same came to light, not only that but an entire planetary system was eventually detected forming around a brown dwarf that is barely larger than a giant planet. That is therefore nothing strange in Earth having once been the protege of a brown dwarf star. As those who are familiar with the thesis I am here submitting now, Earth's primordial brown dwarf star eventually turned into the gaseous planet we now know as Saturn. And yes, I do realize that those who are not familiar with the astronomical evidence that backs this up will find it hard to accept. That Earth had formerly been a satellite of the Proto-Saturnian body was first hinted at by Oskar Reichenbach in 1884 before it was taken up by Immanuel Velikovsky in 1971. And that the planetary Saturn had originally been deified and adored as mankind supreme god all over the ancient world, was magnificently documented by David Talbott during the same decade. Indeed, as Talbott stated, "The consistency with which early astronomers identify Saturn as the former Creator King is extraordinary." As he reported concerning his research of Earth's primordial catastrophic history, "Nothing came as a greater surprise to me than the sheer quantity of material bearing directly on the Saturnian tradition." And as I myself discovered during my own investigations of the same traditions, the Saturnian deity kept showing up in every mytho-historical avenue that I followed, despite the fact that I actually tried very hard to get away from him. Because of a major event, a turning point in Earth's cosmic history, to which I shall get you in a while, it was posited by Juergens that Earth and this primordial Proto-Saturnian stellar host had been traveling together outside the demarcation of the solar system before they were captured by our present Sun. And as unusual as that may sound to some, stars are known to wander alone through space vacating their systems and/or invading others. Nor are regular stars alone in this class since the conglomeration of these three wanderers also include brown dwarfs. Some of these dwarfs are known to orbit sun-like stars but most of them are actually floating freely through space. And free-floating sub-brown dwarfs similar to the one posited as Earth's primordial Sun, are more numerous than their larger siblings. What, however, was it that made Juergens theorize that Saturn and Earth had been floating outside the solar system demarcation before their capture by our present Sun? As with various other matters, this too was based by Juergens on yet another concept that had been proposed by Velikovsky. As Velikovsky had it stated in an almost offhand manner back in mid 1973, Saturn had somehow flared up in nova-like brilliance. It is unfortunate that Velikovsky misplaced the event in time, placing Proto-Saturn's flare up just ahead of what has come down to us as Noah's deluge when there is much better evidence for placing it some 5000 years earlier during that primeval event that lit up the sky for the very first time during mankind's surging on Earth. In the book of Genesis, this event came to pass when Elohim gave the order to "Let there be light." But let this not be thought of as a unique biblical event. On the contrary, this sudden shedding of light into what had been a somewhat darkened world is described in various ways in the mytho-historical records of just about all ancient nations, from Mesopotamia and the rest of the Near East, India and the Far East including China into Egypt down to Africa, Greece and Rome, North America and across the stormy seas to the islands in their midst. As far as Juergens was concerned, the sudden flare-up resulted when the Sun captured the Proto-Saturnian system including Earth into its electrical domain. Thus, according to him, Proto-Saturn's discharge was diverted to the new ruling body since Proto-Saturn found itself much too highly charged for its altered environment. This concept was later taken up by Wallace Thornhill, who pointed out that Proto-Saturn's entry into the solar plasmasphere would have required rapid adjustment by the intruder to the new electrical environment where the Sun was the main focus of electrical activity. So likewise, Donald Scott, when he spoke of bodies like Proto-Saturn and the Sun possessing different inherent voltages. Thus he tells us that when the plasma spheres of such bodies come in contact with one another, an electric current in the form of an arc discharge will fly between them to the detriment of the lower voltage body. In the case in question, the lower voltage body was Proto-Saturn, our primordial Sun, flared up in a brilliant, blinding light that went down in mytho-history as Day One. But can brown dwarfs freely flare? You bet they can and do. Very much like bonafide stars, brown dwarfs also have a tendency to flare up. The brightness produced by their X-ray emissions during these outbursts were originally considered hard to believe and said to have shocked scientists. Such rays have even been detected from what are considered to be lightweight brown dwarfs, strong radio waves spiking at 10,000 times stronger than what astronomers thought possible, indicating flare energies that have actually been compared to those emitted by the Sun have also been detected from these stellar dwarfs. There is an awful lot of mytho-historical material indicating the creative outflow emitted by the Proto-Saturnian flare up. As in other matters, toward the world we come across this outflow as having actually spiraled out across the sky. As in other matters, it is not easy to get away from what has gone down in mythology as the spiral of creation. And here once again we find that on a much larger scale eruptive material from supernovae has a tendency to expel electromagnetic detritus in vast widening spiraling streams as can be seen in the eruptive matter expelled by the giant red star known as R Sculptoris. While it's a sub-brown dwarf, Proto-Saturn's discharge would have been nowhere as close to that of a supernova, it should be kept in mind that within the restrictions of certain parameters, plasmatic occurrences can be scaled up or down from microcosmic to macrocosmic extents without losing their intrinsic behavior. It, therefore, seemed that what our ancient forebears described to have seen spiraling out across the sky, was an accurate report of what was actually transpiring at the time. That the planet Saturn is the end result of brown dwarf degeneration, has more than been implied by orthodoxy. As Glenn Schneider opined, "Given a billion years of cooling and evolution and these objects may be indistinguishable from planets." Or, as Maria Zapatero Osório stated, "With time, brown dwarfs will look like Jupiter and Saturn." That's for that billion years required for such a devolution, how about that monster of a protostar in the Sophias constellation that has been claimed by astronomers to be able to develop into a high mass star in about a mere 10,000 years? Coincidentally or not, 10,000 years is precisely the amount of time Sam Flamsteed claimed it would take a brown dwarf star to turn into a Jupiter- or Saturn-sized planet. In fact, let us be quite honest. As it has been pointed out, the line between planets and brown dwarfs is rather blurred. At present, planet Saturn radiates more heat than it receives from the Sun. Its total heat emission has been calculated to be about two or three times the solar energy it actually receives and, as it has been claimed, an actual internal heat source is definitely called for. At present, it is believed that helium, percolating toward the core, is responsible for this excess heat that has turned Saturn into a world that is hotter than it should be. But, in view of what the ancients had to say, it is more than probable that Saturn's excess heat is a residue from when it radiated as Earth's primordial Sun. Besides its excess heat, Saturn also shines with its own light. At least to an extent. As low as its illumination is, its glow, which has been likened to a Chinese lantern, is sufficient to back fly to the planet's clouds. But let us cut straight across the lawn. That the planet Saturn is the relic of what had previously been a brown dwarf star is now an accept tenet of mainstream astronomy, and there are indications or is there any evidence that Earth did not always belong to the solar system? As a matter of fact, NASA's Genesis spacecraft made a hell of a discovery when its instruments revealed that the solar system's inner planets, including Earth, do not contain the same ratios of oxygen and nitrogen as the Sun. While the interstellar boundary Explorer found that the gases contained within the entire solar system are different from those outside its boundaries. What all this and other evidence has been interpreted to mean is that the solar system, including Earth, came into being in a different part of the galaxy than the one in which it('s) presently located. More importantly however, the Genesis spacecraft readings imply that Earth could not have formed out of the same nebulous material that is thought to have created the Sun. What all this boils down to is that, while the Sun seems to have shifted its location within the Milky Way galaxy, some of its members including Earth had to have been captured into its chaotic family even later. As it happens and this is not at all surprising, our ancient forefathers have been telling us that long, long ago the Sun was young, the present Sun was young and no bigger than a star. They continued to tell us as time... they continued to tell of the time when the Sun was originally very small, hardly a nail's breadth across, but as they also said, one day it suddenly began to grow till it was a span across. One interesting point about these reports is that the Sun, the present Sun, was not merely remembered as having been smaller than it is at present or that it grew in size but that it was known that this resulted because it had actually still been far away. It, therefore, seemed that our ancient ancestors we are not exaggerating in their descriptions of these primordial events. So please, let us pay attention to what they have recorded. Thank you for listening. 
[Music] Our Milky Way is a vast structure containing millions of stars. It contains long-stretching spiral arms which connect to the center. At the heart  of the Milky Way lies a vast bulge. At the core is an object of mystery that is connected to how the galaxy functions. The mainstream call this a black hole, assuming that somehow gravity is able to compress matter into a very small space. In the Electric Universe we would consider this object to be a plasmoid, possibly similar to the ones Eric Lerner was able to produce in his experiments. This would be a highly concentrated structure of plasma with intense electric and magnetic fields, compressing material into the torus and also streaming material out of the  poles. Around this object sits a larger structure which stretches for about 700 light  years. It is a dense zone of activity called the central molecular zone. Here you will find almost 80 percent of the entire galaxy's dense gas. It contains many dense molecular clouds that would normally be expected to produce stars, but are instead devoid  of any. On top of this, the material is not stationary, moving at supersonic speeds of hundreds of kilometers per second. By comparison, the Maggie filament we examined in the last episode was moving at about 54 kilometers per second. If  gravity was the only force shaping our galaxy, you would expect this central molecular zone to be centered on the black hole. And yet, this is not the case. The central molecular zone is offset; they are able to identify two large scale flows across this region, which suggests they represent one, or at most two, coherent streams of material. Scientists struggle to explain where the central molecular zone came from. Nor how it can maintain its structure. One  major problem facing astronomers is that there is so much dust obscuring  our view of the central molecular zone, making observations in the visible spectrum  impossible. Luckily, infrared, radio, X-rays and gamma rays can penetrate the dust. Gamma rays are the highest energy particles; these are thought to be produced when cosmic rays crash into ordinary matter. When scientists mapped the gamma rays towards the heart of the Milky Way, it revealed that something near the center of the galaxy appeared to be accelerating particles to speeds approaching that of light, which in turn was creating an abundance of cosmic rays and gamma rays, just outside the galactic center. At the  same time, something at the center of the galaxy seemed to be preventing large portions of cosmic rays from other parts of the universe from entering. Scientists describe the effect as an invisible barrier wrapped around the galactic center, and maintains a significantly lower density of cosmic rays compared to the rest of the galaxy. Something is allowing cosmic rays to escape from the center, but prevents them from entering. The scientists are at a loss to explain it. There may well be a simple ex- planation for this behavior, but we will return to this in a short while. Twenty years ago, astronomers discovered a number of enigmatic radio-emitting filaments near the galactic center. At the time they defied an explanation. These filaments range from 10 to 100 light years in length and are no more than three light years across. Some of these filaments seem to be connected to concentrated areas of thermal emissions, which likely identified areas of star formation. They also detected upward streams which were non-thermal radio filaments. At the time they thought that these two processes were linked somehow. Wind forward nearly twenty years and new radio images reveal it in even more detail. Now they are able to see thousands of these  filaments. If we zoom in to where Sagittarius A is located, we can see it as what appears as the brightly glowing eye at the bottom of the image. We can clearly see the large cloud structure that lies to the side of Sagittarius A. We can also see smaller filaments that seem to stream in or away from Sagittarius A. You will also notice the much larger filament that runs across the image and seems to bend around this structure. The mainstream explanation for these vertical filaments is now that cosmic rays, streaming from the center of the galaxy, end up dragging the ambient magnetic field, compressing it and illuminating it. What remarkable particles can move and compress an imaginary construct? What could cause something to glow in  radio? This is generally an indication that electrons are undergoing acceleration. So why would these filaments emit thermal radiation, and others not? It is important to understand that we really do not understand what causes thermal emissions, nor that we can really label something as being hotter than something else, simply by looking at the radio emissions. Here is an example  of an explanation for thermal emission. ”The mechanism of radiation emissions is related to energy released as a result of oscillations or transitions of electrons that constitute matter. "A consideration to make is that when electrons or other charged particles are exposed to an electric field, this will make them flow along the field lines. This could cause smaller oscillations to be removed, thereby de-thermalizing the particles, making it appear as if they are cooler. If we are seeing the filaments glowing in radio, it does mean that there is an acceleration going on and I see two different mechanisms for this. The first is that they are being accelerated towards or away from the  center due to an electric field. The second is that the particles are following a helical path, causing a constant acceleration around the center. As we see electrons, we are likely dealing with a plasma which is flowing along these filaments. Now what about that barrier that seems to prevent cosmic rays from entering, but serves to accelerate particles from within the center outwards? One alternative explanation for this might be something that Hannes Alfven felt was a piece of the puzzle, that mainstream science continually ignored: the double layer. It was Langmuir who first discovered what is now termed as a double layer. A double layer is created in order to separate  plasma from its environment. It can be considered analogous to a biological cell wall. Both streaming electrons, and ions can also be present within these. So  how could this explain the magical barrier? Cosmic rays are generally considered to be high energy protons or positively charged particles. So  why might the core be deflecting these high energy particles, and yet accelerating any that reside within it? This could be explained if we consider that the core of the galaxy is net positively charged or electron-deficient, similar to how we consider a star to be electron-deficient. The double layer that forms around this would therefore contain a positive charge on the inside, and a negative one on the outside. Any positive particles within the interior which have enough kinetic energy to overcome the initial repulsion of the positive barrier, will then feel an acceleration towards the negative edge of the double layer. The edge of the double layer is a dynamic zone which is constantly being replenished, as ions get neutralized, and neutral particles become ionized. The existence of this double layer may also explain why we see the larger filament bending around this zone. If we  examine the wider image with many filaments, we see that they seem to be spread across a wide area, and do not seem to congregate to the central point. How could this be explained, and why does everything not connect to the central  plasmoid? I think at this point it is important to consider that there are a number of different models for how galaxies function, and probably none of them are entirely correct. Anthony Peratt's concept was that two intergalactic filaments would twist together and at a certain point along these filaments a double layer would form. This would collect material along the double layer and compress the material in between the filaments as they moved closer. He never modeled this central area, but referred to the work that Eric Lerner had done on plasmoids as one potential for this central area. This would mean that the plasmoid that formed at the center may not directly  be connected to the larger filaments, but instead, the two filaments would connect to multiple parts, and this in turn would stream in towards the central area. Halton Arp felt that galaxies were born from material ejected from active galaxies, which later turned into companion galaxies, as they moved further from the parent. Here we could consider that these galaxies are already within a filament and that as the material gets ejected into the larger filament, new connections are forged. Possibly this material is initially electron-deficient, so would draw streams of electrons towards it, which then later form the filaments that connect it. Now, it's equally possible that these vertical filaments are not part of any mechanism to connect to the galactic filament, but instead are filaments that are part of the internal structure of a galaxy. If we consider Hannes Alfven’s concept of a galaxy, he thought that there was a circuit which pushed material out along the axis and back along the equator. There is much we still do not know and  many open questions that these images raise. What is clear, is that the more we look, the more we see these filaments, both in the interior of our galaxy and spread throughout it, as well as between galaxies on a vast scale. This material is not dormant, but flows. Some  fast, some slow, powering our Electric Universe. [Music] [Music] 
and what point is when recognized that history is unfolding before one's eyes usually takes the benefit of hindsight to appreciate and events historic significance but once in a great while we find ourselves caught in the momentum of a watershed moment countless millions of human beings alive today have witnessed the collapse of the berlin wall the end of the soviet union and astonishing human achievements for man walking on the moon to landing a spacecraft on a comet but other watershed moments may come and go with no immediate recognition in our collective consciousness in the theoretical sciences some of the most profound and innovative breakthroughs have come from individuals who are far from household names for some of these theorists even as science discoveries have confirmed their models the significance of their work eludes institutionalized science in the early 20th century the Norwegian experimentalist Kristian Birkeland hypothesized that charged particles from the Sun were the cause of Earth's Aurora's although the scientific mainstream including the renowned mathematician Sidney Chapman ridiculed and dismissed Birkeland thesis several decades after brooklyn's death he was proven correct in 1970 the electrical engineer and plasma physicist hottest alphane received the Nobel Prize for his work on magneto hydro dynamics in his acceptance speech alphane decried the astrophysical communities theories about space plasmas he said it seems that astrophysics is too important to be left in the hands of theoretical astrophysicists who have gotten her education from the listed textbooks the multi-billion dollar space data from astronomical telescopes should be treated by scientists who are familiar with laboratory and magneto spheric physics circuit theory and of course modern plasma physics more than 99 percent of the universe consists of plasma and the ratio between electromagnetic and gravitational forces is 10 to the 39th power today instruments measuring data across the entire electromagnetic spectrum have confirmed the theoretical predictions of electrical pioneers such as Birkeland and alphane astonishing filamentary structures per me the Milky Way galaxy rope-like structures called Birkeland currents connect the Sun to the earth driving the Aurora's and profoundly affecting Earth's climate and weather dry and rocky comets discharge electrically as they plunge to the sun's electric field planets discharge like comets jetting material into their upper atmospheres the disconnected and electrically inert cosmos of mainstream astronomy has been falsified yet it seems that both institutionalized science and popular media have yet to receive the memo countless billions of dollars continue to be spent in the futile attempt to confirm a falsified cosmology scientists and ability to find elusive dark matter particles or gravitational waves has done nothing to inhibit the astronomical expenditures yet history has shown that with no advance fanfare everything can change virtually overnight the space sciences may be on the cusp of a truly watershed moment we at the thunderbolts project are devoted to exploring the electrical

welcome to space news from the electric universe brought to you by the thunderbolts project at Thunderbolts dot info according to a new report the latest data from the NASA space probe Voyager 1 has left scientists without a working model for the outer solar system NASA scientists recently concluded that Voyager 1 may have reached the outer boundary of the solar system called the heliopause however the scientists were met with a surprising discovery the solar winds surrounding the spacecraft had come to an inexplicable standstill this was a surprise to scientists who had expected the solar wind to be directed laterally like water hitting a barrier why is this discovery so surprising to NASA scientists and how does this affect our understanding of the Sun the news came out that NASA's Voyager 1 indeed had gotten through the the boundary of the solar plasma which most people call the heliopause what they discovered was that the wager was no longer seeing any rapidly moving solar wind particles the the particles that they were observing had essentially died out to almost zero and there's a very interesting plot that they issued with their news and I don't think there is anything in the standard model that would account for that they expected the solar wind maybe to go reach into some reaches some sort of a wall and then divert change direction go off in a 90 degree angle or something but they didn't expect it to just stop the electric universe model predicts a reversal of the sun's electric field as a space probe approaches the Heliospheric boundary this boundary acts as a virtual cathode in relationship to the Sun as the anode in a electrical exchange the charged particles from the Sun will not be deflected laterally as the standard model predicted but the solar wind will simply cease the e model certainly predicts there to be an electrical virtual cathode out there at the in that neighborhood and the all of the data that nASA has just released this week absolutely confirms that I mean they couldn't be more consistent with what what our predictions have been the electric universe model of the Sun has been developed over many many years is essentially that the what we are living in is something very analogous to almost akin to a plasma discharge that has been done in plasma laboratories for the better part of a century now with an anode at one end and a cathode at the other and you have certains plasma structures in there like the anode glow and the and the corona and so on and that's exactly what we are seeing the the standard model says no no this is not electrical this is all having to do with winds and pressures and atomic energy and that sort of thing but they really don't want to talk very much about electrical processes and we do and this latest data says that no I can't put it any other way that the electrical model is correct there indeed is an electrical boundary out there consisting of a wall of electrons which is what we have been wall and I and several of us have called a virtual cathode we've been calling it that for years and I think it turns out that we are we are correct if the Sun is at the center of a Heliospheric electric field many of the sun's most puzzling features may now have a coherent explanation this may also explain why so many recent discoveries have presented mysteries for solar physicists one of the most important ones because of a paper that was published by a fella boy whose name is Hana Shoji and he had two or three cooperative workers and with him essentially disproves the idea that there can be a convection zone on the Sun the standard model of the Sun says there's a there's a fusion reaction in the middle and there's a radiation zone where energy is radiated away from that fusion zone and then after a while about halfway out to the surface of the Sun the energy becomes transported by the convection process which is matter moving in response to a temperature gradient and Hannah soaky's investigation absolutely says if mankind has learned anything about fluid flow over the last hundred years about convection especially convection is not possible in that area of the Sun so that was a dagger through the heart of that vampire I mean there is no way that that standard model can can survive the if Hannah Sookie and his colleagues are are correct the other one is how round the Sun is it's almost a perfect sphere and if it were as the standard model predicts it to be it should not be that round the course they see it's always been a problem for standard model is so why does the Sun rotate so much more rapidly at its equator than it does at its poles one of the big problems seems to me that has never really been answered by the standard model is why does the Sun have a corona at all why is it there in the first place it serves no useful function if the Sun is just a fusion furnace I mean it's their their model is if the Sun is like a big wood stove except it isn't burning wood it's burning hydrogen and turning it into helium and so fine if that's the way it is then what is that glowed we see out there that electrical plasma discharge that we call the Sun's corona why is it there for continuous updates on space news from the electric universe stay tuned to Thunderbolts dot info 
on the surface of today's most well-studied comet we see fields of rubble everywhere from great boulders down to gravel sand and dust a surface littered with debris but was not supposed to be there is just to boldly present why would an evaporating clump of ice and dust look more like the debris strewn surface of Mars than any comet that scientists ever dared to dream of the debris of 67p will force a confrontation with fundamental assumptions for proponents of the electric comet this is an open invitation to pose the unasked question is there a logical evidence-based connection of the 67p rubble field to the origins of the comet as to its birth as a comet it's only reasonable to see the rubble field in such terms because the tiny nuclei of comets are not appreciable attractors the vast emptiness of interplanetary or interstellar space picking up just one Boulder in a million years would be a remarkable feat but those who have explored the electric comet hypothesis know quite well what the rubble field is telling us the comet was born in intense electrical exchanges between planets when planets moved on vastly different paths than they moved today within the electric universe community researchers have across several decades explored pervasive evidence for planetary instability and violent close approaches of planets in the not so distant past seen in electrical terms at it's very birth 67p was immersed and debris from a planetary surface even the nucleus itself looks like a jumble of debris on a large scale what we see are massively disordered and fractured blocks constituted of rock and apparently no ice at all along the towering cliffs of 67p we see the telltale signature of geological strata of course that would be one of the first things to look for wants the idea of violent removal from a planetary surface actually registers the visible straight has seen so clearly on separate fragments of 67p have no consistent alignment with that of other fragments by all indications massive blocks of material some of it looking very much like mountainous terrain were removed from a rocky planet to form a conglomerate on a grand scale and that's what the electric comet hypothesis has always maintained crustal material torn from a planetary surface and intense electrical exchanges between planets with extreme selective heating and significant electrical fusing of the removed debris it's the planetary origin of the comet that underpins our prediction of a host of complex silicate and clay materials that would not be expected or even possible in the deep freeze and vacuum of remote space such materials would be common on the surface of a rocky planet in particular a planet in the habitable zone of the Sun that's why we so eagerly await the reports on ejected dust from 67p we expect the presence of complex crystalline structures not the rudimentary Stardust of popular comet theory not the residue of an imagined nebular cloud a billion years ago but rather the residue of planetary catastrophe recorded just a few thousand years ago by humans on earth you 
well thank you once again for enduring me I guess this is three times now it is a privilege to talk and to have an opportunity to address you about the Sun I'd like to dedicate this talk to my mother checking in and actually she maybe like a lot of our mothers taught me the most important lesson and we're all trying to learn lessons here but the lesson she taught me on her knee was to love now when we consider the Sun currently it's viewed as the gaseous plasma and I'm going to advance that from the photosphere down or - after hearing David's talk last night from the photosphere in I didn't hear the whole talking force which is the part but from the photosphere in the Sun is condensed matter and in the corona and the chromosphere you have a combination of condensed matter and plasma now the first proponent actually of the gaseous Sun was Herbert Spencer he was a very prominent evolutionist his works were largely ignored by astronomers but he got into quite a few little scuffles and if you're interested in the history of how the Sun became a gas the citation is listed here but the real person who gave us a gaseous Sun actually was father Angelo secchi he was a just a spectacular astronomer and if anybody has the chance online you can see his books lissa lay there in french and but even if you can't read the French look at the figures they're phenomenal and also LV Fay so the Sun really became a gas in the minds of these men in the 1960s and many prominent men of the figure of the time in physics so we can say that around 1965 is when the idea that son was a gas was really born now for Herbert Spencer it wasn't fully a gas it was a kind of a bubble was a gas inside it was condensed matter outside for Fey and secchi the Sun was a gas that had floating solid particles on the photosphere because they wanted to have the thermal emission spectrum but what happened with Fay is something quite important it's here that the Sun lost its surface so when you talk to an astronomer they tell you well the Sun doesn't have a real surface it's an optical illusion and of course we can use mathematics to justify that but the idea actually goes all the way back to LV Fay in an article he wrote a name owned in 1865 which I translate here for you so then the exterior surface of the Sun which from far appears so perfectly spherical is no longer a layered surface in the mathematical sense of the word the surfaces rigorously made up of layers correspond to a state of equilibrium that does not exist in the Sun so surfaces do not exist in the Sun this limit is in any case only apparent so since in 19 1865 we've thought that the Sun does not have a surface now actually some observational astronomers didn't agree with that and there were arguments about the Sun did it have a real surface or not you could find papers into the 1900s until then there were papers by Schuster Schwarzschild and of course Eddington and the Sun then became fully gaseous or been viewed mathematically as fully gaseous and the observational astronomers just lost that biodome so today if you look at the present model of the Sun we have a core and in the core it's thought that all the photons are produced and why do we know that because of kirchoff's law of course I just showed you that that is no longer valid you cannot produce photons in the core of the Sun and then we have other layers of the radiation zone the photons are leaving the core and they're radiating out then we have convection zone and eventually for the gaseous on it takes millions of years so photons to finally escaped here and give us an emission spectrum now this can be justified using Stefan's law the center of the Sun being very very hot if you say that the amount of photons that you get moves with temperature to the fourth and you really believe that the surface here is at five thousand Kelvin and that's temperature to the fourth you'll see there's an enormous amount of photons produced here so this has to be considered enclosed and that's how they felt that the Sun could follow kirchoff's law that it could be considered enclosed now the question for us is does the Sun really have a surface and there's so much evidence about it and people have said it a long time ago there's no question the Sun has a surface and as soon as it has a surface it cannot be a gas so we have prominent prominences and coronal mass ejections that can rise from the surface and come crashing back down they represent real structures and they are not optical illusions so this is a little movie here and you're going to see a coronal mass ejection it comes back down and it crashes onto the Sun and when it does you see all these bright points lighting up so this is a collision that's taking place there is a boundary there it's not just an optical boundary it's a real boundary so I'll let you see it again now here's another line of evidence that the Sun has a real surface we have Carrington rotation on the Sun we've known this since the 1800s so the Sun exhibits differential rotation on the surface as first highlighted by Carrington when he was observing sunspots but but the corona winds are orthogonal to this direction and because there are thaw in all this requires a physical boundary so this is one of the simplest proofs you because you have this orthogonal displacement of matter you must have condensed matter there a gas cannot do this so another example was high-energy flares where it was discovered that if you look if you get a very very high-energy flare like greater than 10 mega electron volts they always occurred they were found to occur always towards the limb so this shows that this is an anisotropic process and again evidence so in it anisotropic means it doesn't occur in all directions in other words you're not sending x-rays out in all directions in space its preferential in one direction and that requires that you have a surface now to explain this the gaseous models say well look we have magnetic field lines that are coming in and then we have a mirror plane and then the mirror plane causes a reflection and then this gives us our directionality of course they're mirror plane is my surface now here this is an example from x-ray so if you look at the Sun and x-ray what do you see if you look at the line intensity the line intensity is about one over the entire radius of the Sun over the entire disk except at the limb exactly at the limb as soon as you cross a surface the line intensity doubles and if you think about that that means you're sampling twice as much atmosphere all of a sudden and this shows that you have a discrete surface when the disc ends so we see it an x-ray basically at every frequency band we see it now this is a nice simple line of evidence and some of you know that I took an ad out in The New York Times in 2002 and said the Sun was a was a liquid people really got a laugh out of it and I took a lot of heat of course the article the New York Times article I did that under the advice of a very senior professor which chooses to remain hidden from history but this was one thing that I cited in that New York Times article this particular figure and this figure is important because it shows transverse ways on the Sun so this is a Doppler image you're seeing a flare coming out in white at you in the upper left so the as the flare comes out you start seeing transverse waves produced on the surface and transverse waves can only exist in condensed matter gases cannot sustain such waves and this by the way is over millions of meters and so the wavelength here is millions of meters this is definitely not the gas now one of the things is so they're physicists are troubled by limb darkening and how do they explain it and I'll show you that in a minute but the Sun is brighter at the center and then it darkens as you go towards the edge as you go towards the edge of the disk it looks darker to us okay for the gas models we justify this using optical depth but I'm going to explain to you that this is actually a lattice effect caused by directional spectral emissivity which is well understood in the laboratory we don't need optical depth to explain this so in the gas model what are they saying when you're looking straight at the center of the disk you're looking deeper into the sign so it appears hotter because of the laws of emission tells you that that's going to look hot if you look deeper so therefore it's brighter but when you look at the edge of the Sun you're not looking as deeply so now it looks cooler okay so this is the optical depth argument which doesn't work and you could read this paper again one of the reasons this doesn't work is because kirchoff's law is not valid so you can't get blackbody spectra the fact that you can see differentially into the Sun shows that Kirchhoff's law cannot hold so anyhow you could read this paper now I've explained it this way by saying that the Sun has a true lattice so when you look at the photosphere it actually has not only a true lattice I want specifically this lattice I want a lattice where the hydrogen atoms so the Sun is primarily made out of hydrogen and I want to arrange the hydrogen in this structure and the reason is is because this is the structure the graphite adopts so hexagonal layers one on top of the other now I didn't propose this structure in 2002 but I have been saying the Sun has been a liquid since 2002 at least the photosphere and that has been as I first said in the New York Times than other articles and papers most of the work you'll find from from 2011 until present I think I produced 20 papers last year all I did was sit on my computer and just write write write so you can find a lot of papers and the most important paper to read which condenses everything is this paper on a building block for liquid Sun and another paper 40 lines of evidence for condensed matter so what is directional spectral emissivity well this is actually important to this society the emissivity of a material depends on whether or not it's a conductor so if it's if it's a nonconductor it's it's normal emissivity will start high so it's up here and then as you increase the angle of viewing the emissivity drops if it's a conductor the normal Mississippi is low and then as you increase the angle the emissivity goes up and then finally drops you could read about that in the papers described below now here's an example from the emissivity of granules now granules of course are substructures on the Sun and they're there what really what most of the surface is made out of and granules are best explained by Baynard convection that's a surface driven process so if you don't have a surface you're not going to get Baynard convection so you have convection up flow coming through the center of the granule and then it recedes on the edges okay so it looks like a little mountain so what does that mean well if we go back to our plot again what we know is that on the angle when it goes down we're increasing the angle so I it goes down it's going to be dark so we're going to have these dark inner granule lanes and that's exactly what you see it looks dark you have these dark inter granular LANs now in the gas model they say well that's because the temperatures are different this temperature is different than that one these are all different temperatures every time you see a different color I say no the temperature is pretty much the same or the energy content is pretty much the same but the emissivity changes because you've changed the direction that you're looking at it here's an example from sunspots now for hundreds for a hundred years now they've been telling us that sunspots are cooler the Umbra of sunspots are cooler now the first thing about sunspots is there a manifestation of a real structure they're not optical illusions so the surface is an optical illusion you surely don't can't have a real structure they are magnetic in nature this is well known and that's indicative that they're highly conductive they're emissivities are best explained by directional spectral emissivity in conductive materials not solely by temperature so you're not really looking at a temperature effect here the reason that the sunspot appears dark is seen in the book in the lower figure here see these materials are at the same temperature but this one's a conductor so it's emissivity is going to be low just like silver has a low emissivity right so that's why the sunspot appears dark it's not because it's cooler it's because it's more conductive now this one is going to be harder for you to see I couldn't find a good slide of a faq' lie but for you know what a faculy look like you know that we see the FAQ you lie you can't see them on this on the center of the Sun and they start appearing more as you move towards the limb they become very obvious towards the limb you look at this figure carefully even on the web you will see it so faculy our manifestation of real structure they're not optical illusions they have elevated magnetic fields which also indicates that there are there are formed from conductive materials there emissivities are best explained by directional spectral emissivity again in conductive materials so again we're looking at the sunspot at the center you don't see it much but all of a sudden its emissivity increases and now it starts looking white to us and then as it goes towards limb the emissivity drops now to explain this the gas models have to say that faq' lie I have hot floor hot balls and cool floors well the floor can't be cool because you're it's supposed to be hotter as you go inside the Sun when you look at the limb darkening argument and also how do you get a hot wall in a gas so it's very very simply explained just by going back to solid state physics and let's look at how conductors and non-conductors emit and this general rule can explain all these phenomena using a single explanation now as I've said in my talk on kirchoff's law the Achilles heel that the gaseous Sun is this spectrum there is no way that gaseous Sun can produce a continuous solar spectrum but nonetheless even in 1865 people were saying that the continuous spectrum of the Sun can be produced by a gas and remember ball firts Stewart he's the person who did Stewart's law so remember Kirchhoff was wrong about his law Stewart was right but Stewart wrote this paper saying that a gas could produce the continuous spectrum of the Sun so from all this it was inferred that the luminous photosphere is not to be viewed as composed of heavy solid or liquid matter but rather of the nature of either a gas or a cloud so he says a gas can account for this that spectrum and that's not correct here's another one from 1869 Franklin and Lockyer I mean for people who know their signs they know that these are big names the gaseous condition of the photosphere is quite consistent with its continuous spectrum and this condition has the possibility of this condition has already been suggested by Stuart Lowry and delivery now I have this slide the father of the gaseous son one of the fathers of the gaseous son now it's interesting that I call him a father of the gaseous son because if you read this quote you'll see that Kirchhoff actually believed that the Sun the sun's photosphere was either solid or liquid he didn't believe it was a gas at all but the problem is is that Kirchhoff gave kirchoff's law and when he did when he wrote this law which we just discussed in the previous talk he permitted the astronomers to make the son of gas so according to Kirchhoff's law as long as the Sun can be considered to be enclosed then it must contain black radiation even if it's gaseous obtaining a thermal spectrum is not a difficulty okay yet was kirchoff's law actually valid do arbitrary cavities really contain black radiation and if so why are all the laboratory black bodies always constructed from nearly ideally absorbing materials so clearly this wasn't right as we discussed in the previous talk now I didn't give this little experiment just turns out you know this this talk was ready first and then I was able to give the talk on Kirchhoff and I was only going to discuss this one in this talk so I'll discuss it now so here's an experiment proving the kirchoff's law is not valid so what we're going to do is we're going to have an inner box and an outer box in the inner box we'll make it out of a perfect conductor its emissivity is going to be zero its reflectivity is going to be one we leave that box open in the outer box we're going to make it out of a perfect absorber its emissivity is going to be one now we're going to take that outer box and we're going to plunge it into a helium bath now the the inside box is sitting on the floor or the outer box now when I put that outer box into the helium bath what happens the whole thing is going to go to 4 Kelvin now the outer box being a perfect emitter is going to give me photons at 4 Kelvin so I'm going to get a blackbody spectrum at 4 Kelvin now what do I do I close the inner box I get rid of the helium what happens everything goes up to room temperature now when it does what's going to happen through conduction the inner box using conduction is going to go up to 300 Kelvin but now that door is closed and it's got 4 Kelvin photons trapped in it it cannot produce 300 Kelvin photons because it's emissivity is 0 the outer box of course will produce 300 Kelvin photons and so it'll become filled with black radiation but remember kirchoff's law said both boxes were supposed to contain black radiation at the temperature of interest and now they don't so kirchoff's law is broken arbitrary cavities do not contain black radiation and of course as I mentioned my Kirchhoff talk these papers have all been submitted and the last one is not just submitted now it was I submitted it this week and it was immediately published so that's already published so the gaseous model of the Sun cannot account for the thermal spectrum that is the only proof that's required to establish condensed matter I don't need I wrote 40 but you actually only need this one I really don't care about the others because this one has a lot of physics in it but we'll throw in the others because sometimes people can't understand this one but they see the ripples on the Sun and they can understand that one now who are the notable advocates of a liquid Sun the first was Kirchhoff himself and unfortunately his law undid it Lord Kelvin was also a prominent advocate of the liquid santen and this is reviewed in this paper it's why I think you guys would enjoy the history paper of how the Sun became a gas but the most notable advocate of a liquid Sun was James genes and he was a phenomenal scientist and the story of James genes of Sun is described in the follow-up paper to the first one now there was an interesting character called Hastings and Hastings he wrote in 1881 he wanted graphite on the Sun but he knew he couldn't get it so granting this we perceived that the photosphere contains either solid or liquid particles hotter than carbon vapor and consequently not carbon because he knew he he couldn't get carbon but at any rate we are sure that the substance in question as far as we know it has the properties that are similar to those of the carbon group so he wanted something that behaved like carbon but he knew he couldn't have it in 1881 so this guy was pretty pretty smart back then now genes he had a different approach why did the liquid Sun die he thought all the stars were liquids and the reason it died is that he thought the Sun was made of uranium or radium well when it was proven that the Sun was mostly made out of hydrogen of course he was out of a building block but he did properly recognized the phase and he says there's only two possibilities for stars they can only be liquids or gaseous there's no intermediate okay one of the first points to make is that the Sun is condensed matter it has a true surface and solar emissivity must be accounted for by the presence of a true structural lattice and here's my nice New York Times article cited for you guys now remember you know I was trained as an inorganic chemist and you learn in chemistry that hydrogen is the little cousin of carbon so isn't that convenient now right at the time the genes was losing his building block in the 1920s and had to abandon his liquid son if he had read Whitner and Huntington's paper he would have had the solution because Wigner who is a Nobel Prize winner in physics said that at high temperatures and pressures hydrogen will become metallic it'll assume a structure which will be condensed so let's let's read exactly what he said the objection comes up naturally that we have calculated the energy of a body-centered metallic lattice structure only and that another metallic lattice may be much more stable we feel that the objection is justified it is possible however that a lattice like lattice has a much greater heat of formation and is obtainable under high pressure Diamond is a valence lattice but graphite is a layered lattice so here what happens is Wigner and Huntington in 1935 tell us that hydrogen can assume the graphite form then Neil Ashcroft which is one of the top condensed matter physicists in the world and a great authority on metallic hydrogen wrote a paper which he forwarded to me in 1991 and in that paper Neil wrote on a little reflection it is apparent that all the quantitative remarks just presented on the band overlap state in dense hydrogen by the way he just recently forwarded to me on a little reflection it is apparent that all of the quantitative remarks just presented on the band overlap state in dense hydrogen could have been made with minor modifications about graphite the tetravalent hexagonal band overlapped one atmosphere semi-metal accordingly it is instructive to examine the known optical characteristics of graphite in the visible range graphite appears black to some extent these characteristics are reported to be shared by very dense hydrogen one possible choice for the structure of dense hydrogen consistent with hexagonal symmetry is actually a graphite like arrangement and then lo and behold some people are working while the rest of us are sleeping and this person this group actually recently created dense hydrogen with a with a graphene structure so the spectral signature of the strongly interacting hydrogen molecules is consistent with the presence of graphene like sheets a configuration predicted in early calculations on dense hydrogen so now we have something quite close in the laboratory so again this is the structure that we're looking for now what have I said I said the photosphere is comprised of metallic hydrogen which which has assumed graphite which has assumed the graphite like layered hexagonal lattice the inter nuclear distance is within this lattice or such that the material is semi metal not very metallic not highly conductive so this photosphere cannot be highly conductive why do we know that we know that from its emissivity remember its emissivity is high at normal and then drops with angle so that means you can't make this a conductor okay but as you go inside the Sun then there's compression and so the lattice gets compressed and sunspots faq' lie and the convection zone are comprised of metallic hydrogen which has adopted the same graphite light layered structure but this time it's type 2 in this case the inter nuclear distance is decreased much the material such that the material becomes highly conductive and able to support both strong magnetic fields and the solar dynamo which cannot be correctly explained in the gas model so we have a solar dynamo how do we get it to get a dynamo you need a combination of conductors and insulators you can't get that in a gas the solid solar core is likely to be composed of metallic hydrogen which has adopted a body centered cubic this was first proposed by Professor Sewell issue Maru the corona possesses both free ions and atoms and sparse distributions of metallic hydrogen which are type 1 which have been ejected from the solar atmosphere into the solar atmosphere from the body of the Sun so there's emissions I just showed you a coronal emission in I mean a coronal mass ejection in the movie so the Sun is sending stuff up into its atmosphere the chromosphere possesses both free ions and atoms and sparse distributions of dense hydrogen but that is not metallic hydrogen its molecular in nature and it results from the condensate and it results from condensation reactions in this region and the transition zone does not exist so this is what we're saying in this model the center if you look at the center of the Sun I think the body centered cubic makes the most sense for the structure and of course this is open to debate you can come up with your own ideas but I think this one makes the most sense now in the photosphere we have the hexagonal layered structure with hydrogen if you go inside the sign in the sunspots and the convection zone we have the same structure but now it's compressed see this this the inner nuclear distance is larger here than here so this is more compressed when it goes compress the conduction gets very good the quantum conditions are fulfilled for good conduction so this becomes a conductor whereas here the quantum conditions are not fulfilled and this could even be an insulator or semi metal now in the chromosphere we'd have a structure that might be something like this this is isn't - crafts and paper not for the Sun but generally in reviewing dense hydrogen so he has a hexagonal structure again but now the hydrogen's are molecular in nature so what happens in the Sun is that you're actually fighting to recapture the hydrogen in the chromosphere and then that enters the Sun and it gets recompressed into metallic hydrogen so the continuous spectrum so the chromosphere has a continuous spectrum and because it does that's direct evidence that this region contains condensed matter the chromosphere is likely to be a site of hydrogen recapture and condensation in the solar atmosphere as evidenced by its emission spectra the chromosphere thereby acts to help conserve the mass of the Sun by harvesting some of the atom hydrogen atoms and protons which have been released into the solar atmosphere so here's an example of I just love stumbling on just a beautiful paper you know you're not really looking for it but it just falls right into your lap like this paper by Earl who won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry I don't think for this work but here's an example of condensation reactions and clusters so you have two metal clusters with different amounts of atoms in them and when they combine they make an activated cluster that's why there's a star there and then it relaxes that activated cluster relaxes by emitting a lone atom within activated state and then that atom then is deactivates by emitting a photon so we know that in the chromosphere we have light emission okay we have emission lines from many many types of cations and atoms and it will adopt the same ideas so what we're going to say this is the simplest idea we can adopt we have hydrogen's of different numbers of hydrogen's in both groups they come together in activated form that gets deactivated you lose a hydrogen and the hydrogen you lose is is active and then that activated hydrogen then gives rise to the light now this can be if you read the paper where this is described you will see a very beautiful explanation why we have helium triplet lines in the Sun that are so intense and and in order to get a helium triplet line remember you need about 55 electron volts to get those lines and the chromosphere is only supposed to be at 5,000 Kelvin so how do you get 55 electron volts there well what they what the current models say is that well the triplet lines of helium are excited by photons coming from the corona they're selectively the selective photons come just with the right frequency and excite triplet helium but if you read my paper you will see that helium is a great way to harvest hydrogen and it's known that if you have helium and hydrogen mixtures when you have such mixtures you get ions you get helium hydride cation and you can get activated helium hydride and I believe we have both in the Sun these things are ubiquitous in mixtures of hydrogen and helium now here's an example for magnesium you might ask well why is it that it's magnesium two lines that we see why do we see calcium two lines why don't we see the calcium three lines which of course the calcium three lines correspond to calcium having lost two electrons right so why is it that we don't see the calcium three lines why do we see calcium two well here's an explanation from condensation reaction the same kind of scheme with magnesium so now we know magnesium hydride is known to exist in the Sun on the disk and in the sunspots so what happens is that magnesium hydride then condenses with a condensed hydrogen structure and then donates a hydrogen that structure becomes active it kicks it donates a donates a hydrogen it kicks off the magnesium the the hydrogen structure grows by one hydrogen atom the magnesium is now active and now you get an emission line this by the way I had missed something very important in these reactions and my young son who's an undergrad at OSU said dad and I didn't listen to him he kept telling me dad you're missing something and three times he tried to tell me until finally he convinced me I was missing something you could read my son's paper it's a beautiful addition to this problem now how about the corona well we know that the corona has white light it emits an white light now how do they explain that in the gas model well what they say is we have relativistic electrons in the corona and those relativistic electrons are scattering the photosphere 'ok light now in reality we know that the que corona is becoming the spectrum of the que corona is indicating that the temperature is dropping with distance if you look at the continuous spectrum of the que corona its reddening with distance that means the temperature is dropping away from the sun but all of you know of course that we can have iron 25 up there let's say quite high up one radius up from the solar surface you can have iron 25 you have these enormous ionization states how do you get them so first the continuous spectrum of the corona does not represent photosphere 'ok light scattered by relativistic electrons it constitutes direct evidence that the corona is both self luminous and relatively cool an apparent temperature associated with vibrational degrees of freedom which are no greater than that of the photosphere and which decreases with elevation not increases the presence of highly ionized species in the corona are not associated with temperatures in the millions of degrees but with the presence of condensed matter in the corona which possesses an Aleve ated electron affinity which can strip the electrons which can strip the atoms of their valence electrons so you've got metallic hydrogen there it's starving for electrons and if you're an unfortunate iron atom that comes near it you're going to get stripped of all your electrons the corona is the site of electron recapture and it works to help maintain a neutral solar body now one of the big problems in the Sun has to do with the solar wind and I want to say on time here has to do with the solar wind and the solar activity if you ask your solar physicists why does the Sun go active why do we have a solar wind now the solar wind I discuss it in my paper and I consider the current explanation a violation of the laws of thermodynamics and you could read the paper so basically what we have is is that somewhere outside the Sun in the coral in the atmosphere of the Sun you have to drive energy processes onto the Sun so you get flares why because you have magnetic energy transfer onto the surface so now I got energy flowing towards the Sun but in the solar winds I have to have heat going away from the Sun well you can't have the heat going in both directions it's either going towards the Sun or it's going away from the Sun so their explanations for solar wind doesn't work but if you read this paper liquid metallic hydrogen 3 what do you see I also wrote a paper on helium in the Sun because of course the solar physicists are telling us that the Sun actually has a reasonable amount of helium and as you know helium is one of the three pillars for the big bang right so the microwave background is one the redshift is another and helium is the third so helium in the Sun is very important to the astronomers because it's also linked to cosmology but look at what the Sun is doing with the cycle what is it doing when it's quiet so you look here and at the at the top here the top of the figure in 1996 and 2006 that's when the Sun is quiet so when the Sun is quiet there's hardly any helium two lines on the outside it's quite silent but when it goes active it starts expelling helium so when why does the Sun go active because it's degassing it's non hydrogen elements it wants to kick everything out so when the Sun is quiet at the poles you have coronal holes at the and in those coronal holes material is leaving the Sun at constant rates and so now the Sun is degassed it's able to de gas its poles when it's quiet but when it goes but it can't do anything about the equator any any atoms that are made that are non hydrogen made in the equator of the Sun they're trapped they can't get out why and I'll show you this in a minute so because they can't get out I'll show you in a minute so because they can't get out the Sun has to go active to D gas the equator and so that's why we see the Sun going active so here's an example we know from graphite again graphite can make intercalate compounds since I'm an inorganic chemist I know this okay now how does an intercalate compound work well what happens is you have your so we're going to assume that our metallic hydrogen which can have the same structure as graphite also can do this now what I'm saying is that because inside the Sun you want to keep these metallic hydrogen bands conductive you want to you want to keep these layers conductive we've got electron flow going through there so if you have a nuclear reaction you can you create an atom that's non hydrogen what happens is you kick it into the intercalate region so you end up building these atoms in the intercalate zone and then you have these hydrogen sheets well now what you have now you have your insulator that you need for your for your Dynamo and you have your conductor okay but the Sun if you look at the elements that are in this region these atoms they can't translate in this direction they cannot go through the planes so what but they have almost free motion in this region so in the poles if you orient the poles this way now those atoms can go out and so now during the corona went during the when the period when the Sun is quiet you have atoms escaping at the poles and in the equator you can't do that because now you say so I almost have to draw this for you but in the in the equator the the hydrogen planes are on the surface of the Sun they're aligned parallel to the surface of the Sun so now the atoms are trapped inside so what happens is that when you get activity these atoms can change from a solid phase to a gas phase and when they do that pushes the layer up so that's why we get solar activity and the atoms leave okay so the Sun tries to D gasps its equator and that pushes the layers up and this is why we were getting the sunspots now there's something very interesting about this and that is that it this idea very easily explains why do we get red giants the reason you get red giant says you have a star it has a real lattice it has a hydrogen lattice and that hydrogen lattice doesn't want the other elements so it starts making these layers and all of a sudden all these layers decide to go in the gas phase at once and all of a sudden path you're going to get a red giant now if you had all these atoms in one region of the Sun so let's say for instance the Sun has managed to put these atoms in one layer there's a lot of non hydrogen atoms in one layer that are in the solid state and all of a sudden these go to gas phase now you'd get a supernova so I'd like to acknowledge some people my son Luke he does all the drawings for my papers and all so that the one paper where he corrected his dad we didn't correct me he added a new idea that I had missed and so I'd like to acknowledge my son Luke I have another son also who contributed the paper to this Bernadette Carson cenar 'test and she's done lots of sketches for me all the Graphite's that you see of course my own department as you know this started from the a Tesla scanner and I went into this hard for a lot of people to understand but my department has kept supporting me for all these years and I'm grateful for them and of course the editors of progress in physics without that journal I would have never been able to publish many of these ideas and they have come up with a book inside stars and of course there's a lot of astronomers that are working out there and they're getting fantastic data for us and I'd like to recognize the data that I used both from Soho and the Swedish solar telescope thank you very much 
For thousands of years, we humans have gazed up at the sky and wondered, looked for messages, looked for keys to deeper understanding. But perhaps the cosmos is laughing. Do we really see the universe as it is or as we thought it should be? Throughout the space-age, astonishment and surprise have been the hallmark of scientific progress. Everywhere we've looked, whether close to Earth or in remote space, we've uncovered things forbidden by our theories. What we expected to find, we've not found. And things beyond all expectation have become commonplace. In science a surprise is always good news. It prods us to see things differently, to ask more pointed questions. One discovery in space inspires another, and beneath it all today is the encounter with the one thing our theories didn't allow -- intense electromagnetism. Electrical and magnetic energies in the vacuum of space beyond anything astronomers expected. That's what has happened as astronomers, physicists, and planetary scientists, have come face to face with the Electric Universe. Please join us in this journey to the frontiers of discovery at Thunderbolts.info 
Breaking News: EU Update Well, they say that if you have a dream, the universe provides. And I must say, the universe has provided us here tonight because of the Rosetta mission and the things that have been broadcast in the last day or so. So some of the material here was actually, I copied off the web yesterday morning. So this is really breaking news. And it's not your usual breaking news because it is critical of the news. Before I give you those news headlines which you can see flagged by the image here of the comet 67P, I'll give you a little bit of introduction. As all of you know now, Dave Talbott, Don Scott, Ev Cochrane and I got our initial inspiration from Velikovsky's thesis that the solar system has a recent dramatic history. And that unimaginably powerful electrical events were observed in the heavens by modern prehistoric humans. The evidence for this is now overwhelming. My own passion since reading 'Worlds in Collision' in the 50's, has been to understand the science needed to explain the mytho-historical evidence assembled by Dave, Ev and Dwardu Cardona. Dwardu is not with us at this workshop but his voluminous research and treatment of evidence is a must-read. It's difficult these days to keep up with the pace of new discoveries across all the sciences but it's necessary due to the Electric Universe's interdisciplinary foundation. And the fact that a real cosmology must be more than mere astronomy and mathematical speculation. So it's satisfying to see increasing numbers of scholars, engineers and volunteers willing to join the Thunderbolts Project. The principal aim of this Electric Universe workshop is to inspire and encourage those who may become future leaders in this great adventure. Some say it is perhaps the greatest adventure in history because by recovering the real history of mankind, we gain a clearer view of ourselves and our place in the universe. And that clearer vision shows the powerful role of electricity throughout the universe. I can't stress enough how important that is for our future in this Electric Universe. So welcome all to the adventure of the Electric Universe. Robert Stirniman Robert Stirniman says, "Of all the forces we know there is none stronger than a paradigm." And now we have the power of supercomputers to reinforce a paradigm through virtual reality to the extent that it enshrines established myth and blinds us to other possibilities. Nowhere in science is this more evident than in astronomy where a modern creation myth has been forged. Science has made the fundamental error of discarding myths only to produce new ones. The fact is that science can learn a great deal from myths and mythologists can learn a great deal from science. That has been the foundation for the Thunderbolts Project. Here's a topical example of computer generated mythology on behalf of the European Space Agency for the Rosetta mission to comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko. It shows that the aim is to confirm what we already believe. It is not testing a hypothesis, it isn't considering any alternative so the data will have to be force-fitted into the myth. That isn't science! Once upon a time... - Really? This is a good one, I promise. What is the key to life on Earth? - Water. Water. For a long time, the origins of water and indeed life on our home planet have been an absolute mystery. We began searching for answers beyond Earth. Where could all this water have come from? In time we turned to comets. One trillion celestial balls of ice, dust, complex molecules, left over from the birth of our solar system. Once thought of as messengers of doom and destruction and yet so enchanting, we were to catch one. So there's the myth. Of course, the Electric Universe version is wildly different and more interesting as you will learn over this weekend. And the Electric Universe story has been able to predict surprise after surprise from space probes, particularly comet probes. This is crucial to verify the insights of the pioneers of the Electric Universe, Ralph Juergens and Dr. Earl Milton who proposed the basic model of electrical interactions between a comet and the Sun back in the 70's. Now, what follows is a brief statement from Jean-Pierre Bibring who is the lead scientist for the Rosetta lander. Which shows the overwhelming attachment to the myth of icy comets, in the face of images of a comet that looks like solid rock. Oops, sorry, wrong way. There is no ice at the top, so it's covered by a mantle that we consider is essentially made of organic material. That's why it's very dark. And this material is one of the key things we would like to explore and analyze. There is no ice on top so it must be buried under a thin crust. Have you noticed how many astronomical mysteries are buried out of sight inside stars, planets, moons, black holes? Where you can speculate all you like and postulate anything you like. But I have some sympathy for Jean-Pierre because he has been misled by his teachers and colleagues into thinking that the mass of the comet equates to the amount of matter in it. Of course, because the measured, so-called, mass of the comet, suggests that it has only about a tenth to maybe 0.25 the density of water. But mass does not equate to the amount of matter as I'll discuss in a later session. Eyesight is our most important sensory input in science. If the comet looks like a tortured rock then that should be the first assumption to act upon. We've had plenty of prior warning from looking at earlier comet nuclei. But such is the power of the paradigm that we are incapable of seeing what is right before our eyes. It's a case of; it's not the things you don't know that caused the problems, it's the things you don't know you don't know. Before dealing with comet 67P... Where are we? Here, done that one, sorry. Here we go. Let's just go back and see what was found in the very first comet samples from the Stardust mission. It was full of surprises, as usual. In the "Science" journal of the 25th of January, 2008, Richard A. Kerr reported that first, "Not a single speck of unaltered pre-solar material was found by the Stardust mission." Two, "Wild 2 seems more related to asteroids than comets", said cosmochemist Larry Nittler. Three, "It's changing the way we think about comets", said John Bradley of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (LLNL). But it hasn't changed at all, as you can see from the earlier material. Stardust chief scientist Don Brownlee said, "Rather than preserving the original ingredients of planets, Wild 2 seems to be loaded with materials first altered by the great heat near the young Sun." It doesn't seem to occur to these people that they've always thought the planets were built from comets. It never occurs to them that comets may have been built from planets. Comet theory hasn't changed one bit. It hangs on to the solar nebula model but now with an ad hoc mysteriously modified composition to match the data. Because here, they shoveled the hot material from near the Sun out into the outer reaches where it could be incorporated into comets. This is a pretty messy kind of theory. But comet 67P here, from 10 kilometers distance, looks nothing like an ice and dust aggregate. It looks like a piece of a rocky planet! Which is what I said some weeks ago on the Space News on the Thunderbolts website. And note the bright spots up here, towards the center and upwards a bit. The Electric Universe model of comets says that comets are complex bits of planets, as you saw in that graphic from Dave Talbott earlier. The conjunction of two planets, if they come close enough, the electrical effects are to strip part of the surface into space. The talking of bright spots. Here's comet Hartley 2 in 2010, the comet rotates every 18 hours. It was reported... or before I do that, I'll go through this list here. This is some of the things that were found. The jet seemed to be issuing from those bright spots. The bright spots seem to be atop boulders or surface projections ― not fissures. The bright spots are generally featureless ― not just high albedo surfaces. And the jets issue orthogonally, that is vertically from the surface. Some jets on this comet you can see on the dark side. And one jet there where the arrow is, seems to start and stop abruptly. All of these are simple effects that you would expect from an electrical discharge but not from material issuing from inside the comet through odd-shaped vents and fissures. It was reported also, the amount of water changed dramatically night by night and even within a single night in some cases, doubling in that time. What surprised the researchers was this; As the amount of water went up so did the amount of the other gases and as the amount of water went down the others did too. The fact that the gases all varied together is somewhat puzzling because a large variation was found in the release of carbon dioxide relative to water, said the head of the science team, Michael A'hern. Researchers think that chunks of water ice are glued together in the Comet's core by the frozen carbon dioxide which evaporates before the water ice. The carbon dioxide gas drags, with it, chunks of ice which would later evaporate to provide much of the water vapor in the coma. This is an extremely complex model, and ad hoc. In the Electric Universe model, the gases in the jets are produced by spark machining of surface materials, surface minerals rather. So the gases all vary together. The variation in carbon dioxide, relative to water, could be expected from the movement of discharge points or jets on a non-homogeneous comet nucleus. And it is that same surface electrochemistry that may account for the extremely blackened surface. It may be hydrocarbons or even carbon itself, but it doesn't have to be. This is an opportunity for garage experiment as to test, using clay and rock as the target for a discharge. So here are some of the very preliminary findings about comet 67P that were announced early yesterday morning at a press briefing at the landing of the... ...the craft that was supposed to fix itself to the comet's surface. Hi, Eric Hand, Science Magazine. I was hoping to ask a question, I guess maybe for Jean-Pierre or maybe Holger. A geology question. We are getting slightly conflicting information. We were told, upon landing, that we landed in very soft stuff. And, you know, we see from the rover's picture you know, this very soft stuff with mobilized dust right in the middle of site J. But then we see these Shiva pictures, maybe near a cliff wall, and things that really do look like rocks. So I was hoping, one of you could explain what these materials are and how they can be explained by being made by comet processes, thanks. OK, what you are asking for is to try to be ahead, one year ahead of us because we made this mission essentially to answer the question you're asking now. So it's normal that we don't have the answers and probably the answer will demonstrate that the question is not really well formulated. When you say a cliff for example, it has some resonance in our head that the cliff is terrestrial sort of cliff analog. We don't think that we have that sort of cliff because the material is very low density anywhere. The density is 0., less than 0.5 globally. So the idea of having a very porous material at the very top came from that to the idea that there is no reason to believe that the crust is really a strong crust, as we thought in the past, on a very low density material there. So that's why we thought that finally with the first images we had plus the Cosima measurement showing that the floating grains were very fluffy, very porous that we might have that when we land it. We are not saying that actually it's not the case, it might still be the case. You might still have some really fluffy powder out of which you were, after rebouncing, again, the ejection velocity is very low there. So I will not be more accurate, that's what I said. What we have found has not demonstrated that we don't have a crust, it has not demonstrated that it's a crust. Are you satisfied? Thank you. I am very happy when you seem not satisfied. So I would follow you on that thought that the rebounds of the lander is an indication of a higher strength material that was a surprise to us. So with this picture of dust falling back to the surface, building high porosity layers, I would think we fail to explain the rebounds. So, but we have seen the variety of surfaces there, this snowfield soft stuff, and we have seen this rocky- like but no rock stuff which, which is perhaps a higher strength material, we also see stuff shining through a dust layer where the dust is wiped away or following the gravity field and exposing a higher strength material and this is something that we could consider be the reason for the rebound. So bounce in there, find a higher strength material and then get going for the next landing. So there you go. It was low density everywhere, this is the big hang-up. There are two things about that. One is that gravity is not understood. I'll be dealing with that later in the weekend. All we have is a mathematical description which is no help in understanding. Also, there is the possibility that the comet may have a hollow center. Also the floating grains were very fluffy. Well, electrical ablation of surface minerals can cause that. A higher-strength material that was a surprise to us, based on this erroneous assumption that mass equals the quantity of matter. With this picture of dust falling back to the surface, forming high porosity layers, we fail to explain the rebounds. Well, dust is being removed from the comet and moved around electrostatically as it is on the moon. It's probably superficial in most areas. It's rocky-like stuff, but not rock! Because it's impossible, according to the very low density estimate. This aspect is central to the Electric Universe explanation of gravity. Mass is not equal to the amount of matter, a fundamental error in physics. The electrical model as I said, even suggests hollowness. And then there was this interesting thing that was said, we also see this stuff shining through where the dust layer is wiped away or fallen off following the gravitational field. And exposing a higher strength material. And this is something we could consider could be the reason for the rebound. Well, the shining stuff may be the coronal discharges from the comet. If so, they would be featureless glows like St. Elmo's fire, perhaps with bright points at the active cathode spots, leaving behind a darker, blackened surface that had been modified electrochemically. Anyway, congratulations to the Rosetta mission team for a fantastic effort, shame about the science mythology. It was interesting, the following morning there was an ESA blog where geologists posted the following comment, and since it was an ESA blog we had to log in. I assume, he was somewhat of an expert. He said: "It looks like the shrinkage patterns of clay on the surface..." And this is the image from the lander looking at the surface nearby. "It is quite possible that clay is among the most abundant minerals on the panoramic landscape of the comet." Well, this is pretty outrageous thing to say because clay includes pyroxene and olivine which are high- temperature minerals. Also, to make clay you require water and a, more or less, planetary environment. He says it is, this form of clay is quite common in nature here on Earth. He said, weathering causes erosion of topographic highs and their deposition in basins, shallow seas and oceans. The effect of heat and pressure changes the minerals like olivine into clay and even cement and in the process captures and sequesters atmospheric carbon dioxide. This last point is interesting too because they could be the source of carbon dioxide as well as the water in the comet coma. So we switch to the Mars MAVEN mission which ducked out of the way when that comet shot past. Just recently, comet Siding Spring's flyby, which was 87,000 miles above the planet or about 140,000 kilometers. Debris from the comet added a temporary and very strong layer of ions to the ionosphere, the electrically charged layer high above Mars, this was the report. Such an electrical disturbance is expected from an electrified comet with a different potential to that of the planet and the closer the approach, the more severe the electrical effects up to a Tunguska-type event, or worse. In more recent news, it calls into question our beliefs about how planetary systems form. The caption for this artist's rendition says: "Astronomers have discovered an exoplanet that is 10 times as heavy as Jupiter but orbits its star in less than a day." However, such a sighting should be a relatively rare occurrence suggesting that physicists may have to reconsider their understanding of how stars interact with their planets. The existence of huge, Jupiter-sized planets so near to their stars is a long-standing puzzle, since they cannot form near to the star where it is far too hot. So the standard response is to say they must form much further out, where it is cool enough for ices to freeze out of the proto-planetary disk. This hypothetical protoplanetary disk circling the young star, hence forming the core of a new planet. And then, something then must move the planet into a close orbit, and one likely mechanism is an interaction with another planet or star. Well, it was the astronomer Tom Van Flandern who showed how unlikely these kind of occurrences are. So this is a highly speculative and unlikely scenario. And given the number of hot Jupiters discovered, this last point seemed strained. What's worse, exoplanets have been found orbiting backwards and over the poles of the star. The Electric Universe model of star and planet formation follows the plasma cosmologists', which is all peer-reviewed material, whose theory has been supported by recent infrared images of stars formed along glowing Birkeland current filaments in molecular clouds. As Hannes Alfvén wrote: "Gravitational systems are the ashes of electrical systems." But the Electric Universe models adds an... [a model, sorry] ...adds an electrical fissioning mechanism for forming hot Jupiters like this one that results from a new understanding of the electrical nature of stars. This planet may be recently born, instead of facing annihilation by crashing into the star, as the article later suggests. And this recent report shows the dogged application of the myth about planet formation from a dusty nebula. It says, "These dusty disks, likely created by collisions between leftover objects from planet formation, were imaged around stars as young as ten million years old and as mature as more than 1 billion years old. It's like looking back in time to see the kinds of destructive events that once routinely happened in our solar system after the planets formed. This is the kind of response you get from one of the scientists. Here we see the myth of solar system history stated as fact. But no two "disks" of material surrounding stars, look the same. The report says the features around the star HD 181327, which is the one on the right top corner there, resemble the ejection of a huge spray of debris into the outer part of the system from the recent collision of two bodies. But when all you have is gravity and explosions, your options are extremely limited. The disks look far more like corona discharges, which I've, you can see below there. Which makes sense if we're looking down the barrel of a stellar z-pinch which is something that we'll be discussing in more detail, especially after Don Scott has given his presentation. Also we only hear of accretion disks, yet stars regularly expel matter. So the notion of expulsion disks should be considered also. And here we have problems with stellar evolution theory. And it's a recurring theme in science reports over the previous months. But here's the latest one about stars in globular clusters. It's generally believed that all stars belonging to the same globular cluster were born together, from the same interstellar cloud and at the same time. Strangely, however, this is not the case. It appears that the more information astronomers acquire about the stars in Omega Centauri, the less they seem to understand the origin of these stars. The evidence discounts the stellar evolution model. Globular clusters have multiple main sequences. This is pretty odd. Two groups of stars with, either, an age difference of 1 to 2 Giga years or a significant difference in their carbon-nitrogen-oxygen content and a difference in helium abundance. Astronomers found that the bluest stars contain more heavy elements than those of the redder population. And these are all supposed to be the same age. This was exactly opposite to the expectation and they led to the conclusion that bluest stars have an overabundance of the light element helium. They are in fact the most helium-rich stars ever found. But why is this so? The team suggests that this puzzle may be explained in the following way; First, a great burst of star formation took place during which all the stars of the red population were produced. These stars transform their hydrogen into helium by nuclear burning. This is a standard story. Some of them with masses of 10 to 12 times the mass of the Sun, soon thereafter exploded as supernovae thereby enriching the interstellar medium with blasting it everywhere in the globular cluster. Next, the blue population stars formed from this helium-rich medium. This is really a crackpot theory, when you look at it. It's incredibly unlikely and complex. It's not been shown that the dispersal of heavy elements by supernovae can be enough to form second-generation stars in significant numbers. The EU says, the Electric Universe model, there's a tight alignment of the normal vector to the disk of globular clusters with that of the disk of satellite dwarf galaxies. So they're tied together in some interesting way. They seem to have had the same birth process by ejection from the core of the galaxy, based on Halton Arp's observations of ejection of quasars or nascent star clusters from the galactic core in the plane of the galaxy. And this meets neatly with plasma cosmology models of spiral galaxies. So globular clusters appear to be a form of nuclei of dwarf galaxies. I won't go on about the stellar ages and composition. The Electric Universe model of stars shows it to be incredibly complex and untestable, and it is invalid. When I got the news on April 23rd, earlier this year, that a flare had been detected by Swift and it was coming from a nearby flare star called DGCVN, I was initially very surprised. Swift doesn't normally detect flares from nearby flare stars and DGCVN is a relatively unknown star. There are a few things we know about DGCVN. It is an M-class star, also called a red dwarf, and is located only about 60 light-years away. It's a dim little red star. It has a luminosity that's about one thousandth the luminosity of the Sun. It has a mass that's about 1/3 the mass of the Sun and a radius that's about 1/3 the radius of the Sun. The largest solar flare ever recorded, happened on November 4th, 2003. It was so powerful that it overloaded the sensors measuring it but later calculations put it at an X45. Flares are classified according to their strength, the smallest ones are B-class, followed by C, M and X, the largest. And X45 flare is a very powerful flare. DGCVN's flare, however, was much larger. We can estimate how big the flare on DGCVN was with respect to this solar scale. It would have been an X100,000. So this is several orders of magnitude larger than the biggest solar flare we've ever seen. The flare that Swift triggered on from DGCVN, was only the beginning of what turned out to be a fairly extended series of flares. A flare event, if you will, that lasted almost 20 days. This was a very different star than the Sun so we don't really have to worry about this happening in the present day Sun. The young Sun, such large events may have occurred. In the present day Sun, the activity levels are much lower. The fundamental reason that DGCVN is more active than the Sun is, it's a very young star, 30 million years, it's rapidly rotating, young stars are born that way. And rapid rotation is one of the key ingredients which powers activity. The faster the rotation, the greater the activity. While not a threat to us, the massive flares of red dwarf stars can help us better understand the flares produced by our own Sun. They are also of interest because red dwarf stars are often orbited by planets. Some data suggest that 40% of red dwarfs have super-Earth-type planets orbiting in a habitable zone, where liquid water is possible. If this is true, then they are good candidates for supporting life. However, the habitable zone around a cool dim star like DGCVN is much closer to the star than the Earth is to the Sun. When planets are closer to their star, they're more susceptible to anything the star does. For instance, if the star flares, the planet is much closer to the star and it can be hit by the radiation or the particles that get ejected from the star when this flare process happens. If you happened to be on a planet around an M dwarf when one of these large flares went off, you'd be having a very bad day. I wanted to finish on this slide because this has significance for what we will be talking about when we discuss Proto-Saturn, later on the weekend. Because all of the story about the ages of these stars and how they behave and that the, our own, Sun is not likely to do this kind of thing, is based on erroneous science. None of it is valid. However, there are certain aspects that I just want to point out before my time is completely gone. The light curve that you saw there showed rapid onset and slow decay followed by lesser pulses gradually falling. And that's typical of lightning or an electrical discharge. Red stars don't have the photospheric granulation to regulate their discharge so this is the only way they can respond to changes in their environment. And they do so by changing in size and by expelling matter. And I would suggest that that red dwarf was actually giving birth to a satellite. It may have been of planet size. I think this is the way in the Electric Universe that these things happen and it has significance for the story of Proto-Saturn which we'll discuss later. Thank you. Thunderbolts.info 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info NASA's New Horizons mission has recently shared pictures of the most distant object in our solar system ever imaged by a spacecraft. It's nicknamed Ultima Thule, a relatively tiny body, just 19 miles long, located more than 4 billion miles from Earth in the so called Kuiper Belt. As we can see, like countless asteroids, some moons, as well as the majority of comet nuclei imaged to date, Ultima Thule is made of two distinct lobes which are joined by a thin neck region. Unsurprisingly, the only process by which planetary scientists can imagine the object forming is a collision between two bodies, both of which had accreted in the solar system's conjectured infancy, supposedly more than four billion years ago. However, for over seven years on this series we have outlined the amazing failures, both experimental and observational, of the gravitational accretion hypothesis to explain objects in our solar system and the universe beyond it. This crisis is outlined in a 2018 news report which states, "According to the traditional story of the origin of the solar system, the planets formed slowly from accretion, as particles in the circumstellar disk clumped together to great pebbles, then slightly larger spheres, on and on until they reached their current size. But when scientists tried to re-create this story with computer models, it breaks down. Rather than growing, these incipient planets tend to splinter after reaching pebble size." Based on the abundance of small double-lobed objects in our solar system, it would seem according to astronomers, that collisions between these bodies have not been particularly rare but have been relatively commonplace in our solar system's history. These objects have routinely floated together and then fused, incredibly sometimes forming a neck region in the process. In the case of the comet 67P, Rosetta mission scientists had favored the speculation that such a low-speed collision between two comets had created the double lobed nucleus. But more recently, a team of scientists acknowledged that 67P does not appear to be billions of years old. They performed simulations to try to prove that, a mere millions of years ago, two comets were destroyed in a high-velocity collision and then re-coalesced rather than dispersing in the vacuum of space, as depicted in the computer animation on your screen. In contrast, the Electric Universe has always proposed that comets, asteroids, and meteoroids, did not form from accretion billions of years ago. Rather, they were recently torn from planetary surfaces by interplanetary electrical discharge. In fact, as we have shown dozens of times, the double-lobed form is easily reproduced in experiments with electrical discharge creating a stunning analog for countless celestial objects. Today, physicist Wal Thornhill explains why Ultima Thule appears to be yet another resounding victory for the Electric Universe theory. NASA and the Space Age is the gift that keeps on giving. This last week we've had the New Horizons spacecraft arriving at a tiny body in the so-called Kuiper Belt in the outer reaches of the solar system. The nickname given by NASA scientists to the object is Ultima Thule; in classical and medieval literature a name given to a distant unknown region, the extreme limit of travel and discovery. Ultima Thule is a Kuiper Belt object or 'KBO' also known more specifically as a trans-Neptunian object or 'TNO' since the Kuiper belt occupies an enormous doughnut shaped volume in the cold outer reaches of our solar system beyond the orbit of Neptune. The New Horizons spacecraft is sampling this region from the orbit of Neptune at 30 AU out to a distance of 50 AU. According to the Nebular Hypothesis of formation of the solar system, astronomers believe there are millions of small icy leftover objects out there including hundreds of thousands that are larger than 60 miles or 100 kilometers wide. Some, including Pluto, are over 600 miles or 1,000 kilometers wide. When the first pixelated image of Ultima Thule arrived - showing an elongated object, I wrote, "This discovery, based on the double-lobed appearance, fits perfectly with the Electric Universe scenario. See for example my recent YouTube space news on 'Seeing Double.' Close-up images should probably show a non-icy rocky appearance like Comet 67P." A NASA web site tells us, "A fairly large number of Kuiper Belt Objects, or KBOs, either have moons -- that is, significantly smaller bodies that orbit them -- or are binary objects. Binaries are pairs of objects that are relatively similar in size or mass that orbit around a shared center of mass that lies between them. Some binaries actually touch, creating a sort of peanut shape, creating what's known as a contact binary. Pluto, and other minor planets; Eris, Haumea and Quaoar, are all Kuiper Belt objects that have moons." Formation by gravitational accretion didn't predict a double lobed shape for planetesimals, asteroids, or comets. In fact, it has difficulty in keeping small colliding particles together without some form of stickiness or electrostatic clinginess. Then there's a problem removing angular momentum from closely orbiting bodies. It requires a number of smaller objects to be slung out of the system to remove the excess momentum. But we run into a problem that was identified by the astronomer Tom Van Flandern. He said, "The most difficult objection for the gravitational condensation theory is to overcome how such objects could form in the first place." The mean distance between small bodies in the vast volume of the Kuiper Belt is so great that collision and accretion has negligible probability. So, the leftmost image from NASA JPL is fanciful, to say the least. Then there's the problem of attaching and forming a neck between two bodies. The impact was proposed in the NASA TV presentation as equivalent to a bump in a car parking lot. But that doesn't explain the neck. Ice can be treated as rock at the very low temperatures at that distance from the Sun and rocks don't fuse together when they collide at low speed. More significantly, why do we only ever see two objects fused together? In later more detailed images, it seems Ultima Thule has significant cratering which implies many high-speed collisions between objects in the Kuiper Belt despite the fact that they should be orbiting the Sun with low relative velocities and an infinitesimal probability of collision. Given their vanishingly small cross section in the unimaginable immensity of Kuiper Belt space, NASA’s story only survives because diagrams, like that shown, give a false impression. But that's not all. Gravitational accretion is a hypothesis, not a fact. Calling rings of material around distant stars 'accretion discs' is merely an assumption. We routinely see stars ejecting matter, yet it is never considered that such discs may be equatorial ejection discs like a mega coronal mass ejection. Such is the mesmerizing power of a paradigm, a story told over and over so the brain goes into neutral. And it is remarkable how the disciplined mind shuts out, to quickly forget discordant data. For example, here is one discovery that shows there is not enough material in nebular disks to make planets, let alone minor planets at vast distances from the star. Only last October, Quanta magazine published an article 'Planets Found to Be Larger Than the Disks They Come From.' It reads, "...a new research paper suggests that planets may be forming in ways beyond our understanding. In system after system planets are much larger than the universe's biggest star-skirts. This seems to defy maths, or at least reason; planets shouldn't be larger than the stuff they're made from." Of course, this defies understanding because the model is wrong. Powerful long-range electromagnetic forces could form all condensed objects in the universe. Gravity has nothing to do with it. Only after the electromagnetic forces have subsided, does gravity, the weakest force in the universe, take over to produce orbital systems. Galaxies are star birth engines and they show the electromagnetic forces in action. That's why Gravitational Theory doesn't work for them. Modified gravity, black holes, and dark matter, are unnecessary fictions once this simple fact is understood. We can stop spending billions chasing imaginary particles and objects in deep space. Plasma cosmologists have known the answer for half a century. But the crabbed spirit of specialism has denied astronomers this understanding. Science as it is practiced today, is dysfunctional. The alignment of spiral galaxies, like Catherine wheels strung along a wire, and their common rate of rotation regardless of size, is all simply explained if the wire happens to be in the form of galactic-scale rotating Birkeland current filament pairs. Birkeland currents are formed by two parallel current filaments which attract each other according to Ampere's law. As they draw closer, the magnetic attraction between them is overcome by electrostatic repulsion caused by charge separation within those filaments. As a result, those filaments circle about each other to form a twisted pair, a configuration well known to electrical engineers. And it is this pairing that tends to concentrate matter in toroids and closely orbiting bodies. The galactic toroid gives rise to the observed peanut cross-section of the central galactic bulge in spiral galaxies. Plasma behavior is scalable over an enormous range; from the galactic down to the laboratory on Earth where this has been tested. So the process that forms stars and galaxies also forms planets and smaller satellites in the same process. That process has been seen by infrared telescopes to produce stars in pairs, like beads on a necklace, along interstellar Birkeland currents inside molecular clouds. At present, smaller bodies like planets can't be detected in molecular clouds by our infrared telescopes. So, what evidence do we have for the formation of planets in pairs? There was a report from the Keck Observatory in January last year titled 'Planets around other stars are like Peas in a Pod.' It reads, "...the team found that exoplanets tend to be the same sizes as their neighbors. If one planet is small, the next planet around that same star is very likely to be small as well, and if one planet is big, the next is likely to be big. They also found the planets orbiting the same star tend to have a regular orbital spacing." So, it is very interesting that the astronomer Tom Van Flandern drew attention to the possibility that Jupiter and Saturn can be considered as twins. Even more so if Saturn ejected a lot of matter recently leaving the evidence behind in that planet's ephemeral rings. Also, Uranus and Neptune make appear with similar masses, compositions and solar distances. "Each pair is notably dissimilar to its adjoining pair or pairs. Now there is no particular reason under the 'primeval solar nebula' hypothesis of planetary formation why this should be so. The nebula from which the planets allegedly condensed should have been rather homogeneous in most respects, and planet masses should have had a smooth radial gradient with solar distance." Sometimes in moments of lucidity, science writers state the obvious. Richard Kerr in the Science journal in 1999, addressed this issue. "The four terrestrial planets nestled closely to the life-giving Sun make an unlikely family. Little, moonlike Mercury is mostly iron, covered with a bit of rock, and has no atmosphere. Venus, Earth's twin in size and composition, is smothered by a most un-Earth-like inferno of an atmosphere and is drier than any desert. On Earth, which is nearly drowning in water, continents drift across a surface infected in every crack and crevice by life. And Mars - 1/10 the mass of Earth -- has an ancient, immobile face, now dry and lifeless but with hints of an earlier, more hospitable era. A single family? More like a bunch of unrelated adoptees from alien planetary systems." The centuries-old nebular accretion model is long overdue for retirement yet every space mission is launched with the benediction that it will show us how the solar system was formed. It can do that but not while reciting the nebular hypothesis as a fact. It has been discredited again and again during the Space Age but all that happens is that computer models are adjusted to provide the virtual reality which passes for science in this unenlightened age. So far, observers have catalogued over 2,000 trans-Neptunian objects. Importantly, those objects are not evenly distributed through space. Once astronomers started discovering them in the early 1990's, one of the early surprises was that they could be grouped according to the shapes and sizes of their orbits. This led scientists to understand that there are several distinct groupings or populations of these objects whose orbits provide clues about their history. The expectation was that if there were objects beyond Neptune, they would be in relatively circular orbits that aren't tilted too much from the plane of the planets. Instead, many KBO’s are found to belong to families, some with significantly elliptical and tilted orbits and associations with the planet Neptune. Pluto's orbit is in a stable repeating pattern with Neptune's. For every three orbits completed by Neptune, Pluto makes two orbits. These features suggest capture episodes rather than leftovers of a primordial nebula. Dr. John Hewitt wrote in his report to the Royal Society 'A habit of lies', "To be of any real value, a new idea must compete with existing suppositions used to explain the same data set. It is diametrically wrong to demand of a new hypothesis that it be consistent with the ideas it sets out to replace." The Electric Universe is a distinctly new hypothesis. It uses forensic evidence from the entire span of man's experience of the sky to replace the old theoretical belief in the orderly nebular hypothesis -- that the planets orbit now roughly where they were formed primordially. This idea is centuries old and formed the basis of the uniformity principle, beloved by mathematicians because they believe they can feed in the movements of the planets today and announce where the planets were thousands or even millions of years ago. This has allowed scientists to propose gradual evolution and climate cycles based on slight wobbles of the Earth. It is merely wishful thinking. The geological record shows otherwise with clear evidence of paroxysms of extreme violence. The solar system has a recent dramatic history which we will only begin to understand when we give up the nebular hypothesis and look for family resemblances instead, because the Sun has a blended family. As Tobias Owen of the University of Hawaii recommended in considering random events in shaping the solar system, "...it behooves planetary scientists to decipher the patterns.., looking for the ties that unite even the most dissimilar siblings into a single family." Only then may we understand Ultima Thule and that knowledge will change everything. 
[Music] Previously, in playing with new thinking, the first episode of this seven arc series, I talked about how the new discoveries of the space age were changing the ways in which we thought about the  cosmos. We're making observations that had been undetectable by our biological senses. They are now confronting us with evidence that doesn't fit with the ways of thinking that have become so familiar that we take them for granted. The night sky isn't dark and empty to electronic sensors, but bright and full. There's no precedence for this in all of human existence. The universe of our senses is radically changed, but it's still human minds who try to make sense of it. Making sense is a creative act and that works best when we don't take it too seriously. In this episode we'll be playing with historical thinking. Knowledge tends to progress incrementally for long periods, as popular theories are developed and adjusted to fit each other and discrepant evidence. But occasionally the inevitable contradictions and ad-hoc additions become a hindrance to further progress. Hatching the popular theories becomes cumbersome and ugly. Entirely fresh foundational ideas become necessary. New metaphysical assumptions that underlie any theory are required. The worldview, the paradigm, changes. For example Ptolemy's geocentric model of planetary movements with perfect circle epicycles, spinning on perfect circle deferents, was geometrical, no orbits, and kinematic, no force. It was good enough for casting horo- scopes, which was the goal at that time. Its practitioners didn't worry about the little inaccuracies relative to the precision of the instruments they used, but they did worry about the linear element, the equant that corrected for the greater inaccuracies. They presumed the heavens of the gods were perfect and therefore operated only with perfect circles. Copernicus's heliocentric model was not that much of a cognitive revolution. He kept the epicycles and deferents. He only discovered that centering them on the Sun eliminated the equant, thus making the system more perfect. He revised the structure of the Ptolemaic model, but not the way of thinking on which it was founded. The  physics changed, but the metaphysics didn't. The cognitive revolution began with Tycho Brahe building more precise measuring instruments. Kepler then realized that Brahe’s more precise locations could be better matched  with ellipses than with perfect circles. But the perfect heaven's world view didn't allow ellipses. At the same time Galileo's telescopic observations confirmed the existence of imperfections, spots on the Sun. Other observations also contributed to doubting the perfection of the heavens. Newton's idea of a central force, gravity, acting on orbiting masses, not only allowed, but required ellipses. The revolution was the replacement of a kinematic and geometric way of thinking with a  dynamic one. At first, people objected that Newton was promoting an occult, spooky action at a distance. But the accuracy of his results eclipsed the uneasiness. Soon gravity displaced circles. The theories changed; the math changed; calculus replaced geometry; many of the assumptions changed; and  the ancient world view changed with them. But one underlying assumption of the perfect heavens of the gods persisted. Alexander Pope wrote, “Nature and nature's laws lay hid in the night. God said, Let Newton be! and all was light!” The underlying attitude of belief in one absolute perfect reality, independent  of cognitive operations, persisted. Perfect circles were replaced with perfect  clockwork. A reified natural law, mistaking an abstraction for a physical entity, became the  new god. Metaphysics never changes 100 percent. It's still human minds with their inertia of prior beliefs, that make the new sense. The progress of instrumentation wouldn't reveal discrepancies between Newtonian theory and evidence for a couple of centuries. Even then, and still to today, the idea of gravity was good enough for the ballistic goals that the invention of cannons and rockets had made more important than the goals of casting horoscopes. But in the 19th century Michelson and Morley's observations of the invariance of the speed of light, along with other difficulties, generated a crisis for Newton's model. Time was independent and absolute in Newton's theory, but more precise observations seemed to indicate that it varied with velocity, especially as velocity approached the speed of light. Fast moving objects seemed both to weigh more and to shrink, and their clocks ticked at different rates. Einstein resolved the difficulties in the next century by returning to geometry. The non-Euclidean geometry of a curved coordinate system made more accurate sense of those new observations. Celestial bodies were no longer propelled along orbits by a distant spooky force, but coasted along geodesics. Yet still in this age of relativity, people still talk about gravity as a force and the speed of light is the new absolute. Now, new instruments observe the heavens in ways that have been inaccessible to our biological senses. Radio waves, infrared, ultraviolet, X- and gamma rays, in-place measurements of bodies in  space and of that space itself, orders of magnitude more precise observations  and data. The resulting evidence reveals notions, forms and compositions that are generating a crisis for the conventional models. The night sky is no longer dark and empty, but bright and full of plasma. And the experimentally discovered behaviors of electrically active plasma make more accurate and direct sense of the evidence than the predictions of the gravity and gas models. For example, both Herbig-Haro stars  and active galaxies exhibit thin, twisting threads of plasma from their poles  that extend many light years into space. Condensations, or blobs, are often scattered along them. They give off synchrotron radiation from electrons spiraling in strong magnetic fields. These are impossible in a purely gravity and gas universe, but are expected in an electricity and plasma one. In the Standard Model, plasma is often called an ionized gas and then the discussion relapses into gravity and gas descriptions. Million degree hot gas, shock waves, jets, gravitationally collapsing clouds, but plasma doesn't behave like a gas and descriptions based on gas theory fail to describe the matter accurately. Any substance at a million degrees is fully ionized and behaves as a plasma, not as a gas. Even cold molecular clouds contain enough  charged dust particles and ions to act like plasma. Concepts of pressure and volume are supplanted by the Bennett pinch and double layers. Those particles and ions have extremely low densities. If they were electrically neutral, as assumed by the Standard Model, they could travel long distances before colliding with another particle. They would be unlikely to generate a shock wave with billiard-ball-like collisions. But they are carrying an extensive electromagnetic field. They constitute plasma and display typical plasma behavior. Filaments, cells, double layers and  the like. Shock waves are the closest thing astronomers can imagine to the electrical effects they deny. If the threads of plasma spiraling out of the poles of stars were jets, subject to gas laws, they would soon dissipate in the vacuum of space. But they remain coherent  for long distances, spiraling around each other like, well, like Birkeland currents. Gravitational collapse in the Standard Model itself is actually very difficult, if not impossible to achieve. Any rotational motion in the original cloud will be amplified as the cloud collapses, like spinning ice skaters drawing in their arms. The centrifugal force will soon reach equilibrium with the gravitational force and the collapse will stop. Plasma, on the other hand, requires collapse: Bennett pinch and spin, the response of moving charged particles in a magnetic field and those forces can be much stronger than gravity. They can also repel, not just attract, as with gravity, as seen in the long-range attraction and short-range repulsion that keeps Birkeland filaments twisting around each other without merging. To explain, or to explain away the new evidence, the gravity and gas theories have been patched with hypothetical, unobservable and untestable phantoms- collapsed matter, dark matter, dark energy- the phantoms must be there to save the theories from falsification and the need to change deep-seated habits of thinking. Theorists overlook that they have inverted empirical methods, assumed that their theories are the touchstone of truth, and are judging the acceptability of evidence by its conformity with their prior  beliefs. But as the patches proliferate, the stitches have begun to obscure the theories and to weaken the underlying metaphysics and empirical methods. The Standard Model of the gravity-and-gas paradigm, no longer provides a straightforward explanatory structure, but has become a nuisance. Gravity and gas don't allow for electricity in space. Plasma requires it. That's the fundamental distinction between the Standard Model and the EU Model. From a historical point of view, it's time for another conceptual revolution. [Music] [Music] 
[Music] In 2012, I began an online video series with The Thunderbolts Project called Space News from the Electric Universe. The purpose of this series was to explore the role of electromagnetism and plasma at all scales in the cosmos. It was my opinion that the most interesting and effective way to present this material would be to do so in the context of discussion of space discoveries. Beginning in the late 1990s through my father David Talbott's relationship with physicist Wal Thornhill, I was in the privileged position of having direct access to the chief proponent of the Electric Universe. Now, when one looks at space discovery through the lens of EU theory, it cannot help but transform one's perspective on the nature of the universe. One thing I learned quickly is that, generally speaking, celestial objects simply can't form the way that gravitational theory proposes. The hypothesized collisions, explosions, and slow gravitational accretion processes simply do not match what we observe, nor do these processes work experimentally. As any astronomer knows, over decades  of planetary formation simulations, gravitational accretion only achieves an object the size of a pebble before it breaks down. Ironically, mysterious magnetism has more recently been added to accretion experiments in an ad hoc effort to make them actually work. Of course, star formation is an equally mysterious process for mainstream astronomy. In his recent Thunderbolts presentation on the James Webb telescope, Wal Thornhill has offered a definitive treatise on the creation of stars in an Electric Universe. Thornhill has contrasted the predictive success of the standard hypothesis of stars where they formed by gravitational collapse and accretion, versus the Electric Universe and plasma cosmology view of stars where they formed by the electromagnetic Z-pinch. Over the last decade, I've done my best to articulate this viewpoint when reporting on the relevant scientific discoveries. For a moment now, I'd like to again don the hat that I wore at the helm of Space News and present a recent scientific finding In light of the Electric Universe theory. Earlier this year, scientists using data from a number of space telescopes, studied over 300 so-called protostars in a star-forming region called the Orion complex. What these scientists found is that so-called gravitational cavities do not play their expected role in quenching the growth of a star. Conventional theory had proposed  a type of so-called stellar feedback where the combined force of astrophysical jets and stellar winds pull gas from a star and trap it in its molecular cloud, thus eventually halting a star's growth. However, as is so often the case, what the  scientists actually found sent them back to the drawing board. Astronomer Nolan Habel of the University of Toledo says in a science alert report quote “In one stellar formation model, if you start out with a small cavity, as the  proto-star rapidly becomes more evolved, its outflow creates an ever-larger cavity until the surrounding gas is eventually blown away, leaving an isolated star... Our observations indicate there is no progressive growth that we can find, so the cavities are not growing until they push out all of the mass in the cloud. So, there must be some other process going on that gets rid of the gas that doesn't end up in the star.” However, the problem for astronomers is truly fundamental. How can one hope to resolve the mystery of how star formation is quenched if one doesn't understand the formation process itself? Theorists’ reliance on convoluted, inefficient and unproven processes, should be the first signal to us that something is wrong with their gravity-only approach. Now, our suggestion that astronomers don't understand such an important cosmological process as star formation, might seem outlandish to some. But again, we have to consider the evidence. In fact, through the entire space age, scientific discovery has completely confounded conventional theories about stars,from a star's birth until the end of its life in a supernova. I've often cited the quote of economist Milton Friedman which states, ”The only relevant test of the validity of a hypothesis is comparison of prediction with experience.” Gravitational theory did not predict the landmark discoveries in stellar science. In contrast, technological leaps have provided increasingly stunning confirmation of the predictions of plasma cosmology and the Electric  Universe. Again, in standard theory gravitational collapse and accretion lead to the creation of both stars and planets over many eons of time. However, both the Electric Universe  and plasma cosmology propose that the electromagnetic phenomenon called the Z-pinch, also known as the Bennett pinch, is the powerful organizational force governing the rapid formation of  stars. We have to remember that the gravitational accretion model never expected polar jets. They had to be accommodated with a cover story involving the usual suspect, which is magically generated magnetic fields, when scientists discovered them coming from some bright stars. Now,  the scientific paper cited in the aforementioned Science Alert report states, “The mechanism for creating these cavities, whether by jet precession, wide- angled winds or jet entrainment is still debated.” But what's really observed is hourglass shaped cavities centered on the protostar. This is precisely the same pattern that we see in planetary nebulae, where the star's vast electric circuit is clearly lit up. So, to say that the cavity is lit up by quote “scattered light from the star” is merely a convenient assumption and its constant size is easy to understand, since the circuit is unrelated to the developmental stage of a  protostar. And the authors of the paper admit. quote, “... several evolved protostars with relatively small cavity sizes are identified.” In fact, the aforementioned Nolan Habel states in the scientific paper, ”An HST Survey of Protostellar Outflow Cavities: Does Feedback Clear Envelopes?” states, ”Understanding the factors that govern the evolution of the envelopes - and thereby influence mass accretion  and the properties of nascent discs - is a problem in star and planet formation studies. Now many decades ago, it was the father of plasma cosmology, Hannes Alfven, who made the outrageous prediction that stars would form by cosmic Z-pinches along vast networks of filaments, with an electromagnetic scavenging effect in molecular clouds in each current filament. Alfven wrote of Willard Harrison Bennett's discovery of the Z-pinch in the first half of the 20th century, quote, ”Important fields of research, i.e., the treatment of the state in interstellar regions, including the formation of stars, are still based on a neglect of Bennett's discovery more than half a century ago... present-day students in astrophysics hear nothing about it.” A great opportunity to test these opposing theories is found in these remarkable images of a stellar nursery in the aptly named “Snake Nebula”. Here we see a number of stars forming along the filament and the stars themselves break up along a cylinder. This is not expected at all by gravitational theory, which predicts that a center of mass exists toward which all of the surrounding material in the cloud tends to move, and to congregate to eventually form a star. What's more, just as a fatal deficit of matter has been observed in the discs about stars, required to form a typical number of planets, scientists studying the Snake Nebula found that the material needed to be drawn in to form massive stars, is far less than gravitational models predict. In 2014, the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics issued a press release which stated, “Previous theories proposed that high-mass stars form within very massive isolated ‘cores’ weighing at least 100 times the mass of the Sun. These new results show that that is not the  case. The data also demonstrate that massive stars aren't born alone but in groups... The team also was surprised to find that these two nebular patches had fragmented into individual star seeds so early in the star formation process. They detected  bipolar outflows and other signs of active, ongoing star formation.” The dramatic absence of the required material to form stars is not surprising if such objects are formed by the electromagnetic Z-pinch As Alfven noted, the electromagnetic force is exponentially greater than gravity and is scalable up to the cosmic magnitude. Dramatic confirmation of the star- forming electric currents came more than a decade ago when the Herschel space observatory imaged an ”incredible network of filamentary structures seen in the constellation of the Southern Cross. A 2009 ESA report stated, “That a dark cool area such as this would be bustling with activity, was unexpected. But the images reveal a surprising amount of turmoil: the interstellar material is condensing into continuous and interconnected filaments glowing from the light emitted by new-born stars at various stages of development.” The conventional explanation for these filaments was the dissipation of some quote, “large-scale turbulence involving exploding stars.” However, such explosions would be expected to impose some radial curvature on the filaments which we simply do not see. And the claim that the filaments are quote ”glowing from the light emitted by newborn stars” simply cannot be tenable, because the filaments glow steadily along their length, demonstrating that the light is intrinsic to the filaments, which is exactly what one expects if the light output is provided by electric current. Moreover, in 2011 even finer images from Herschel provided the conclusive evidence that cosmic scale electric currents flow along the filaments. An ESA report at the time states, ”The filaments are huge, stretching for tens of light years through space and Herschel has shown that newly-born stars are often found in the densest parts of them... Such filaments and interstellar clouds have been glimpsed before by other infrared satellites... but they have never been seen clearly enough to have their widths measured. Now, Herschel has shown that, regardless of the length or density of a filament, the width is always roughly the same.” The lead author of a paper on the discovery stated, “This is a very big surprise...” And the ESA report concludes, this consistency of the widths demands an explanation.” Any attempt to explain the filament's constant width by explosions is also untenable. Explosions will cause the filaments to vary markedly in brightness and width depending on the density of the interstellar dust and the perspective from which they are viewed. Several years ago, Thornhill wrote of this  groundbreaking discovery, quote “The constant width over vast distances is due to the current flowing along the Birkeland filaments, each filament constituting a part of a larger electric circuit. And in a circuit the current must be the same in the whole filament although the current density can vary in the filament due to the electromagnetic pinch effect.” The evidence I’ve just cited is as easy to understand as it is compelling. It's consistent with the universe governed by efficient mechanisms that are easily replicated in laboratories on Earth. From my perspective as a curious layperson, the overwhelming predictive success of any scientific hypothesis demands urgent consideration from institutionalized science. And yet, a fair and thorough scientific hearing on the Electric Universe  or plasma cosmology, has yet to occur. Alfven’s statement that students of astrophysics are unfamiliar with even basic concepts of electric currents in space is as true today as it was decades ago. It is important to remember that scientists are human beings, and although the scientific method is devoid of bias, humans are not. Science  is not a static collection of pronouncements from authorities or quasi- authorities. Nor is it a set of unassailable dogmas established by a show of hands. Science  is an ongoing and never-ending endeavor, and by its intrinsic nature, makes accurate the prediction that inevitably, the truth will out. [Music] 
welcome to space news from the electric universe brought to you by the thunderbolts project at under bolts dot info in his recent space news interviews comparative mythologist EV cochran introduced his extraordinary decades-long research into ancient testimony of catastrophic celestial events witnessed on earth as cochrane explained in countless ancient cultures the identities of familiar planets and myth including Mars and Venus cannot be explained in terms of anything seen in our world today the planet Mars a distant pinpoint of light to the unaided eye today was globally identified as a warrior hero the planet Venus a bright pinpoint of light to modern sky watchers was identified in various phases as a great comet a goddess with flowing hair a feathered serpent and more in this conclusion Cochrane begins by explaining the painstaking methodology he and colleague David Talbott developed over their decades-long collaboration which ultimately produced their reconstruction of recent planetary catastrophes witnessed on earth I often compared the researcher David myself to that of James Watson and Francis Crick and reconstructing the precise helical structure of DNA initially we were presented with just a giant jigsaw puzzle as it were with with very few clues as to where the respective planets belong in addition to the complex nature of the puzzle itself this was an ever evolving planetary configuration in which the planets change places and appearances over time so consider for example the eye of heaven most scholars prior to us just simply identified the eye with the Sun and never thought twice about it Dave and I very early on discovered a link with the planet Venus for example ancient traditions around the globe identified Venus as a tie the same is true in certain ancient languages like Maya and yet at the same time we found that the planet Mars was specifically identified as the pupil in the eye and so as Dave and I thought about this situation we quickly arrived at the idea that Mars must have stood in front of Venus whereas the smaller body it would appear as a dark dot or pupil inside the Venusian eye now of course in today's sky Mars can't appear in front of Venus since it's an outer planet but Mars is significantly smaller than Venus so if it could stand in front of us it would present this image that we had reconstructed of what the AI must have looked like so this finding this let's say hypothetical finding early on it generated a host of other deductions Mars must have formed the axle of the Venusian wheel Mars was the child at Venus's breast as depicted in numerous artworks of anna and isis we could supply hundreds and hundreds of other examples in none of those examples however would the myth hold if Mars was behind Venus like it is in today's sky because of course you couldn't see it you just see Venus so it has to be in front of Venus so that's just one case of countless dozens we're slowly but surely we pieced together the evidence and arrived at the conclusion that during this particular phase in the evolution of the polar configuration Mars must have been in front of Venus and thus closer to the earth than the other planets looking back on on our long relationship I'm I'm firmly convinced that whatever success we achieved and I'm confident that our success is substantial and will stand the test of time it required endless hours of research detailed analysis theoretical reasoning followed by years of trying to model and visualize this polar configuration and it would have been difficult for either of us to find success without the input and insights and encouragement of the other on this series we have outlined the growing scientific evidence that the catastrophic event is proposed by Cochran and his colleagues did indeed happen this includes the experimental analogs achieved by electrical discharge in the laboratory for countless planetary features and of course one of the greatest crises in space science today is the astounding failures of the standard theories of planet and star formation as scientists discover increasing numbers of quote impossible exoplanetary systems the question of our own solar system's origins in history grows increasingly muddled we asked f how he might address scientists who have an unwavering faith in our solar systems four and a half billion year history well first and foremost astronomers must give up their collective fixation on the idea that planets have moved peacefully on their current orbits since the solar system was formed billions of years ago that dogmas long since become a fundamental impediment to an accurate understanding of the solar system's recent history secondly I would refer astronomers to Tony peratt's groundbreaking researchers into the celestial origins of the primary patterns of prehistoric rock art as Tony documented in great detail using his vast knowledge of plasma under experimental conditions the forms found in ancient rock art are virtually identical certain forms generated in high-energy discharge experiments so for example the ladder to heaven squatter man the Queen cooks you could cite again dozens and dozens of different structural forms or quote symbols in the final analysis Tony's findings demonstrate that incredibly powerful electrical magnetic forces formerly played a significant role in the history of Earth role in the solar system and this is well within the last 10,000 years and it's undeniable that such events were catastrophic in nature and provided much of the inspiring imagery encoded in ancient myth and religion and yet those electromagnetic plasma forces are nowhere seen in today's sky except in the relatively diminutive rural images you know that we occasionally get that most people on earth don't even see just within our lifetime the astronomers opinions of Mars and Venus have been forced to change just because of the findings that have been coming in from these various space probes so when Dave and I originally were talking about massive volumes of rock falling down for Mars and and hitting the earth the astronomers were unanimous in their decision or in their idea that meteorites or large rocks could never get off the surface of Mars and yet now we know that dozens of Martian meteorites have indeed made their way to the earth and similarly in in our theory where Mars is growth is located during the polar configuration relatively close to the earth it stands to reason that it had a more temperate environment during that time possibly had a massive atmosphere possibly had plenty of water this naturally leads to the conclusion that it could have had various life forms and yet none of those things makes any sense whatsoever if Mars has always orbited countless millions of miles away from the Sun where it's freezing and water would never form and never flow and it would be difficult to have an environment like that an atmosphere and so we believe that the water and the atmosphere and if there were previous life forms those were all extinguished within the last 10,000 years Mars lost its atmosphere it lost its water if it indeed had it it obviously lost a ton of its surface geology is Walland Dave of documented detail and so what is true for Mars is also true for the planet Venus to some extent Venus was a participant in these unbelievably spectacular exchanges of electromagnetic forces and so you would certainly expect to see scarring on the Venusian planet just like you see a ton of evidence of scarring on Mars in our view that didn't happen countless millions of years ago at the dawn of the solar system's history it happened well within human memory so we fully expect that when an if were ever ever able to reliably date some of these geological events it will it will stun the astronomers of how recent this these events were [Music] 
Is General Relativity: A Case Study in Numerology? Now, I mean that both facetiously and literally. Because I'm going to show you today, using mathematics and numbers, that general relativity and all it's associated things, such as black holes and big bangs, are really nothing other than some kind of numerology. But that's exactly what the black hole event horizon has. In fact, they tell us that the black hole event horizon - the escape velocity, or the escape speed, of a black hole at the event horizon - is the speed of light. That's why nothing can escape. Really? If the light is traveling at the speed of light, and that's the escape speed of light, wouldn't you expect light to escape? I would! I'm social scientist and I'm here at this conference as a sociologist of science, and as a sociologist in general, I'm interested in social groups, and collectivities and communities. As a sociologist of science, I'm interested in scientific communities, and so, I'm interested in you. Now, I suggested this was a change of subject matter for me and that's true, but it's also misleading because sociology, as I've said, social groups of communities of collaboration of collectively held knowledge, of shared values of the way in which communities mobilize to maintain and defend their boundaries of the social determination of what is acceptable, and what's unacceptable. And so these are topics common to pretty much any sociology, including the sociology of science. Something happens very similar to this party example, to the chemical elements on the Sun, and a certain group of elements are much more likely to be found outside the Sun than on the surface of the Sun. For example, on the Photosphere, we see about 35 magnesium atoms for every million hydrogen atoms, but in the solar wind leaving the Sun there are four times that many magnesium atoms. Another example, we see about 47 iron atoms for every million hydrogen atoms on the photosphere, but a solar flare might have a hundred times that much iron. So, you come and you take a look at a satellite image of a hurricane on Earth. And you guys can do this. Just pop on Google, and type in 'hurricane'. You're going to see the eye, just like the umbra on the sunspot. You're going to see the swirling clouds that we've all come to know in a hurricane, just like you would see in the corona on the Sun. But, if you get to look at one of the new Rapid Scan images that GOES is taking of the weather, or you take a look at some of the hurricane or typhoon images on NOAA's Environmental Visualization Lab, you will see that amidst those swirling clouds you can see lines. That's about one quarter of the story, and it's seems strange that they stop there. Stig Lundqvist who did this model before me for about 50 years before I got there, he'd stop there. Even good old Hannes Alfvén, where you ask him to draw a picture of a Birkeland current, he'd draw you something that looks like that. That's a very incomplete picture because you can just think of being continuing on. Go out to the next little distance out from the center of this ... what do you think happens, nothing?! The lure of what we think we know, the comfort of the accepted wisdom versus the fear of not knowing. We have to recognize that this love of certainty is a very, very innate and undeniable human attribute. It would be disingenuous, if not foolhardy, to propose that there's some group of humans somewhere, somehow that are somehow immune to, or above this level of certainty - it's an integral component of our collective psyche. They have now shown that the neutrino has mass. Now, the very idea that it didn't have mass meant that it couldn't have been a real particle, anyway, because there is no such thing as a particle with no mass. The problem then was, that according to the Standard Model of subatomic particles, the neutrino doesn't interact with the 'Higgs field', as it's called. That meant that there was something seriously wrong with the standard model. So, what has happened? They've said, this gives us the opportunity to modify the standard model, in other words, please send more money. It's all moving, right? Nothing ever stops moving. A gust of wind and a cosmic jet are manifesting a single power - that's the world we were given. The objection to perpetual motion machines is one of those absurd capitalists parsimonies; it is no free lunch. It comes from a mindset, a metaphysics that privileges neutrality, stability, equilibrium. But what the world gives us as facts, are polarization, unstable equilibria, and explosions. This world is in perpetual motion. But, of course, you don't always have to stay in that position, you become a tenured professor at some point, and you can push out and innovative. And, if that were not the case, there would be no new science. So, somehow it does happen that new science does get developed. People that are radicals in their field are able to do something about their radicalness - they are able to take bold steps. There's not just rigor in the choice of statistic. Not just rigor in the kinds of  designs that we use. It's not just rigor even in the language of how we write about interpretations and alternative explanations, and limitations of experimental design, in formal scientific papers that we write. We are told to stick closely to the data and not let our emotions, or even our humor, get in the way. And that, I think, is the single biggest problem in physics today is that we worship the discipline of mathematics as science, and it's not. It's an important adjunct and a tool. It's a kind of shorthand describing what we observe, and then you can manipulate the symbols to try and get more information from that data. But it's rather like handing over the control of a company to the typing pool, the shorthand readers. Very few people can read shorthand, and very few people can read all of those mathematical runes on the blackboards. In fact, it's become a cliché for 'genius'. So, we accept it's breakthrough one crack in the door at a time. It is working, if you actually follow what's going on as our communication with real scientists, feet on the ground researchers. You'll see that, give us a hearing personally, give us an opportunity to just engage you on the basis of fact, and implications of fact, the EU material is very persuasive with people. 
welcome to space news from the electric universe brought to you by the thunderbolts project at Thunderbolts dot info for many decades few scientists have challenged the mainstream theoretical model of the Sun most in the general public today probably believe that astronomers have a good understanding of the Sun and no reason exists to question the solar model we learned about in school but in truth countless seemingly unresolvable mysteries of the Sun continue to haunt scientists today is the electric universe the key to a new and better understanding of the Sun here is Cameron Mercer with the Thunderbolts picture of the day managing editor Stephen Smith as they provide a brief introduction to the electric Sun Theory over several hundred years astronomers studying the Sun have amassed a laundry list of anomalies but these apparent contradictions arise only if the solar system is electrically inert take into account the sun's electrified environment and its connection to galactic currents and the anomalies disappear well the general premise is probably thousands of years old that we could be living in a dynamic solar system where electricity plays an important role but it's only been in say the last hundred years that scientists have given serious credence to the possibility and since electric universe theory assumes that celestial bodies interact through conductive plasma and are connected in circuits the Sun is also assumed by electric universe theorists to be electrically connected with the galaxy as well as earth so the Sun can be thought of as an electrically charged object seeking equilibrium with its environment and the charge is flowing into and out of the Sun increase and decrease to the point where it releases plasma discharges called solar flares or coronal mass ejections and sometimes it doesn't display any sunspots or any major coronal activity at all and after all the sun's electric field extends for billions of kilometers in fluency the planets and their motions as well as how they interact with each other now if the environment of the Sun is electrified then we would expect tangible effects on all other charged bodies sharing the same environment this effect is testable we suggest that this effect can explain many anomalous behaviors of the solar wind including behavior so outrageous it defies kinetic explanations entirely yeah on January 20th 2005 a coronal mass ejection achieved velocities greater than anything any astronomer had ever seen it often will take 24 hours or more for charged particles from a solar explosion to reach earth but this one arrived in under 30 minutes after the explosion so energies to propel a proton storm 96 million miles to earth in just under a half an hour is pretty unbelievable that's an incredible amount of energy back in the day when NASA scientists were talking about this one of the quotes was for reasons no one understands these fields exploded and leashing as much energy as 10 billion hydrogen bombs so one wonders what drives the Sun to throw off billions of tons of solar material and accelerate it to thousands of kilometers per second the sun's heat and radiation pressure can't explain how charged particles accelerate out past the planets no one expected acceleration prior to the discovery of the solar wind and in the electric universe the obvious explanation is that there are electric fields in space and since particles continue to accelerate out into the solar system since they don't have little onboard rockets on these particles then something must be drawing them onward and the only thing that can accelerate charged particles is an electric field since these charges flow through the solar system then it seems reasonable to conclude that the dark mode solar plasma or the so our wind is affected by the electro dynamic fields of the Sun and by the fields of the planetary family solar flares the corona of the Sun and all the other solar phenomena result from changes in electrical input to the Sun the Sun trans acts with all the family of planets in the solar system and it probably is transacting with the interstellar medium as well since it's powered externally and not internally it must reach an equilibrium with the electrical environment to the galaxy for continuous updates on space news from the electric universe stay tuned to Thunderbolts dot info 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info What does the future hold for the space sciences? interest in space exploration was remarkably high among the general public, as humanity's attention was held rapt by the race to the moon. However, in the 21st century, the public face of space science is less the astronaut than the physicist and astrophysicist. When young people wish to learn of space science, they learn of big bang, gravity-centric cosmology. They hear of the respective works of Newton and Einstein and they must try to make sense of concepts such as warped space-time, infinities and singularities. They're told of a universe that is 96 percent dark, comprised of matter and energy that are unproven, invisible and “poorly understood”. To find that a scientific foundation exists for any different way of seeing the universe, the young and the curious have little choice but to seek outside the confines of institutionalized science, and beyond the narratives its celebrity spokespersons promote in popular media. On such a journey, one has a chance  to discover that an astounding scientific foundation exists for another cosmology, a cosmology which recognizes it is not gravity that governs the universe, but rather electromagnetism. The forefathers of this cosmology are not named Newton and Einstein. They are the giants of electrical and plasma science, the renowned experimentalist Kristian Birkeland and the Nobel prize winners Irving Langmuir and Hannes Alfvén. A universe filled with electrically conducting plasma is not 96 percent  dark. It is alight with electric currents, and the physical mechanisms that  spark the phenomena we see, are both understandable and easily replicable in laboratories on Earth. Recently, we spoke with a member of the Electric Universe community who has made it his mission to introduce the young and the curious to the ideas of the Electric Universe. His  name is Benjamin Hyde and he is a science presenter on the news station, Fox 13 out of Salt Lake city, Utah. We asked Ben to introduce himself and to describe his efforts to spark inspiration and interest in the sciences among today's youth. This is Benjamin Hyde and I have been studying physics, specifically quantum physics, for the better part of two and a half decades. It's been a passion of mine, it's something that I love and I really enjoy and now, two and a half decades later, I realize that the reason why I was so fascinated with it, is because I like understanding the fundamentals of things. Reality and quantum physics from my old understanding was that where that explanation was going to come from, you know. I wanted to know what everything was made of and so I studied it and I did what everybody in this field did. I just took what was given to me and accepted it, and because I didn't have  anything different at the time, I just  said OK, this is what it is. And it didn't really dawn on me that it didn't make sense, and  if it didn't, I'm just like, well I'll just roll with it. I remember  specifically a few years ago, when dark matter and dark energy really hit the stage, and I learned that 96.5 percent, or whatever  it is, of the known universe was either dark matter and dark  energy. And I thought wow, that is a profound amount of stuff in the universe that we don't know anything about. So I justified it in my mind that, basically anything was possible, because most of what we knew we didn't know. So, as I'm studying quantum physics, particle physics, cosmology, I of course ran across videos from the Electric Universe. Because I would go to YouTube and I would watch, you know Brian Greene, the World Science Festival videos; loved those for a while. And of course the Electric Universe videos would pop up every once in a while. And I'm like, great  I'll watch those too, and I did. But, what happened, and this is funny, every time I would study physics,     I would get to a burnout mode. You know, I would study it for a few weeks and I would just get so frustrated, I just would lose interest in it. And now, looking back on it, I realize that was because I was studying  nonsense. And I was trying to bang this garbage stuff into my head; and there was a part of my head that was just saying, you know Ben, this isn't real you know, this is a mistake. So, after one of these up and down times with quantum physics, I went into the Electric Universe and became enthralled. You know, I learned who David Talbott was, I learned who Wal Thornhill was, and I learned what they had to say and it was just captivating. And, as we all know, I mean all of us who are in this, understand this feeling of like, oh finally all the stuff we've been studying our whole lives, now finally makes sense. And I've never stopped, and what was interesting is, that I never went back into that up and down pattern of studying it and then not studying it, studying it. I've just been constantly studying Electric Universe stuff because, you know, we don't know everything. And there's still questions clearly, but it feels like we're on the right path. For a person with a previous focus in mainstream physics and cosmology, we asked Ben what might have caused his shift in interest toward the Electric Universe: I think what it was, is that I got to the point with particle physics and quantum physics, where it was just so absurd that I couldn't help but drop it. But you know, drop particle physics, I mean the whole idea that a thing can be both a wave and a particle, is just so colossally absurd that it begs to be dropped. The fact that the Electric Universe, I think the first thing that really got me into it, is the  fact that they were talking about that everything in the universe is basically moved and affected by charge differential. I mean,  I played with a battery. I've rubbed my feet across the carpet. I can create a charge differential. You can see it and the lightning discharge between my fingertip and a wall socket, when I rub my feet across the floor, is just a scaled-down version of lightning, what I see in the sky. And then, when the Electric Universe talked about scaling, I'm like, scaling  yes, I understand scaling. Because one of the things I found out that was just absolutely absurd. Another one of the absurdities in the current model, is that quantum physics wasn't scalable. I was like, wait a minute guys, if there are fundamental principles of the universe,  they would by definition have to be scalable. But quantum physics, by its own definition, says that our rules, the quantum physics rules, only work up to the scale of maybe a molecule and everything smaller than that. And above that, they don't work. That's just silly in every sense. I mean it just defies common sense. And I have to tell you that, this is getting a little personal, but at the time I was going through a  faith crisis, a faith transition, and I just learned that everything I had been taught you know, religiously up until that point in my life was also, it was just a story. And all of a sudden, when I allowed myself to think that, everything in my life suddenly made sense. All the ideas and questions I had  that religion was supposed to answer, but didn't answer, I realized I had just been making justifications for. And so, when I lost the ability to justify what I had been told, that skill leaked out into science and all of a sudden I saw the same things with quantum physics and with science in general, that I had been just assuming and justifying and rationalizing what these teachers of science have told me my whole life. And so, it was easy in that respect, to go into the Electric Universe because they had very simple concepts that were easily identifiable. Stuff that you could do at home in a very simple sense, which is what I've done, to show the principles. See, I could never show quantum principles here at my house, or to the kids that I teach. You could never do that. I mean the closest it came was pointing a laser at a double slit and saying, ‘’look you can see refraction patterns,” but you know even then you're not demonstrating that light is both a particle and a wave. You're just telling people that that's what's happening. And that's as close as I could ever come to demonstrating the principles of quantum physics. And I'm thinking, if there's actual real fundamental laws of the universe, they should be demonstrable and they should be scalable. And that was one of the first things that Wal Thornhill talked about, you know and mentioned I think, that Hannes Alfvén said that the effects of the plasma cosmology were scalable to like you know 10 to the 19th or 10 to the 16th. I'm like, great, perfect, that envelops the macroscopic world that I can interact with, and the cosmological world. Perfect, let's go. After beginning his research into the concepts behind the Electric Universe, Ben began performing his own experiments on Electric Universe Geology, that is, reproducing the familiar features of planets and moons through electrical discharge to a solid surface. We asked Ben if he could identify the catalyst for his own experimental research. Of course, it was Valles Marineris and you know Wal and David talking about how that there are scalloped craters and that electrical discharges could do this. I'm like,, you know, I was just fascinated because it was so brilliant to see Valles Marineris and realize how big it was and the thought that electricity could do that, was just captivating. So, I'm of course looking for how to do this. It was really funny, I was so blind by this, it's amazing because I had in my possession a transformer that took, you know 120 volts and bumped it up to 12,000 volts. And I've had that for years, but it never dawned on me that I could play with it, until I  told one of my co-workers about the Electric Universe and he said, you know what Ben, I've got a transformer at my house that I use to create Lichtenberg patterns in wood. I'm like, yes, yes, yes, yes, that's  what I'm talking about. He said I'll give it to you and so I'm like great I'll take it. But I didn't even realize that I already had one in my possession. I'd been using it to create a Jacob's ladder for my science experiments for the kids that I do with spark science. And so I ran out and dismantled the probes or the two electrodes from my Jacob's ladder and just put them on the dust plate, like, what you say, the little metal plate and then I just created an electrode out of a screwdriver. And bam, I started throwing different powders on there, different dust and just creating you know, the butterfly effects that we see, the lightning scars, everything. Everything that the Electric Universe Geology folks deal with. And it was just fun and so I've just been out there for the last month, throwing  different powders on there. As a side note, I'm actually  a licensed pyrotechnician which means that I build fireworks  as well. So, I've got a whole arsenal of different compounds and I'm really curious to see how they all react to an electric field. And  so, I've been putting each one of these in the different fields, and I found that boric acid works and [that it] creates some really interesting effects. Baking soda creates really interesting  effects, and charcoal creates really interesting effects and  I have not gone through and tested all of my powders yet. But I’m in the middle of that. That's what I do and then I post a lot of this stuff to Facebook Live and to my Spark Science channel. And it's so fun and anybody can do it. Like many other members of the Electric Universe Geology community, Ben himself resides in the American Southwest. We asked Ben if his locale provides unique opportunities for exploring electrical geology concepts. Yes,  oh absolutely. It literally feels like I'm at ground zero for the  supposed electric discharge phenomena that happened between the  earth and Mars, as we understand it. Now I realize that the earth has a couple different places on it that have, you know, just striking features, but Utah is one of them. Now I live in Utah Valley and the Wasatch mountain range is to my east. I mean I'm literally five minutes from it; I can walk to the mountains. Well there is a canyon just like 10 miles away, that was featured in Andy Hall's episodes and he's taken pictures of it, and  he talked about it and I've always noticed it. it’s just startling, because you have the mountain range that's basically smooth. And then all of a sudden there's this horrible jagged crack, right there, and then the mountains get smooth again. and I've gotten out, I've taken pictures of it. I've actually hiked up this canyon. My father-in-law lives right at the base of it right, at the  mouth of that canyon and we've just explored it. And then seeing that Andy Hall thought it was significant as well, I finally went up there and climbed up there and have taken pictures. And I told you this before, but the rock cliffs up there, there's one of them that has a hairpin turn in it. Now, regardless of whether that was electrically made or or lava made or whatever, it was something catastrophic and well worth investigating. When I learned about these different features, I started looking at Google Earth in my local neighborhood, and everything that everybody talks about, you know these wind-driven triangular buttresses, I can see in my own backyard. It's amazing, I mean just  right here in Utah county. You know how Andy Hall describes triangular buttresses and supersonic winds, is right here. I mean I don't even have to go to Google Earth; I just could literally walk outside. So, I've been pulling out my astronomy binoculars, looking at the mountains. We just got back from a family vacation down in southern Utah. We were 30 miles away from Canyonlands and a lot of the features that Andy Hall has talked about. And so, this is what I did, and this is what I'm doing right now. In fact, I'm glad that I have this platform to talk, because I want people to send me rocks and soil samples from wherever they live. Because I want to put them under my arc and see what they do. Because I just brought two samples back of rock that looked very volcanic, rock from southern Utah and soil samples. And as soon as I'm done here talking to you, I'm going out and I'm putting them under the arc to see what they do. And of course I'll film it and share it with everybody. I'm going to show you here what the arc does with baking soda. And you can see right here, that as I turn on the arc, this butterfly pattern just erupts. I mean you can see that as it comes down to a point, it creates a chevron here and the moment that I turn it on, you'll see the poof of dust going around it, which tells us that there are particles of the baking soda that are ionized. Not all of them, but enough of them are, to where they're immediately expelled from the region. And if I do this just right, and if i position the electrode in just the right area, you will see that the arc will form. It'll strike the powder and create a little nodule, I guess is what I call it. But as the arc dissipates, or if I make the arc, if I bring it further away from the dust plate and just go back to the electric field effects, you'll see that that little nodule remains. It stays in place and you can touch it, and of course you can smash it with your finger, it doesn't take much, but what's interesting is that it's like that instant petrification that we hear about, that Peter Jupp  talked about. It literally looks like something like that is happening: it forms a little column, a little bead, that holds itself in place, even though all the dust around it, as you can see, is flying away, is being excavated. Now this one is barium, (not barium, I'm sorry, barium  also makes green in fireworks), this is boric acid and as you can see, if we apply the arc to it, boric acid also burns green. But as you'll notice, it also can create these beautiful butterfly effects and these are the  same ones that we see in different places all over the planet. Andy Hall has pointed them out: very, very stark examples of them in southern Utah. People in the group have talked about the ones in Russia, but they're everywhere and you can create them in the lab right here. The last one I have is just charcoal which, of course, is just burned wood. It's carbon and as you can see, as I turn it on to strike the arc, you get a  big cloud of dust of just excavating the dust and then  as we let the arc continue, it will form that familiar chevron shape or butterfly. It just depends on how long you leave the arc. If you  leave it on for a few minutes, you'll get the full butterfly wings, as you can see. If you leave it on for just a couple seconds you'll get the formation of the chevron, which you can see. So I'm not done; those are just the three most interesting ones that I've found. And I'm going to do more; I'm going to use just regular dirt. I've got clay I'm going to use and try and create that effect that Wal Thornhill and Dr. Ransom created, but that's still up and coming. I don't have that done yet. Given the significant differences between the Electric Universe and standard cosmology, we asked Ben for his thoughts on the best approach to introducing the subject to newcomers. Well, there's two things that strike me. The last time I was in public talking about this, I said the following. I said science is all about learning and progress and if anyone ever tells you that we have decided, and we've finally landed on it, you know that that's not science. And everyone you know, they know that. And so, I start off my conversation with them and I tell them that, and then I say, our old knowledge is that comets were icy snowballs, but we have since sent out probes that have landed on comets, and we've seen, they've taken pictures, and we've seen that they're not icy snowballs, and here's those pictures. So, the icy snowball was the old thinking, you know from Fred Whipple in the 1950’s and the new knowledge that we're gaining is this. That's palpable, that's a spoonful of sugar right there. You know that's not saying that all science is wrong  and scientists are stupid and they're egotistic maniacs that are just chasing the dollar. I was able to explain it like that and the people responded very well. It was palpable to them and that was the adults. Now the kids are actually a lot easier, because kids especially at the age that I deal with mostly, you know, right around 10 years old, they are naturally curious. They have big questions and I know this, because I have eight kids myself and I've got five of them in that range right now; they ask me about where did the universe come from? You know just big, big questions and it's not because their dad is really into science, it's because they themselves are interested. And so, when I tell them that the things they're learning  in school, are stories, they are an explanation based on our best knowledge at the time, it's easy for them to say, oh what else is there? And I say, well here's what else is there. So, kids, it's really easy to introduce them to the stuff, because they're naturally curious. So you  don't have to come up with clever, soft ways of telling it. You  just answer their questions. [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by TheThunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info How big is space? Of course the question demands refinement since the term ‘space’ merely describes a region that is empty of visible content. When we consider for instance the space between the Earth and the Sun, it's a distance of just over 90 million miles. When we consider the distance between the Sun and the outer edge of its influence called the heliopause, it stretches to a degree that the human mind finds hard to comprehend, to about 11 billion miles. The nearest star system beyond our solar system Alpha Centauri is about 24 trillion miles from Planet Earth. Within the Milky Way galaxy, at least 200 billion stars inhabit the roughly 100,000 light-years of space the Milky Way encompasses. And beyond the Milky Way, the Hubble telescope has already revealed an estimated 100 billion galaxies with many billions more waiting to be discovered. In other words, space is a big place. One might think that within that unfathomable vastness for objects to suffer the same fate as automobiles in busy traffic would be an exceedingly rare occurrence. Nevertheless, a cosmic collision is a process that astronomers and astrophysicists routinely propose to try to explain countless data at all scales throughout the cosmos. In our own solar system, the ravaged surfaces of planets and moons supposedly testify to random impacts over eons of time. We do see types of craters that are reproduced in impact experiments. However, we also see endless varieties of so-called ‘anomalous’ craters, including straight-edged polygonal craters, pristinely graded and spaced chains of highly circular craters, craters made of concentric rings, aligned craters, so-called bull's-eye craters, and the consistent preferential appearance of smaller craters on the rims of larger craters. That all of these craters are routinely produced in experiments with electrical discharge remains a fact completely unacknowledged and unexplored in planetary science. A cosmic collision is a process that institutionalized science has sanctioned for decades. As is sometimes said: if your only tool is a hammer, you see every problem as a nail. Thus, today in the astronomical literature objects smashing together for some reason is routinely proposed, even in vast rooms of space where the odds of such collisions are almost incalculably remote. One of the clearest examples of this can be seen in comet science, in the ad hoc theories that astronomers have proposed to try to explain a growing enigma. When the nucleus of Comet 67P was first imaged by the ESA's Rosetta spacecraft, scientists were puzzled by its double-lobed or "rubber duck" appearance. The two lobes of the comet which are joined by a neck region raised questions about the comet's origins and history. The ESA team considered two hypotheses. One was that localized erosion of a single object formed the distinct narrow neck. The other was that a low-speed collision between two fully formed comets, each of which formed from accretion in the "early solar system," produced the distinctive shape. Scientists eventually settled on the collision hypothesis in part because of the extraordinary layering of the nucleus's rocky material which in many regions appears indistinguishable from sedimentary or igneous rock on Earth. As investigator Matteo Massironi stated, "It must have been a low-speed collision in order to preserve such ordered strata to the depths our data imply." Investigator Bjorn Davidsson said, "...the striking structural similarities between the two lobes imply that despite their initial independent origins, they must have formed through a similar accretion process." However, a more recent scientific study in 2018 argues that 67P's formation was much more recent, a mere millions rather than billions of years ago. As reported by phys.org, "Comets which consists of two parts, like Chury, can form after a catastrophic collision of large bodies. Such collisions may have taken place in a later phase of our solar system, which suggests that Chury can be much younger than previously assumed. This is shown through computer simulations by an international research group with the participation of the University of Bern." Unlike earlier proponents of the collision hypothesis, the investigators believe that 67P could not have survived for billions of years in its current double-lobed shape, so they suggest that a catastrophic collision destroyed a number of comets from which some of the material immediately coalesced in the vacuum of space to produce 67P's double-lobed nucleus, as illustrated in the virtual reality animation on your screen. In response to this hypothesis, these major points must be emphasized. First is the truly incredible failure, both experimental and observational, of the accretion hypothesis to explain the rocky bodies in the solar system, from planets down to asteroids or even comets. As briefly described in a recent Washington Post article, "According to the traditional story of the origin of the solar system, the planets formed slowly from accretion, as particles in the circumstellar disk clumped together to great pebbles, then slightly larger spheres, on and on until they reached their current size." But when scientists try to re-create this story with computer models, it breaks down. Rather than growing, these incipient planets tend to splinter after reaching pebble size. How could this process result in bodies the size of those in the asteroid belt, let alone whole planets?" The next problem is the incredible improbability of cometary collisions. This improbability is highlighted on an official NASA webpage entitled 'Where Do Comets Come From?' It states of the Kuiper Belt and the hypothetical Oort Cloud, "Each of these regions contain billions of comets, but they have so much room in the vast room of space that they get no closer to each other than we on Earth do to the Sun." A comet nucleus is typically no more than a few to several kilometers in diameter. If comet 67P's double-lobed form were a lone or even rare occurrence, then perhaps one could be tempted to accept the collision conjecture as a miraculous one-time event. However, it is an astounding fact that the double-lobed appearance does not appear to be rare at all. Although relatively few comet nuclei have been imaged to date, the number of bodies that have similar shapes to 67P has grown increasingly daunting. As noted by University of Arizona investigator Stephen Schwartz to space.com, "Although the number of comets for which we know their shapes is still few, the tendency so far is for them to be bi-lobate or two-lobed." The comet Halley, comet Borrelly, comet Hartley, and more recently radar images of the Comets 8P Tuttle and comet 45P/HMP have all been suggested as so-called contact binaries. And of course, comets are not the only rocky bodies to display the double-lobed shape. Numerous asteroids are also double-lobed. As described by Lance Benner of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, "Radar imaging has shown that about 15% of near-Earth asteroids larger than 600 feet have this sort of lobed, peanut shape. There must be a process that forms the double-lobe naturally." And two of the five moons of the dwarf planet Pluto, Kerberos and Hydra, also display forms which astronomers can only imagine resulting from the collision of two objects. In this view, relatively routine collisions in the unfathomably vast rooms of interplanetary space caused colliding objects to stick together rather than fragmenting or simply repelling each other. However, as longtime viewers of this series are well aware, experiments with electric arcs routinely produce fused or double-lobed spheres as seen on the screen in Dr. C.J. Ransom's experiments to replicate the trillions of spherules called blueberries on the surface of Mars. The similarity to Comet 67P and other double-lobed bodies is self-evident. Of course every high-resolution image of a comet nucleus to date, as well as the more recent radar images of comet nuclei, reveal that comets are as far from "dirty snowballs" as one could imagine. Their terrains are dry, rocky, blackened and geologically complex. The complex layering of Comet 67P, which astronomers can only attribute to accretion and collisions, has also been seen on other comet nuclei, including Tempel 1 in 2005. This was an explicit prediction of the Electric Universe theory which also proposed that comets, as well as asteroids and meteoroids, were electrically torn from the surfaces of planets and moons. It's not the position of the Electric Universe that cosmic collisions simply never occur. We do see examples of craters on planets and moons that may be best explained by kinetic impacts. But given how common the appearances of double-lobed rocky bodies in our solar system, including and especially comet nuclei, astronomers must confront the actual probability of collisions forming those tiny bodies. Again, a comet nucleus is a minuscule celestial object and as noted by astronomer and specialist in celestial mechanics Tom Van Flandern, "The mean distance between comets in the hypothetical Oort cloud is 1 billion km, so collisions and accretions have negligible probability..." Again, the double-lobed appearance is stunningly common among the comet nuclei imaged to date. Just how commonplace could cometary collisions have ever been at any time in solar system history to produce this prevalent form. This strange and unfounded conjecture is now the standard interpretation in comet science while no effort nor resources have been devoted to even examining the genuine alternative hypothesis that the Electric Universe has offered. In a forthcoming episode, physicist Wal Thornhill will explore "doubleness cosmology" where stars and planets will tend to be formed in pairs and galaxies begin life with two "plasma sumps" in close orbit about each other. It seems that objects formed in interplanetary Birkeland currents will also begin life in pairs which may coalesce, like the central bulge in a barred spiral which has a peanut- shaped cross section. So asteroids and comets may be expected to be found with the same double-lobed structure due to their electrical birth. The world of astronomy may inevitably confront a collision of cosmic proportions. Not a collision between tiny bodies in the unimaginable vastness of space but rather a collision with reality. 
Good afternoon. This is a great conference, it takes a huge amount of work and an effort to organize an event like this, so, to all the organizers, thank you very much. I'm glad... I'm glad to be here today and talk to you about the instrumentation, data acquisition, data transformation and analysis. My job with the SAFIRE team is to not only collect data from the experiment but the collect it in such a way so that it can be used after an experiment has been done for our team to more easily see relationships between various events that are occurring during the experiment. Further to this point is to also be able to pull the data from an experiment, so we can do detailed analysis on those relationships. In these data and the integrity... it is these data and the integrity of these data, which is vital to the quality of the work that we do. But first, I would like to talk to you about what is an experiment, how experiments were done in the past and how the SAFIRE team does them today. An experiment is a procedure to test a concept or hypotheses. The reasons why we do experiment is to gain insight into what causes are involved in an observed effect, which may support the hypothesis or show that the hypothesis is false. Galileo's hypothesis was that on Earth all object fall at the same rate, but prior to these most people thought that the heavy ball should drop faster. Galileo found that his hypothesis was correct, but the big question became, why? Why are they dropping at the same rate? It was not until Sir Isaac Newton defined the law of gravity, that scientists started to understand why the balls fell and the same rate. So, as science progresses and experiments become more sophisticated the causes of effects become more difficult to determine. This also means it is more important to conduct a robust or repeatable experiments and use measurement devices capable of high degree of accuracy. It also becomes more challenging to clearly show to everyone the causes of a particular effect. I want to introduce the important concept of time in an experiment we start over the beaker of cold water and we are going to heat the water one way and then we will hit the water by any another method you need to add a stopwatch and the thermometer, so we can see how long it takes to boil the water. Now if you added the heat we will watch and document how long it takes the water to boil. After approximately 10 minutes, the water comes to full boil. But then I ask myself, is there more effective and quicker way to hit the water? I had the idea that if you could use the afterburner of an American F18 that might be a more effective method to heat the water. I discovered that, in fact I was right. It took approximately 0.05 nanoseconds, to not only hit the water, but vaporize it. and the beaker with it. I suggested to Monte that we should keep the F18, but he was mumbling something about budget constraints. Now, back in today, when scientists work in the laboratory they had to document everything manually, as experiments got more complex it required more scientists to record and collect data they created procedures on how to collect the data. Aligning the data to the same time line was a challenge in the past as it is today. Then plott of the data and finally do analysis of the data to determine the cause of the effects. So, as experiments become more complex the necessity of more sophisticated methods of measurement become vital to the success of the experiment. Let us have a look at the progress of the data acquisition specifically in this case capturing of what have seen. This picture of the Egyptian Sun was most likely creative with a hammer and chisel. In the mid 1800's an astronomer and physicist Warren de La Rue design and built the first cube photograph, used to photograph the sun's corona. For his time this was a major scientific breakthrough, since up until this time no known photographs of the sun's corona ever existed. But as we all know advances in the technology of the ions have help humanity in many ways and we now have through the hard work of Lockheed Martin and NASA the Solar Dynamics Observatory. What we are looking at is a full disk multi-wavelength Extreme Ultra Violet image of the Sun, taken by SDO on March 30th 2010. For scholars trace different gas temperatures, and these temperatures are represented in their own images as the Olight spectrometer returns this light spectra. At the top of this graph we are looking at the SDO broad light spectrum from the Sun. Below we are looking at the actual light spectra converted to specific light wavelength peaks, every element and it's very specific light spectral signature, when it is ionized. And it is by using optical spectroscopy you can tell what elements make up the light from the Sun. or, in our case, the light is coming from SAFIRE this is a SAFIRE plasma discharge and the light we get. And this is an example of spectral signatures we get back from the optical spectrometer. The SAFIRE experiment is based on Monte's announces of the electric Sun model of charged plasma affecting the matter of a different electrical potential. So, we introduce electrical power in the form of voltage and current than chamber pressure and plasma gas types. And when these factors are introduced into the experiment, then we measure these responses: Plasma voltage and current; Chamber pressure; Plasma gas types; Light spectra; Langmuir probes voltages; Temperature; Video capture; Photography. Here is a picture of phase one of SAFIRE showing the array of many instruments we are using to acquire data. As each instrument is acquiring data we also recorded video of each instrument computer monitor. This is the mass spectroscopy, this is a screen of voltage current and pressure gauge, this is a screen of the light spectra. And we also conduct synchronize video recording of the changes in the SAFIRE chamber in real time, this then consolidate all the video feeds into one master video, as a video recording of each experiment. This is the grand tour of the video, it helps our team very effectively recognize the points of interest that happened during the experiment. Let us investigate how data acquisition devices work. You have seen some of the results, now let's take a look at the vorish under the root. There is an analog-to-digital converter at the heart of each data acquisition device. The controller connects the data acquisition device and collects the digital data. The computer communicates with the controller, reach the controller's data and stores the data. The data acquisition path follows from the data acquisition device through the controller into the computer where all the data is stored. A data transformation engine takes all the data from the experiment and transforms the data into comprehensive graphical overlays and this is to help the SAFIRE team to analyze the data looking for causes of the effects the observer of the time. Here we have thousands of data points of the plasma current, now be overly the voltage, and high pressure measurements, and high vacuum pressure measurements and these are just a few, there are thousands and thousands of data points. But what we see is that in this region, for example, after the pressure drop in the chamber, there is a huge spike in voltage and current. The data transformation engine allows us to zoom into these regions with extremely high resolution and we see that both, the voltage and current, are discharging out in this region of the graph. What we discovered was quite profound, that during a short time SAFIRE had an intense plasma discharge that measured over 2 million watts. What is so profound is that we limited the input power to only 1800 watts. The transformation engine allows us to zoom in and examine in extremely high detail these points of interests. It is these kind of information that helps us determine what factors need to be used in the design of experiments that Dr. Paul Anderson will present now. Thank you. Thunderbolts.info 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info On this series, we have explored the significance of the filamentary structures seen at all scales throughout the cosmos. From the streaming filaments seen in the ion tails of comets, to the giant snake-like filaments reaching from the surface of the Sun, to the dark cores of sunspots. To the stupendous filamentary networks intimately linked to star formation in the Milky Way galaxy, to the web-like filaments along which galaxies form, like pearls on a string. Filaments in space are the expected features of a universe where electric currents connect celestial bodies across cosmic distances. Electrical circuitry pervades interplanetary, interstellar and even intergalactic space which can be seen when electric currents meet regions of dusty plasma and pinch the material into visible filaments. It's therefore no surprise that the discovery of huge filaments in space continues to send mainstream scientists searching for answers. Recently, astrophysicists using the Very Large Array telescope have made what for them is a completely unexpected discovery near the center of the Milky Way galaxy. What they have found is a nearly two-and-a-half light-year long filament that is "probing the hypothetical Black Hole at Sagittarius A". The December 20, 2017, Phys.org report describes the discovery as follows, "The center of our galaxy has been intensely studied for many years, but it still harbors surprises for scientists. A snake-like structure lurking near our galaxy's supermassive black hole is the latest discovery to tantalize astronomers." The leader of a study on the discovery stated, "With our improved image, we can now follow this filament much closer to the Galaxy's central black hole, and it is now close enough to indicate to us that it must originate there. However, we still have more work to do to find out what the true nature of this filament is." The investigators are only considering three possibilities to explain the mysterious filament. One is that the hypothetical black hole "kicked away" high-speed particles somehow forming the light-years long filament. This would involve the black hole's rotation pairing with spiraling gas to produce an incredibly powerful magnetic field. Another possibility they've entertained is that the filament is a mathematical conjecture called a cosmic string, which theoretical physicists have proposed may have formed in the early universe, but which have never been discovered. Ironically, as described in the phys.org report, it's believed that hypothetical cosmic strings "... are long, extremely thin objects that carry mass and electric currents." The final notion the scientists have considered is that the alignment of the filament with the galactic center is coincidence. However, as the phys.org report states, such a coincidence is quite unlikely to happen by chance. Unfortunately, the investigators are not considering other more promising possibilities, namely, that the hypothetical black hole at the galactic center simply does not exist. As we noted in the recent episode 'Black Holes Behaving Badly', in astrophysics today the black hole has become an unfalsifiable concept. In our own Milky Way it appears that no discovery, including the recent observation of star formation occurring much too close to the hypothetical black hole where tidal forces must rip the gas and dust apart before it can form stars, will force any doubt of the black hole's existence. As we've outlined many times, the position of Plasma Cosmology and the Electric Universe is that it is not a black hole at the center of galaxies but an ultra-high density energy storage phenomenon demonstrated for decades in laboratories, called a plasmoid which is a kind of load in the Galactic electrical circuit. The plasmoid concentrates and stores energy and is connected to a larger network of electric currents. When the plasmoid reaches a threshold density, it discharges, usually along a galaxy's spin axis. This is in fact the source of stupendous galactic jets. The discovery of a vast filament, such as that recently observed, is expected and is in fact required if it is a plasmoid at the galactic core. As we've noted several times recently, the role of magnetic fields in sustaining cosmic filaments is now being discussed with increasing frequency in astrophysics. Earlier this year, scientists reported the first-ever measurement of the "magnetic bridge" linking the Milky Way's two nearest galaxies. Known as the Magellanic bridge, the filament stretches for approximately 75,000 light-years connecting the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. One of the researchers stated, "Not only are entire galaxies magnetic, but the faint delicate threads joining galaxies are magnetic, too. Everywhere we look in the sky, we find magnetism." The lead author of the study stated, "In general, we don't know how such vast magnetic fields are generated, nor how these large-scale magnetic fields affect galaxy formation and evolution. Understanding the role the magnetic fields play in the evolution of galaxies and their environment, is a fundamental question in astronomy that remains to be answered." But of course, magnetism is only a part of the story and will always remain mysterious without the recognition of the electric currents required to produce and sustain the magnetic fields. However, we do see increasing signs that this inevitable recognition is beginning to occur. The December 25, 2017, issue of 'Astronomy & Astrophysics' published the paper, 'The jets of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) as giant coaxial cables'. In looking at the properties of stupendous parsec-scale jets, the authors conclude that, "...our results have now yielded firm evidence that many ― possibly all ― Active Galactic Nuclei jets have inward currents along their axes and outward currents in a more extended region surrounding the jets. It also indicates that astrophysical jets are fundamentally electromagnetic structures, which must be borne in mind when interpreting observed features in the distributions of both their intensity and linear polarization." We note the counter-rotating magnetic fields the authors depict in this diagram of the jet's environment. As those in the Electric Universe community are well aware, the counter-rotation has special significance. In recent years, Dr. Donald Scott has developed the mathematical modeling of a Birkeland current whose influence can be seen visually in the form of counter-rotating shells as observed in Earth's cylindrical auroral sheets and at the north poles of the gas giants Saturn and Jupiter. Dr. Scott will discuss the role of Birkeland currents in galactic jets in a forthcoming Space News. Another scientific paper published in October, 2017, also proposes that giant electric currents flow through the Galactic jets. The author states: "Several researchers have reported direct evidence for large-scale electric currents along astrophysical jets. Quite unexpectedly, their directions are not random as would have been the case if the magnetic field were generated by a magneto-hydrodynamic dynamo. Instead, in all kilo-parsec scale detections, the inferred electric currents are found to flow away from the galactic nucleus. This unexpected break of symmetry suggests that a battery mechanism is operating around the central black hole." However, we again note the futility of scientists looking to colossal gravity as the cause of stupendous electromagnetic cosmic phenomena. The question is, what can any so-called battery do that is not connected to a circuit? The central object in an active galactic nucleus must be an electromagnetic energy storage circuit element, the aforementioned plasmoid in a far grander galactic and extra-galactic circuit. Plasma cosmologists recognized this decades ago and it was explained excessively in the book 'The Big Bang Never Happened'. Yet, these concepts are nowhere to be found in mainstream astrophysics, leaving working scientists to ponder undeniable electrical phenomena with little hope of resolving the underlying cause. And so as we enter the New Year of 2018, our basis, at The Thunderbolts Project, for optimism and confidence has never been stronger as groundbreaking discoveries lead scientists closer to our Electric Universe.

Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info A team of scientists on Earth have made a surprising and perhaps a very significant discovery on the Sun's magnetic field. The scientists were utilizing a solar telescope to study the Sun's corona, and through good-fortune were able to observe and analyze an exceptionally powerful solar flare. The team focused on estimating the magnetic field strength of features called coronal loops, which are glowing arcs of electrified plasma. What they found is that the coronal loops' magnetic field is ten times stronger than solar physicists had previously thought. The lead investigator of the study stated, "This is the first time we have been able to measure accurately the magnetic field of the coronal loops, the building blocks of the sun's magnetic corona, with such a level of accuracy." However, the description of coronal loops as "building blocks" of the Sun's magnetic corona reveals enduring beliefs about the Sun and its magnetism that may demand reassessment. Today, retired professor of electrical engineering Dr. Donald Scott, author of the book 'The Electric Sky' shares his analysis of the real processes behind the Sun's magnetic field, based on the Electric Sun model. In regard to that that press release about the Sun's magnetic field being measured as 10 times stronger than what they thought before, I think that's, that's very good. That's very, I'm very encouraged that they are measuring magnetic fields on the Sun. The lead investigator, Dr. Kuridze, I believe it is, said, "Everything that happens in the Sun's outer atmosphere is dominated by the magnetic field, but we have very few measurements of its strength and spatial characteristics. This is the first time we have been able to measure accurately the magnetic field of the coronal loops", that's important, "the building blocks of the Sun's magnetic corona, with such a level of accuracy." So he says that the coronal loops are the building blocks of the Sun's magnetic corona. Well, that's just not so. For several reasons. If the astrophysicists have little or no knowledge about how magnetic fields are created within the Sun to start with, then it's, there's a little doubt, there's a little surprise on our part as to why they are always surprised by what they measure. In any event, the corona is mainly an electrical phenomenon. It's an electrically driven plasma and it's not primarily a magnetic one. There may be some magnetic fields within it, but the corona is mainly an electrical phenomenon and astrophysicists have gone right to the precipice of allowing their theories to incorporate magnetic fields - magnetism but not electrical ones. Well, Hannes Alfvén pointed out a long time ago that the coronal loops are examples of an electric plasma discharge and he pointed out that these loops are inherently unstable because they incorporate or can incorporate a magnetic electrical structure called a double-layer. And I said magnetic, it happens within a plasma and so there is a magnetic field within that plasma but the double-layer itself is primarily an electrical phenomenon. And the whole idea is that the double-layer is, can be, it tends to be at times unstable and it can explode, and that the explosion of that double layer in that prominence, in that loop, is what gives rise to what we now call coronal mass ejections. The material of which the loop is made, plasma is spewed out just like it would be from any other explosions into space. But anyway, astrophysicists have now seized upon the idea that anything they can't fully explain was to be due to magnetic fields. So for example, if you ask an astrophysicist what causes sunspots? They'll usually answer something to the effect that the sunspots are cooler than the photospheric surface around them. Well, why is that? The typical standard answer is that well, the Sun's magnetic fields sometimes gets twisted. Over time all that messy an uneven twisting movement distorts the Sun's main magnetic field in the same way that your bedsheets get wrinkled and bunched up when you toss and turn in your sleep. I kid you, not that I actually read those words in a recent press release. Then they go on to say, sunspots are cooler areas of intense magnetism. Oh, say that again? Cooler areas of intense magnetism. So intense that they inhibit the flow of hot gases from the Sun's interior to its surface and that's their explanation of what causes sunspots. That the magnetism has stopped the flow of hot gases, and having presented that as a well-established fact they immediately move on to the discussion of what they see the sunspots doing. But wait a minute! Since when does magnetism push gas around or inhibit its movement? Can we move or halt gas flow by putting a bar magnet at its path? No, of course not. But without explanation for their assertion they continue; quote, "The bunched up spots ... have so much magnetic power that they push back the hot gases beneath them and prevent the heat from rising directly to the surface. And so, that supposedly causes a cool sunspot to occur. If you're, I asked for example, what causes thunderstorms? The answer is not clouds. It's much more complicated than that and that's the kind of level of explanation that we're getting about sunspots. It's that magnetism cools things down. Anyway, several years ago, Stanford University announced that they had been studying what they called flows below the surface of the Sun. They discovered jet streams or what they called rivers of hot electrically charged gas; OK, translation -- plasma; flowing beneath the surface of the Sun. They also found features similar to trade winds that transport gas beneath the Sun's fiery surface. Well obviously, rivers of plasma are rivers of electrical charges and that is by definition an electric current. And currents cause magnetic fields. So it doesn't take much of a leap of imagination to realize that flows of charge within the Sun currents are what cause these magnetic fields. That's why the magnetic fields exist in the first place. Well anyway, seeing their work, seeing the work that the Stanford people did, I began to think about, I hate to use that word flows of gas and that sort of stuff, so I said well, let's put the real language on there. If we label that with currents, how could those currents result in what we see on the surface of the Sun? These magnetic loops. Well, I realize I have a picture there you can put on, that is in my book, that's my picture. I'm very proud that other people have borrowed it and use it from time to time and I've seen it several times in other people's papers. And that's great, but I want to emphasize that is only my idea, my supposition of what might be going on within the Sun. I think it explains the magnetic loops sufficiently. Now is this the only arrangement of currents and magnetic fields within the Sun that can cause these? No, of course not. But it is one of the possibilities. So if you take a look at that picture, you can see that entering down into the North Pole of the Sun and entering up into the South Pole of the Sun, I have labeled there the main current and it's increasing in strength. OK well, let's presume, you know, there is a sunspot cycle, 11-year sunspot cycle, actually the whole cycle takes 22 years, but it's, half of it is up on the upswing and half of it is on the downswing. And so, during the part of that cycle, which is the active Sun is growing, I don't know but I think it's possible, what we're seeing is that the main current into the poles, those red currents, are increasing in strength. So I've labeled the diagram 'increasing in strength', and as a result if you use the right hand rule, you know, put your thumb in the direction of the current, and let your fingers show you where the magnetic field is going to be, you can see that there circulating around those main incoming currents are some magnetic fields. I think they've done them in blue there. And also if the current is increasing, the magnetic field is increasing in strength. And so, if we go down, proceed down into the Sun, these four concentric circles are there to show that those magnetic fields are increasing in strength. Well, transformers. Every transformer on Earth relies on what's called transformer action and that's what we're seeing here, is that if the current is increasing in the transformer magnetic core, the magnetic field is increasing and there is that magnetic core links an output winding in a transformer, and here there is no magnetic core, but there is the possibility of magnetic field being inside the Sun. And the Sun inside the Sun is a plasma. And a plasma is conductive. And so therefore the plasma which links those increasing blue circles, they are those increasing magnetic fields, there's a possibility for current to be formed by the changing strength of that magnetic field. So let me say that again. One of the basic rules of electrical science is that if there's a conducting path through a magnetic field and the magnetic field is changing, in this case increasing in strength, there will be induced in that conductor, a current, a secondary current. And you can see, I've sketched it lightly but I've labeled it secondary current. So that's the main input current, it's the primary winding, and the secondary current is the output winding, of a solar transformer, if you will. Now if you look at that, there's light little secondary currents. If you put your thumb in the direction of that secondary current, your fingers will be in the direction of a magnetic field which is produced, which is the result of those secondary currents. So very lightly there in the northeast quadrant, I've shown a magnetic loop created by that secondary current. Well, we've observed for years the fact that these magnetic loops do indeed come from sunspots. And where the magnetic field leaves the Sun, that's by definition a North Pole, and where it enters the Sun, that's by definition a South Pole. And if you look and compare what happens in the North hemisphere with the South hemisphere, you see that if going from, let's say, east to west in the north, you get a North Magnetic Pole and then a South Magnetic Pole. And if you go from east to west in the southern hemisphere, the first thing you come upon is the South Magnetic Pole and then you come upon the North Magnetic Pole. And so as the sunspot cycle goes on, these magnetic loops, these coronal loops, they change their location and latitude. In the other half of the cycle, those north-south pole positions reverse. And so this, I claim, is a possible model that explains several things. One thing that is certainly consistent with reality of these two, the way these North Pole and South Pole configurations and the magnetic loops change around. Also that main current, you can see it coming out at the equator, I labeled it, main current increasing in strength. That's a well-known current sheet. In one of the press releases they say, "When solar physicists talk about solar field reversals, their conversation often centers on the 'current sheet'." That's the only time they actually mention current but they do at that time. "The current sheet is a sprawling surface jutting outward from the sun's equator where the sun's slowly rotating magnetic field induces an electric current." Huh? The magnetic field induces an electric current! Yeah well, the magnetic fields can induce electric currents but I suspect and suggest to you at this point, what's going on here is that that current is producing the magnetic field. That's just the reverse of what's actually, what they say is going on. I think it's actually what's going on. But anyway, when you see a picture of a coronal loop, that's not a magnetic field you're looking at. Magnetic fields are invisible. They're invisible to the human eye. What we can see is electrically excited glow- or arc-mode current, plasma forming those loops. The plasma is coincidental with the way the magnetic field is moving and certainly with the directions the current is moving. Mainstream physicists try to avoid explaining how the Sun's magnetic field gets formed in the first place. Electric currents which are the only cause of magnetic fields, they don't come from anyplace else, they don't come by mixing gases or anything else. They're coming from, they're caused by electric currents. They're almost never mentioned, with one or two exceptions like this current sheet that comes out of this equator of the Sun. Magnetic fields don't get twisted up and they don't cool things down unless they're, and they don't move unless their formative currents produced that movement. They certainly are not able to modify sunspots. They're the results of an electric process that creates them. Anyway, it's good to be able to measure solar magnetic field strengths and I'm very happy that these people have done that and with increased accuracy, that's wonderful. But it's kind of like improving the accuracy of measuring exact length of an elephant's tail while ignoring the rest of the animal. 
[Music] It's time to put to bed the fairy tale of dark matter, something so dark of course it's invisible, and so mysterious that it remains undetected after decades of searching for it with sophisticated instruments, scanning all the known cosmos and the entire electromagnetic spectrum. But how can something be falsified that's this imperceptible? Of course, there are many other invisible non-existent astrophysical entities, such as dark energy and neutron stars that have been invented and disseminated using disingenuous methods of measurement and interpretation onto a naive unsuspecting public. But those are battles for another day. Being a scientist is like being an explorer who's attempting to hack a pathway through a dense jungle, snarl of weeds, vines, trees and undergrowth. But the scientist’s jungle consists of natural ignorance and also a lack of knowledge and grown false beliefs which may be long time officially accepted mis- conceptions. Real scientists try to produce hypotheses, that is to say logical descriptions of real things and how they interact. All scientific hypotheses of course have to be testable. If it can't be actively tested, a hypothesis at least must pass the so-called test of time. Incoming new data has to fit comfortably into any proposed hypothesis or model without too much tinkering with it, or massive back-to-the-drawing board modifications, and certainly without inventing imaginary ecological, non-measurable forces and non-observable entities, such as strange matter to explain the new data. In the past few years I’ve been studying Birkeland Currents. Those are the strong, stable flows of electrically charged particles that connect from one place in the cosmos to another. What their form and structure is and how they affect objects they connect with. Originally discovered by Kristian Birkeland early in the 1900s coming from the Sun to the  earth. They deliver the electric power that lights up our auroras and I wanted to develop an accurate, realistic model of their structure. A complete description of what I did is thoroughly detailed in chapters 10 and 11 of my latest book “The Interconnected Cosmos,” published by Stickman on Stone, and I urge you to pick up a copy. Anyway,  here's a brief description of what I did. My starting point was at the edge of the scientific jungle, astrophysics and cosmology, which supposedly is the scientific study of cosmic space and those things that inhabit it, but it really is a jungle of contradictions and warped, bizarre, impossible processes and imaginary forces. But I had to begin somewhere. At that time I had completed the derivation and interpretation of a mathematical model that had been started by Stig Lundquist in 1950. He had determined two equations that describe the basic shape of the magnetic field that is inside a Birkeland Current, but that's where he stopped. I completed his model to include five major equations and also interpreted what they implied about the physical shape of the Birkeland Currents and their behavior and that was not explained fully by Lundquist. My model predicted that Birkeland Currents uniquely produce coaxial counter-rotational motion of their internal plasma and are able to carry electric current in both directions at the same time. Let me emphasize, this is a unique behavior. A coaxial cable here on Earth cannot simultaneously carry current in both  directions. As far as we know, true coaxial counter- rotation is created in nature only by field aligned, that is to say, Birkeland Currents. For example a pair of tornadoes, located near each other, rotating in opposite directions, is not an example of coaxial counter-rotation simply because they're not coaxial, they're not inside one another. So when NASA recorded those coaxial counter-rotating cloud bands on both Jupiter and Saturn, my model had passed its first test. That was the extent of my first foray into this cosmological jungle and at that point I figured we’d pitch camp for a rest. But then the announcement of the discovery of counter-rotating stars in the faces of several spiral galaxies, was even stronger evidence that was headed in the right direction. In  2014 it was reported that a vast network of plasma filaments, Birkeland Currents really, had been discovered that connect many, if not all, the galaxies in the  Universe in what has been called the Intergalactic Web, abbreviation IGW. The discovery was quickly confirmed and a rush of scientific papers followed. All this strongly suggested that Birkeland Currents not only connect objects within our solar system, but there are much larger and stronger Birkeland Currents arching across the vast distances between galaxies. I assume that those galaxies within the Intergalactic Web must be sending and receiving electric currents via the plasma filaments to which they are connected. Also, I thought if galaxies actually form on those Birkeland Current filaments in the web, they probably inherit their rotational profiles from those filaments. If that happens, then the stellar velocity profiles ought to be the same as the velocity profiles of the Birkeland Currents on which they form. Remember that the typical stellar velocity profile in a galaxy, a plot of the star's velocity as a function of its radius r, how far out it is from the galaxy's center, has been totally baffling to astrophysicists. Actually they typically look like a plot of the function the square root of r. This shape cannot be explained by Newtonian physics and almost all astrophysicists deny that electrical effects could possibly produce any of what we see in the cosmos. So,  that's why astronomers like Vera Rubin and her colleagues postulated the existence of dark missing matter in the 1940s. Their repeated unsuccessful attempts to explain this rotation of those stars is what set astronomers off on their decades-old quest to find dark matter. So, I wondered if the plot of the rotation speed of the plasma in my model Birkeland Current, might be similar to the ones that baffled those astronomers. I set out to determine what that velocity profile might be. My model yields information about the magnetic field strength and the current density in a Birkeland Current, but it doesn't directly yield any information about the velocity of the charges that make up those currents. The key to determining the velocity of the stream of charged particles in a Birkeland Current was the realization that the current density in any plasma has two components, the charge density and the velocity of those charges. The charge density is how much charge you have per cubic meter and the velocity of course is how many meters per second does that box of charges travel with. Therefore, if we know any two of these three quantities j, rho and v, we can find the third one. We obviously know from historical astronomical observations what the typical velocity profile of stars  within the galaxy looks like, and it's approximately the square root of r. And we know from the equations of my model that the current density j, varies with radial distance r, out from the BC's, that is the Birkeland Current's central axis, as one over the square root of r. So, I was able to solve for the third quantity, not very hard, the charge density rho that must exist inside my model BC, using all this data, the data from galaxy NGC1620, it turns out to be a simple inverse relationship, one over r. This clearly demonstrates that an electrical process exists, that can produce the heretofore inexplicable stellar velocities, that prompted astronomers to search for dark matter in the first place. In other words, the refusal to accept the existence and effects of electrical charges in space, is what began, and maintains to this day, the dark matter wild goose chase. But is there any evidence that this particular distribution, this one over r shape, is the way charge really is distributed inside an actual BC? I took a short side trip off the logical journey we had been on, to find that  out. Did the velocity profiles of other galaxies also require this same charge density in the BC’s they connected with? That was the question. Other galaxies may have slightly different velocity profiles. Using any of those other velocity profiles with the same expression for current density from my model, yielded slightly different charge density curves. But the main point is that there is always some charge density curve, that will exactly reproduce any arbitrary velocity profile. So, I repeat myself. We have now shown, and as I said recently, presented in a greater detail in my new book, that a purely electrical process does indeed exist that can produce a hitherto inexplicable stellar velocity [distribution] that prompted astronomers to search for dark matter. And that's the end of the story. The charge densities may be slightly different from that one over r-shaped distribution in different galaxies but the BC curve, that Birkeland Current velocity curve will always match the actual one. By the way we know that BCs often show coaxial counter-rotation. So, when we observe coaxial rotation of the stars in a galaxy that is connected to a BC, that's additional evidence that we're correct that it is the Birkeland Current that's producing the velocity of those stars in those galaxies. The twisting motions of the galaxy's Birkeland current are what produces the velocities of those stars. If we assume that the charge density distribution that exists within a typical Birkeland Current filament is, as a function of radial distance r, the distance out from the Z-axis of the Birkeland Current, is proportional to one over r, as it is for the one particular galaxy I show there, NGC1620, we can solve mathematically for the electric field that particular charge density plot creates. In other words, we know what the charges are, where they are, we can solve for the electrical field that results. In turn, knowing the properties of that electric field, allows us to find the voltage that will occur at every point within the Birkeland Current's cross-section as a function of the radius value of that point. It turns out that under this assumption about the charge density, that the maximum voltage occurs exactly at the center of the Birkeland Current, that r equals 0, the central Z-axis. Out  from there, the points of increasing radius, the voltage plot is a simple linearly decreasing function of r. This voltage distribution is exactly what's needed to produce Marklund convection. Okay, but so what? What's Marklund convection? Well, in Marklund convection, it's a process that occurs in a Birkeland Current, atoms of the various elements present are sorted according to their so-called ionization potential. This results in the easily ionized, that is to say the heavier atomic weight elements such as iron, being found at the center of the filament, and the lighter elements such as hydrogen and helium, being found in its outer regions. This  process works, because positive ions accelerate down the voltage drop that starts at the center of the Birkeland current, and ends at its outer edge. They go faster and faster, until they collide out at the edge of the Birkeland Current with any matter, atoms, ions, dust, any other stuff, and this releases heat. Those collisions release heat. The temperature is hottest at the collision site, just at the Birkeland Current's edge. And that's why the elements that are the most difficult from which to strip off an electron, such as hydrogen and helium, are found out there. So the center of the Birkeland Current is its coolest region and contains the heavy elements such as iron, and its outer edge is the hottest region containing elements such as hydrogen. This is intriguingly the same sorting arrangement found in stars including our Sun, which are formed in Z-pinches in Birkeland Currents. Our Sun has a heavy concentration of hydrogen at its outer surface. Therefore, if the Sun was created at the center of a pinch, such as a Birkeland Current, then its center ought to be relatively cool and its outer surface, the  photosphere should be quite hot and it is. We know that the dark center of a Sunspot, the umbra, is much cooler than the surrounding photosphere and it's  a window into the inside of the Sun. But the question still remained. Was  my assumption that the distribution of electric charges, the charge density rho, one over r, correct? Does it really occur? The answer came when a noted astronomer, professor Michael Merrifield of the University of Nottingham, reported that the outer rim of a galaxy, this one was NGC4550, mysteriously had a collection of counter- rotating, hydrogen-rich stars at its periphery, at the edge of it. He complained  that there was no known way for this to ever occur. His announcement unintentionally provided supporting evidence that I considered strong evidence, for my claim that a Birkeland Current had been, or was connected to this galaxy. This might easily have been the cause, not only of the hydrogen-rich collection of stars along its edge, but also why that band was counter-rotating with respect to the other stars in NGC4550. I assert that my assumption was thus shown to be valid, at least in this particular case. And once again, we  see that an electrical process is the explanation that eludes all these expert astrophysicists that still say yes, yes, we know electricity exists in the cosmos but it doesn't do anything. Well, the Sun's heliosphere is a node, a pinch in a Birkeland Current. According  to our model, the only place in a Birkeland Current that involves energy loss, would be the outer edge of the Birkeland Current where positive  ions falling radially down that linearly decreasing voltage profile, recombine with electrons just outside. This recombination process will emit a low level of visible light. It releases energy in the form of light. The newly formed energetic neutral atoms called ENAs, energetic neutral atoms, then diffuse back into the Birkeland Current. Being neutral, they're unaffected by any of the electromagnetic effects there. This visible light was discovered by the NASA Lockheed Martin IBEX mission. The announcement said in part, IBEX's  all-sky map of energetic neutral atom emission reveals a bright ring of ENAs that encircles the entire heliosphere. David J. McComas, IBEX principal investigator and assistant vice president of the Space Science and Engineering division at Southwest Research Institute, said quote, ”The IBEX results are truly remarkable, with a narrow ribbon of bright details. This is a shocking new result. We had no idea this ribbon existed, or what has created it. Our previous ideas about the outer heliosphere are going to have to be revised.” But if history is any guide, it will not be revised. NASA and the astrophysics power structure never admit they were wrong about anything. We'll see what they do in this case. In any event the Marklund convection process may well be occurring all along the vast length of the Birkeland Current that extends on either side of our Sun's  heliosphere. And that Birkeland Current is not visible from Earth, probably because it's an aging normal Birkeland Current that has a weaker charge density along its length than will be found at the Z-pinch, the heliopause, the heliosphere. The current density will be weaker, the plasma will therefore be in dark mode quite likely, and I think it is, from observation, and any light generated by recombination along its periphery will be even weaker than that observed by the IBEX mission. But the Marklund convection process, in which the positive ions inside a Birkeland  Current are accelerated outward, directed by an E-field from a high-voltage central axis, is exactly the same process that we now know occurs just above the edge of the Sun's heliosphere, when the solar wind positive ions coming from the Sun recombine with incoming electrons to produce the light seen by IBEX. It's  also similar to what happens just above the Sun's photosphere, where accelerating positive ions, escaping from inside the Sun, collide with other matter, which creates the high temperatures of the Sun's coronal temperature anomaly. It's the same process, just with higher current density at the pinch than  along the BC's length, and highest of all just above the Sun's photosphere. So, the evidence strongly indicates that stars are connected to their planets  and to other stars. All galaxies are connected. The more we look carefully,  the entire Universe is interconnected by plasma Birkeland Current filaments.  And the electrical interactions at all locations are fairly similar, just with differing strengths and sizes. The process seems to be scalable. I have  long wondered why cosmologists, who claim the Universe is created by a Big Bang explosion, never try to explain where all the rotation comes from. Just about everything we see in the cosmos rotates, or twists, or spins. Why? How did it get that way from a Big Bang explosion? Birkeland Currents rotate and they counter- rotate. Is that the source of all the rotation? I claim yes, it is. At least until I hear of another natural process that can cause the rotation and coaxial counter-rotation we see  everywhere we look in the sky. We all have to realize that no one can ever disprove the existence of something that doesn't exist. In order to maintain or renew  the sources of their grant funding, astrophysicists who now refuse to put  an end to their fruitless and wildly expensive dark matter quest, are  challenging us to do just that. In maintaining their assertion that dark matter still exists, they're saying something like, ”There's a big vicious dog under this table. He's invisible, untouchable, unsmellable and makes no sounds, but he ate my homework last night. Prove to me he doesn't exist.” Now, this is a dishonest, illogical unreasonable, childish challenge. Anyone seriously making such a demand is a shyster, a snake oil salesman who is intentionally trying to swindle his audience, or  perhaps he's an intellectually lazy astrophysicist fearing misinformation. Either way, the evidence is indisputable. The theory and most importantly, the rationale for the existence of dark matter has now been systematically debunked. An accurate understanding of the  cosmos is impossible in the conventional science of astrophysics, simply because they refuse to expand their tool set. Limited to the force of gravity in  either its Newtonian or Einsteinian format, gravity only attracts. Magnetic  forces can attract, but they can also repel. Electrical forces can also attract and they can  repel. And then there's the Lorentz force that exists between electrical charges moving through a magnetic field. Including all of these essential forces of nature when cracking the secrets of the Universe, then the concept and necessity of dark matter is outright ridiculous. Another key difference between the Standard Model and the Electric Universe model of cosmology. [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info The surfaces of the rocky bodies in our Solar System testify to events that planetary scientists have never considered. The interpretive manual of standard geology limited to processes such as random impacts, wind and water erosion and volcanism, has never successfully explained countless of the features we see on rocky planets. For decades, experiments with electrical discharges in the laboratory have reproduced some of the most puzzling craters and other features seen on planets and moons. Within the Electric Universe community, a growing number of enquirers are exploring the surface of our planet identifying the indelible marks left by high-energy electrical discharges. In this episode, Thunderbolts colleague Andy Hall continues his remarkable series of presentations with his two-part exploration of the 'Lightning-Scarred Earth'. The blue-white arc of a lightning bolt stuns the senses. Blinding radiance, elemental beauty, awesome power and primordial danger flash into existence from thin air and vanish before the mind catches-up. We stare, immobile, unthinking and awestruck. In that moment, a channel of air the diameter of a quarter heats 50,000 degrees, as trillions of electrons cascade to Earth. The volume of air blows-up, radiating energy across the spectrum, and sending sonic booms across the sky. Lightning also pummels the land, creating pressure waves exceeding 70,000 atmospheres -- that's 1 million psi. It can create a layer of shocked quartz and vitrify surrounding rock into glass. Lightning is an interaction between the Earth and sky. Its cause is an electric field between the electric storm above and the ground beneath our feet. 'Ground' in this case is also a technical term, meaning the ambient voltage potential of the soil. Earth is a negatively charged body in space and current flows up from ground to atmosphere, normally in a drift of ions and electrons that is invisible. Storms reverse this current flow, causing electrons to avalanche back to Earth. The Earth and sky are part of a circuit. Storms result from capacitance in this circuit. The atmosphere stores energy in the form of ionic charge, and releases it through lightning, among other effects. The ground is one plate of the capacitor where positive charge collects. As negative charge builds in the cloud, it is repulsed from the ground below, and positive ions are drawn in. The ground reaches up with plasma tendrils. They collect especially around tall structures, pooling densely at sharp projections, surrounding them with a halo of charge the cascading electrons target for connection. When a connection is made, the arc touches Earth, spreading current in horizontal arcs across the surface as much as 20 meters away. This is a death zone. If you're in it, you are part of a 200,000 amp circuit. The horizontal arcing is a side flash -- a scatter of arcs tendrils that follow surface conduction across the ground, radially away from the point of impact. The ground potential, type, and shape of the surface influences the character of the side flash. Dry sand acquires charge very easily and so lightning attracts charged particles and will sweep sand to it leaving a display of the entire strike zone. Sand in the strike zone where current surges across the surface, pulls inward leaving a shallow crater with a cone of sand in the center. It's like grabbing a bedspread in the center, pulling it up and dropping it in a pile. The following photos were taken near Kayenta, Arizona on desert plains to the south of Comb Ridge. The form is like an anthill, but these are not anthills. Ants dig rock from below ground and pile it outside the hole. These are built just the opposite way. The sand is swept-up from the surroundings, leaving a pile at the center of a crater. Besides, these don't have ants or antholes. The mounds of sand are composed of fine, almost powder sand. But the tops of the mounds are dusted with pebbles. The pebbles are sand that was drawn into the lightning channel and fused before falling back to Earth when the flame extinguished, falling to cover the mound, like candy sprinkles on an ice cream cone. Nothing grows inside the craters, or on the mounds. It's as if the soil is sterilized. PH tests show the soil to be highly alkaline. What meager growth there is are low, ground- covering grasses and weeds around the perimeter of the craters. The desert in this region of Northern Arizona is carpeted with lightning strikes that left crater and mound features like these. The land is on the Colorado Plateau, just south of Monument Valley. They form what some call 'fairy rings' when seen from the air. The next images show clusters of them. The craters vary in size from 15 to 30 feet in diameter, or larger. The size of the central cone is proportionate to the size of the crater, ranging from about 8 to 18 inches tall. The strikes especially cluster where black rock crusts over the sand. The lightning seems to have punched through, scattering rock and leaving the craters bare, where nothing grows. Whether the lightning is attracted to the rock or the rock was made with the lightning isn't known, but the rock provides a clue. It appears the lightning came in a coherent event that peppered the land, punching through and shattering the rock. That, at least, is how it appears. It's as if there were two events. One that torched and melted the surface of the land, creating the cap rock, and a subsequent one that shattered the rock with lightning. What amazes is the number of them clustered in particular areas. They rarely overlap, spaced fairly even, but randomly apart. There are hundreds of thousands, if not millions of them scarring the land just south of Comb Ridge. There are regions around the world where features like these carpet the land for hundreds of square miles. They are seen in desert lands especially since there is little undergrowth to obscure them. The next image is from Namibia. Here the features connect with filaments of stream beds. But note how they connect in linear arrays and branch radially like little stars. They are electric discharge patterns. Each feature seems to be a shallow basin or spring where water collects. Map resolution doesn't allow better detail but these features are larger than the Arizona features. Many cover several acres. Much of the country of Uzbekistan is also carpeted with similar features, as the following images from a small portion of eastern Uzbekistan show. The Uzbekistan features are larger and more numerous still. They also appear to be shallow basins where the geology is distinctly changed, and there appears to be a source of water. In the last image, there appears to be a home, or ranch with a livestock tank, well, or catchment at the center. It makes sense that water is found where lightning has struck. Subsurface water is a source of ionization that intensifies charge density, and therefore the electric field, attracting lightning to its location. Standing surface water won't do that because ions have no point to collect -- they spread evenly over the surface of the water. But subterranean water is trapped in the earth, where ions can collect and build concentration, locally intensifying the electric field. Pits, craters, and rilles formed by lightning leave depressions over aquifers that are natural for springs and wells. But what about larger features -- bigger than pits and piles of sand. Can lightning make a mountain? Volcanoes form mountains by extruding molten rock to the surface from hot pools of magma beneath the crust. This is conventional understanding, and it isn't in dispute in the Electric Universe. After all, volcanoes can be witnessed doing this in real time. The resulting strato-volcanoes, cinder cones, lava flows, ash deposits and lahars are seen across the globe. What creates magma chambers and causes them to erupt is not understood. Consensus science has a number of speculative theories based on conventional beliefs about the make-up and dynamics of the interior of the earth. It's these theories EU has a problem with. EU theory proposes the mechanism for heating and erupting volcanoes is electrical discharge beneath Earth's crust. But our theories are also speculative because there is no way to look inside the Earth to be sure. One type of geologic feature attributed to volcanism can be challenged by EU Theory, however. These are buttes believed by the consensus to be the ancient throats of volcanoes, where a magma plug froze in the throat, and later erosion exposed them leaving a hardened pinnacle. Archetypal of these is Shiprock, a tall butte that lies near Four Corners, where the U.S. States of Arizona, Utah, Colorado and New Mexico meet. It lies in the heart of Navajo lands Some Navajo traditionalists argue Shiprock is the work of the 'Star People'. Could it be they know more about it than our consensus scientists do? We can use this butte and the surrounding landscape to discuss how such features were actually formed by lightning in the distant past when lightning was a 'Thunderbolt of the Gods'. But first, let's look at some of the absurdities in consensus theory concerning its formation. Shiprock does (not) sit near a region of true volcanic activity. Northern Arizona has volcanoes along the Mogollon Rim that lie to the South and West of the Four Corners region. This is part of a super-volcanic complex much like Yellowstone. Yet Shiprock itself, and a number of similar formations are well removed from those volcanic fields, standing alone on the high desert plains. They are attributed to an ancient volcanic complex called the Navajo Volcanic Field but are not surrounded by lava flows, ash deposits, or any other features provably volcanic in origin. In fact, for these to be considered the throats of ancient volcanoes, the consensus assumes it formed 2,500 to 3,000 feet below Earth's surface and became exposed after millions of years of erosion. In other words, 3,000 feet of vertical surface lands had to be completely eroded away, leaving just the butte poking out of the flat, sandstone desert floor. Shiprock is 1,500 feet of broken rock, meaning 1,500 feet of surrounding plateau washed away, in addition to the 3,000 feet of overburden, along with the lava fields, ash deposits and other traces of volcanic field, without washing away the butte. Let's just say that it's hard to conceive how wind and water could have washed across the land carrying away trillions of tons of other rock but left this shard standing. It's not made of kryptonite. It's no harder than the surrounding sandstone. Exposed to millions of years of such abuse, it would have dissolved like a popsicle in an Arizona summer. Nor is there any evidence of how, or where this material disappeared to. There's no deposit of silts, or remains of past river channels, anywhere in the western hemisphere to provide evidence of this. How any river or inland sea could have washed the land away without a trace, leaving these 'volcanic plugs' is a mystery that the consensus can only explain by invoking billions of years. It's the only excuse they know and they feel it safe as long as they ignore the Electric Universe. Shiprock and its neighboring buttes are made of sandstone and a similar material called Minette. Minette is chemically the same as the surrounding stone except it is highly potassic and apparently fused together by heat. The composition of the rock is not hard, highly compressed, or consolidated such that it could withstand the kind of flood waters required to wash away the surrounding land. Nor is it like any rock we can witness being produced by volcanoes today. A more plausible and responsible theory is that they were made the way the Navajo say it was made. In part two of 'Lightning-Scarred Earth', we'll look closer at Shiprock and other features caused by lightning, and their role in mountain building. Thank you.

You've just entered the theater of an alien sky. If the words and images seem strange to you, there's a reason for this. Our world was once a vastly different place. To experience this won't hurt you, and there is nothing to fear. The Labyrinth Window to the Ancient Archetypes In previous Discourses, we followed multiple paths of evidence to describe the mythic labyrinth, the dancing ground of the legendary mother goddess and warrior hero. Our claim has been that this enigmatic theme has its archetypal origins in extraordinary celestial phenomena. Events did not occur down here on any local landscape but in the sky, in the original theater of the gods. And so, as we gain insight into the most fundamental archetypes, we unavoidably encounter the phenomenon of localization, a universal aspect of storytelling in ancient times but only rarely discussed in modern day treatments of mythic traditions. Localization refers to the ancient habit of projecting the original mythic archetypes on the familiar and accessible local landscapes, to the extent that a thousand local symbols came to be confused with the celestial forms and events of the original myth-making epoch. Every sacred mountain on Earth, named after a cosmic prototype, came to be remembered as a place where the Creator God himself stood in primeval times. Every sacred city came to be celebrated as the city of heaven, the original dwelling of the gods. This pattern of confusion was repeated thousands of times around the world, the later symbol came to be seen as the thing originally symbolized, and that's the pervasive mistake we're required to recognize and to unravel in any investigation of mythic origins. As for later symbolic elaborations, a good example is the appearance of commemorative knotwork, the connection fitting perfectly with our earlier identification of the labyrinth as the original Gordian knot. In seeking out the later echoes of the mythic theme, many useful clues will be found in the symbolic knotwork of Ireland and Scandinavia, with striking parallels in the labyrinth. I'm now fully satisfied that at root, the two mythic threads arose from precisely the same human experience. And so, it's no coincidence that familiar themes we've covered in these Discourses, show up in the complex knotwork of Northern Europe. From entwining twin serpents to the symbolism of the ram's horns. The labyrinth and sacred knotwork also overlap in the Chinese image of the Pan Chang called the endless knot or knot of happiness and here too we discover that the knotwork theme can't be separated from the mythic intestines of the labyrinth. Chinese legends described the entwined Pan Chang as a knot formed from the intestines of a slain enemy. All of which remind us again of the so called Fortress of Intestines to which Humbaba, the enemy slain by Gilgamesh, gave his name. As we've discovered so consistently, it's when seeming absurdities fall into line with an inherently logical expectation, that we know we're on the right track. I should hasten to add that the most common association of the labyrinth revealed by cross-cultural comparison was with the famous cave or cavern entered by the hero, as we should also expect. Dorothy Norman in her book "The Hero" writes, "In those cases where the ritual has been preserved, the labyrinth itself, or a drawing of it, is invariably situated at the entrance of the cave or dwelling." Of course, that pattern is entirely logical if the labyrinth entered by the hero meant precisely the same thing as the famous cavern of the hero's initiation. And so our conclusion; the predicted symbolic equations noted here can be fully verified by any independent researcher who will follow the available keys. The hero bound within a knot, as observed by the comparative symbolists Chevalier and Gheerbrant, is equivalent to the hero being swallowed by the monster, another universal motif, and so the disgorging of the hero by the monster is simply a variant on untying the knot, signifying at the same time the god's release and the defeat of the Chaos monster. So the labyrinth is a challenge to the hero and conceptually it's only a short distance to the mythic riddle or paradox, a common folklore variant of the critical juncture in the biography of the hero for his victory is synonymous with meeting a test. In other words, the test turns out to be the critical turn in the biography of the hero, meaning that it gives the hero his defining role. When Oedipus answered the riddle of the Sphinx correctly, what happened next? He was not only saved, but the devouring goddess plunged over the precipice. Among those comparative symbolists who discovered the essential connections, though certainly not accounted for them, I would list J.C. Cooper who writes in "An Illustrated Encyclopedia Of Traditional Symbols", "The labyrinth is related to the symbolism of the cave and with initiation rites, it also shares the symbolism of the knot in binding and loosing, restricting but uniting... The labyrinth in a square depicts the four cardinal points and the cosmos and may be connected with the swastika." Yes indeed, the very symbolic relationships we've already noted, but while Cooper's summary of associated symbols is generally accurate, it offers no clue at all on the origins of the pervasive labyrinth archetype. For us that is a giant shortcoming, since uncovering the integral origins of world mythology is our overriding purpose. But now we can confidently say that the labyrinth theme did not arise from anything in today's familiar natural experience. The cavernous form was entirely celestial, towering over humanity. Of course, that's been our message all along; it's only by seeing the named mythic powers as planets close to Earth, that we're able to bring the global patterns to light. And as we're now prepared to demonstrate, that means a concrete explanation for all of the acknowledged archetypal personalities of world mythology, a coherent ancient story unfolding in an extraordinary phase of solar system history. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info The following presentation is an adaptation of the Mel Acheson, Thunderbolts Picture of the Day article, 'Back to Basics', the link to the article may be found in the description box of this video. Newton, Einstein, Darwin and the other early explorers of science, discovered the new world of fundamental laws of reality and the scientists will come after them are mere colonists. Continuing this line of thought, John Horgan writes in the end of science that the late comers have only two choices, to apply those fundamental discoveries in the construction of derivative theories or "...to pursue science in a speculative post empirical mode that I call ironic science... Ironic science offers points of view, opinions, which are, at best, interesting, which provoke further a comment. But it doesn't converge on the truth. It cannot achieve empirically verifiable surprises that forced scientists to make substantial revisions in their basic description of reality." Horgan classifies most modern theories as ironic science. Super string theory and the inflationary Big Bang, and punctuated equilibrium. This interesting opinion provokes me to make a couple of further comments a "basic description" of reality is not the same thing as fundamental laws. Fundamental laws or generalities reality is concrete. A description of reality asserts among other things which fundamental law applies in which real situation. Between the laws and reality lies the description in which scientists select which laws to apply. The accepted description of reality in astronomy asserts that only the law of gravity applies in space. The law can be Newton's or it can be Einsteins, but it cannot be Darwin's law of evolution. A description of astronomical reality based on Darwin's law probably wouldn't make any sense. But the point is that one law is selected and another is not. Even the particle physicists who lately have invaded astronomy select only certain fundamental laws on which to construct their basic description of atomic reality. This business of selection is so simple as to be not worth mentioning. But not mentioning it leads to not paying attention to it which leads to skipping over it in the occasional circumstance when it may be important. My next comment of course is that it's important now. Horrigan and the scientists he interviewed for his book have overlooked a deeper irony. While the theories of ironic science have been unable to "achieve empirically verifiable surprises". Experimental and observational science has produced a flood of them. Nearly every discovery of the space age from the Van Allen radiation belts around the earth to the high velocity winds around Neptune has been pronounced as a surprise. And the surprises have been surprising precisely because they haven't verified the prevailing basic description of reality. One might think a reasonable plan in this circumstance would be to take a second look at the fundamental laws selected for one's description. One doesn't have to resort to anything as ridiculous as consider in Darwin's law. For instance the laws of electromagnetism have been lying around for over a century mostly ignored except by a few electrical engineers because you "can't get charged separation in space". The problem is that scientists are like the horse led to water, neither the failure of ironic science to achieve empirical surprises nor the failure of achieved empirical surprises to verify the accepted description can force scientists to drink basic provisions if they don't want to. Selection is the result of wanting to choose and if you want to defend a theory you can always find expedient excuses. Almost nothing outside the solar system and a lot of things inside it don't obey either Einstein's or Newton's law of gravity. e.g. The stars in the arms of spiral galaxies revolving about the same velocity instead of slowing down with distance as gravity predicts. To make these observations fit the gravitational description of reality astronomers have chosen to hedge the fundamental law with a thicket of ironic opinions and points of view that are not empirical. There might be appropriately configured halos of unseen dark matter outside the galaxies that produce the observed velocities. This avoids the necessity of questioning fundamentals, but it turns the basic description of reality into an imaginative fantasy that is explanatory but neither verifiable nor falsifiable. Modern theories with appropriate adjustments can explain everything and anything just as psychoanalysis with childhood trauma. The dark matter of the mind can explain any behavior. However the point of science is not merely to explain, but to find out which explanation is actually the case. For that you need more than one explanation from which to choose. This object might be a black hole, that object might be dark matter, having disallowed competition from fundamentally different theories. There's no way to tell if those objects might be something else. Verification alone is inadequate. You need to search for alternatives and to test them to gain reliability. Planting more hedges of ad-hoc hypotheses around the fundamental law of gravity may appeal to ironic scientists. But other scientists mostly outside astronomy are more inclined toward empirical results. The new field of plasma cosmology has admitted Maxwell's laws of electromagnetism to the description of astronomical reality. The properties of electrical discharges applied to the phenomena of space by such pioneers as Birkeland, Langmuir and Alfvén explained the new discoveries without ironic fantasies. The revised description expects the observations that are surprising to the standard gravity only version. And this electrical description is directly verifiable in plasma labs. Dark matter and 10 dimensional super strings are not. The reality we think we see is constantly being revised by what we actually see of a partially known reality. Usually the revisions are superficial, but there have been times in the history of thought when the revisions have reached to the basics. Plasma cosmology hasn't discovered a new fundamental law it merely replaces one law - gravity - with another - electromagnetism - but the effect on the basic description of astronomical reality is as great as if a new law had been discovered. We think we see an entirely new reality this shouldn't be a surprise! The Space Age has brought substantial revisions in instrumentation allowing us to sense the entire electromagnetic spectrum. From radio wavelengths to gamma wavelengths. For the first time in human history we are not restricted to an anthropocentric sensory viewpoint. The Space Age has also brought substantial revisions in location allowing us to sense the cosmos from positions off the Earth's surface. For the first time in human history, we are not restricted to a geocentric positional viewpoint. We should expect these revisions in basic viewpoint to be accompanied by a revision in the basic description of the reality viewed. The ultimate irony would be that in the face of our liberation from an anthropocentric and geocentric viewpoint. We would be unable or unwilling to liberate ourselves from a traditional way of thinking about reality. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info In part 1 of this presentation, Electric Geology, investigator Robert Hawthorne explored the stupendous geological feature in the American Southwest known as Upheaval Dome. As Robert explained, while standard geology favors the interpretation that Upheaval Dome was created by a kinetic impact, the hypothesis that the feature was created by interplanetary lightning finds great support in the geological evidence. This includes recent experimental research which shows that chemical changes in rock, normally attributed to impact, such as “shocked quartz” are also produced by powerful lightning. Robert introduced an unusual rock associated with the Upheaval Dome site, called the Obsession Stone, whose discoverers were able to submit the rock for professional chemical analysis. In this conclusion, Robert explains why such analysis only strengthens the electric discharge hypothesis. I would like to talk about analcime now and this is a picture of analcime from Wikipedia and you can see that it kind of resembles a golf ball- shaped, white, milky white kind of spheres with trapezohedronal faces on them, according to their crystal structure. However, when we got to show you the picture of the Obsession Stone, you'll see that it's quite different. But analcime is classified as a zeolite. That means, ”zeo” meaning to boil and “lighting” or “lite” mean rock, and the Cassidy and Zolensky letters mentioned previously, suggest a secondary processing of the mineral where all the strata layers in the stone were processed in this manner. That was something that I wanted to try and find out. Because like I said, we have multiple rocks at different colors and luster, and then in these graphs here, I just show that, these are the X-ray diffraction of the purple sample, the rock that was in the previous slide. This is the result of that sample. If you were to look at the bottom X-axis line, that is your angle, your two- theta angle and that's what they measure and if you can imagine, like a substrate or just like basically any flat surface, and you aim an X-ray at it, the beam should actually reflect off like an angle on - angle off- kind of principle. But if you were to imagine the ray actually penetrating the substrate and continuing on through in a straight line, and reference that to the actual reflected angle, that is actually your two-theta angle. And that's what they actually measure in X-ray diffraction. And the intensity of that beam that's absorbed, that's how they understand your charts here. So, on the results chart, you have listed in numerical order, from first to last, all the peaks that are listed. And then you have in the column below that, you have your intensities that are ranked which one is the tallest, all the way down to the lowest. And from there they actually do their calculations and that's what they came up with, is the analcime calcite. I though wanted to go a little bit further and try to prove that the multiple layers had this electrical discharge machining performed on multiple layers, simply because of the different colors of the rocks that we have. So, I was given the opportunity, while I was attending the Salt Lake Community College enrolled in their electronics engineering program, one of my classes offered a microscopy lab. So, I was given the opportunity to take these samples, and again, I took two samples, one purple and one brown and put it under the scanning electron microscope. And here are the results. This first one is from the brown sample and I found this one rather peculiar because it had like this brush stroke, or a paint swath that's made almost entirely of molybdenum. And I to this day, I have not been able to research if they have any kind of traces of molybdenum in that area of southern Utah. That's kind of when people always asked me about if a possible transmutation has occurred. I'd like to say that, according to the NASA paper, that they can't really tell what the original mineralogy was. But did an actual transmutation occur? I really can't say, because I don't have that kind of technology to perform such a test. But I could say that molybdenum in these traces and in the next couple slides you're going to see, trace amounts of elements that are in there, aren't really dominant in the area of southern Utah. And this graph is just the Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, or EDS. And this is the chart, just similar to the X-ray diffraction, but this uses the spectral line of the element itself, and that's what it reads. So, your bottom X-axis here is your energy readout from the spectral line, and each number is a signal to the actual element that it belongs to. So, you can see here the results that you got. You have your sodium, aluminum, silicon are rather dominant, and your oxygen. But then you also have your calcium and your carbon and your oxygen which is your calcite. It's just that one part of molybdenum that’s just sitting there, which I wanted to use this for. In this picture is just the distribution of all these elements and their concentrations in our area. Now move on to the purple sample that I used. Actually, I did take a lot of samples, but like you can see in these images, there's just a lot of gray dots and stuff. It's when you come across something white and reflective, that you kind of want to focus on because it's something interesting. So, as in here, you can see that this is a purple sample and there's a lot more elements in this sample than in the previous one, but it still has the dominant analcime features with calcite. However, this also has some iron, some potassium, looks like ruthenium and tantalum in it. And again, here's your EDS chart. Distribution of the elements, there is quite a lot of them in this one. That's one of the reasons why I use this. Oh, I also took a third image. This one had some tantalum and some indium in it as well. This was the other side of the purple, because the purple sample had a fused outer crust, from I guess being scorched. And of the interior I took another sample as well, and this is the interior. Now on the outer fused crust, there was no indium at all in all the places that I looked. But on the interior, there is copious amounts of it, of indium inside. That's why I found it interesting and put it into this report. Again, your EDS chart for the sample, and the distribution of the elements. Tantalum looks like it's just been peppered on. It doesn't look like it's been agglomerated to any other atoms in there. Just dot after dot; there's no really clustering in it at all. Almost with the indium, but it does look like it's a bit concentrated on the left-hand side of the image. So, in conclusion this presentation, I hope, that I made the argument that electrical discharge can form craters and eject material. I hope it has provided evidence that the electrical discharges can generate the temperatures and pressures required to shock quartz crystals, and shown you that fulgurites and a sample from the mineral analcime from Upheaval Dome is presented evidence of electrical discharge do to its properties. And I feel that this presentation has presented the argument which suggests another mechanism for planetary crater formation. Now I'd like to take this time to thank the many people that have helped me with this project. And I would first like to thank again the Thunderbolts staff, Susan Schirott, for giving me this opportunity, especially for being at the Electric Universe conference in 2017. I'd also like to thank the International Multi Conference for Complexity, Informatics and Cybernetics and their staff. I would also like to thank Bruce Leybourne and Andy Hall for their helping me understand electrical discharge theory and how it applies to geological formations. And I'd also like to thank, last but not least, the Salt Lake's Community College's many departments and staff. First, Salt Lake's microscopy lab coordinator, Glen Johnson and my instructor, Wesley Sanders for allowing me to use their labs for this presentation. I would also like to thank Jason Roberts in the writing department for helping me with the editing of this paper and lastly I'd like to thank the Salt Lake print shop for recovering the faded X-ray diffraction papers, because by no means was that an easy task. Thank you. [Music] 
Solar Gravitation and Solar Plasma Wave Propagation Interaction Dr. Ed Dowdye was a popular speaker at the 2012 EU and he's back. An electrical engineer with degrees in mathematics and physics formerly of NASA, the originator of the extinction shift principle, which challenges the general and special theories of relativity, let's welcome Dr. Dowdye to the stage to challenge us a bit. The title of this is a continuation of what I have done before and this talk, we talked about Solar Gravitational Gradient interacts indirectly with Electromagnetic Waves propagating in the solar plasma limb. And when I say the gravitational gradient, for an example, we know very well that when you put up satellites in a deep space you put atomic clocks on-board these systems, in order for the GPS system to work properly, then each one of these platforms that are orbiting about the Earth has to be timed, a time reference has to be onboard the system in order for when you receive a pulse in your vehicle when you're moving on the ground or in the air you know your exact location because when you receive that information from the GPS systems they time-tag it. And the clock running onboard the satellite has to run at the same rate as that on Earth. But the problem here is, when you put these systems in space, the gravitational gradient acts on the atomic clock; and actually the clock on Earth will actually run at a slower rate than the one in space. So let's talk about this. So in the next 19 minutes, I'm just going to give you a split on this. So I'm going to go to the next slide here which is similar to this slide. My title is actually the Solar Gravitational Gradient acting on Electromagnetic Waves. It turns out that the solar gravitational gradient interacts directly with the solar plasma limb, but the solar plasma limb interacts directly with the electromagnetic waves However, the gravitational gradient, the first one, interacts indirectly with the electromagnetic waves. So, that's the gist of what I'm talking about here. And there's enormous evidence for that and relativity, the people who support relativity, are fighting against this. So let's go on to next one. Here's a picture of what I mean in the first two slides. See, you have the solar limb of the Sun and it turns out that the solar limb of the Sun contains hot plasma gases. We've been talking about plasma all day here and partly yesterday. The plasma is actually totally ionized, ionized at the Sun. The ionized limb of the Sun is such that the particles in this limb ripped off all the electron clouds. So you have only nuclei, positive and negative nuclei. So it's actually a plasma about 5,000º to 6,000º C. And it turns out that that plasma limb is being acted on by the gravitational gradient of the Sun. And it has a gravitational profile, and when light propagates through that or microwaves, or whatever wave propagates through it, you can determine the path of the waves propagating through that. And there's a calculation that allows you to get that. And what happens, this plasma limb of the Sun acts directly on the electromagnetic waves propagating along the minimum energy path. It turns out that you send your students, you get your students’ assignment in undergraduate and graduate classes and you guys you know this, because I'm preaching to the choir here, you talk about the minimum energy path, or the least-time path for waves propagating in an atmosphere, or some medium, along a minimum energy path. And it would be defined by the gravitational gradient field of the Sun. And it turns out that the gravitational gradient field of the Sun interacts only indirectly with the electromagnetic waves. So it's going and we see what we're talking about here. Here we find out, if you go above the Sun or solar limb in space, going above that solar limb as long as you're in the limb there's bending taking place in the limb. But above that several of even a fraction of a solar radius or many solar radii above it, it turns out that electromagnetic waves propagates in the plasma free space, the space where you have no plasma at all, there is no bending. And these light rays are going along a straight line pair So the next slide, continuing on, Showing a picture again you have the solar limb and it turns out, you have the Sun, the radius of the Sun proximately, what is it, 600 or 650,000 km radius. So actually what happens above the solar limb and beyond that, engulfing almost all the planets orbiting about the Sun, there is an electron profile that's known as the solar wind. I want to talk about that later on, very briefly, because we only have very [little] time here. So what's happening if you have a satellite system, a system moving down, if I can have a pointer, and I'll point to you what is meant. I point here, going down, let's say you have a system moving down, a satellite system moving down, it could be the Earth or planet moving from here on down. What happened, this system contains antennas on board. And the antennas are such that they're spread apart so you can have a wide beam; what is called a wide-beam interferometer, a wide-beam interferometer system. And this system will detect the rays of light coming from a distant source and this distant source is so far over here that these rays are almost parallel to one another. And what happens when one of those rays interacts with the solar plasma of the Sun, there's bending that takes place. And in a star, like the Sun, that has one solar mass and (is) one solar radius, will bend 1.75 arc seconds. So that's just bending down 1.750 arc seconds okay, and those at the other side of the Sun would bend up. So it turns out, that it's bending such that the Sun acts like a lens. And it acts pretty much like a lens here, if you go far enough away from that, way out here someplace, these rays will come together and come to a focus. But that's a long distance, let's talk about that later on. But what's taking place here, you can detect the bending: this one would bend up and this one would bend down, but in the middle here there is no field. And so this information is coming from this distant source. It could be a radio source, or some satellite system, or a distant quasar system that is emitting actual microwaves, these rays are noticed to bend. And the astrophysicists have measured always this 1.75 arc seconds. However, there has been no information up here at all, or down here. That means the bending always take place at the plasma limb of the Sun. That is in itself a direct violation of General Relativity. And there's enormous evidence for that and I'll show you, the evidence this can take place after this. Let's take a look at what we mean by gravitational gradient. If you look at the gravitational gradient of the Earth in comparison to that of the Sun. If you look at the Sun for an example, if you are just above the surface of the Sun, there is a gravitational potential, a very strong gravitational potential. And if you’re over here up above, you go to 0.38 Astronomical Units (AU) and 0.72 AU there you have Mercury and you have Venus, and at 1.0 AU there's the planet Earth. On the Earth's surface it turns out that the gravitational potential of the Sun is almost a factor of 14 times greater than that of the gravitational potential of the Earth. But that is the gravitational potential of the Sun; this yellow line indicates the gravitational potential of the Sun. However, that little box where you have the Earth 1.00 AU if I blow that box up. I have the planet Earth here and you calculate what is known as the gravitational potential of the Earth. The green line represents the gravitational potential of the Earth, but down below you have, blown up in this box, the gravitational potential of the Sun, indicated by the yellow line down below, that's 14 times greater than that of the [Earth]. But it's not the gravitational potential that we are concerned about; we are concerned about the gravitational gradient, not the gravitational potential. The gravitational gradient is the key here. So let's take a look at this next slide. If you note the gravitational potential of the Sun and the Earth at any given point in space the Sun always wins over. But the gravitational potential gradient, that’s a different story. But you have the Sun, the gravitational potential of the Sun, is equal to approximately 14.14 times that of the gravitational potential of the Earth. That's key, keep that in mind. Next we look at the gravitational potential gradient. If you calculate the gravitational potential gradient, what you have to do is take the first derivative of the Sun, the gravitational potential of the Sun along its Z axis, and Z coming from the Sun where you have the radius of the Sun is 1 AU, the radius of the orbit of the Earth is 1 AU, if you look at that at the Earth, right? you'll find that that is much smaller than the gravitational potential of Earth along a radial path which is the radius of the Earth. So that's significant because you find that why is it that atomic clocks run slower, when you put the atomic clock in space, than on Earth. It turns out the moon has a profound effect on the Earth's tidal effect. The tidal effect causes the waters to stand up on a hill (slope) when the moon passes above the Earth. It is the moon that wins over, when it comes to gravitational gradient of the moon, (it) is greater than the gravitational gradient of the Sun. However, the gravitational gradient of the Earth is far more than that. So, going on to the next slide, I'm going to try to sum this up in the next ten minutes. So, making a picture short, taking the Sun, the gravitational gradient plasma limb of the Sun, you'll find that history for the last 100 years now, the scientists have been able to measure light-bending of the stars in the gravitational limb of the Sun. But if relativity were factual, according to General Relativity, light-bending should be everywhere where you have gravitation. But that is not the case. The scientists who support relativity, this is bad news for them. They don't want you to know about this. So this next slide, this is the prediction of General Relativity. Relativity says there's bending at the limb of Sun. At the limb of the Sun you have 1.75 arc seconds bending, but above that, if you go a radius or twice the solar radius above that, the bending should be one-half of that. In other words it is one half of 1.75 seconds, or possibly 0.85 arc seconds. And above that, 3 solar radii above that, it's 1/3 and then you get 1/4, 1/5 and so forth, that's General Relativity. But what happens here is that relativity fails this experiment. So you take the great General Relativity equation which is the light bending or 4GM/Rc², that is the bending predicted by General Relativity, and in units of a radians. You can convert that to arc seconds, but 2π radians is 360º and 1º is 3600 arc seconds. You work out the mathematics: that first equation will get you 1.755 arc seconds. But you take the Earth and the Sun, the mass of the Sun and let that be M, and no matter what the potential, what the density of that mass happens to be, using Gauss’s law, you should get exactly the same bending. So using Gauss’s method, you can find a lot of objects out in deep space where relativity has failed. And going forth, we can use the principle of reciprocity and the principle of Gauss showing these two principles that are in textbooks all over planet now. We teach this stuff in astrophysics and general physics, undergraduate physics, the students are learning this stuff; however they're not tying it down to the failure of General Relativity. They keep that silent. So this is our job, to point this out to these guys. You point out the failure of relativity. So going forth and summarizing what I just talked about: you have three different masses, if these masses are the same, they could be more dense, enclosed within a Gaussian sphere, they come up with the same light bending and the optical reciprocity is illustrated here. So let me move fast, and this summarizes what I just talked about in the previous slide. So I’m just going to move forth if I'd ever summarize this in the next couple of days if you want a summary on this. So let's look at this, summarizing again the principle of reciprocity what we just talked about. If you have bending of a star, and so you have a star that is a distance beyond the mass that's responsible for light bending, and you observe at the telescope you should not see, according to General Relativity, you will not see a point light source. In other words, you should see bending all around. And this is looking at it in two dimensions; looking at in two dimensions you see the bending for light coming from the star bending up and then going down to the telescope. The light beam could also go in the other direction and go down first and then bend up toward the telescope. If that happens according to the prediction of General Relativity, the observer should see an Einstein ring. And the Einstein ring should be visible in the time you have this picture. So let's go forth and take toll of what we have here. I decided to put in picture an animation of what actually takes place. When you have a distant light source out in deep space, and that light source could be a red light source, and where you have photons of light, or wave packets coming from light, (if you don't need the word ’photon’, we can use ‘wave packets’), or we can use just ‘emissions’ of optical waves coming from a red light source. And if in the center between that light source and our telescope, there is some object in the center, that according to General Relativity could cause bending of light, that light should be reflected or amplified, or actually magnified, by the massive light source halfway in between, and the observers should see in that case an Einstein ring. And down below, just below the observer and his telescope, this is what the observer should be seeing in his telescope. He should see a red ring around that red X, instead of seeing a point light source. So let me move on and try to summarize this as we go past. The main key here is the gravitational light bending as a function of the impact parameter in plasma free vacuum space. This is the main thing we want to talk about here. So what I did, we talked about the light bending as a function of the impact parameter. The smallest impact parameters you can have would be the exact radius of the Sun. So I can go to 2 solar radius, or I can go to 3 solar radius, or 4 solar radius, or 5 solar radius. If you go on beyond, the light bending should get less and less. So let's take a look and see what we have here. So you take a look at what the reality tells us. For the last 100 years of observation, we have observed virtually no bending at all of a star light, beyond the solar limb of the Sun. So you go back and look at relativity again, relativity predicts bending, whether you are at the solar rim or beyond the solar rim: However, the reality tells us this: the impact parameter, beyond the Sun there is no bending whatsoever. Here relativity has a problem. so looking at this, summarizing what we are seeing in the picture, the solar limb of the Sun causes 1.75 seconds of bending, while there's no bending above that. So if we take a look at the light bending, as reality tells us, in deep space modern astronomy shouldn’t tbe able to explain this at all. So we have 2R, 3R or 4R, nR, there should be a bending always, according to General Relativity. So, and going back again what we talked about, if the Sun bends light rays, and it has always been the dream of some astrophysicists to go into deep space and take a spacecraft and travel out and find a point in space where the Sun bends light rays and they come to a point. It turns out that you take the 1.75 arcsec and the radius of the Sun and go out beyond in space, you should go at least 550 AU that is 550 times the orbital radius of Earth. And that's not likely right now, because of the space program we have right now. It's not a silent isn't it maybe in sometime in the future I'm not going to be here, maybe my kids or your kids. We need some of you guys younger than I am. You will be here. So that's not going to happen right now. So here is the data. For the past couple of years I have managed to publish some papers in a refereed journal, calculating the impact parameter at the solar radius. You calculate a minimum energy path; you find then an equation that will tell you at one solar radius what the bending would be. And I come up with the very same equation as General Relativity, but it has nothing to do with General Relativity at all. So let's go forth  and I might try to summarize this in the next 5 minutes and I'm done. There's a principle known as the Shapiro Delay and Shapiro was a scientists who used Mariner satellites that were put up by the government, and they used microwave transmission in communication with these Mariners satellites. And we had orbited around Venus. There are some orbiting satellites around Venus and when I was at NASA I had a neodymium YAG laser and one of my projects got canceled. These guys took my laser and used it at the astronomical observatory to try to hit Venus with that microwave neodymium YAG laser. I had this 1,000 milli Joule YAG laser, and people wouldn't come in my lab because they were afraid this energy would burn a hole through. They used the same laser to cut steel. So I was working in this lab and my boss told me if I had an accident that they just would take the body and do away it. So this guy didn't care about me at all. So I had this laser, this guy took the laser and tried to hit Venus with this laser beam, right? And what happened, you can always hit these planets with a microwave beam, right? It turns out when you go past the Sun and try to hit a planet out in the solar system, what happens, they found out that microwaves will always have a delay. When you get close to the Sun the delay would be on the order of a millisecond. That's a drastic mistake. What happens, it turns out that this delay is a function of the microwave frequency however, for shorter wavelengths or microwave links at higher frequencies you get more delay. So let's go forth and to summarize this picture, I'm gonna summarize this, and then I will be done. What happens with the microwave, you'll get a delay, with the Shapiro effect. However, microwaves that came in the limb of the Sun, you'll get light-bending This is what happens with microwaves. The question here is, if Einstein is correct then, where are the Einstein Rings? If you have many stars out in the star-filled skies at night, you see all these stars right? And many of those stars are pretty much like our Sun. So as we know, all these stars have a plasma rim associated with it. And if there is (any) light bending whatsoever, we should see Einstein rings all over the sky. It's not here, it's not there, so the question is, where are they. So reality tells us that light rays are passing by these stars in deep space where there's no plasma. So there's no bending of the light at all. So let's go forth  and I'll just skip this part about the mathematics and you can see me, this is on my website, so you can go to the mathematics that I calculated the solar minimum-energy path and the light bending, coming up with this equation that general relativity used. Just a derivation of the same equation of relativity, without relativity. This is bad news for those guys. So here's the major event that's going on at the center of our galaxy known as Sagittarius A this device, whatever this thing is, is estimated at about four million times the mass of the solar system. So what happens is, there’s orbiting stars about this thing, about 17 some stars orbiting about this thing all along Kepler paths. This has been observed for the last, probably 20 years now. And this star, S2 is now on its second orbit, almost a perfect elliptical path about this thing, where the red X is. There’s this super massive object there and there's no light bending in this thing at all. This is bad news for relativity; so what (would) happen if relativity were factual? This is what you should see. You should see light amplification or light scattering somewhere around, according to the textbooks. if relativity were actually the case, this Sagittarius A should look pretty much like that. You don't see this. So therefore, where (are) the Einstein rings and where is the scattering? You don't see it and this is what's in the textbook: a star orbiting about a black hole should be amplified when it passes behind the black hole. You don't see that, you see it in the textbooks, but you don't see it in space and you don't see it in cosmology. This is what you do see. This is what you see, here you see no bending whatsoever. So, summarizing what I just talked about all this stuff, let's this finish up, just skip over to the summary and conclusion. And in conclusion you have the light scattering and light bending according to General Relativity and all these things here. Let's just summarize and then I finish. In summary the gravitational gradient field of the Sun acts only indirectly on the plasma limb of the Sun, and there is no bending whatsoever outside of that. And you take a look at all electromagnetic waves propagating (in space) free of plasma, there’s no bending whatsoever. Even Einstein said in his own words, quoting Einstein, he said if the velocity of light does depend on the velocity of the light source, then all my theories are wrong. So I'm quoting him right now [reads the German text], ”If the velocity of light is even only a tiny bit dependent on the velocity of the light source, then my whole theory is wrong”. That’s what he said. I just use his own words, okay? And this is Einstein, okay? This is it. 
You have just entered the theater of an alien sky. If the words and images seem strange to you, there's a reason for this. Our world was once a vastly different place. To experience this won't hurt you and there is nothing to fear. The City of Heaven When exploring ancient myths and symbols the first rule is to follow recurrent themes back to their earliest occurrence. That means as close as possible to the original provocation in the natural world. At the dawn of the great civilizations, what natural events occurred with such impact on humanity as to produce an explosion of storytelling, obsessive reenactments and monumental construction? Uncovering that catalyst becomes essential and there's no other way to make sense of the vast human response in ancient times. The greatest challenge the researcher will face is the confusion of surface detail. There were far too many cultural interpretations and elaborations, too many self-promoting cultural claims, all leading to fragmentation of the archetypes. By localizing the stories the ancient chroniclers could only introduce a flood of regional contradictions as every culture asserted its own special place in the stories told. A good example of this fragmentation occurs with the historical emergence and evolution of the archetypal Primeval City, the mythical homeland affirmed by so many cultures the world over. We introduced that theme in our previous segment on the Atlantis myth, a story with a hundred claimed origins in different parts of the world. Though no one disputes the primeval city archetype, the critical question is too frequently missed. Why the persistent connection of the sacred city to the story of creation and its subsequent catastrophic destruction? In fact, it's this very connection that confirms a global archetype beneath the surface confusion of localized variations. We see the paradox in the creation myths of ancient Egypt for example, where certain foundational concepts persisted for thousands of years. Every sacred city in Egypt identified itself with the celestial world created in the beginning. But what did that mean? Despite their diversity, the regional myths converge on a special place, a land said to have emerged from an undifferentiated prior condition in the creation. That primordial environment meant no visible stars, no Sun or Moon, just a diffuse glow most often reported as all-encompassing waters of chaos. Always remember that the condition so often translated as chaos did not convey any modern sense of agitation or something out of control. The literal meaning was the absence of any discernable activity and any discernible form. Egyptian priests repeatedly declared that in the Zep Tepi, the first occasion or first time, the island of beginnings arose from the celestial waters and all Egyptian traditions agree that it was this remembered creation that gave to humanity a model for sacred construction on Earth. In fact, every temple and every city identified itself with a prototype. It was in the Zep Tepi that the wandering creator Atum found his resting place and from that place the drama of creation began with the triangular or pyramidal form of the Benben stone at the center and summit of the sky. From the first appearance of Atum as the Benben, the work of creation progressively unfolded with the emergence of the island of creation. It was through this collective memory that ancient kingship rites could name the Creator himself as the exemplary ancestor, the first in the line of Kings, "I came into being of myself in the midst of the primeval waters." The god states in the Book of the Dead or the God declares: "I was alone in the primeval waters" or again: "I had no companion when my name came into existence." By following this theme to its roots we can see the critical distinction between the ancient symbol and the celestial reference symbolized. The original act or object was cosmic while the symbol was its commemorative expression locally. The irony is that by virtue of the inherited symbolism, every sacred land or sacred place proclaimed itself to be the original location. By this identification the Creator could be said to have stood on the very spot of the local temple or City. You can see this in the titles of cult centers from Heliopolis to Memphis, from Hermopolis to Edfu or Thebes. Each celebrated its own special identity with creation leading to multiple variants of a single underlying memory as in this declaration of The Coffin Texts, "The Great God lives, fixed in the middle of the sky ...dweller in the city." The cosmic city is the primeval place symbolically duplicated throughout Egypt, "I have come to this city, the region of the first time, to be a dweller in the land," The Texts say. Thus the Egyptians invoke a celestial Memphis, "the divine emerging primeval island" a celestial Thebes, "The island emerging in Nun," the cosmic waters "which first came into being." A celestial Hermonthes, "The high ground which grew out of Nun" a celestial Elephantine called "The city in the midst of the waters" and a celestial Abydos, "The Ta Ur, the primeval 'Great Land' rising from the same cosmic waters." So too, Chinese tradition declared the local Kingdom to be a copy of the celestial Empire and each capital city imitated the same plan. The integrated symbolism even when growing complex never departs from the underlying idea of a visible place or land, the first form of the created world emerging from a primeval ocean. Of course, as we've seen so many times, the localization of an archetype invariably introduced regional contradictions even as the archetypal substructure persisted across the millennia. The ancient memory of a lost island preserved around the world consistently harked back to a prior age, an age of innocence and wonder. For the Greeks this was the age of the first sovereign Kronos whom the Romans knew as their own ancient ruler Saturn. Here are the words of the Latin poet Dionysius of Halicarnassus, "Haste to the realms of Saturn shape your course, where Cotyle's famed island wandering floats." The cross-cultural accord is remarkable. Japanese legends recall the ancient cradle of life as a floating island called "the drifting land" congealing out of the primeval waters. Its original location was said to be the North Pole later localized to become Japan. That's the localization of the cosmic archetype. So too, the legendary floating island of Delos which Poseidon stabilized by his cosmic trident. Pointing to the same archetype would be the floating islands of the Argonautica, called the Strophades, or "Islands of Turning." In the voyages of the Celtic divine hero Maeldhuin the adventurer encounters a fabulous Isle in the midst of the sea "Around the island was a fiery rampart" "And it was ever wont to turn around and about it." Examples are plentiful, all reinforcing our most fundamental claim that every archetype stands as a contradiction of our natural world. The primeval revolving islands of Rhodes or Corcyra, spun on the cosmic spindle. The primeval Isle of the Cyclos, the wheel, which gave its name to the Cyclades. The white island of Zeus in the midst of the sea. The floating Hindu white island Shwetadvipa located at the axial center of the sky. The lost Toltec white island of Tula, also called the center of the world. That is the fundamental quality of the Sumerian Ekur, the "pure land" or "great land" always venerated as the model or prototype and we see the same exemplary role in the Assyrian Esara, the "supreme place" founded by the gods, remarkably similar to the pure land of the buddhist. Rather than familiar geography, the terminology always takes us back to the place of mythic origins subsequently localized through commemorative practices. The greatest mistake a researcher could make is to confuse the original inspiration or first form with its local symbol. No mythic archetype has ever been explained by a local experience but with that reminder it's also worth noting that the historical localization of universal traditions by bringing the gods down to Earth was the primary means by which humanity consecrated and passed on the archetypes across the millennia. And that is why in our comparative study we are invariably led to the universal substructure of storytelling the world over. In the process, we observe how through localization of an inherited story every tribe and every nation asserted its own identity as the children of the creator himself. What then is this connection telling us? As we've repeatedly observed, it was intensely remembered events that gave each culture its sense of divine origin, its mythic connection to the gods and it's this connection that requires us to follow localized mythology back to the archetype of creation itself. The truth is that a single archaic idea could never confirm a cause in human experience but the existence of just one archetype does pose the question of cause and how will we address that question as we encounter hundreds of archetypes all connected to each other in an underlying agreement of the ancient cultures. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info. In Part 1 of this presentation, Thunderbolts contributor Andrew Hall explored the role of electrical discharges in earthly volcanism. Hall compared the physical characteristics of volcanic fields, called the Maars of Pinacate, with strikingly similar features on the moon and found in both evidence for high-energy electrical discharges. In this episode, Hall considers the evidence to be found in earthly volcanism for the electrical circuitry connecting the Earth and the Sun. [Andrew Hall] In Part 1 of the Maars of Pinacate [Thunderblog,] we looked at rim craters and their resemblance to craters on the moon. In Part 2, we'll ask the question: If lightning can occur in the sky why not in the ground? A capacitor stores electrical charge up to a point and then lets go, like a dam breaking. It's called dielectric breakdown, and sparks are the result. Sparks are the flood of current through the dam. Lightning is one example of a spark we've all seen, but there are several types of electrical discharge to consider. Each type represents a flow of current, electrons and/or ions in an electric field. What primarily differentiates the type of discharge are polarity and surface features of the electrodes, the voltage and current density, and the medium the current travels through. Our atmosphere carries an electric field. The atmospheric field varies widely - from night-to-day and summer-to-winter: between 100 volts per meter vertically in clear weather, to orders of magnitude stronger during thunderstorms. Normally the atmosphere carries a minor fair weather current of one picoamp per square meter. This tiny current is thought to be a return current caused by lightning around the world, diffused throughout the atmosphere. We don't notice what's happening electrically in our atmosphere normally because we live on the Earth’s surface in an equipotential layer. We don't notice, that is, until a thunderstorm arrives. Lightning from a thunderstorm has no ‘electrode’ in the sky. It comes from accumulations of charge in the clouds: pools of electrons or ions, like the accumulated charge on a capacitor plate. Temperature and pressure moved by shearing winds take the place of plates in segregating regions of charge. A study using interferometer and Doppler Radar to correlate lightning with updraft and downdraft winds, showed that lightning avoids the updraft core, and forms in regions of weaker winds around the updraft. As a storm intensifies and the updraft speeds up, lightning frequency dramatically intensifies around the updraft. James Dye, researcher on the study from the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, said the findings were a surprise. The massive accumulation of charge in thunderstorms is believed by consensus science to result from static build-up caused by ice formation and collisions in the fast updraft region, so they expected to see lightning there. Instead they found the lightning surrounds this updraft. Consensus science always requires collisions of some sort to explain electrical phenomena. Physical processes such as induction, don't seem to be included in their scientific toolkit. However, fast updraft winds are likely motivated by electric current in the storm in the first place. So, it is not surprising in an electric atmosphere that positive ions in a powerful updraft would collect negative charge around the updraft column, which is where they found lightning to initiate. The study indicates updraft winds won’t produce much lightning until they reach 10 to 20 mph. Then strike frequency escalates with updraft speed. From 20 to 50 mph wind speeds, the lightning frequency might be 5 to 20 strikes per minute, but above 90 mph the flash rate can exceed one strike per second. In a consensus scientist’s minds this can only mean one thing: the ice is colliding faster! But back in the real world, the updraft should be recognized as a current, with faster winds producing higher charge density. In any case, the charged layers in the cloud, and the thin, flashing filament we see in common cloud-to-ground lightning, is only part of the event. There is also a buildup of positive charge on the ground. The ground charge forms as a pool of positive ions over the surface of the land and its features, accumulating in the highest concentration at high points. The positive ions form when electrons are stripped away from air and surface features by the electric field. The lightning bolt initiates when the negative charge invades the air below with filaments of charge called leaders. They zig-zag downward in stepped segments, while the ground charge reaches up in a filament of positive ions called a streamer. When leader and streamer meet, the channel is complete and dumps the negative cloud charge to ground. The ionic ground charge follows, ions being heavy and therefore slower than electrons, rushing up the channel at 60,000 miles per second in what is called a return stroke. It's the return stroke we see emitting light from particle collisions in the channel. Return strokes often repeat as new charge pools and discharges, producing multiple flashes until charges equalize. It all happens very fast. You can't see these charges moving around and pooling, but you can feel it. It's called wind. Another type of lightning is positive lightning from a buildup of layers of positive ions in the tops of thunderclouds, which create arcs more powerful by a factor of 100 than the common lightning between ground and the negatively charged cloud bottom. Positive lightning also travels farther. A typical lightning bolt is about 3 miles long. A storm in Oklahoma produced a record lightning bolt that travelled 200 miles across a blue sky. The longest-lasting lightning was recorded in France at 7.7 seconds. Typically, lightning will pulse several times, but the total duration is less than two-tenths of a second. These record setters show that lightning can scale by orders of magnitude. In fact, we know no limit to how large it can scale. So, what does all this have to do with volcanoes? Lightning is seen not only in thunderstorms but in snow storms, hurricanes, intense forest fires, surface nuclear detonations and, you guessed it, volcanic eruptions. There are two regions to consider in electric volcanoes. Above and below the ground. Above, they are integral to the Earth-Sky circuit. A volcanic plume is a dusty plasma: pyroclastic ash mixed with ionized gases. How such a plume might increase the charge density between Earth and sky is unknown, but powerful volcanic lightning is a known occurrence. Volcanic eruptions throw hot, pyroclastic material into the sky. The volume of scorching hot cloud that erupts upward is not filled by the erupting gases alone. Ground wind necessarily flows inward to fill the cloud from below. This is a depiction of how a nuclear airburst detonation is designed to destroy a city. The sudden expansion of gases created by the blast rise up, leaving a rarefied region. Inward flowing ground winds reach the speed of an F-5 tornado, 300 mph, filling the vacuum created beneath the rising fireball, and leveling anything in its path. A very large volcanic plume can have the same effect, drawing winds inward at ground level. This seems the more likely explanation for the lopsided rim and even circular aureole of Cerro Colorado. It may also explain why maar craters in general have characteristically small amounts of ‘ejecta’ concentrated around their rims. But beyond the kinetic effects of the plume, the rising column of ionic material will act in the same fashion as the updraft in a thunderstorm, generating lightning around the column. At the mouth of the erupting vent one can imagine the current flow drawing ionic charge to it from the surrounding land. This may be why rim craters occur where they do, at the boundary of the rising plume. Consensus science has concluded there are two forms of volcanic lightning. Researchers led by Corrado Cimarelli, a volcanologist at Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich, Germany, studied Sakurajima volcano in Japan and concluded ash particles are responsible for building static electricity that discharges near ground level, as they reported in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. A separate study, also published in Geophysical Research Letters of the April 2015 eruption of Calbuco volcano in Chile, discovered lightning striking 60 miles from the eruption, from 12 miles above Earth. The scientists concluded that thinning ash clouds formed ice that rubbed together to produce lightning like they say a thundercloud does. The consensus narrative always needs a collision and static buildup of charge. Why this is so, is hard to understand. No doubt rubbing and static charges do occur, but there is already an atmosphere with an electric field to work with, moving electric charge and oodles of ionization in these events, whether volcanic or thunderstorm. They occur in the dielectric atmospheric layer between ground and the charged plasma of the ionosphere. By assuming electrical discharges only occur due to localized static charge, is to miss the big picture, that Earth is just one device in a circuit. Whether discharge comes only from the plume, or also within the ground, is the second part of the electric volcano story. We don't know much about the currents within Earth’s inner regions. We know the crust carries current. Ground current is why we ‘ground’ electrical devices, so a voltage potential can't build between the ground and the device and generate spark, or worse, a dead person whose last act on earth was to touch the device. Ground Induced Current, or GIC, is current in soil, rock and water, as well as metal fences, pipelines, and wire. It’s induced by the atmospheric current because the two are coupled. Solar activity is a forcing influence on atmosphere current, increasing the dangers of GIC during solar storms. The Carrington event of 1859 was a solar flare that, among other things, produced especially energetic aurora's and induced current in telegraph wires. Many lines burned-up, telegraph operators were shocked and showered with sparks. Some reported the telegraph had so much current, they continued working without a power source after the generators were disconnected. GIC may not be the only source of electrical current on and under the ground. After all the rush of lava and gases through vents in Earth’s crust would seem to require a lot of things rubbing and colliding. It seems necessary that this would build static charge and cause discharges deep within the Earth, even by consensus reasoning. Even more likely, it’s electrical discharges deep within the Earth that heats the magma, vaporizes rock and causes eruptions in the first place. It's entirely unknown what the voltage drop is across the layers of crust and mantle to the center of the planet, but given those huge auroral currents at the poles and the puffed-up magnetosphere around Earth, one should assume it is rather large. Pinacate and other volcanic fields display features that the Electric Universe Theory has ascribed to electrical phenomena on other planets and moons in the solar system. Since they appear on this planet too, they need to be interpreted in the context of an Electric Earth. One look at the Delta-Wye configuration at the bottom of this maar in the image below, and the question - Is the Earth Electric? - is perhaps answered. In three-phase electrical transmission, Delta-Wye connections are used to connect an ungrounded system, such as an overhead transmission line, to a grounded system, such as a transformer. The Delta configuration is the ungrounded connection of three phases of current, whereas the Wye connects the three phases to ground at the center of the Wye. A geo botanical feature at the bottom of a volcanic crater imitating electrical circuitry may be an astonishing coincidence. Or not. It may be a physical expression of how sky and ground currents ’couple’, the same way we couple a transformer to a power line. Lest we forget the Moon and the physics of electrical scarring, we can look there for hints at how subtle electrical scarring can be and since this information comes from NASA, it’s all the more astonishing. Deep craters at the polar regions of the moon never see sunlight. Within these eternally dark and frozen craters cosmic rays are bombarding the surface, creating a double layer of opposite charge, because it is theorized, electrons penetrate to the subsurface, while positive ions hit and collect at the surface – it’s always the collision thing. The double-layer discharges tiny sparks that vaporize dust and launch them up to float the thin atmosphere above the surface. This dust atmosphere was first noticed by the Apollo crews and remained a mystery for decades. There is more evidence of electrical influences in the Pinacate volcanic field and the surrounding Altar Desert than rim craters on the maars. Some maars that don't have rim craters appear as doublets or multiple craters with consistent floor depths. These too are features similar to the usual shapes seen on the Moon and Mars. Tuff rings are the volcanic rims surrounding a maar crater. Tuff ring forms as hot ejected tephra falls back to Earth and lithifies into a ring of welded tuff. They are typically low relief, with a gentle slope of less than 10 degrees on the outside. Several tuff rings in Pinacate are exposed, but the crater that formed them is buried. These next four images show, in order, lunar like features of tuff rings in the Pinacate. The first is a concentric tuff ring inside a tuff ring, with rim features at three o'clock. The next is a concentric tuff ring inside a tuff ring, with rim features at nine o'clock. Third is a tuff ring with the rim crater at five o'clock and an east-to-west crater chain at 12 o’clock. And the final picture is a polygonal tuff ring doublet. Chains of raised tuff, craters and cinder cones can also be found throughout the Pinacate. The following pictures show chains of various features, including tuff rings and cinder cones. And then there are unusual erosion patterns that seem to begin and end without reason. These are stark patterns of apparent erosion across playa that are dead flat; there is not one-foot elevation change. They appear to be lined with black rock and then the Pinacate is covered with fractal patterns and lightning bolt rilles of feathery ash and tuff deposits. Fractal patterns appear everywhere across the Pinacate from lightning bolt rilles to feathery ash and tuff deposits. We’ll look at the electrical nature of volcanic fields more in future articles.

The SAFIRE technology was designed and built to replicate the atmosphere of the Sun in a laboratory on Earth, and to test the Electric Sun model. These are the factors we control. These are some of the things the SAFIRE lab is now capable of. These are some of our recent discoveries. In our tests and experiments, we have found no disparities with the Electric Sun model. In fact, all the evidence to date indicates that electricity is the primal force in the universe. Michael Clarage arrives from Boston. We have just completed our latest experiments in the lab and were confronted with mountains of information and imagery from a score of data recorders. The plan is to park ourselves in my garage for two weeks and prepare for the upcoming conference in the UK. Analyzing the SAFIRE data is like going through a door only to discover another door beyond. Doors upon doors opening to unfamiliar territory. We're looking for a coherent story that we can present at the conference. Something that happens in a few seconds in the lab can take weeks to analyze. Turning those analyses into a 45 minute PowerPoint presentation is another challenge all together. A year ago, the SAFIRE review team set the agenda for the next 12 months. The plan was to focus on three things: energy, transmutation, and finding parallels between the SAFIRE Sun in the lab and the Sun in the sky. During the year, we also gave talks at the Electric Universe UK conference in 2018, the New England Venture summit, and MIT in Boston. It is two days away from the conference in Bath, and we still don't have our story yet. Scott Mainwaring and I go over the material to be presented at the conference tomorrow. Scott was responsible for our original mandate which was to test the Electric Sun model by replicating the atmosphere of the Sun in a lab on Earth. Given the discoveries of the last 12 months, Scott states that we fulfilled our research objectives and our mandate. The International Science Foundation has given us the amazing luxury of doing pure science for the last five years. Now it is for us to turn what we've learned into something useful, something beneficial to humanity. I realize the story Michael and I've been struggling to articulate is only partly about what we've discovered this past year. The more complete story needs to include our new mandate. Ladies and gentlemen, Monty Childs and Dr. Michael Clarage, the SAFIRE project. You can hear everything can you? I even hear myself. So we're gonna start from the beginning, there's two fundamental components to thermodynamics when you're heating something up. If you have a pot of water and you have a candle underneath it, it might take an hour to heat it up to bring it to a boil, then it stabilizes at that temperature. So that's what we call steady state. What's important is that if you take a blowtorch from the mine down the road, OK, that they use to melt steel, and put underneath the pot; that rise in temperature is gonna happen maybe within a couple of seconds, and the water will come to its steady state or maybe it'll go on and just vaporize. So I want you to keep that in mind as we walk through this section. In the lab, when we're running that particular bright ball, so Ben's there, he's capturing his video, we're capturing video on our screens and the computers... The anode, you heard me saying that 'bring it back, bring the power back, bring it back, bring it back back, please bring it back!' Reason is because we're reaching the reactor maximum temperature and we weren't able to stop it. Dr. Lowell Morgan, myself and a guy named Tommy Mello who actually works in development of computational fluid dynamics code, and that code is used by NASA and Lockheed and others, all kinds of corporations to do thermodynamic analysis, in other words rocket engines, cooling systems and the transfer of heat and energy. It's very complex, very expensive, but it's very powerful software, and that's what we use today. So we can predict very accurately, if we understand that the factors involved, how something should perform. And that's how they design your car engines, so they don't overheat any more. Our calculations showed that we needed, in order for us to reach maximum reactor temperature, our power supply had to be at 100% power output. So just imagine a hundred percent, means that you've got a blowtorch underneath the pot. The max. temperature of the chamber should be about 113 degrees Celsius. The other numbers we just kind of tested at different levels of what kind of temperatures that the chamber should respond to. The seven percent, we're gonna get into in a few seconds, is actually where the power was set, when you see that anode and where we're actually creating the transmutation of elements. This is a model, some of you may have seen it from 2016, when we did the analysis. When it's cooled, with the cooling systems at full power, shouldn't reach much higher than about 110-113 degrees. At a full power, cooling system on, steady-state, 110-113 degrees. When we did our calculations, each of us did them separately, we were all within 50 degrees of each other. Without cooling the chamber, it would heat up to 500 degrees Celsius. So that hundred degrees, or 110, actually represents 500 degrees Celsius without cooling. So when I say 50 degrees, you might say well that's 50% but it's actually 50 degrees of 500 and then we put cooling on it and it should come to this, so for three years we've been running the experiment and SAFIRE has responded predictably, until now. We have on our SCADA system, you see here in the screen above, it's at 113 degrees, we have thermocouples, we have 12 thermocouples all around the chamber, measuring to make sure that it's stable. And we can monitor these things cause it's important. So what this graph is, is a video. The red line represents the infrared camera, that's the one we're looking at the anode to tell what its temperature is, so it doesn't, it's not compromised thermally or melt. The blue one is called a bolometer, it measures, you might say, a relative energy measurement of what's coming off the end. It's not a total measurement of energy as such of what SAFIRE is putting out. The Gold Line is actually the thermocouple. So this is a day's worth of experiment sped up a couple of thousand times. That’s what our day looks like, we work very quickly, as you can see. Isn’t that interesting, we're at the peak. So it's climbing and falling, we're changing chemistry, you might say the gas composition, power settings, and we're monitoring the thermal temperature of the anode and the chamber. Yes, that is the anode melting. We didn't know it at the time, because it was happening so slowly, but we realized what was happening, we had to shut  SAFIRE down, it got too hot. What I want you to observe here is the angle of that yellow line and that is real-time rise in  temperature over time. This is the real-time, and the rise in temperature over time is identical to what we calculated at hundred percent max power, but we're only at 7%. The fall here represents after we shut it down,  as you saw in the video, we couldn't control at that point of time so we start dialing the power back. And we were only at 7%. For me, doing mechanical engineering and what I do, everybody gets excited, well, it's all this heat, probably it's like, can we run the reactor? Now, this next picture is not a black and white, this next picture shows you when we change the composition of the catalyst, it actually takes heat out of the system to a point where the anode, if you can see it here, doesn't even register and that's at max. power, dials turned up to 11, OK? And that's what we get, so we can cool it down. So we can introduce certain compositions and things and take energy out of the system. 100 percent max power gives you a hundred percent maximum thermal stable state energy or heat in the chamber. Seven percent gave us a hundred percent plus because we couldn't track where it was going to stop. I don't like to boast about our error so our calculations were only off by 93 percent. I'm 62 and I'm telling the truth, I've never been off 93 percent of anything in the engineering I've done in the past, and that's a big number. It's not just me, it was Lowell, it was  Tommy, chamber shouldn't be doing this. SAFIRE can create, control, contain, and repeat any number of plasma regimes. For five years, SAFIRE has performed exactly within the limits it was designed for, until now. This recent catalytic event was not predicted and according to plasma physics, it should not have happened but it did. This is calling into question our understanding of plasma physics and will require a new math and a collaboration of complementary disciplines to resolve. These recent catalytic events have not been observed before, they're new and show the potential for a clean, energy-efficient reactor. Transmutation -- finally! 2017, we had some interesting results but we weren't in a place to talk about  it with confidence. Today we are. So this is before, this is during a plasma discharge. What's interesting about this is that the plasma double layers have collapsed down and become very intense around the anode and now it's giving a uniform coronal glow. Just keep this in mind as we go through this presentation. And this is after, and we said well, that's interesting. In other words, so we decided it was time to subject it to what's called Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and EDAX. They kind of go  hand in hand. Technology's been around for thirty years and scanning electron microscopy is just a very powerful microscope. EDAX basically is technology where they energize the elements that are on the sample and they can tell you definitively what those elements are. And they use it for forensic sciences, all kinds of things, and it's a standard piece of equipment, it's about a million bucks for one, I would say, standard or common, but it's very good. So this is June and another lab that we work with and what we did with the sample so, when you go over a sample like this on scanning electron microscope, it's almost like scanning over top of a planetary surface, so just imagine that you're in a satellite or a rocket, and you're saying well, that's interesting! So pretend you're in there, zooming in with the microscope, things get interesting... And then we said, what are you doing there? A ball and then you can get into all kinds of discussions about how a sphere can form in  an experiment like this. And there's a lot of people who would agree that to get a sphere like this has to form in a non-gravitational environment, so if you want to make spheres you throw particles up that are heated and as they glide through the atmosphere they become spherical. We don't know what it was, we didn't know why was there. There's better pictures of this, but just take a look at something, there's some almost like tectonic  thing happening here. We can't tell you some of the things that we did to get there but we can show  you the results. So if you see some of the elements missing, that's some of the elements that we can't discuss, but what's interesting is, these elements that you see were not in the chamber before, and SAFIRE is making lanthanum and it's making cerium. It's making carbon,  it's making oxygen. So we went and scanned another region and said well, that's interesting, that doesn't look like the  base materials at all. And this is what we found, we found phosphorus and silicon and titanium and oxygen and magnesium and calcium and sodium and potassium and aluminum and carbon and chlorine and sulfur. Those were also not, we know definitively they were not in there. What you see here in the previous slide is that these formations are actually growing out of the surface. Growing, that's  what it looked like. This looks like actually a fish egg sack full of particles. So we said well, nobody's gonna believe us, because well, we’re the SAFIRE team and of course we're completely biased, that's how they're gonna see it so we said, this particular agency said, we have a lab for you if you want to validate your results and send it down to this lab. And it's a lab that they use  and Lockheed uses it and others... We say OK, why don’t you go on scan  the sample and tell us what you find. And this is what they found. Wow, that's a really interesting ball, and what is going on there. It's like these particles forming in here  and they confirmed the fact that the predominant elements of  that ball are cerium and lanthanum. These are heavy elements. And they scanned another area, and they came up with titanium, chromium, zinc, phosphorus and carbon. What we did is, because our EDAX machine isn't as good as theirs, they have a bigger budget. They can resolve for carbon and some of the lighter elements and they resolved some of the predominant elements there, in fact SAFIRE is making carbon, zinc is not there and neither is phosphorus. So this is some of things that it's making but there's even more coming. What's interesting is the topography and this is as close as we're gonna get. This is basically, you might say  it doesn't look like crystals but in metallurgy you use the word crystalline structure. You can see how the top surface of the main nodules in the material have been eroded. What's also interesting is the vent holes that are here in this material. So we said well, that's  interesting, let's go and take a look down in between these mountains or these guys and we found other things like calcium and chlorine and carbon and potassium, and these are certified materials, so we got them  from a certified company, certified spectroscopy done on the materials before we actually put it in the chamber. So we want to make sure we're doing right science before we start making claims like this, especially these kinds of claims. We start with the periodic table of elements and we're using the word catalyst because we can't think of a better term to use for the types of gas constituent or composition and the materials that we have that the anode is being exposed to. So we're just saying these  are catalysts, we introduced those into the chamber and when we fired it up and that nice bright anode that you saw that looks like a Sun, this is what it returned, these are the new elements minus the catalyst. The aluminum and silica we wrote  off because well, our probe is alumina, so we figure well, maybe this is contamination meaning it may be making it, may not be, we're just going to say look, let's just dismiss it. But you have a pile  more that SAFIRE is making. Now, what's cool about this is  that we can repeat the experiment. OK, and get the same results and we've dialed it up, then we dialed it down, and we can, you know, it's tuned that's what Wal was talking about, you know, good technology bringing to bear modern technology that Birkeland didn't have. Well, this is what modern technology can bring us, it can bring us some answers or actually many more questions. So, optical spectroscopy; this is Michael's thing, I'm his Padawan, OK, when it comes to optical spectroscopy, but he's going to talk to you what we found in the atmosphere. The optical spectroscopy is used to study the atmosphere of the discharge. What Monty was talking about is a surface analysis of the metal. Optical spectroscopy is used again to study the atmosphere around the anode. I'm gonna have to go over there, okay. This is wavelengths of light coming out of the chamber and optical spectroscopy is like a really fancy prism that shows you the rainbow colors that are in your glowing sample. It's a wonderful science, it's been perfected for so many decades that it's one of the most reliable tools that an astronomer or a plasma physicist has to study. When you light up the chamber at low discharge with a simple atmosphere, you might see that line and maybe one more here, OK, because it's a very simple discharge, it's easy to know what's in there. When you turn up the power and you get things really rolling in there, you get this whole sea of lines. A lot of elements  produce similar lines. When your circuits are complicated, it's not so easy but it's a wonderful game, it's like Sudoku on steroids, if you try to find out what elements might be producing the lines that you're seeing. It's part of the art of the science there. And it took us a while but then we noticed this triplet here, this a triplet of lines that are  very close together. This triplet here and this triplet here, and our intuition said, let's focus on those because that's so unique of a fingerprint, no group of elements would make that, it's got to be one. That was the  intuition at least. And if you ask your optical spectroscopy software to match the known lines of different elements, after a lot of hunting, we came across manganese and manganese lies exactly on this triplet, this triplet, and this triplet. It's basically impossible that that could be any other, statistically impossible, any other element or  group of elements. These other ones, we don't  know yet, we're still hunting, it takes a  lot of hours to hunt this sort of a diagram. So that means that we have manganese, which is another metal that is in the atmosphere but not on the surface, right, we don't know why but it's very clear that that's happening. We also saw in the atmosphere the green ones here, the lithium is also in the atmosphere that was not on the surface, the manganese and then the sodium, the Na there that appears in both, the surface of the anode and in the atmosphere. One of my challenges when we designed SAFIRE was that, okay, we can do post-experimental analysis on lots of materials, but the real challenge is, when is it happening? So if you do see transmutation, do you know when or under what conditions these reactions are happening? And so what we can tell you today is, we know now when it's happening. It's because the spectroscopy tells us, we can dial it up and we see it come up, then we dial it down and it disappears except for the prominent lines of the particular gas constituent we have in there. So what we can tell you is that manganese is not one of the gas, part of the gas compositions, we know that, and this is laboratory quality stuff, and not with that kind of signal. You're gonna enjoy this. So always when we're running these experiments, part of my job is to keep in mind the connection with cosmology. Cosmology allows you to place everything that you might experience as a human on this planet into some framework, and that has definitely been at the start of the SAFIRE project as well. Here is some framework to put some of these results in. This is his normal rate, speed, Monty, keep up! Planets, very dynamic electrical systems, currents flowing in and out, and from what we know now, it's not as simple, it's not simply a current like flowing through a wire into something and out the other end, current flows in and out of the North Pole, current flows  in and out of the South Pole. I just drew one of the ring currents up there,  I think we're up to about four or five now, that we know about, it's very complicated stuff. So let's take that starting point as what we know about our local environment, put it inside the solar system, so stars also, they do have and we will eventually measure currents going in and out of their poles as well. The numbers are a little tough to nail down but a planet might have ten to the seventh, so ten million amps, more or less flowing in, a star might have a billion amps flowing in and out of it. You start to see the pattern when you draw the pictures, this is a cosmic blueprint, if you will, for how electrical structures are formed. Each star is also following this blueprint but then its sub members also follow the blueprint. The planets are receiving their energy from their star, the star is connected to its source of power, the planets are connected to their source of power and their source of power is their Sun. So you have to imagine if not direct currents flowing between them, at least some sort of resonance or induction, but the planets only get their power from their Sun. If you imagine one of those  being Jupiter, say one of those planets there, and we look at the sky, we see Jupiter as a dot, pretty small dot, right, but the magnetosphere of Jupiter, the body, the real body of Jupiter is huge, it would take up, if you did this with your arm to the nighttime sky, that's how big the body of Jupiter  would look if we had eyes to see it. OK, so composition of planets, as Wal so well said years ago, we understand planetary formation so little currently, that we need a different theory of planetary formation for every planet in our solar system. One of the patterns that we see in electrical systems throughout all of nature is membranes, boundaries. The plasma naturally forms its own version of a membrane or a boundary. So we'll start with our star, shorthand it, right, and then we'll ask how does the star fit in its world, the neighborhoods that it comes from and lives in? So that green there is an interstellar filament which you can kind of see in the background of the slide here, and the stars are set up on those filaments. Before the advent of the Herschel and Planck Space Telescopes, we honestly believed that the stars were randomly distributed in the sky. We believed that, right, and then once you see the filaments, every star we see in the sky is on a filament, there's no randomness to it if you can see the underlying structure behind it. There's also these other blobs that we see now and as a scientific community we're bounded by what we already know about and so they have a name, they're called protostars. Any time somebody uses the word  proto, you know they don't know what they're talking about, right? So I don't think they're stars, they might be, I don't know, the point is, they might be something else, they don't have to be on this track that we call be a star, right, they could be something else that is needed in the interstellar medium. We have found, to date, over 200 organic molecules in the interstellar medium. I'm sure that number will continue to grow exponentially as we study more and more. One of the big questions, of course, is where do they come from, how do they form, how do they get there? Now what about the inorganics in the interstellar medium? Again, the number keeps growing but these have been known about for quite a while. That group right there, of 11 elements -- inorganics, metals, are known to be out there in the interstellar medium. How did they get there, why are  they there, big questions, right? We thought well, wait a minute, we have a list to compare this to, why don't we compare this known list from stars and interstellar medium, why don't we compare that to which  ones we find in SAFIRE, right? Yeah, so pretty good, right? I think the evidence  speaks for itself. I think the evidence speaks for itself,  might even demand a verdict, yes, right. Dark mode plasma, this is something  that, for our research, started from Scott Mainwaring who quoted that wonderful line from Edgar Allan Poe about there being dark stars in the sky. I don't know the exact quote, but it was in the back of our minds all this time as to well, what's going on in a plasma environment that's under tension but  it's not discharging? That's an important question, right, and even though it was on our docket for exploration, when we found it  we weren't looking for it. Life in the lab. Yes, so here's an image of dark mode  plasma, yeah, this is our anode, right, and so just to give you a picture that's in the center of the chamber, but the probe, our voltage probe comes in from the outside and measures the floating potential of the plasma as it's  moving around in the chamber. And at a certain point, the probe started going crazy but there's no discharge in the chamber, and we spent some time studying the spatial extent of that  strange phenomenon. It varies in size depending upon the parameters in the atmosphere right, how big that that boundary is. What's amazing about  this is that we have a very sharp voltage drop just off the surface of the anode, a plasma double-layer and there's no visible plasma, voltage goes to almost zero and it goes right back up to, almost, anode potential. And there's no plasma. So I want to contrast it to the glow  mode to see, you get a reference, we would call that a form of glow mode and at the middle, a very clear atmosphere, very clear boundary at the edge of the discharge. When you run the potential probe  through that, you see that chart on the left, so that's electrical potential, that's the voltage at that point in space, at that point in the plasma, and you can see when you come up, there's that sharp boundary coming up from the left side, that's sharp boundary, that's that outer edge of the blue ball, glowing mode, and as you come in, the potential rises very steeply, you'll notice the potential drops down basically to zero, right before you touch the anode, and then, when you touch the anode, it jumps up to  the voltage we set the anode to. This is what we saw running  the probe in and out of the dark mode so we had the chamber under tension, a lot of volts, you don't see anything going on, but then you can see that's the chart of what the probe is telling us is in the chamber. There's a lot of arguments about what it is  this is telling us, and as a contrast you can see some stack over each other, very different behavior, very different shapes, very different sizes of potential in there... I want to emphasize that we don't know what it means, OK, there's some previous research on this sort of thing where the probe you're running in a chamber discharge shows this kind of really rapid and intense pulsations, but no one's studied it spatially. It brings you right up against the problem we've known since the ‘20s which is, you can't actually measure anything without affecting it. There's this idealization that  you can somehow measure something that's really there even if you're not looking at it, OK, but that's not the truth of nature. So we know it's an interaction between our probe and the anode, but nature is always that way. If you think about the solar system and the electrical distribution in the solar system, it's not just a Sun sitting there in isolation, there's planets, there's comets, and all of those, you could say, serve as the probe in the solar system and so they're going to be experiencing something like this. I'll talk tomorrow about some of the astronomical implications of that. The SAFIRE team is now developing  the new mandate for SAFIRE. We're going to take what we've learned and turn it into something useful. For the immediate future, we are focused primarily on clean energy generation. We have already designed a prototype energy generator. But some of these things really came together in the last, maybe three weeks, and we're saying, what's  the SAFIRE story? OK, so we want to change the conversation from zero-point energy and free energy to efficiency. We're gonna be talking about that a little bit more tomorrow, because there's no free lunch. If you think about your cars, the oil is out there and it's in the ground and it gets sequestered, then it gets pulled and it's put into tanks then it's refined and then it's pumped into your tank where it's actually focused and you burn it, you harvest the energy that has to offer. Actually the same thing happens with a hydroelectric dam, now you've got this river running through it, put up a dam, focus that potential energy into one particular place, we do the same thing with uranium. We want to, on our SAFIRE team, change the conversation from zero-point energy and these kinds of things out there, because we don't believe they happen like that. We don't see it in nature. Energy generation is all about efficiency, how one determines efficiency is much debated, but the Wall Street Journal factored in the cost of the fuel itself, the cost of production, the cost of damage that  fuel and oil production does to the environment; and came up with a picture like this. Ultimately, nature itself shows us the most efficient way to do things. SAFIRE will fit somewhere in this picture. The fact that the main fuel is hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe, and that the process is clean and produces no negative side effects or waste products makes SAFIRE a very attractive energy generating technology. Elemental transmutation occurs both in nature and in the laboratory and is not a new phenomenon. Studies done at MIT have shown that when radioactive waste is exposed to hydrogen isotope nuclei, the observed decay rate of the radioactive material is effectively increased. SAFIRE produces copious amounts  of hydrogen nuclei that interact with other elements, creating self-organizing spherical plasma double layer shells. Within these shells, electrons, ions, and molecules, are trapped by powerful electromagnetic fields. This is where radioactive material would be exposed to the hydrogen nuclei to remediate the radioactivity of that material. One of the confusing aspects, if you only think that gravity and turbulence and heat are your causal factors, none of this is ever, you can never explain this how there's so much structure. We see a spatial structure there, right, one of the benefits of the current suite of telescopes around the Earth is that you can also see elements and energetic states of elements, and those are segregated also. So what you might be looking at here is a center region of hydrogen that has been collected in the middle, and then that bright boundary might be a layer of excited hydrogen. Right outside of that, that orange boundary might be cold carbon monoxide just sitting right there, right next to that inner shell, and then right outside of that you might find energized calcium sitting right next to those other layers. How that happens? We see that naturally in the SAFIRE chamber, all those double layers and different structures you see, those are segregated and separated different elements, molecules, and energetic states. And we're not trying to force it to do that. We don't have a giant billion-dollar  ITER machine that uses 20 mega-watts of energy to try to just contain the plasma so it doesn't blow apart. We're not trying to force anything in our chamber, we are studying what nature shows us, what it gives us naturally of her own design. So, summary. So we have energy, we have transmutation and we have the Sun and interstellar medium. We see a cohesive picture. The Electric Sun model gave us the  premise with which to engineer the SAFIRE reactor. Once constructed, the proof of concept bell jar version of SAFIRE was up and running within minutes. Likewise, once constructed, the 44,000 part SAFIRE reactor was also up and running within minutes. At every step of the way, the Electric Sun model's predictions proved accurate. What if the process used to create the SAFIRE Sun turns out to be similar to the process that  creates the real Sun and stars? The scientific community would have a field day with door opening. That would be the big picture. In all our experiments and discoveries, we have  found no disparities with the Electric Sun model. All the evidence to date points to electricity as the primal force in nature. We believe the SAFIRE project validates and supports the Electric Sun model. SAFIRE's new mandate is to create beneficial and commercially viable transformative technologies  for Humanity. That's what tomorrow's talk will be about, it'll be really the story and where do we go from here, and what should we do with SAFIRE, should we stop the research? Caesar, up -- down, OK, off with their heads. So I guess, we'll leave that with you, I hope you've enjoyed it. 
[Music] The endeavor of science can, and should  be seen as a noble effort to bring humanity out of superstition, but it has its limitations. Most importantly, it must stand on some metaphysical principles. Alas  instead, it has spawned its own high-end mysticism and myths. The  word ‘science’ means knowledge, but knowledge can come in two types: true and false. The premise being posited here, is that any scientific thinking that violates axiomatic metaphysical principles cannot be valid. The worst thing we can do is to know and rely upon something that is not  true. This would be like stepping on a lily pad, thinking it would hold your weight. I'm going to quote J.P. Claybourne, author of ‘Why an Ether is Positively Necessary’: ”The belief persists in some quarters that the concept of an ether as a medium for electromagnetic waves has been completely discredited. Although it is true that the mathematics of electrodynamics and Einstein's special relativity operate without reference to details of a transmission medium, in neither case is the ether concept contradicted; it is simply not addressed. Also, I quote from another physicist, James Owen Weatherall. “If physicists can't agree on the properties of empty space, they won't be able to explain the physics of planets or particles either.” Now, the EU thinking has been primarily focused on the things that we can apprehend with our senses, from the microscopic level to the telescopic level, but mostly on the normal, visible level. On just these three levels, there is an overwhelming abundance of phenomena and structure that show the universe works electrically, from galaxies down to cells, down to atoms. Much, if not  most of this should be obvious and would be, if a wrong paradigm didn't obscure the thinking. For instance, welders and machinists familiar with electrical discharge machining (EDM), get the electrical cratering and scarring aspects immediately, usually exclaiming that it's obvious. Electrical engineers often find other aspects to be easily assimilated and accepted, but many plasma phenomena on this triune level are not that familiar to scientists. For example Birkeland currents, double layers, cells and Peratt instability formations have not been widely understood. And plasma phenomena can be very complex, as well as being outside of our normal experience. Let me remind us about our limitations. It should be understood that below the level of the various microscope tools, or beyond the various telescope tools, when thinking about the material universe, aspects and attributes of phenomena and structure, cannot be apprehended directly by our senses, our sight nor by the other senses. We can only do experiments and get clues as to what we are dealing with, and then we can only build models for and/or project metaphors or analogies from our tangible experience on these aspects. I suggest that our ignorance is profound. We don't know what we think we know. This restricted domain on the lower level includes the basic atomic particles and we can only get blurry visual patterns of nuclei shape and where they are located and arranged in material. To this point, theory has claimed that atomic nuclei must be symmetrical in three dimensions, either spherical, flattened or elongated spherical, as in a discus, or a rugby ball shape. Now we can confirm that some nuclei are pear-shaped and oriented in a specific spatial direction. This  development actually sweeps away much current cosmological theory. Even  the orbital model of the atom has not been confirmed and part of the time it must be discarded in atomic model thinking. On  the other end of the spectrum, we should be mindful that we have  only electromagnetic radiation given off by radiating bodies or structures that we can access through our telescopes. Sound, tactile sensation, smell and taste are not available for analysis or consideration. Nothing else comes through, just light. No direct chemical analysis to determine material or molecular structure, no physical analysis to determine density, specific gravity, index of refraction, hardness, viscosity etc. No application of tape measures, scales, hydrometers or reagents. Just and  only patterned radiation to work with. Thus on the lower levels concepts that we have can be little more than pure speculation. We have a tendency to project the orbital metaphor on atomic structure, but this is probably unwarranted. Mainstream thinking has imagined quarks on the lowest level and the EU, the Electric Universe model talks about sub-sub-atomic particles as positive or negative ‘subtrons’. The  point is that beyond sensationalism there is little justification to present these physics flights of fancy to the public as knowledge. Let's be mindful that all our  relevant observations have taken place from a platform within familiar distances within our own Sun's heliopause and essentially within a platform perpendicular to the axis of the Sun. When considering bodies outside of our platform in more distant outer space, we are usually projecting from our own environment and then speculating. We don't know enough about the true distances, the true sizes and the attributes  of the regions, such as any charge differential, ether density, field strength etc. We  can't confidently extend meaningful values on the decrease of force with distance of the 3-distance squared formulas. Thornhill is even suggesting that the attractive force that we call gravity, actually turns  into repulsion at some point. The Electric Universe model lays a theoretical foundation for all of this on the atomic particle level by positing just and only two electric charge carriers; negative and positive matter particles. And just and only two forces: electric attraction and repulsion. These foundational things, along with sequence, motion, and the aspects and constrictions of the geometry of three dimensions, account for or undergird all other physical phenomena, including polarity. Also, in my understanding of the EU model, the definition of energy is that it is always matter in motion in relation to the rest of the universe. Not something mystical, nor even a thing in and of itself. Early theoretical physics accepted the existence of an ether, and it is only a modern scientific failure  to detect it, that has precluded it. The famed Michelson-Morley type expe- iments and others have so far not given positive results that are expected, if an ether is present. However, the problem is probably in carrying aspects of the wave-in-water analogy, or metaphor, along for light waves that are not applicable. On the  other hand, the Earth may carry along an entrained cocoon of ether with it. Because of some assumptions that may not be true, science will tell you it has disproved this, but it hasn't. The measured decrease in the speed of light over the last century or two, does indicate an ether that is getting denser in the vicinity of the Earth. Given that there cannot be voids of nothingness in the universe, the Electric Universe model, because of both sound evidence and reasoning, has confidently settled on the conclusion that the volume of the physical universe is filled with an ether. In other words, the existence of  an ether is next to being axiomatic. Currently, the thinking is that  this ether is composed of polarizable neutrinos. Where these are matter particles that have a vanishingly small amount of mass-energy and dipolarity in their empty state. These dipolar particles can spin axially, rotate radially, and oscillate. The  internal mass-energy would be some combination of these three internal  motions. There would be no skin of course. If you build a universe of three dimensions that can't have any voids, then you have only two regular polyhedrons  that can fill or tesselate a volume, those being tetrahedrons and cubes. So, if we must think of shape, it may be we should think of ether particles having one of these two forms. On the other hand, neutrino-based particles probably are asymmetrical in shape. At this point we have crossed the border into a different realm and are deep into projecting a topological shape metaphor onto it. But, since other more substantial particles and objects apparently move without friction through this ether medium, the particles must be quite flexible, if not compressible, and their surfaces must be without friction. Their vanishingly small mass would generate vanishingly small viscosity. In conclusion, science is far from perfect and has a serious problem in being intellectually responsible on these foundational levels. [Music] [Music] [Music] 
so he come to comets an electric discharge model of comets was not even on the table at the beginning of the Space Age allowing astronomers to embrace Whipple's dirty snowball model as the scientific consensus but images of comet nuclei show us God and created rocky surface and usually you go by the appearances if you haven't had a chance to actually scoop some of it up in it and examine it in the laboratory meanwhile gravity measurements suggest a comet is a fluff ball very low density so what I'm suggesting is there is something seriously wrong with consensus understanding and I showed this slide on the opening knife it's my opinion that of all the bodies in the heavens perhaps none will approve more definitive in confirming the electric field of the Sun than the comet because the cometary display relies on there being a weak electric field centered on the Sun it is clear that at least by the second half of the 19th century many scientists believe that comet tails are fundamentally electrical they looked and they could see the commonality with electric discharge experiments in low pressure gas and they made the connection for example in August 1882 English mechanic and world of science wrote of Comet tail's there seems to be a rapidly growing feeling among physicists about the cell flight of comets and the phenomena of their tails belongs to the order of electrical phenomena and there are other papers from that era that I could easily add to that when comet Halley was flown first it was a surprise because the nucleus was found to be blacker than a lump of coal it the some of these small rocks have comas larger than the Sun and the material that was coming off the comet instead of just sort of evaporating it was coming out in jets was unexpected and some of these Jets also were on the dark side now if it's supposed to be formed by the heat of the Sun you did not expect to see jets on the dark side it had complex cratered surface once again if you're just a blighting material in the heat of the Sun you would expect it to look more like a melted ice cream than a cratered surface they exhibit layering and we've also having sampled the tail of a comet found high temperature minerals just like meteorites it was discovered by accident that they emit x-rays and x-rays our signature of an electrical discharge pure and simple comets explode for unknown reasons well in the electric model that's simple if you're discharging the body and that body is an electorate and has an internal electric field the process of discharging that comet will build up stresses within the comet rather like an overstressed capacitor which will eventually explode and that's what we see this is the astronomers jet model and it's the most fanciful thing you could imagine here we have jets coming out of orifices you know vertically from the surface if you imagine a rough surface and ice trying to escape from underneath you don't expect it to come out like that it can come out at any angle in a fan you do not get highly collimated jets and of course we've comet Hartley 2 we said the Jets drag water ice out of the nucleus producing a comet snowstorm this is one of the things that's puzzle of astronomers is how you get such a tremendous volume of very fine dust it's in fact when healthy was first flying past they couldn't believe the fineness of the dust there was an answer to that when heat from the Sun reaches the pocket of dry ice this is the explanation of the traditional one Fulford instantly transforms from solid to vapor forming a jet wherever local topography happens to collimate the air rushing you guessed now the local thermography fog rafi will not column out the address with rushing gas unless it's a perfect really perfectly cylindrical event apparently these cio carbon monoxide jets are carrying chunks of snowy water ice along for the ride and this is the story it's more or less a fairy story now comet built two shows similar surface etching to that of an electrical discharge machine EDM surface which you see below in fact common bill two had a thing called the footprint on it which you can see down to the lower right of the comet nucleus and at the top of the EDM he means you can see a small footprint if you like in the surface which has been etched by an electric arc so the similarities are obvious it was said in the report from the scientists it is not clear by sublimation process is driven by solar illumination on a spinning body would form globally distributed circular structures of course it's not however electric discharge dude for globally distributed circular structures unresolved bright spots seem to be connected with the Jets from the nucleus and this is the same kind of thing as happened on Jupiter's moon Io there were spots bright spots which burned out the cameras in which were colored in by NASA as lava because that's what they believed it was so these unresolved bright spots are probably the are cut down points 
Welcome to Space News  from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™  at Thunderbolts.info For the last five years on this series, Thunderbolts colleague Andy Hall has presented an extraordinary reconstruction of catastrophic events on Earth, exploring the tell-tale clues these events imprinted on our planet's surface. As Andy has described, many of the fractal patterns we see on Earth cannot be explained through any traditional geological process. However, these geological features find intriguing analogs in some of the highest energy atmospheric phenomena seen in our solar system today. In part one of this two-part presentation, Andy continues his Eye of the Storm series with an examination of the remarkable filamentary and dendritic patterns seen on planet Earth. Patterns whose explanation may be found in ancient events that created the cultural memory of a mythical creature, the dragon. Dragons are real, folks. This chapter may be hard to get your head around because we've been taught dragons are myth, but they are not figments of imagination. They  come from the laws of physics. They also come from  the bowels of the earth. You see, rivers flow where dragons once crawled. As told in countless tales, they  are said to come from the sea in the underworld labyrinth. There are so many examples, I don't think I need to quote more than one. But I’ll save that for later. Go discover for yourself. After this article, you will recognize the physics of dragons in the stories of myth. Our ancestors were doing their best to warn us. And yes, dragons are still around; they're just sleeping. This is a concept some may struggle with even in  the EU, because so much of our theories focus on celestial chaos and the electrical havoc wrought by planets in close  proximity. We imagine sparks flying, drilling craters into the surface of planets and moons. And there is overwhelming evidence of that. But that is what happens to rocky planets without an active magnetosphere. Mars, Mercury and many pockmarked moons display significant magnetism, but it is mostly remanent. A static artifact of the past electrical activity that scarred them with craters. Planets with dynamic magnetospheres, atmospheres and weather  like Earth in the gas giants, and even some of the moons, have internal electric circuitry. Stars and planets are circuits; three-dimensional standing waves of current and magnetism living in the winds of their parent stars and galaxies. They are a product of inductance and capacitance, potentials and currents, and the magnetic fields current generates. The matter trapped in these 3D whirlwinds, gas liquid and dust and yes that includes us, is 100 percent organized by the circuitry. Circuits are cyclic processes. They  produce resonant frequencies where signals are amplified and dampened in patterns of constructive and destructive interference. The atmosphere and crust of the planet are essential parts of the circuitry because they provide capacitance, energy storage, and regulated energy flow. What follows comes from simply understanding that the circuit flows inside the planet, as well as in the atmosphere,  plasmasphere and magnetosphere. But it is all one circuit and  that is why things are so interconnected. There are feedback loops, oscillations and high order harmonic responses that bring order out of chaos, concentrating energy into identifiable coherent forms. The forms appear all over the place in geology and weather, due to the  role capacitance plays in the circuit. In the situation that Earth's potential is raised or lowered in response to some significant celestial event, the  crust of the earth can become saturated with charge. And  based on applied science, the most violent discharges in a circuit can be expected through the capacitor. That is because a capacitor builds charge and a voltage across it that is the maximum of the circuit. And when a capacitor blows, it's the biggest bang of them  all. Hence we have dragons. A dragon is a type of discharge event from inside the earth. It's a short circuit around the continental plates, generated by ground currents beneath the plate boundaries. The discharge is reaching for the other side of the plate - the top of the continental mound that is forming around the eye of the storm, where it's raining rock, dust and water in a positive ionic mix relative to the current beneath the continental shelf. Once again, rinse and repeat, this is due to capacitance. In nature capacitors aren't insulated the way we make capacitors. When we make capacitors for electric circuits, we want their actions to be predictable. The last thing we want is a short circuit. So we insulate the edges of capacitor plates to prevent short circuits from plate to play around the dielectric medium. Nature doesn't do this; in fact nature builds a continental plate as a big dielectric that is thicker in the middle and thinnest at the edge, sandwiched between a deep ground charge and an opposing surface charge. The edge effect at the periphery of the capacitor plate is called the fringing field. Think of it as a leakage of charge around the edges. It makes it the most likely place to have a discharge, and if current leakage occurs, it will make its way directly to the opposite plate and short-circuit the capacitor. Man-made capacitors are insulated around the edges specifically to prevent short circuits in the fringing field. The continental plates aren't insulated. In fact the earth's crust at the continental boundary, the sea floor, is much thinner and it lies over the ground current paths. Telluric currents beneath the crust are rivers of current that create the plate boundaries, and their magnetic fields create high stress. So, the continental plates are structured, not to mitigate the fringing effect, but to encourage short circuits, like a relief valve for the energy building below. Dragons are short-circuit discharges from the fringing field of the continental plates, discharging through magnetically stressed regions of the sea floor, fracture zones and volcanoes. There you go. That is what a dragon is. No magic puff, but a ground-to-ground lightning discharge. Energy building beneath the crust tries to release through volcanoes belching hot molten matter, heat, lightning and clouds of ash. But every lava flow adds layers of matter to the capacitor plate. The plate  gets wider and thicker and is dancing with surface charge from falling ash, rock, rain and cooling lava. It's chemical soup. Every charged cloud of ash and water vapor forms another chemical soup, rising to a stratosphere already charged with plasma. The reaction is plasma storms of higher ion content today than today's little tabascos. These storms build surface charge beneath them on a surface, already dancing with energy released from the cooling lava. And so it goes. Charge keeps building across the plate until it short circuits in the fringing field. Essentially the same thing happens in a cloud-to-cloud discharge, where the lightning streaks across the surface of the clouds, rather than jumping to ground. Just think about it. The electric field of the storm is between ground and clouds. It's a  potential of hundreds of megavolts. Yet much more lightning goes sideways from cloud to cloud than from cloud to ground. There is a local voltage difference between clouds that is stronger than the prevailing electric field of the storm between cloud and ground. Of course, it's all one field, but the direction of its potential shifts. The field becomes stronger between clouds due to phasing. As clouds discharge lightning, they discharge energy and then rebuild it from the inflowing winds. This  sets up cycles with hysteresis and two parts of the cloud or two storm cells get out of phase with each other, which creates a huge potential. The arc closes this voltage gap. The path the arc takes predominantly follows a surface conductive path at the cloud's edge, where the condensate boundary forms a layer of charged particles where droplets form. The same thing happens in ground-to- ground discharge. The subsurface and surface potential difference is oscillating. This especially occurs if the normal path of conductance is blocked, as volcanoes evolve gas chambers of vapor that choke current flow. These oscillations can spike voltage between subsurface and surface, amplifying ground-to-ground potential and draw short-circuiting arcs from one side of the continental plate to the other, just like any capacitor would if you strip the insulation from its edges. How can we know this is true? Because charge diffusion and discharge take fractal form and we can identify fractal forms and understand what patterns them: electricity and magnetism. There is no question rivers take fractal form, perhaps not every stream of water. But you'll notice, if you pour water downhill, it generally flows straight down whenever it can and rarely produces a lightning bolt- shaped fractal, unless you place rocks strategically in the path of the water the way hydrologists do. Examine a man-made mountain, where natural water erosion is allowed to occur, like the mine tailings pictured. The water erodes straight channels, but natural rivers like the Amazon, the Congo and the Colorado river take on the same class of fractal form called Lichtenberg figures, after George Christophe Lichtenberg who first studied them. It is the form that arcing electric discharge takes during dielectric breakdown. Dielectric breakdown is another way of saying ‘short circuit’ in a capacitor. Dielectric breakdown occurs as current paths form and continuously branch in self-similar filaments in a process called ‘diffusion limited aggregation’. Brownian motion in the diffusing plasma results in a random walk, where charged particles cluster and grow in dendrite trees called ‘Brownian trees’. And rivers in fine and large structure, from headwater to delta, consistently match the variety of branching, dendrite forms seen with electric arcs, branching in multiple self-similar repetition. The process is self- similar over time scales, as well as dimensions. A dielectric breakdown may occur over years or nanoseconds and produce the same dendrite form. Lightning bolts occur in seconds, flashing several times through a channel created by a cascade of electrons, reaching for positive ion tendrils growing from the ground. But filaments of discharge in a high voltage insulator grow over months, in a manner of crystal growth. The dendrites expand from a point in ever smaller self-similarities, spread out in ever greater area or volume over time. They grow in pulses, lightning bolt flashes as energy pumps into the filament again and again, until it breaks through and establishes continuous current flow. Charge advances by combining with, and drawing electrons from, its surroundings. Which alters the surroundings thermally and chemically, creating channels. Each new pulse follows the channels, wave-guided to the old paths and extending them forward in self-similar steps until it breaks through. So, a dragon may repeat its route over and over again, in pulses that may be separated by moments, or millennia. In these select images of the Colorado River, note how  much the river follows long, straight segments. Most people are led to believe that rivers are the result of water, simply flowing downhill to the ocean, following the path of least resistance. But it is accepted scientific consensus that rivers follow faults, and these straight-line segments are the visual evidence of it. So water doesn't just go downhill, it follows faults. The obvious question is what causes faults. Faults are the dragon's footprint. Faults are the path of a ground-to-ground discharge. The solid bedrock below is the fused earth from its heat, shock, pressure, diffusing charge and magnetic field. Its false valleys and canyons are what I call the ‘arc-blasted zone’. Arc blast is a term from applied science whereas ’dragon’ sounds a bit whimsical. But they are one and the same thing. The path of the water meanders, but the channel it travels in defines the fault line. Water flows flood and recede, build sandbars, islands and can change course within the channel. A magnetic footprint accompanies the dragon, as countless magnetic dipole measurements surveyed on rivers around the world attest. River channels have a magnetic signature transverse to the direction of the channel. Which is what one should expect from a lightning arc. Shores blackened with magnetite is another testament to a past event, when electric current flowed in that channel, wrapped in a magnetic sheath. Its path is the jagged step-leader shape of a lightning bolt, jumping in  straight lines and arcs from point to point, like connecting dots. The path often splits to form tributaries. The angle between the channels provides hints of their cause. [Music] 
[Music] A new scientific paper published in the journal Science reveals yet another major surprise from NASA’s Juno mission to the gas giant Jupiter. In 2019, the Juno spacecraft twice flew past the extraordinary long-lived anti-cyclone called the Great Red Spot, the  longest enduring storm in the solar system. The data reveals that the storm reaches much deeper beneath Jupiter’s cloud surface than space scientists can explain. A report on the findings from sciencealert.com states, ”NASA’s Juno spacecraft zipped past the Great Red Spot - an anti-cyclone large enough to swallow Earth - twice in 2019. Measurements from those flights are now revealing the storm structure in far more detail than telescope images can show. That data suggests that the vortex probably extends anywhere from 186 to 310 miles deep, far below Jupiter's clouds.” ”Mysteriously, the jet streams surrounding the Great Red Spot extend even deeper - nearly 1,900 miles below Jupiter's cloud surface. The researchers aren't sure why. They  do know, however, that those jets - distinct bands of gas wrapping around the planet - are keeping the Great Red Spot alive. The storm is wedged between two jet streams that move in opposite directions, powering the spin of the vortex...” Juno scientist Marzi Parisi of JPL states, ”It's surprising that the Great Red Spot goes so deep... but it's also surprising that it doesn't go as deep as the jets... So something is happening at 500 kilometers that is basically dampening the Great Red Spot” Unbeknownst to the scientific press, this discovery is yet another remarkable affirmation of a long string of predictions by the chief proponent of the Electric Universe, physicist Wal Thornhill. In July of 2017, in an interview on the Thunderbolts series, Space News from the Electric Universe, Thornhill made the following statement. ”Plasma physicists have shown that Birkeland currents draw the heavy elements towards the centers of celestial bodies and the gases form their atmospheres, with hydrogen and helium outermost. So the composition of Jupiter can't be assessed from its atmosphere. Jupiter is not mostly hydrogen and helium. All of the issues raised mean Jupiter is a solid shell composed of heavy elements. It will have structure both on its external and internal surfaces. Jupiter  is not, as (Donald) Scott said of the simplistic standard model, ’boring and uniform inside. Anywhere you look will not look the same.’ Finally a word about Jupiter's Great Red Spot. Its continued presence for centuries is another argument for a solid body beneath the clouds. Its giant tornadic form is that of a continuous electrical discharge vortex, for an elevated surface feature acting like a lightning rod. Which could be the birth scar of one of Jupiter's moons. The Juno spacecraft is due to observe the Great Red Spot closely on its next close encounter with Jupiter where I expect even greater gravitational and electromagnetic anomalies to be found associated with the spot.” Unfortunately, the electrical phenomena that Thornhill explained and predicted over four years ago, are not part of the standard theoretical toolkit, and thus were not on the table for consideration by Juno investigators. However, we have repeated ad nauseum  on this series, that the only valid test of a hypothesis is its predictive record. By this standard, it becomes difficult to rationalize institutionalized science's continued disregard for the Electric Universe and plasma cosmology. It  is now worthwhile to review some of the most “outrageous explicit predictions” by Thornhill, later confirmed by science discovery, and dating  back over a quarter of a century. As far back as the mid-1990s, prior to the arrival of the Galileo space probe in the Jovian system, Thornhill registered several advance claims. Following the lead of earlier investigators  Dr. Thomas Gold, Dr. Anthony Perratt and professor Alex Dessler, Thornhill insisted that the so-called ”volcanoes” on Jupiter's moon Io are actually electric discharge plumes. He predicted that the so-called “volcanic vents” would be much hotter than lava, that the plumes are the jets of cathode arcs and they do not explode from a ”volcanic vent”, but move around and erode the periphery of dark areas which planetary geologists call lava lakes. The  so-called “lava lakes” themselves are merely the solid surface of Io, etched electrically by cathode arcs. They would not reveal the expected heat of a recent lava flow. Each of these predictions received stunning confirmation. Io's volcanic hot spots were not only hotter than any lava on Earth but were too hot to be measured by Galileo’s instruments. In fact, no lava flow ever recorded has produced temperatures as hot as seen in the original Galileo image. Also,  as predicted by Thornhill, the discharging was found to be focused on the edges of the so-called “lava lakes”, though the rest of these dark fields are comparatively cold. None of the expected volcanic vents could be  found. And in fact some of the volcanic plumes were discovered to move across the surface  of Io. It was also discovered that the plumes emit ultraviolet light, something inconceivable under normal conditions of volcanic venting, but ultraviolet light is of course characteristic of an electric arc. Perhaps most significant of all, from the electrical viewpoint, was the discovery of filamentary structure in the plume of the so-called volcano Vashtar. To this day, planetary scientists admit that filamentary structure simply has no place in a volcanic plume and cannot be explained. And yet, as noted previously by Gold, Peratt and Deshler, it is the distinctive feature of the penumbra of an electric discharge. More  than a decade and a half ago, Thornhill offered an equally ”radical  prediction” on the planet Saturn. On February 5th, 2005 Thornhill published his analysis of scientist discovery of a “warm polar vortex” at Saturn’s south pole. Thornhill offered a detailed electrical interpretation of the phenomenon and chastened investigators for referring to the vortex as the “first to ever be discovered in the solar system.” He wrote, ”Keck researchers don't seem to have done their homework. Or maybe things that can't be explained get forgotten! Saturn's ‘warm polar vortex’ is not ’the first to ever be discovered.’ The  Pioneer Venus Orbiter (PVO) discovered a warm ‘giant vortex’ of surprisingly complex structure and behavior located in the middle atmosphere at the north pole of the planet, with a similar feature presumed to exist at the south pole also.” On the question of Saturn’s strange polar hot spot, Thornhill offered an explicit prediction. He stated the Electric Universe also predicts experimentum crucis that both poles should be hot, not one hot and the other cold. In 2008, the Reuters News Service published a science headline, Scientists Find Hot Spot On Saturn's Chilly Pole. They wrote, “Saturn's chilly north pole boasts a hot spot of compressed air, a surprising discovery that could shed light on other planets within our own solar system and beyond.” Planetary scientist Nick Teanby said of the discovery, “We didn't expect it to have a hot spot at the north.” Saturn's north polar hot spot was a total surprise to planetary scientists because the pole had been deprived of sunlight since its winter began more than 12 years earlier. Another clue to the incoming electric currents creating the polar hotspot, is the long-lived hexagon, also at Saturn's north pole. While planetary scientists have long favored an explanation for the hexagon based on fluidic experiments, recent scientific discovery definitively excludes the fluid dynamics theory. In 2014, scientists studying data from NASA's Cassini spacecraft focused on Saturn's northern stratosphere, a region hundreds of kilometers above the atmospheric hexagon. The shocking discovery came when they began observing a vortex far above the famous hexagon. One of the investigators says of their discovery, “As the polar vortex became more and more visible, we noticed it had hexagonal edges and realized that we were seeing the pre-existing hexagon at much higher altitudes than previously thought.” A 2018 ScienceAlert.com article states of the discovery, ”...since wind conditions change dramatically with altitude, the fact that the hexagon shape persists so much higher than the cloud tops is a baffling conundrum.” In other words, the evidence overwhelmingly favors the explanation that incoming Birkeland currents are the cause of both Saturn's polar hot spots and the mysterious hexagon structure. The Saturnian system provided even greater confirmation of Electric Universe theory in 2018 with the discovery of water in Saturn's atmosphere which is remarkably similar to water in Earth's oceans. In fact, it was well over half a century ago that Emanuel Velikovsky offered  the radical prediction that the source of Earth's water was Saturn, provided in an epoch when the planets were in close congregation. Thornhill's own investigation led him to conclude that Earth, Mars, and the Saturnian moon, Titan were all satellites of an object he refers to as proto-Saturn. In December of 2004, Thornhill predicted that spidery ravine networks, called Lichtenberg forms in electrical terms would be seen on Titan, not unlike the so-called “arachnoids” on Venus. He also stated it was unlikely that large craters would be observed, although mainstream investigators were expecting them in abundance. In the standard view of Titan, the moon is billions of years old, allowing plenty of time for massive impacts to scar the surface. In Thornhill's opinion, Titan shares a similar history to that of Venus. Both were born very recently by electrical ejection from a “gas giant.” In both cases, planetary scientists have proposed an ad hoc theory of massive planetary resurfacing which has erased many of the craters. A recent birth also removes the need for a global hydrocarbon ocean to supply over billions of years the methane observed in Titan's atmosphere, since methane is destroyed in the atmosphere by sunlight. That too was affirmed when the Huygens probe landed on a solid surface in what looks conventionally to be a drainage basin. However, the channels leading to that basin have the distinctive appearance of surface lightning scars and need not have been carved by a flowing liquid. To date, images returned of Titan reveal that large craters are almost non- existent. What they do show are the very Lichtenberg patterns of electrical discharge Thornhill had anticipated. Perhaps no Thornhill prediction was more dramatically affirmed than the one that shocked scientists with NASA's Deep Impact mission. As far back as October of 2001, after the announcement of NASA's 2005 mission  to the comet Temple 1, Thornhill wrote, ”Given the erroneous standard model  of comets it is an interesting exercise to imagine what surprises are in store for astronomers if the plan is successful. The electrical model suggests the likelihood of an electrical discharge between the comet nucleus and the copper projectile, particularly if the comet is actively flaring at the time. The projectile will approach too quickly for a slow electrical discharge to occur. So the energetic effects of the encounter should exceed that of a simple physical impact, in the same way that was seen with comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 at Jupiter.” 24 hours before the impact event in collaboration with the Thunderbolts.info group, Thornhill predicted that an electrical flash might precede the impact and explosion and that the explosion would be much more energetic than NASA anticipated. And this is precisely what happened on July 4, 2005. Other successful Thornhill predictions included: a surprising lack of increase in water production in the cometary coma, indicating a lack of subsurface water anticipated by astronomers; an unexpected lack of ice on the comet nucleus, or water in the immediate ejecta from impact; a sculpted comet surface with sharply defined craters, valleys, mesas and ridges, the precise opposite of what one expects of a “dirty snowball”; a rearrangement of the comet's jets due to charge distribution. And of course in the 16 years since the Deep Impact mission, the evidence in favor of the electric comet model has improved tremendously. The ESA's Rosetta mission to comet 67P revealed one surprise after another, including the obvious stratified rock and extreme planetary geology seen everywhere on the comet nucleus; the discovery of sand dunes and other impossible cometary features; the stunning absence of visible water ice; the discovery of molecular oxygen in defiance of the comet's origins in a primordial nebular cloud; the continued non-detection of so-called apertures which are thought to collimate comet jets; the puzzling double-lobed shape of the comet which is also seen routinely among asteroids; and even a completely unexpected electrical aurora emitted by the comet. In fact, in the many years since the predictions we've outlined were published, Thornhill has further developed his model of electro-gravity which explains among other things the rounding of cometary orbits by electrical discharge. Indeed, those who have followed these presentations understand space discovery has served as the ideal testing ground for the theoretical predictions of Thornhill's Electric Universe model as well  as the discipline of plasma cosmology. And of course these predictions become more powerful, when juxtaposed with the failed predictions and endless surprises for standard gravity-centric theory. This juxtaposition is both a gadfly for institutionalized science beckoning for change, and an invitation to all inquirers, both present and future, who are inspired to discover our Electric Universe.

Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info Part 2 of our interview with Wal Thornhill about the recently imaged "black hole". Well, I think it's fair to say that when it comes to conditions at the center of any galaxy, some of the most interesting data has to come from our own celestial neighborhood in the Milky Way. I remember last year, we reported on the "shocking discovery" that low-mass stars were forming just three light years away from the hypothetical supermassive black hole at Sagittarius A, and in fact I have in front of me a quote from a Phys.org report on that discovery. It states, "At this distance, tidal forces driven by the supermassive black hole should be energetic enough to rip apart clouds of dust and gas before they can form stars." But since the black hole's non-existence is not and has not been for a very long time on the table as a theoretical option for astrophysicists, this type of discovery, like countless others, is simply forgotten or at least no emphasis is placed upon it. So what are your thoughts on some of the best evidences in the Milky Way, which tell us that it is a plasmoid and not a black hole at the center of the galaxy? The stars that orbit that so-called black hole in Sagittarius A star, do so very rapidly which suggests, if you're using gravity in your equation, that the mass at the center of the, or the focus of that orbit is of the value they give, in millions of Suns or, you know, maybe even billions, and that's only because they're using the wrong force, we're talking about electromagnetic forces. The other thing is that it was pointed out, I think by Ed Dowdye, who's done valuable work on looking at gravitational, so called, gravitational lensing in pointing out that it doesn't make sense. He said that stars orbiting that black hole, particularly ones that may have an orbit that's tilted and passes either behind the black hole or very close to behind, should suffer gravitational lensing, and I've seen no evidence that in any of the telescopic observations of the Sagittarius A. And they've been following them now so I think other manage to observed complete orbit of at least one star, possibly more. The other thing was that there was a report of a cloud of material that was due to be sort of 'torn to shreds' as it went close to the black hole and that didn't happen. Well, of course we're not dealing with gravity, we're dealing with electrodynamics which is at the heart of real physics. That is, the fundamental physics of the universe is electrodynamics; gravity is merely a minor effect. We happen to live in an electrically neutral environment where gravity does have an effect that is noticeable, but even for us it is so weak that the entire Earth can't stop us from jumping away from it even if only for a second or so. Well, one of the most important phenomena we've talked about for years on Space News, is the pervasive filamentary structures, which we see everywhere in the cosmos. Filamentation of course, is produced by electric currents traveling through plasmas and of the question of what lies at the center of the Milky Way, over a year ago we reported on the discovery of a 2 ½ lightyear-long filament which appears to reach directly to the center of the Milky Way. So how does this discovery relate to the plasma cosmology theory of a plasmoid at the centers of galaxies? These filaments, and some of them are twisted, I believe also that they've seen a twisted pair of filaments heading into the Sagittarius A star region. The circuit that Hannes Alfven drew, all those decades ago, the Nobel-prize-winning plasma physicist, showed that the current, it has to be a circuit, if you've got an electric current, it must be part of the circuit, and he showed that the current would flow in along the Galactic arms to the plasmoid in the center and then out along the spin axis. And then, at some distance he didn't go into where, the circuit was completed but it was at some distance from the galaxy. Now, since he put forward that circuit, it's been discovered of course that galaxies tend to, seem to align their spin axes along, what you might call, cosmic strings and they're beginning now to be able to map these strings and these connections between galaxies. Now, none of this makes any sense from gravitational point of view, because gravitational forces are centered on a center of mass ― not along a line which filament is, so both Hannes Alfven and Halton Arp in his observational research into galactic forms and structures and behavior, all coincide and form the basis for Electric Universe cosmology. The very idea of curved space or space-time as he called it, he attached two words together with a hyphen, both of them are merely concepts, they're not physical things so how you curve non-physical concepts is a question that is not answered, and we're shown diagrams where you have a heavy object on what looks like a rubber sheet being deformed, the rubber sheet being deformed by the weight of this object. But that uses gravity to explain gravity, or to describe it and it doesn't make much sense, if you think about it. Deleting the force of gravity raises a simple question, well, what is it that stretches the spring on the balance that measures the kilo of, you know, potatoes? That is a force that we feel, a force, you know, we're very well aware of it when we fall over, you cannot just make it a trick of geometry. So that's the first problem, the major problem with black hole theory and the big bang is this idea that you can have a concentration of mass or energy at a point. Well, the point is non-physical, no physical object, not even a subatomic particle can occupy zero space and yet we see all kinds of mathematical concepts being put forward as being physical and this has created huge confusion. In fact, the language has become largely meaningless. Even more so, when you consider that there is no physical definition of the quantities mass and energy, there is no physical definition. Now, that means we don't understand E=mc². So come on Einstein, you know, tell us what you mean! Explain it, nobody can explain it at present, no physicists on Earth can explain it because they haven't defined their terms. And the problem has been the dominance of mathematicians in physics, rather than physicists and what we call natural philosophers. Those with a broader education, the ones who got us through the 19th century with the huge number of developments which actually brought us to the brink of the Electric Universe model in the 1870s with the Germans, Wilhelm Weber in particular and his electrodynamics law, that you don't hear about that, I never heard anything about that at university and when you look in the textbooks, you won't find anything about it. We are not given ideas to compare and think for ourselves and that is the failure of education these days, we're just given things to remember and facts which are not facts but conjectures quite often. The result is that you are unfit for the job once you leave University. I've said this before, you know, that electrical engineers are the ones who should be doing astrophysics because it is an electrodynamic universe, it is not a gravitational universe. Well, of all the issues we've talked about on Space News, I think the most powerful evidence for cosmic scale electric currents is of course cosmic magnetism. So but it's not technologically possible to directly measure electric currents, the way that scientists can infer their presence and their strength is indirectly through the magnetic fields that they must produce. So at every opportunity, I remind the audience just how recently mainstream gravity-centric cosmology downplayed or even dismissed the idea of cosmic scale magnetic fields. Here for maybe the third time, I'd like to read this quote from the 1999 online NASA feature which asked the question, do magnetic fields exist throughout space? And it states, "On the cosmological scale, there is no data to suggest that magnetic fields are present. They certainly are not important in the dynamics of the universe for any reasonable range of field strengths consistent with present observational constraints." So why don't you discuss what has actually been discovered about cosmic magnetism and why it's so important for the Electric Universe and Plasma Cosmology? Now, one of the beliefs that's inculcated in students and postdocs as well, at all levels in astrophysics, is that electricity plays no particular role in the universe which is quite incredible when you think of the use we have for electricity and that the universe has no use for it. And when you map magnetic fields which the radio telescopes have done for decades and more recent telescopes that are being built, which are able to do it even better, they find that the universe is almost, in fact they come to the point now, where they think that magnetic fields play a large role in star formation, because they've been able to map the magnetic fields in star forming regions inside molecular clouds. Now this kind of modern observation technique is showing more and more often the fact that magnetic fields are everywhere and not only that; they are structured, they're not chaotic, which is what the gravitational theory would have us believe that it's a shock-induced chaos and whatnot, but they find ordered fields, particularly around spiral galaxies. And you do not have a magnetic field without electric currents. Electric currents are absolutely necessary because you need  an accelerating force on a charged particle to generate the magnetic field and the ordered magnetic fields indicate ordered electric currents, all of which matches the filamentary nature of the universe which is also being discovered. 
Welcome to Space News  from the Electric Universe, brought to you by the Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts. info. In Part One of this presentation, physicist  Wal Thornhill introduced evidence for the extraordinary recent origins of  our planetary neighbor Venus. In myth and folklore around the entire globe, Venus was remembered as the great comet, as a dragon-like serpent  breathing fire about the heavens, and as a goddess with majestic, flowing hair. As noted previously, based on Venus's mythic identities, Dr. Immanuel Velikovsky was the only individual to correctly predict that Venus would be superhot. An even more outrageous prediction by Velikovsky was that the planet Saturn was the source of water in Earth's oceans. As we reported in 2018, this prediction received astonishing support when scientists wrote in the journal Icarus that water in Saturn's rings and satellites is remarkably like water on Earth. We  asked Wal to continue to explain his own reconstruction of our solar system's recent catastrophic history, and to reflect on the significance of recent science discoveries on this reconstruction. First, I think I need to give a warning. The Electric Universe identifies fundamental errors in science which have held back progress for more than a century. So what follows is entirely off the map of accepted science today. I mentioned earlier that we were a satellite of a brown dwarf star, Proto-Saturn. So, the answer to Velikovsky's prediction of Saturnian water on Earth requires a fundamental rethink about both nuclear physics and the century-old model of what stars are. Stars are not controlled thermonuclear explosions. Their steady light signals a simple control process. The Electric Universe model of stars was verified experimentally in 2019 by the SAFIRE project and proved stable and controllable. It proved that most of the Sun's radiant energy comes from the transmutation of light elements in the bright photosphere right in front of our eyes. Power like the Sun by thermonuclear fusion, has been  a colossally expensive pipe dream. It demonstrates the tunnel vision of experts. As for particle physics, a number of leading researchers have declared  the standard particle model is in crisis. But the Titanic steams on, ignoring the low energy nuclear icebergs that are being produced in laboratories now. Brown dwarfs are low-energy electric stars inside a bloated red anode glowing  shell. To give some idea. If Jupiter's magnetosphere were to be lit up, it  would appear at opposition the size of the full moon in our sky. Jupiter's large moons would orbit inside that glowing red sheath. Inside that huge bubble is the most hospitable environment for life, because the radiant energy received  by each satellite is evenly distributed over its entire globe. There are no seasons, no tropics, and no ice caps. The radiant energy from the plasma sheath of a brown dwarf star is strongest at the blue and red ends of the spectrum. L-type brown dwarfs have water as a dominant molecule in their spectra, along with many other biologically important molecules and elements. Satellites, like the Earth, would accumulate atmospheres from such a brown dwarf and water would mist down  continually, regardless of its spin and axial tilt. A satellite orbiting inside the  plasma sheath of a brown dwarf could experience an  ideal environment for life. However, the brown dwarf Garden of Eden comes with a caveat. Stars off the main sequence, without a bright photosphere, do not have the self-regulating photospheric discharge to smooth out variations in electrical power input. Consequently, brown dwarfs are subject to sudden outbursts or flaring, when they encounter a surge in the circuit that powers them. These flares will dump minerals and gases on the satellites orbiting inside the sheath. It sculpts their surfaces electrically and causes sudden extinction events, vast fallout deposits and  instant electrical fossilization. The last dramatic flaring event, “Let there  be Light,” signaled the breakup of the Proto-Saturnian system and  traumatized our prehistoric ancestors, giving rise to all of our creation myths and existential post-traumatic stress disorder. It was that dying gasp of Proto-Saturn that gave rise to a stream of material orbiting Saturn, described as the Ouroboros, or snake swallowing its tail. The matter piled up to form the radiant planet Venus. Saturn's icy rings are the bright remnant of that matter. The Earth, being  a much older satellite of Proto-Saturn, explains the origin of our amazing abundance of water and likely its saltiness, according to Velikovsky. Nitrogen on Earth and Titan are predominant in their atmospheres. This suggests very strongly that the natal atmosphere of Venus contained a lot of nitrogen. So  why is Venus's atmosphere today predominantly carbon dioxide? The  answer comes from the nitrogen being consumed at the surface and  converted to carbon monoxide. This reaction was observed by the leading French scientist Louis Kervran when he found welders being poisoned with carbon monoxide, yet there was none in the air. He found that the red hot surface of iron that they were welding was energizing the nitrogen molecules which were then breathed in, and on the substrate of the lung the energy was converted to carbon monoxide. In other words the nitrogen molecule, the nitrogen nuclei, joined to become two different nuclei,  carbon and oxygen. Two nitrogen gives carbon and oxygen. So, this was demonstrated experimentally by professor Louis Kervran. So, now we have on the surface of Venus  carbon monoxide being formed from the nitrogen. On Venus, the high surface temperature and the water in the atmosphere, (remembering that we must have  had a considerable amount of water also in the atmosphere), come together in a well-known industrial reaction to form carbon dioxide  and hydrogen. The lighter hydrogen is being lost and has been detected in  space. Now to confirm this model, the early Venus landers discovered that water  vapor was present in the atmosphere, but decreased strangely on approach to the  surface. This fits the suggested model. But most importantly, the latest discovery of the decrease in nitrogen as we approach the surface of Venus, offers further support, because there we have the welder's hot surface energizing the nitrogen and converting it into carbon and oxygen, or carbon monoxide. Earlier, I  mentioned the entire planet is said to have been resurfaced by some unknown process. The far simpler explanation that Venus is an infant, simply  doesn't occur. As for the network of filamentary scars, they  encircle the planet in the low latitudes. Venus was remembered by the  ancients as a radiant star. The reconstruction of events show Venus with a variable number of distinct streamers radiating outwards, like the petals of a cosmic flower. This  pattern is seen, looking down the barrel of certain plasma discharge experiments here on Earth. The filamentary pattern around the equator of Venus is to be expected  under these conditions, since an electrical discharge in the very dense atmosphere of Venus will switch from being diffuse in space to becoming very narrow lightning channels under these conditions. The extreme energy of the cosmic lightning is sufficient to sculpt the arachnoid features and bizarre pancake domes. In the case of Titan I proposed that it was also a relatively young satellite of our brown dwarf. I wrote in 2004, “That Titan may be  young as hinted at by its eccentric orbit, which cannot have persisted for billions of  years... Like Venus, surface temperatures are globally uniform on Titan within a few degrees. It is thought that there is a greenhouse effect operating on Titan. However,  the heat of Venus is due to its origin and has nothing to do with the greenhouse effect. The same will likely be true for Titan.” Like Venus, Titan seems not to have a magnetic field and yet it has a distinct magneto-tail. Titan's electrical plasma interactions  may be like those of Venus. Titan also shines on the dayside  in ultraviolet light too brightly to be explained by solar radiation.” To sum up, the best possible indication we could have that our reconstruction of events is real and accurate, is the novelty and specificity of our successful predictions. Having a good model allows better questions and experiments in future. It allows us to halt the terrible waste today in education, manpower and massive public  funds on misguided experiments on big science. The Electric Universe  is inspiring participation by the public, by garage experimenters who are reproducing features on planetary surfaces using electric discharges. Science is a cultural activity and should be open to all to participate. The  modern cult of the narrowly trained expert must end. The world is far more complex than any of our pet theories can deal with. Only the broadest perspective can reveal the interconnectedness of our Electric Universe and guide  us to the science of the future. [Music] 
Well I think I'll start with what I call a “head” note. You've heard of footnotes, right? Well “prologue” sounds a little formal and so I’m calling it a “head” note. My first experience with the Electric Universe conference was 15 years ago. I believe the group was called Kronia then and much smaller; maybe eight speakers, maybe 40 attendees. At first, the subject matter really mystified me, and the context of what the different speakers were talking about and how it intertwined, was a mystery. But I was really fortunate, I sat next to the late Amy Acheson, a brilliant mind and one of the pioneers of this group. Back then I think it was called Kronia. It wasn't called EU then. Amy patiently answered every question, but I scribbled on paper and shoved at her during the conference. And she'd whisper back and she'd write the answers. During breaks and during lunch she'd answer more questions. Eventually, Amy became a very good friend and my mentor. It wasn't long before all those questions got patiently answered by Amy, that I got it and I was hooked. Through the years, I have come to understand the Electric Universe more and more and have made many dear friends, many of whom I see out there today. I wish Amy were here today, to see how the EU has grown, expanded not only in size, but in context for the speakers. The talk I'm about to give is my way of passing on Amy’s mentoring and hopefully help those of you who are new to the EU, to see the big picture. There are many paths to discovering the nature of our universe. Established members of the Electric Universe, Dave Talbott, Wal Thornhill, Ev Cochrane, Dwardu Cardona, have been focusing on different aspects of the nature of the world that surrounds us. And yet they have to offer interconnections, the ways that interconnect in an intriguing way. Those interested in the EU, who specialize in the areas of planetary history, mythology electricity, plasma, geology, archaeology and prehistoric man, often have hypotheses that interconnect and support each other, and thus suggesting a history and a present-day understanding of our universe that is revolutionary and compelling. A fascination with the universe that surrounds us, dates back to an age long before there were telescopes, space probes, or shuttle missions. When prehistoric man cast his eyes to the heavens, pictographs of a great diversity of early cultures independently depict man's fascination with, and fear of, what he observed. Myths and lore tell of strange and violent events, terrifying dramas in the heavens, and catastrophic changes in the cosmic order itself. Early man built temples to the heavenly figures he worshipped as gods. The myths and pictographs of antiquity clearly show that at one time, our eyes saw a vastly different sky from what astronomers view in their instruments today. As Wal Thornhill has stated, today's narrowly compartmentalized specialists have a form of tunnel vision, because they are not trained to see any relevance in other fields than their own. Or merely refer to observations no more than a few years old. Don Scott has observed that most astrophysicists’ education stops with Einsteinian gravity and have little or no knowledge of electrical science, and thus come up with convoluted explanations for phenomena they don't understand, or they call mysteries: black holes, dark energy, string theory and the Big Bang. At one of our EU conferences Pierre Marie Robitaille presented impressive fundamental scientific evidence that one of the favorite, universally applied principles of astrophysics is not as generally valid as had been assumed. Kirchhoff's law of radiation, together with Max Planck's derivation of it, are often assumed to be applicable in about just any case, even when they really are not. The idea that a peak in the emissivity characteristic from any body whatsoever, will reveal the exact temperature of that object, no matter what it's composition, is fatally flawed. Pierre Marie and Stephen Crothers, an expert mathematician, have published a groundbreaking paper, ”The Theory of Heat Radiation Revisited.” Pierre Marie has given numerous presentations, (he'll be giving another one here today, or at least during this conference), pointing out that many previously accepted research results are fatally flawed. Their work, as with so many other EU researchers, have been met by the establishment with denial, derision or been ignored. Ev Cochrane, author of the book, “The Many Faces of Venus”, observes that the recent history of the scientific investigation of Venus, reveals a vast theoretical graveyard of discarded hypotheses, false deductions, erroneous premises, shoddy observations, and wishful thinking. While many astronomers, Carl Sagan among them, expected the Venusian clouds to be composed of water, Mariner 9 found precious little water and plenty of concentrated sulfuric acid. Cochrane notes that where leading astronomers observed luxuriant Venusian vegetation in full bloom, modern space probes discovered a barren desiccated wasteland. Indeed, if truth be known, the Mariner, Magellan and Pioneer missions have forced astronomers to radically revise their previous assessment as to Venus's origin, nature and geological history. Cochrane states than on virtually every major feature of the Venusian landscape and atmosphere, the astronomers’ theoretical expectations have been proved wrong, time and time again. Given this dismal record, there would appear to be some justification for maintaining a healthy skepticism with respect to astronomers’ current best guesses as to what is possible regarding Venus's recent history, or possibly that of other planets as well. Indeed, there are good reasons for believing that other, even more radical revisions of our understanding of Venus are in order. Many traditional astronomers and mythologists dismiss early stories and drawings as the fantasies of primitive cultures, lacking an understanding of what they saw. However, comparative mythologists Dave Talbott, Ev Cochrane and Dwardu Cardona, have found that there is a consistent pattern in these stories. When many different, widely separated cultures, tell the same story, the probability exists that these are not mere flights of fancy, but valid observations. If astronomers today were to re-examine their assumptions about what is and is not possible in the cosmos, and take a new and unbiased look at the pictures coming back from NASA's probes, as well as the images from their own telescopes, they would find strong evidence to support a view of cosmology different from the one espoused by mainstream astronomers. One that ancient man saw all too clearly. Dave Talbott notes that in earlier times, man worshipped heavenly bodies as gods. Myths proclaimed, we once lived in the presence of gods. Gods were visible powers, often capricious and frequently violent. The priestly astronomers of ancient Mesopotamia and elsewhere, made clear that these remarkable powers were planets. If the myths surrounding these gods were to be taken seriously, they raised many questions. Why did ancient man worship the god Saturn? The planet Saturn is very difficult for the average person to even find in the sky today. Some mythologies postulate that there is evidence in ancient lore to connect the scarred warrior hero of legend with the god Mars. Yet the planet we know as Mars is only a tiny speck in the sky and its deep 2,400 mile long scar canyon, Valles Marineris cannot be seen from Earth without a powerful telescope. Why did the ancients depict Venus as a fiery dragon, as a goddess with flowing hair, when that planet is merely a bright dot in the sky today. The myths of many ancients tell of violent thunderbolts in interaction between the gods. Of course, we see lightning in the (sky) today, but never thunderbolts that streak between planets. What could have caused these violent interactions long ago? Because of their understanding of plasma, electrified gas, that makes up 90% of our universe, Wal Thornhill and Don Scott have formulated some reasonable hypotheses as to the cause of such violent interactions of the past. Relating to the present electric sky, Scott has studied the behavior of plasma in the form of Birkeland currents (I think you've heard of that), and spoke at the last two EU conferences about their counter-rotating currents (I think you've seen that picture recently too), that are descending on the North Pole of Saturn. Shortly after he showed diagrams of his hypotheses of these rotating current Birkeland currents, shortly after, not long, a video produced by NASA appeared on the Internet clearly showing exactly what Scott had predicted. And yet, his proposal of just such a thing, and the reason for it, has been ignored. Another hypothesis, and the reason for it that proved to be real, was Thornhill's prophecy that, if a comet were to be impacted by a block of copper, as NASA announced it proposed to do, a powerful electrical discharge would occur shortly before impact. Although NASA never predicted such a possibility, this is exactly what happened. Since that event, Thornhill's explanation of the electrical discharge has either been ignored or denigrated, most likely because those in the astrophysical world have developed a collective mindset against any sort of electrical causality in the universe. An excellent resource for information about the Electric Universe is the website Picture Of the Day, managed by the industrious EU scholar. Thunderbolts picture of the day remember it and check it out. You'll get a lot of interesting information there. Prehistoric man was also fascinated by our universe, as are Scott and Thornhill today, but often what the ancients chose to depict has little bearing on what we see in the cosmos. Talbott notes that pictographs show what is commonly considered to be the Sun as a huge disk, with a smaller one in the center, often with rays flowing out of it. With a third darker circle superimposed in the center. Our Sun looks nothing like that. In many different cultures we see the symbol of a Crescent with a star at the center. How could this be, when there is no star or planet closer to Earth than our Moon to form such a configuration. And most importantly, why do so many... .... and most importantly why do so many disparate and far-flung ancient cultures, people who could never have come in contact with one another, such as the Sumerians, Egyptians, Chinese, Native Americans, Mayans, Babylonians, Australian Aboriginals and many others, all tell the same story and draw similar pictures? If these ancient writings were based on valid observations, rather than fantasy, what do they tell us? Cardona, Cochran and Talbott theorize that Earth formerly moved in a linear alignment of planets, (which I think is the picture that's been here a little early) having no resemblance to our current solar system. As seen from Earth, several planets appear together as a towering form in the northern sky. In its stable phase the planets moved in collinear equilibrium. They stayed in a line as they moved through space. For observers on Earth, the result was a unified configuration in the heavens, visually dominated by a large glowing planet, one we theorize to have been Saturn, then seen without its present ring system. This highly unusual planetary assembly was centered on our North Pole. it was regarded around the world as the cosmic center, the theater of the Gods. Talbott offers that this can only mean that the axis of the earth was directed along a line running through the collinear system. When the earliest religious texts and mythological sources are permitted to speak for themselves, this is precisely the arrangement they describe. What the ancients were seeing when they depicted the Sun as three concentric disks, was a different alignment of planets from the one we see today. They suggest that at one time, Earth was in a different polar alignment, an alignment Talbot, Cochrane and Cardona theorize as having been Saturn, Venus and Mars. The large outer disk in the pictographs being Saturn; the next inner disk representing Venus, often with rays emanating from it; and the center dark or red disk being Mars. The view of a crescent with a star- like body at its center is impossible. However, if it would indeed be the scene viewed from Earth in its polar alignment, if the Crescent were Saturn somewhat illuminated by the Sun, and the star-like object Mars, superimposed upon Venus. Interdisciplinary physicist Wal Thornhill ventures that at one time, Earth may have been in the protective aura of a cool brown dwarf star, the proto-Saturn which provided an ideal atmosphere for life on Earth. Given this configuration, Earth would have been bathed in Saturn's constant beneficent glow, with no difference between day and night, and a continual benign single season. This would have been the ”time before time” that Dave Talbott theorizes ,was the golden age, the age of perfect virtue, or Garden of Eden, depicted in one way or another in all diverse myths and religions. our early forebears portrayed celestial events through ritual reenactment and storytelling, bringing the original celestial personalities down to earth, to become legendary ancestors of those telling the stories. By this identification with the gods, nations the world over became the special children of the mythic creator and the creator himself often metamorphosed into a legendary first king, or god, of the land. Sacred activity was enacted the world over, as humans relived cosmic events on Earth. Two primal motifs stand out: a nostalgia for the lost paradise of the Golden Age, and a fear of doomsday. A fear of Doomsday's return, fueling collective war, sacrifice and guilt. A group of astronomers, physicists, electrical engineers and experts in the field of ancient mythology, have begun to challenge some of the generally accepted hypotheses of the history of our solar system, and conventional theories of cosmology, and agree that our solar system had a catastrophic past. A common theme in the myths and religions of many disparate cultures, is of a doomsday that brought the Golden Age to an end. Could it be that a disturbance and the Saturn polar alignment was the doomsday these cultures each independently remembered? The exact cause of the eventual breakup of this polar alignment, is a mystery. It may have been the result of a close pass- by of an asteroid, or a comet. Perhaps an inherent instability of the alignment resulted in its natural dissolution. Whatever the cause of the break-up, we know the final result is what we see today: the placid, almost circular, well-separated orbits of our present solar system. Dwardu Cardona hypothesized that what became known as the creation, did not proceed out of nothing but out of a pre-existing chaotic substance that was, among other things, understood as a celestial ocean, circumscribing the sub-brown dwarf star that emitted the radiating light and that went down into mytho-history as Day One. Many skeptics say there is no mechanism that could have circularized the widely divergent paths of the planets that were ejected from the polar configuration. Electrical engineer Don Scott points out that plasma physics shows us that planets can interact electrically, if they are within each other's protective plasma sheets magnetospheres’ electrical repulsion that is alternately felt when the planet sheets intersect and then not felt when the sheets do not intersect, could circularize orbits relatively quickly. In addition, there is strong evidence that gravity and mass itself are dependent on electrical charge. Traveling along another path to present-day understanding of our universe, is Scott's suggestion that the workings of the Sun's photosphere can be characterized by and better understood via a detailed study of how an electronic transistor performs its functions within an electronic circuit. Several unique phenomena observed on and above the Sun's surface are relatively easily understood through the analogous behavior of Scott's transistor model of the Sun. Another question that relates to the enigma of how Earth is different today from ancient times is the size of the giant dinosaurs. Given what we know about mass-to-muscle ratio, there is no way these huge beasts could have held up their heads, much less walked in the gravity that we have at present. Could a different planetary arrangement and/or electrical charge on Earth have provided the decreased gravity they allowed these giants to stand up and walk? Although there are questions about the Earth's gravity at the time of the dinosaurs, it is widely acknowledged that their rapid demise was caused by a catastrophe. Somehow our gravity and our environment have changed, probably abruptly and perhaps repeatedly. It is well-known that there is a universal memory of doomsday- type catastrophes, from age-old tales of floods, fearsome thunderbolts in the sky, and an age of darkness that descended upon the Earth. The question is, how did these catastrophes come about. Certainly for the planets to change their alignments and gravity, cataclysms of gigantic proportions must have occurred. Islands in the Arctic that consists more of shattered bones than of earth, ancient cities submerged in oceans, sea shell fossils found on mountaintops, and behemoths found flash-frozen in the Arctic with palm fronds in their stomachs, are evidence of such violent events. Arcing and scarring are strong indications of past cataclysmic events in the solar system. Wal Thornhill proposes that the Valles Marineris scar on Mars may well have it been made by an electrical discharge and that the Grand Canyon in Arizona, right here, could have been formed in the same manner. The origin of the Grand Canyon has long been in controversy and geologists are presently rethinking their long-held theories in this area. Those in the EU ask, if the canyon were caused by a river, where is the delta, the debris and why are the so-called tributaries perpendicular, rather than at an angle, as is typical of river tributaries? From the air, the Grand Canyon resembles a Lichtenberg pattern, a pattern that is carved on a golf green, when the pole is hit by lightning. If you look at the Grand Canyon from the air that Lichtenberg pattern looks very much like the Grand Canyon. Thornhill points out in his work, The Electric Universe, that plasma pervades the solar system and arcing will occur when and if, charged bodies interact electrically. Makes sense to me. He proposes that it is just such arcing that has caused craters on planets, and asteroids, and moons, and even on Earth. He postulates that pictures of craters, coming back from our space probes, do not show a shape consistent with either the impact or volcanic models. Almost every crater we observe is round, not elliptical, as many of them would be, if the meteors were coming in at an angle. They have flat bottoms, often with conical central cones. The strata of the central peaks are undisturbed, and in many so-called ‘impact craters’, their walls are terraced. Secondary craters form on the rims of primary craters. Plasma physicist Dr. C.J. Ransom has simulated such craters in his Vemasat Laboratory via an electrical arc. Thornhill has demonstrated in the laboratory, that such characteristics are expected with electrical arcing, but not with impacts. On some small asteroids, the craters are huge, with diameters more than the asteroids’ radii. If these craters had been caused by impacts, surely the asteroids would have been destroyed. Are these craters caused by electrical arcing? That's the the phenomenon that was interpreted as the thunderbolts that raged between the gods, or planets, as described in ancient myths. A corollary to Thornhill's Electric Universe Theory, is a theory that engineer Ralph Juergens originated concerning the mechanism that powered the Sun. Following in Juergens’ path, Donald Scott contends that mainstream astronomy is attempting to ignore data that contradicts their accepted nuclear fusion model. He suggests that both the polar configuration and the electric hypotheses are strongly supported by research in the field of plasma science. Scott's carefully crafted mathematical model of Birkeland currents, shows how energy in electrical form is transported across huge distance in cosmic space, without being dissipated and diverted from its path. Scott was the first person to demonstrate that the magnetic field within a Birkeland current, reaches outward and remains effective at far greater distances than any other known type of cosmic phenomenon. He has explained the physical rationale for why the orbital distances of the planets from the Sun, correlate perfectly with certain properties of his Birkeland current model. Might the flowing hair of Venus, or the fiery dragon, as that planet is depicted in many ancient myths and drawings, actually have been the glowing ions of twisting Birkeland currents, or stringy things as mainstream calls them? Perhaps petroglyphs, showing ladder formations, and tales of a ladder to heaven, or Jacob's Ladder, might well be the sightings of Birkeland currents and plasma instabilities, such as those Tony Peratt has seen in his plasma laboratories at Los Alamos. It is interesting to note, how often a planet, a sphere, is included in pictures of a Chinese dragon. Astrophotographs taken at Mount Palomar and Mount Wilson by astronomer Halton Arp, have removed one of the main linchpins supporting standard modern cosmology. Astronomers traditionally assume that, if an object such as a galaxy strongly exhibits a quality called positive redshift, then that object must be 1) receding rapidly away from us and 2) very distant. This assumption has led astronomers to pronounce the existence of such counterintuitive notions as Big Bang, missing matter, black holes, neutron stars, dark energy and expanding curved space. Dozens of Arp’s photographs provide strong evidence that the ‘redshift equals distance’ assumption is wrong. Arp theorized, based not only on his own photographs, but also an images being taken by X-ray satellites such as ROSAT, that there is an evolutionary process of galaxy birth and maturation. Young objects are born from the active nuclei of parent galaxies. These youngsters are called quasars or BL Lac objects. They are often ejected symmetrically from the parent galaxy along its semi- major polar axis, perpendicular to the plane of the parent. This ejection process is strongly supported by the Electric Plasma Universe theory of Thornhill, Scott and Peratt. The thread that connects all of these innovative researchers is they're willing to base their hypotheses on the data they observe and change these hypotheses as new data is received. Too often, scientists stop asking questions and try to adjust new incoming data to their preconceived and accepted theories. The Electric Universe proponents, representing a variety of disciplines, are aware of how vastly different fields that date back to the earliest of time, can intertwine and discover rational new hypotheses about our universe. The most important element in the search for truth is the asking of questions. The advocates of the Saturn model polar configuration and the Electric Universe are asking fundamental questions, based upon what they have observed on the paths of discovery they have taken, and as a result have proposed some reasonable hypotheses. All they ask now is that they be listened to and that the listeners open their eyes and their minds to the possibility of new paths to discovery of some very reasonable ideas. Thank you. 
welcome to space news from the electric universe brought to you by the thunderbolts project at Thunderbolts dot info on Friday March 6 the NASA Dawn spacecraft entered the orbit of the mysterious dwarf planet Ceres with a craft scheduled to begin sending images to earth in April for several weeks surprising and unexplained bright spots within a crater on the planet's surface have generated enormous buzz in popular media the very limited speculations on these mysterious bright spots have ranged from exposed ice to water vapor to salt flats or even a quote volcano like feature on the tiny planet it's interesting that Ceres which was once classified as an asteroid has no nearby gravitational influences to create tidal heating which might generate the plumes the mechanism planetary scientists have used to try to explain the so called volcanic plumes on the Jovian moon Io recently planetary geologist Emily lacta Wallow reported on the theory of at least one scientist that the bright feature on Ceres is a form of so-called outgassing lacta Walla writes as Sarah's his globe rotates and the 80 kilometer craters rim rotates into view that rim should block our ability to see the bright feature on the floor of the crater however the bright feature is already visibly bright as the crater begins to rotate into view therefore it must be vertically above the rim of the crater it must be some kind of plume it's interesting that so-called outgassing is also the mechanism that astronomers frequently cite when attempting to explain the astonishing spectroscopic readings of comets and vast distances from the Sun where the environment is much too cold for solar warming to sublimate the Comets invisible theoretical subsurface ices countless comet mysteries might finally be resolved if scientists were willing to entertain electrical discharge activity on a comet as noted in several recent space news episodes the discovery of greatly enhanced electron fluxes close to the nucleus of Comet 67p is a confirmation of the electric comet theory which states that a comet will emit electrons as its discharged activity increases the visibility of the plume vertically above the rim of a crater and the location of the brightest of the two bright spots at the center of the crater are not a coincidence if electrical arcing is happening on Ceres in electrical discharge experiments we routinely see central craters or central Peaks that match precisely countless puzzling craters seen on planetary surfaces so-called bull's-eye craters which are craters with central craters within our long-standing puzzle for planetary scientists we note that immediately around the crater with the mysterious bright spots we see what appear to be at least two such bullseye craters consider the side-by-side comparison of the surface of Ceres and a picture of anode crater formation in an electrical discharge machining process the electric universe theory states that craters seen on asteroids comets and planetary surfaces are primarily the result of electrical discharges at a vast variety of scales the opportunity may now exist for scientists to witness the active electrical excavation of a planetary surface such a process on an electrically active comet has already been witnessed dramatically on comet Tempel 1 prior to the Deep Impact mission in 2005 scientists had suggested that the comet nucleus lost about one third of a meter of depth in each orbit when the star does next spacecraft reimaged the comet nucleus in 2010 it found that the wall of the most prominent Mesa had astonishingly retreated dozens of meters the excavation of material appeared to be precisely focused at the location of the mysterious pixel saturation which according to proponents of the electric universe was the focal point of electric arcs we note it is still too early to form any final conclusions about the nature of the bright spots on Ceres and we eagerly await images from the dawn spacecraft in Perle however has repeatedly demonstrated on this series space news from the electric universe theoretical models based on the notion of an electrically sterile in disconnected solar system have resulted in continuous surprises and unexplained mysteries the electric universe theory states that both comets and asteroids will experience varying degrees of electrical stresses depending on their orbits and will electrically discharge in response to a potential difference in their plasma environment given that the solar wind is primarily composed of protons representing a positively charged region of space it is only appropriate to consider the effects of this potential difference on commentary and asteroid 'el activity we suggest it is inevitable that this possibility will begin to creep into mainstream astronomical literature consider the 2011 paper of the russian scientist in the dog entitled space observations of comets during solar flares while the paper does not include the electric universe concept of electric circuits in space it does describe a capacitor like breakdown occurring between a comet's charged sub surface and a differently charged surface due to arriving protons from the Sun it Madhab writes an irradiation of a certain class of comet nuclei having positive brightness correlation with solar activity by intense solar cosmic rays fluxes of high-energy protons and positive ions ejected from the Sun during strong solar flares can possibly produce impulse and gamma hard x-rays due to high voltage electric discharge in the subsurface layer of the comet until recently the dwarf planet series was officially classified as an asteroid and in recent years scientists have acknowledged that the distinctions between an asteroid and a comet are increasingly unclear as noted in a 2013 space news episode astronomers were stunned when the asteroid P 2013 P 5 suddenly produced six comet-like tails the asteroid has since been officially reclassified as a main belt comet the ad-hoc theory some scientists have proposed is that an increase in the asteroid spin rate caused dust material to fly off into space where it is stretched and confined by solar radiation in a recent scientific paper astronomers have also proposed that an increase in the spin rate of the asteroid P 2012 f5 actually caused the asteroid to explode however we suggest it is not a coincidence that comets also suddenly disintegrate even at remarkably vast distances from the Sun much too far for solar warming to cause the explosions are the bright spots on Ceres electrical in nature while it is again too early to form any final conclusions we do make the following prediction with great confidence all theoretical models that fail to recognize the planet as a charged body will only result in further surprises and confusion for forthcoming updates on NASA's Dawn mission to Ceres stay tuned to space news from the electric universe for continuous updates

[Music] Throughout the 20th century, the science of comparative mythology has been characterized by an ever-increasing specialization and narrowing of interest. Unifying theories of myth are nowhere to be found. The so-called Saturn theory represents a notable exception in this regard. Proponents of the theory, including David Talbott and myself, have argued that extraordinary astronomical events in the relatively recent prehistorical period, had profound and formative influence on all primary institutions of human culture, including mythology, religion language, monumental architecture, funerary practices, marriage ritual, cosmology, athletics, dance and music. Stated this boldly, our historical reconstruction seems so ambitious as to inspire incredulity. Once the evidence is fully laid out however, it speaks for itself. While it would be impossible to summarize a lifetime of research within a 10-minute presentation, and we intend to use the next several videos to illustrate some of the most salient evidence supporting the theory, interested viewers can turn to our manifold publications for additional information. A testimony of ancient religion is especially compelling. In ancient  Mesopotamia and Egypt, the principal gods are identified with celestial bodies. In the earliest strata of Mesopotamian Uruk, conventionally dated the last  third of the fourth millennium BCE, it is the worship of the planet Venus as Innana that predominates. So too at the dawn of history in Egypt, the leading  god Horus, is explicitly identified with a star. In our reconstruction that star is Mars. And yet mainstream scholars rarely ask the all-important question, why planetary bodies assumed this prominent role in the oldest religious texts? The evidence from the earliest written languages corroborates this picture. Writing was first invented in ancient Mesopotamia in the fourth millennium BCE and the earliest script was pictographic in nature. I.e. the vast majority of the written signs were pictures of the object being described. For example, a foot  signified a foot or, ‘to walk’. In perfect keeping with our hypothesis that the earliest gods were astronomical in nature, Sumerian scribes denoted the concept of God with an eight-pointed star. This is a so-called ‘An’-sign. The  earliest pictograph for Inanna Venus in turn, depicted a comet-like object. Our theory, and our theory alone, can explain these facts. The first  gods were identified with the most prominent celestial bodies and the queen of heaven, as Venus, spent a portion of her early career as a comet-like body. The Saturn theory is most famous perhaps for the claim that a giant pillar-like structure formerly spanned the circumpolar heavens and seemingly linked together a number of nearby planets. Hence the name polar configuration coined by Talbott, the subject of much controversy over the decades. While it is well documented that the mythological traditions of cultures around the globe celebrated a luminous world pillar in the sky, critics tend to be skeptical of the testimony from ancient myth. It is here that the evidence encoded in monumental architecture is especially instructive and difficult to explain away. Witness the towering pyramidal structures and ziggurats in Egypt and Mesopotamia that took thousands of people and multiple generations to construct. The ziggurat at Ur, for example, is estimated to have weighed several hundred thousand tons. What could possibly have possessed the ancient sky watchers to erect these towering structures? What were  they intended to represent? According to terminology applied to the monumental structures by the builders themselves, the answer is patently obvious. The ziggurats represented the world mountain, atop which the planetary  gods lived, loved and died. Thus it is that among the earliest Sumerian names for the ‘ziggurat’ are ’giant mountain’ and ‘stairway to heaven’. And to whom were these first ziggurats constructed and devoted? To the aforementioned star gods Inanna Venus and An. The earliest ziggurats and pyramids, like sacred architecture everywhere, were specifically patterned upon the unique celestial configuration overhead in accordance with the prevailing philosophy of ’as above, so below’. It stands to reason accordingly, that early monumental structures will include a number of telltale architectural details that have no conceivable function or rationale in the present natural world, and point instead to the unique features of the polar configuration. As a case in point, consider the massive set of shiny horns that formally adorned the apex of early ziggurats. At the tail end of the third millennium king Gudea of Lagash could be found boasting of a ziggurat quote “One makes the house grow upwards like a mountain, ...makes it lift its horn like a bull.” How on earth is it possible to explain this bizarre bovine imagery? For  anyone familiar with the writings of Talbott and myself, the answer is obvious. The gigantic crescentine horns model the heaven-spanning crescent that formerly distinguished the polar configuration during one particularly memorable phase in its history. But you don't have to take our word for it. An archaic pictograph from China dating the third millennium BCE is believed to depict the mountain of the Sun. While the image in question has no conceivable reference in the present sky, it illustrates perfectly a central claim of the Saturn theory, namely  that a crescent formally adorned the world mountain and served as the perch of the primordial Sun God. Human institutions, not surprisingly, were indelibly impacted by the unique and awe-inspiring events associated with the polar configuration. The institution of kingship offers a perfect example. It  will be remembered here that Sumerian tradition held that kingship had originally descended from heaven. Early kings in Mesopotamia, Egypt and Mesoamerica referred to themselves as the son of the land and modeled their behavior in accordance with the mythical behavior ascribed to the prototypical son. If the prototypical son engaged in sexual intercourse with the planet Venus, the Sumerian king made a public show of simulating sex with Inanna Venus in order to legitimize his hold on the throne and signal his own divinity. So too, if the prototypical son was said to have formerly appeared as a diminutive orb at the breast of Venus, the Sumerian king had himself depicted in monumental artworks as a babe at the breast of Inanna or  Ishtar. If the prototypical son fought apocalyptic wars against the powers of chaos, the kings of Sumer in Babylon purposely sought out barbarian hordes to  vanquish. This while proclaiming that the warrior goddess Venus accompanied them at their side, protecting them from all harm and guaranteeing victory. The  sacred garments of kings reveal the clear imprint of extraordinary astronomical events. Check out the royal garb of the Assyrian king. It is as if the king wrapped himself in iconic stellar images, namely  those of the primordial son and Venus. It will be noted that not one of these images has any recognizable counterpart in the current sky. In the earliest attested rituals of royal investiture, each and every detail of the king's regalia reflected the celestial original. Crown worn by the king for example, was expressly modeled upon that worn by the prototypical son at the time of beginning and is identifiable with the planet Venus. Thus it is that Sumerian hymns report that the ancient Sun God tied on a mush band as a crown, wherein the word  'mush' is the aforementioned comet-like pictograph denoting Inanna Venus. The local king following a long tradition, tied on his mush crown in  imitation of the celestial prototype. Nearly two thousand years later, Assyria's great king Esarhaddon reiterated this belief, claiming of Inanna Venus that quote “She guards me like the crown on my head.” What is true in ancient Mesopotamia is also true in Egypt and Mesoamerica. There too the king tied on a headband crown carefully modeled upon the planet  Venus. Thus it is that the Egyptian ‘seshed’ headband shows the same spiraling form and  two flowing streamers as a Sumerian mush sign. The word ‘seshed’, as Talbott and I pointed out 30 years ago, means ‘comet’. Recall here the statement from a third millennium Sumerian hymn quoted in our previous video wherein the king invoked Venus as follows “The ever- sparkling lady gives me my kingship.” The word translated as ever sparkling here is mul-mul-e = “to shine, or radiate”, a verb formed from the Sumerian word for star: mul=”star” and hence referring to the luminous splendor of Venus itself. The clear import of this passage accordingly is that kingship is a gift of the planet Venus. Venus's profound influence on ancient conceptions of kingship is simply one of hundreds of archetypal mythological motifs that conventional scholarship has no answer for. Our historical reconstruction on the other hand, explains the connection with an unrivaled elegance and logical rigor. Truth be told, in order to achieve a fact-based history of our solar system, it is sometimes necessary to ignore the strictures of modern science and pay careful heed to the testimony of ancient myth.

[Music] The atomic model has remained unchanged for a long time and yet there are many mysteries that this model has not been able to unlock. Some nuclear reactions are very well known and have been thoroughly studied. One would therefore expect that we know all there is to know about such reactions and that we understand how the products are created. One problem is predicting how the larger atoms split. Why does uranium split asymmetrically, if the nucleus is simply a collection of neutrons and protons jumbled randomly in the center. If we examine the simple case of an alpha particle emission, this also  throws up many problems. One of these relates to the size of the nucleus itself. We know that protons and neutrons have size. This means that the nucleus must have a size which relates to these sizes. If we add into this the fact that in the Standard Model, the position of the protons and neutrons are thought to be random, then it would imply that to emit an alpha particle, the internal protons and neutrons must rearrange themselves to form this prior to being ejected. This becomes more complex as we examine larger and larger atoms that always seem to produce the same products. The nucleus would need to  undergo significant rearrangement in order to accomplish this. And this  requires space within the nucleus to allow the particles to move to their correct location. If we examine the width of the nucleus and compare this to the width of the individual particles that make up the nucleus, we find that there is simply no room to allow this to happen. It would appear as if the atoms  are in a very dense packing state at all times, which would not allow for any rearrangement of the particles. And this implies that the nucleus must have structure. And this is something that Edo Kaal has spent the last 12 years working on and now has a team of people working on it. Unhappy with the many problems with  the current model, he set himself the challenge of redefining the structure of the atom. The basic premise of the Structured Atom Model or SAM for short, is beautifully simple. The neutron is not considered a fundamental particle. Instead  it is redefined as a proton- electron pair. The nucleus therefore only contains protons and what are called inner electrons. These inner electrons are used to bind the protons together, acting as a kind of glue. In order to bind two protons together, we require one inner electron. One proton and inner electron are therefore equivalent to what was called the neutron. Overall,  the charge of the nucleus does not change. But the important point is that the force which holds the protons together inside the nucleus, is the electrostatic force, not the strong nuclear force. This also explains why a neutron will  decay to an electron and a proton and an antineutrino within 15 minutes of leaving the nucleus, and why the charge of the neutron is zero and its mass is slightly more than that of a proton. The force holding the proton in the nucleus will attract inwards towards the center of the structure, causing the formation of specific geometric shapes which form platonic solids that have triangular faces, like the tetrahedron and the icosahedron. These form the building blocks from which the larger nuclear structures are built. The SAM team have produced a new periodic table that shows a plausible structural configuration for each element. The structural pattern, combined with  the principle of densest packing, drive the various observable nuclear physics phenomena, including which nuclear reactions are possible, the tendency to fission and probable isotopic variations that may exist. It is well known that transmutation can occur under laboratory conditions. However current models are not capable of providing an explanation for how this might occur. The SAM model contains the components for a theoretical basis for the transmutation of  metals. This in turn will clear the way for finally resolving the mystery of cold fusion or low energy nuclear reactions. We also think transmutations play a key role in biology and again here SAM can help to understand these vital processes in more detail. One of the main insights obtained from the SAM model is that the inner nuclear structure dictates the chemical properties of the element. Being able to visualize the nucleus can potentially provide structural clues about the outer electron configuration. SAM has also been able to identify several cases of potentially missing elements, solely from the vacancies in the new periodic table. They identified structural shapes  that can be used to make predictions about the chemical properties of these missing elements. In cosmology it is thought that the elements are created through a variety of processes in stars. The lighter elements from carbon to sulfur are created by fusion reactions, while elements in the iron group originate mostly in supernova explosions, and elements beyond iron are made in high-mass stars by slow neutron capture, and by rapid neutron capture in violent interactions of rare supernova variants or compact stellar collisions. The narrative of the origin of the elements is being challenged by the SAM  model. The realization that element transmutation does occur in relatively benign environments, suggests that this depiction of nuclear synthesis may be flawed. An alternative possibility put forward by the SAM team is that the heavy elements beyond iron are created in situ on the planets. This would occur in intense electrical discharges. Related to this, electrical discharges are the  prime suspect for the occurrence of transmutation in Earth geology. One consequence of this, is that the dating of geological layers becomes questionable since the transmutation alters the decay rate of elements. SAM provides insights that no other model is capable of doing. They  explain how each element is structured; why the isotopes of an element differ from each other; where the cycle of 8 comes from; and why it breaks down. It not only explains why elements become unstable after lead, but also why alpha decay happens in some elements and yet not others, and why uranium-235 splits asymmetrically, and the origin of the neutron drip line. SAM is a radically different way of looking at the  atom that brings with it a simple approach that is easily understood. Simple rules create the structure of the elements and these in turn determine, not only their properties, but also determine how they will interact or break down to form other elements on a predictable basis. The key underlying assumption is simply that the particles are held in the nucleus by one force: the electrostatic force. It removes the need for the strong force and also questions the existence of the many exotic particles that physicists have dreamt up. This is just  a brief overview of the SAM model. If you are interested in a deeper understanding of SAM, and how it can explain things like, for  example why certain elements are unstable; how nuclear reactions would work; how it could explain transmutations; then please see the SAM playlist on my channel, or head over to the SAM website where you can also pre-order their new book.

[Music] My first foray into comparative mythology was the book Martian Metamorphoses, a compendium of traditions about the Red Planet from antiquity until modern times. There I documented that Mars was conceptualized as the archetypal warrior hero, and as a central player in the catastrophic natural events attending creation and the ordering of the cosmos. My basic strategy was to investigate the earliest literary and astronomical texts, mentioning Mars, to see if recurring patterns could be found. In time I succeeded in identifying well over 200 motifs associated with the red planet, including dragon slayer, eclipse agent and fire god. Many of these motifs are shared by Mars gods around the globe: compelling evidence that they trace to the witness behavior of the planet Mars in relatively recent prehistoric times. The picture that emerged from my research, is that Mars represented an awe-inspiring celestial form, one  prone to drastic distortions in its relative size and luminosity, to say nothing of its propensity for hurling great thunderbolts and generating world- engulfing storms. All of these ideas are difficult to reconcile with Mars’ present benign appearance, needless to say. In ancient Mesopotamia, the homeland  of the first scientific astronomy, Mars was identified with the god Nergal, the latter described as a raging warrior whose incendiary behavior threatened the  world. Numerous hymns attest to Nergal's prowess as an invincible warrior. Quote, ”Warrior! Raging storm-tide, who flattens the lands in upheaval, Warrior!” Nergal's belligerent nature knew no bounds. According to one hymn, the god's wrath threatened the domain of the gods as well. Quote “O warrior... Perfect one without rival among all the gods, who grasps the pitiless deluge-weapon, who massacres  the enemy, Lion clad in splendor, at the flaring-up of whose (fierce) brilliance, the gods of the inhabited world took to secret places...” Babylonian astronomical texts, interestingly, warned that if a person is born during the appearance of Mars, he will be quick to anger. While such traditions can only appear bizarre and incongruous by reference to the Red Planet's innocuous behavior in today's skies, the fact remains that analogous reports should be found around the globe. Far removed from ancient Mesopotamia  the Skidi Pawnee of the North American plains are known to have had an astronomically-based religion. Indeed, it has been said that they were obsessed with the planets and had a sky-oriented theology, perhaps  without parallel in human history. For the Skidi sky watchers, Mars was described as an irascible warrior, whose interactions with Venus at the time of Beginning sparked creation. During a ritual in which human sacrifices were offered to the Red Planet, the celebrants sought to channel Mars's anger. Quote, “I become ferocious: I became like him.” End of quote. In another ritual, the Mars impersonator chanted the following refrain when pretending to conquer Venus. Quote, “I become myself when I become angry.” End of quote. Yet  another hymn quotes the god himself ”This is the way I did when I became angry.” Analogous traditions will be found in Egypt where early astronomical texts identified Mars with the god Horus. In literary texts dating to the third millennium BCE, Horus described as raging against the gods, thereby reminding us of the Akkadian traditions attached to Nergal. So too, in the pyramid text Horus is described as the “Lord of Wrath,” whose seething fury shakes the very foundations of Heaven. Quote, “Unis will come with the face of the great god, Horus, who is lord of wrath...; he will strike Shu's arms from under the sky.” End of  quote. The Latin god Mars, whose name was assigned to the Red Planet during Hellenistic times, was remembered as a warrior whose terrible fury knew no bounds. Although the vast majority of Roman mythology has been lost, a few  vestigial remnants can still be found. The Carmen Arvale, the oldest bit of Latin text from antiquity, invokes ‘fere Mars. Literally, “the fierce or furious Mars.” In his classic, Archaic Roman Religion, George Dumezil offered the following portrait of the Roman War God. Quote, “The ambiguous character of Mars, when  he breaks loose on the field of battle, accounts for the epithet “caecus,”  or blind, given him by the poets. At a certain stage of furor, he abandons himself to his nature, destroying friend as well as foe.” Why, it must be asked, would a distant diminutive planet, moving on a supposedly eternally stable orbit about the Sun, be described as angry or furious or as raging against the Gods? A major  portion of Martian metamorphoses was devoted to investigating the mythological traditions associated with the great heroes identified with the planet Mars. Figures such as the Greek Hercules for example, to see  if there was any discernible overlap with the aforementioned Mars gods. As I documented, the overlap is at once substantial and archaic in nature, tracing to the earliest literary traditions in the third millennium BCE, while it would be impossible to do justice to this vast wealth of material in a 10-minute video, it might prove instructive to examine a few traditional tales recounting the Warrior Hero's terrible anger. The Greek Heracles, expressly  identified as the planet Mars during the Hellenistic period, was renowned for his fiery anger and deemed to be a major threat to the gods. The poet Virgil describes Heracles as follows in the Aeneid. Quote, “Suddenly Hercules ignited in rage. Here the word ‘rage’ is ‘ira’, literally ’anger’ or ‘rage’." Seneca wrote an entire play on the subject: Hercules Furens. Ovid in turn speaks of the fire generated by Heracles’ seething wrath. The Celtic hero ‘Cu Chulainn’ offers a striking parallel to Hercules. In traditional accounts of the great hero's fury, it is reported that he radiated intense heat, became crimson all over and assumed a gigantic form. The epithet ‘the distorted one’, commemorates the radical distortion of features that distinguished the Celtic hero during his battle frenzy. Indeed, The Tain describes the hero's furor as follows. Quote, “It was then that, as before, Cu Chulain’s distortion came on, and he was filled with swelling and great fullness, like breath in a bladder, until he became a terrible, fearful, many- colored, wonderful giant.” End of quote. The swelling of the warrior hero, while in the midst of his furor, is a universally occurring motif, as I have  documented. Ovid in his description of Heracles’ Apotheosis on Mount Olympus, notes that the hero suddenly took on a gargantuan appearance. So too, Beowulf was said to swell with anger as he prepares to meet the dragon Grendel. Marie Sjoestedt, summarizing the Celtic traditions, was among the few scholars to call attention to this motif. Quote,  “We see that all the words for ‘hero’ express the notions of fury, ardor, tumescence, speed. The hero is the furious one, possessed of his own tumultuous energy.” End of quote. That the hero's sudden swelling traces to a witnessed planetary event, is strongly suggested by the fact that ancient astronomers called attention to Mars’ propensity for swelling. Thus it is that Polynesian sky watchers knew Mars as Horo-Pukupuku, ’Quick-swelling.’ So too Babylonian scribes describe Nergal as pes-gal, literally the “furious” or impetuous god. Yet the word ‘pes’ also denotes, to ‘swell’ or to ‘expand’. A classic example of the warrior heroes offered by the ascetic Batraz, renowned  for his terrible furor and erratic behavior. In a popular tale recounting the hero's birth, Batraz is said to burst forth from a giant's abscess on high, whereupon  he fell headlong towards Earth. Quote, “When he came down from heaven to earth he was burning.” End of quote. The igneous nature of the infant hero who fell from heaven like a thunderbolt, or meteor, is a decided point of emphasis. In a number of tales the townsfolk are said to have gone to great lengths to cool him down through one means or another. In one account, the newly delivered infant plummets down from heaven and is forthwith dunked into a tub of water in an effort to quench his warrior ardor. Quote, “Batraz ...grew so furious that his steely body became red hot. He peered around, then leaped down from the heavenly heights, straight onto the roof of the seven tower... He burned his way through ceilings, one after another with his red-hot body. In the lowest story of the tower, there stood a huge water tub, and into that fell the glowing-hot Batraz. Having cooled off in the water, he climbed out of the tub.” End of quote. In a  variant account of his birth, Batraz is thrown into the sea to cool him off, at which point he assumes a gigantic form. Quote, “When the little boy came out of the abscess at the time of this birth they carried him to the sea and threw  him in. All at once he became as big as a mountain.” End of quote. Such  traditions have nothing to do with human biology, needless to say. Rather these vignettes encode extraordinary i.e. cataclysmic natural events. The  curious report that Batraz became as big as a mountain upon descending from heaven, represents an invaluable clue. As we have documented elsewhere, when the planet Mars descended towards Earth as a meteor-like bolide along the axial column uniting the various planets, it assumed a colossal form. Like  countless other warrior heroes, Batraz is a notorious shape-shifter. Especially relevant here are the traditions that describe the hero as taking the form of lightning. Quote, “After a turbulent and marvelous childhood, somewhat reminiscent of that of Heracles, he went to heaven, where  he lived from that time on, never leaving except to fall (literally) onto the earth, in the manner of lightning, sometimes to save his fellow Narts when they were in danger, but sometimes to decimate them cruelly and blindly without any clear motive. Each of these ‘descents’ is described in terms and images that express his lightning nature.” End of quote. On those occasions when Batraz descended from heaven, it is reported that he was wont to assume a brilliant red form and become furious. The red color assigned to the descending bolide, together with the hero's identification with Aries, is tantamount to the DNA left at the scene of a crime and allows us to positively identify Batraz as the planet Mars. Here it is significant to find that Mesopotamian sky watchers expressly compared the Red Planet to a meteor, or fire falling from heaven. Thus it  is that the star god Nergal was given the epithet miqit isatu, denoting ”the fall of fire” from heaven. Equally telling is the fact the same phrase was employed to describe ”lightning” or “meteor”. Far  from being confined to ancient mythological traditions, the warrior hero's capacity for destructive feats of furor left an indelible mark on countless ancient rituals and customs, not to mention warriors’ initiation rights around the globe. If Skidi warriors used to prepare for battle by emulating Mars's fiery anger, the Spartans and Batavian berserkers of old Europe whipped themselves into a frenzy by singing of the deeds of Heracles in the hopes that they too, might be possessed by his spirit  and prove equally formidable and invulnerable to fire or pain. Quote,  “Archaic warriors everywhere re-enacted in masked dances the deeds  of the gods and ancestors. They did so to gain the divine ecstasy of ‘the beginning of time’...In battle when it mattered most to live in mythical time, warriors bodied forth gods and ancestors fighting in their style. Batavi going to battle sang of ‘Hercules,’ their ancestral, club-wielding hero.” To summarize, traditional tales attached to the warrior hero describe him as red-hot in nature, swelling in anger, possessed by seething wrath, and radiating intense heat or lightning-like flashes. Such  attributes point unequivocally to the Martian origins of the warrior hero archetype. Is it any wonder then that indigenous warriors around the globe formerly smeared their bodies with red ochre in order to embody and advertise their furor? [Music] 
[Music] Proponents of Electric Universe theory face  one seemingly infinite wall of resistance. The false preconceptions cemented in people's minds by consensus science. We simply do not see the cosmos the same way  materials do. Fundamentally, I think the cosmos is energy. Energy is kinetic motion or potential motion of matter over a distance, but matter itself is potential energy. So it's all just one thing, energy. An Electric Universe is one of energy transformed from kinetic to potential by standing waves of constructive interference. Matter particles consist of holographic, plasmoidal interference patterns. Standing  waves, in other words, that form the ether. Each standing wave is itself a circuit of energy, shaped by its frequency. The shape of matter conforms to the shape  of energy flow. And the shape of matter forms circuitry that anchors the  shape of energy. It's a feedback loop. From our perspective, plasmoids are electromagnetic bubbles of potential energy, and hence the perception  of a particle. On the inside there are whirlwinds of trapped energy, patterned into an infinite cyclic circuit. This circuit creates polarity, angular momentum, exchanges energy with its environment by induction, and maintains structural Integrity with the membrane of capacitance. Its internal potential maintains resonant balance, and therefore is in constant feedback with its environment. It is  an RLC circuit. This circuit pattern repeats in self-similar scalar harmonies from the subatomic scale to the super-galactic. Therefore, an Electric Universe is luminous bubbles within bubbles; circuits within circuits; harmonies within harmonies, vibrating at constant energy from within, in resonance with everything without. Electric Universe. I see the cosmos is circuitry that patterns energy, frequency and vibration. Circuitry is life. The feedback loop is universal. Entropy is energy, dropping an octave. Infinity means as big as it needs to be. Gravity is an emergent consequence, worthy of study, not worship. And we don't divide  by zero. Minds that imagine energy as chunks of stuff, bouncing around, are unlikely to consider repeating scalable fractal interference patterns as evidence for anything but the mysteries of nature. They've been groomed all their  lives to think what matters is matter. They will remain befuddled by ‘duality’ and hunted by ‘entanglement’. They will disavow longitudinal waves and ether. It's why consensus science cannot explain ubiquitous patterns at every scale in the cosmos, like the Fibonacci sequence or the Mandelbrot set. It's just physics, but they try to sweep such evidence of circuitry in nature under the rug by calling it a ‘mystery’, as if it's something beyond science. It is they who have gone beyond science, beyond falsifiability with dark stuff, wormholes and multiverses. Breaking out of the mold  that poisons quackademia and hence the greater population, requires more than waiting on its internal decay. Although that is happening at an accelerating pace, there is still a need to reorient people's minds to reality. They need new physical models they can visualize. Fortunately, great minds have already blazed a path. Their message has just been suppressed. I'm talking about people like Faraday and Maxwell, Heaviside and Steinmetz. These are names that need no introduction in the Electric Universe. But  let's add one more today: Hans G. Schantz. Hans G. Schantz is with Q-Track Corporation of Huntsville Alabama, and he has written a paper titled, “On Energy Flow in Standing Waves.” In this paper Hans re-discovers the enlightenment of our electric pioneers. This paper examines the underpinnings  of electromagnetism appropriately, in the context of wavelengths, frequencies amplitudes, harmonics and the patterns that emerge as originally studied by The luminaries mentioned. In particular this paper explores the Poynting-Heaviside interpretation of energy flow in electric circuits, which basically says the energy isn't in the copper wires of a circuit, but flows through the electromagnetic lines of force  around the wires. This is quite different from the conventional concept of electrons channeling through wires. This paper demonstrates however, that the Poynting-Heaviside interpretation is correct. This  conclusion should be no surprise in the EU community. However, it's critically important to understand the motions of a dusty plasma in free space. It's critically important for people whose concept of electricity is confined to the wires they plug into their appliances. The convention in science and engineering is to model electric circuits from a far-field perspective; that is to measure voltage, current, and resistance, from point to point and ignore how the electrons travel between. The scientists mentioned in particular developed methods to approximate with simple math what otherwise was too complex to  be useful. But there was fidelity lost about the pattern of actual energy flow in the equations and hence the very perception of it, even for engineers and scientists. The paper illustrates the flow of energy and impedance, in concert with voltage and current as a result of standing waves formed in the electromagnetic field in a simulated two-phase system. Although this is a very simple model, the patterns of energy flow are similar to patterns found in geology created by electromagnetic waves. It illustrates how energy flows like water, changing direction in zigzag patterns, and circulating in whirlpools. These intricate turbulent motions are ignored by the convention, and we can't afford to ignore them if we want to model weather and geology, or anything else for that matter, in nature. As we've shown in previous articles, plasma storms pattern the face of the Earth by raising a global dust cloud and reapplying the constituents in patterns formed by electromagnetic forces. In other words, Earth is an electroplated planet. We've shown and discussed significant evidence that supersonic winds molded mountains, leaving distinctive, in fact unambiguous patterns of shock waves. We've shown and discussed evidence of canyons formed by sputtering discharge. And we've shown and discussed river channels formed by ground-to-ground, arc mode discharge, and the evidence of resonant frequencies, Hall effect, stray capacitance, line-to-line phase vectors, and other identifiable geometric effects in the discharge patterns. These are all near-field effects that are not captured in conventional far-field  analysis. Wind effects in particular are patterned by energy and power flow, and hence conventional far-field methods won't work. A quick dimensional analysis says, wind is mass forced to move over distance, which is energy over time, which is power. To model the patterns of dusty plasma winds, requires the methods of Messrs. Poynting, Heaviside and Schantz. Before you click to this paper and die a small death at the sight of all the equations, scroll past the illustrations. Anyone who can see the pattern, sees the result of electromagnetic forces, regardless  of whether the equations are understood. Energy flows a more tortuous path than conventional models imply. It makes right- angle turns and eddies around pools of impedance into Z-pattern flows, like water in a rocky stream. Just like shock waves reflect off of shock waves, EM waves reflect off of EM waves, creating interference, standing waves in odd places, harmonics and traveling waves, transient standing waves. Geologic evidence of wind patterns left by supersonic shock waves and many other features, confirms that plasma winds, filamented into linear Z-pattern, right angle and circulating cyclones patterned by electromagnetic fields as well. Examine the interference patterns in these illustrations and take special note of the total energy and the impedance diagrams shown. The same type of energy flow molded the Laramie Mountains around the spectacular X-discharge pattern at the heart of the range. Although the patterns are not identical to the examples in the paper, the angular relationships patterned in the landscape, are the same, because it was also created by an orthogonal electromagnetic field interference pattern. The patterns are more complex in the mountains than the simple two-phase simulation, but so is the electromagnetic field of the plasma storm that created these mountains. The storm generated an electric field between the sky and ground at this particular location on the Continental Divide, because of tension between circuit domains forming the Mississippi, Colorado and Snake River watersheds. It was this hot spot in the ground that drew a response in the atmosphere by building a thunderstorm, one of Zeus's finest. Wind patterns, indicated in blue, show the path of energy flow along lines of force, which we now know are interference patterns in a multi-phase electromagnetic field. The wind energy traveled in straight line filaments at angles roughly 30 to 45 degrees offset to the orthogonal cross, just like the impedance is offset from the total energy in Figure 5 and for the same  reason. The ground discharge pattern that made the orthogonal cross presents the ground phase. And the tropical layer of the storm cell above it presented the opposite end of the electric field. Or the other plate of charge density in the capacitor, and the other phase in the electromagnetic field for this circuit. The cross itself is a discharge between the three ground domains and is anchoring the location and establishing the frequency of the circuit. As a discharge cycle from peak to trough, it presented a standing wave of maximum impedance, minimum voltage to the plasma winds. Plasma winds were biased positive and the ground  negative. Winds were drawn by reactive energy flows of electric field inductance, which is also known as capacitance, and magnetic field inductance, both leading and lagging the pulsing arc mode discharges on the ground. Magnetic field inductance, through filamentary jet streams toward the center of the cross and then up into the storm center, these jet streams followed magnetic waves, vectored in the direction of the wave motion, perpendicular to the lines of force. Electric induction drew winds in curving paths, field-aligned with magnetic lines of force, and these winds deposited dust where ground charge attracted it in the act of electroplating. The patterns formed by a dusty plasma are also influenced by the dust itself. The difference in ionic mix, and the influence of magnetic or diamagnetic particles, might make the difference between a clockwise or counterclockwise turn; or a fast or slow wind; or whether it sticks to ground charge densities, at a shock wave; or blows right through. So, to summarize, the orthogonal relationship of alternating electric and magnetic fields yields an X-shaped constructive interference pattern of maximum reactive energy flow, and a vertical cross-shaped minimum energy pattern of maximum impedance. This pattern is repeatable, scalable and expressions of it are identifiable throughout nature. The takeaway of this paper and what it illustrates about Earth, is the phased interplay of reactive power in the electromagnetic field between sky and ground. The sky is reactive, lagging in phase to charge concentrations first established in the ground. Lightning tornadoes and storm cells are phase-to-phase discharges in a multi-phase circuit, not DC dielectric breakdowns, nor anything to do with CO2. That is  why consensus science can't understand weather. On Earth, like everything else in the cosmos, is a pattern of energy storage and flow. Follow the energy to any answer. That's how it's done, with or without math. One can feel energy. When you add the complexities of spherical geometry and how waves propagate and interfere on a spherical capacitor that inducts energy from the poles, definable patterns appear. Take  for instance these images of Iapetus. Iapetus has no atmosphere or internal geoelectric  dynamic. What happened here was a direct current event. However, it serves to illustrate ground  currents. What is obvious is a meridian of raised rock, called a dike, running from one pole to the  other. A quarter turn, or 90 degrees around the moon, is a similar pole-to-pole meridian of aligned craters and it's highlighted right at that limb where the light shines from the  Sun. Another, smaller meridian of craters runs roughly between the larger craters and the  dike. It's about 30 degrees above the dike. Each of these lines of craters and the dike itself, is an expression of charge densities formed by filaments of current. Immediately, when you notice the quadrangle formed by interference, here from a polar aspect, look at the dike and major crater meridians and how they parallel a quarter rotation apart from one another, around the pole from pole to pole, with a minor meridian of craters between. It's a similar three-dimensional quadrangle of power flow as the paper depicts in two dimensions, where the quadrangle is formed by constructive interference, and then divided into eight sections by destructive interference. Each section forms its own pattern of charge densities, because each section acquires a different ratio and vector of electric and magnetic field inductance due to phase and frequency differences. The craters formed on radial currents, emanating from the moon's interior and aligned along these meridians as they pass through the crust, they form destructive interference or cathode spots on the spherical field of the crust where the energy deconstructed matter. The dike, on the other hand, is a meridian filament of constructive interference on the crustal surface that ran like a wire from pole to pole. Constructive interference means energy aggregates matter where positive and negative ions came together and recombined. The energy was entering one pole and leaving the other, but reflecting its internal flow into multi-phase interference which pattern standing waves of voltage, current, and impedance from within, to create these distinct geometrically-aligned filaments, as a rise in internal energy exceeded the capacity of the body. Atmospheric planets especially show consistent patterns of energy flow in their weather, due to multi-phase reactive  energy. The V-pattern winds on Venus, the magnetic shadow on the Sun, and the continental formation of North America, are all the consequence of energy flows from a body  that is inducing energy, storing it in layers of spherical capacity, and expelling the excess energy through its own dynamic electromagnetic fields, forming these predictable interference  patterns. Ground charge densities, called shield volcanoes to lay the continents’ foundations on Earth, and weather-layered sediments on top. But they were both shaped by the same reactive energy flows and interference patterns, because the plasmoidal circuitry in Earth, Venus and the Sun are very similar. These patterns come and go. Other patterns  emerge. Nothing is constant, but the patterns recur. They are interference patterns  from internal circuitry that has its own cyclically-operating switching mechanism. It's obvious, if you think about it, assuming you accept electrical formation in the first place, that Earth's land masses must be patterned by forces from  within. If they were not, how would diffuse energy from space create the complex geography  we see. By applying the same physics described in this paper, one can determine the  fine detail about geology on Earth. The cycles of catastrophe in Earth's past left patterns of plasma winds, sputtering and arc-mode discharges, shock waves and fringe-effect-currents around the continental plates, all patterned by Earth's own energy flow. Each episode laid a new layer on the old. Each layer, if properly interpreted, will yield a clear picture of what happened. Were there comets and asteroids colliding with the Earth in cyclic patterns of recurrence? Or did Earth switch its circuit patterns periodically, perhaps due to solar influence? These are answerable questions. In the same way one can interpret prevailing wind patterns from the shape of a sand dune, one can interpret virtually any hill or dale on the planet. A record is retained in Earth's geology like a hologram,  because it was formed by standing waves. Now, thanks to the work of engineers and scientists like Hans G. Schantz who are brave enough to challenge the consensus, we have the beginnings of models to reinterpret  our world. We can go to work rewriting science. [Music] [Music] 
A newspaper headline today, unconsciously invokes imagery of the four horsemen of the apocalypse, of doomsday. Fear and division are being whipped up globally through a compliant media and the internet as if it were wartime. The difference this time is that the war is against nature on two fronts: a pandemic and a human-triggered planetary heat death. And as usual in wartime, truth is the first casualty. This is an all-too-familiar pattern. It requires the broadest possible historical perspective to understand. The Electric Universe synthesis is the only science that has grown from that understanding. It offers hope and inspiration for a better future. Sadly, our 2020 conference had to be cancelled as the dreadful downward cycle of humanity's fearfulness and irrationality headed towards its nadir. How often do we have to repeat this destructive pattern? How grim does it have to get before we come to our senses? Our planned theme for the conference last year was 2020 Vision. It is a theme that I am passionate about. Since the Electric Universe has a vision of humanity, rather like that of the Apollo 8 astronauts who first orbited the moon. Perhaps only the few humans who have witnessed Earth from that distance in space have felt the cosmic insight that such a perspective offers. On Christmas Eve in 1968, the Apollo 8 spacecraft with astronauts Frank Bormann, Jim Lovell and Bill Anders entered lunar orbit. At the beginning of the fourth orbit, their spacecraft was emerging from the far side of the moon when Earthrise, one of the most influential images in history was taken. The image affected Bill Anders who said later ”This is the only home we have and yet we're busy shooting at each other threatening nuclear war and wearing suicide vests. It amazes me.” He gave up his religious beliefs because he could not imagine a judgmental deity up there, wondering whether Billy was a good boy yesterday.  With a clearer view of our world in relation to the Sun, Moon and stars, he recognized the irrationality of our beliefs and behavior. History shows that beliefs that acquire the character of religious dogma are the most inhibiting and divisive influence in the world. Yet religion fills a basic need that science felt bound to address. Sadly, the  result is merely a religious story rewritten - the lifeless and unscientific Big Bang creation myth. We must first understand human nature to understand the world. But in this technocratic world it is a specialist subject, not taught to scientists who need it most. In my keynote speech at the 2016 Electric Universe conference, I introduced  the work of Dr. Iain McGilcrist whose groundbreaking work on the different functions of the two hemispheres of the brain, has shown that our education systems damage our ability to do science. By preferentially training the left hemisphere which focuses on detail, rather than the whole picture, you get stuck in a certain way of thinking, which is fine for a worker on an industrial assembly line, but deadly for doing science. Left-hemisphere people exhibit denial and a need to be in control. It has resulted in the active suppression of alternative ways of approaching problems and accusing others of denying their beliefs about what constitutes the facts. Instead it is they who will not contemplate ideas they deny. As a consequence, there have been no fundamental breakthroughs in science since early last century. In complete contrast, Dr. McGilcrist compares this with right- hemisphere people who get meaning from understanding the whole, and are comfortable with not being able to grasp everything. That was encouraged in the highly productive 19th century, by a more general education and openness to the self-taught, which resulted in significant contributions to science by eminent outsiders, like Ben Franklin, Faraday, William Herschel and many others. It has been my fortunate approach, resulting in the Electric Universe synthesis. However, modern academia is highly resistant to incursions, even from Nobel prize winners in other disciplines. The lack of major breakthroughs in fundamental science in the last century, is the result. I was lucky that my early inspiration came from the classically trained scholar, Immanuel Velikovsky who was a practicing psychoanalyst. In the 1972 BBC Horizon documentary on his major work, Worlds in Collision, the narrator finally asks ”Why do his views attract such sympathy? Perhaps it is because what he has to say is so much fuller than the grey conventional view of man's history and that of the solar system. And he offers his listeners a total theory, one which appears to explain everything - even the origins of religion.” ”Most of all he offers them a philosophy of hope; an idea that through his view of science, rather than the orthodox view, man can save himself, not kill himself. He offers them an understanding of man's irrationality and thereby a chance to cure it.” Velikovsky concludes by stating, “Mankind is irrational in everything he does.... He lives under the urge to repeat the [catastrophes of the past]. There is nothing more important than for the human race than to know the past; to be able to face it!” His warning is clearly of utmost importance today. As a practicing psychoanalyst Velikovsky identified the origin of humanity's subconscious doomsday fear, originating from apocalyptic planetary close encounters. Hell, like the desolate landscapes of the Moon, Mars and Venus was in the heavens, while the heaven on Earth was being destroyed. Throughout history, those who wish to control others have played upon this existential fear. The famous psychoanalyst Carl Jung also identified the subconscious nightmares that haunt all humanity, but he couldn't explain their origin. He too warned that humanity is its own worst enemy. Velikovsky, by explaining the archetypes, showed that our irrational post-traumatic stress behavior is expressed cyclically in trying to somehow safely relive the experience. For example, through watching disaster movies, involving an archetypal hero to save the world. But in the extreme it involves visiting destruction upon others we would like to control in our misdirected fear. The catharsis that follows the madness has people working together to rebuild. I'm lucky to have experienced this collective behavior following World War II. But this technological age has seen the world become progressively more dangerous in the hands of leaders of a damaged species. This critical understanding for our long-term survival on this extraordinary and beautiful blue planet  was buried by mainstream astronomers who had acquired the status of a priesthood, and who denied all of Velikovsky's evidence without reading it, because it didn't satisfy their subconscious necessity for a peaceful, clockwork solar system. The Electric Universe cosmology is built upon Velikovsky's insights and those of the scholars who have developed his work for many decades. The result is an unprecedented scientific and cultural vision for the future, as the arts, humanities and sciences are combined in a phenomenal and awe-inspiring panorama of the recent history of the living Earth. It promises to heal our differences and restore peace on Earth. Nothing less should be the goal of ‘we damaged survivors’ from an unremembered past. The present is not the key to the past. Surely the idea that there is still a great deal to discover, is a more inspiring position for artists, philosophers and scientists alike. William James shone his lantern upon this point in his 1895 address to the Harvard Young Men's Christian Association entitled “Is Life Worth Living?” ”I have heard more than one teacher say that all the fundamental conceptions of truth have been found by science, and  that the future has only the details of the picture to fill in. But the slightest reflection on the real conditions will suffice to show how  barbaric such notions are.” ”They show such a lack of scientific imagination, that it is hard to see how one who is actively advancing any part of  science can make a mistake so crude.” 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info Today, comparative mythologist Ev Cochran continues his series on his lifelong research into the themes and archetypes of world mythology. In previous discussions, Cochran has explored the extraordinary identities of planets in myth, including Mars as the warrior’s hero, and Venus among other identities, as the mother goddess, the great comet and the fire-breathing serpent. The reconstruction that Cochran and colleague David Talbot have produced, leaves none of the global archetypes unaddressed. Archetypes which could only exist as the result of real celestial events, witnessed and experienced by ancient peoples. Previously, Ev presented his investigation into ancient Egyptian traditions, which describe the Sun appearing atop a lotus flower at the time of creation. According to both Talbot and Cochrane, such traditions describe a particular phase in the history of the polar configuration, one in which Mars, as Horus, was positioned in front of Venus as the lotus flower. In this episode, Ev continues his discussion on the lotus flower in myth, a symbol and probably linked to the Sun gods of various cultures. A familiar image in ancient Egyptian iconography finds the Horus child seated atop a lotus flower. According to Eric Horning, the Dean of Egyptologists, the Sun God on a lotus blossom, was an image of the first emergence of shapes at the creation. James Allen offered a very similar summary of this fascinating thematic pattern, noting it was from this flower that the Sun could blossom into the world. Why an infant sitting atop a lotus should be an archetypal symbol of creation is rarely addressed and has yet to receive a satisfactory answer. Predictably, Egyptologists identify the Horus child with the present Sun, but they essentially ignore the fundamental role of the Lotus. At no point do they ever seriously address the elephant in the room namely, where in all of heaven is a lotus flower to be found in the immediate vicinity of the present Sun? The motif is attested in other cultures as well. In ancient India for example, we read that ”The world Lotus originally blooms in response to the rising of the Sun ‘in the beginning’.” Here is in ancient Egypt: the blossoming of the Lotus is explicitly placed at the time of beginning. In other words, creation. Analogous traditions are evident in Mesoamerica where the sacred Mayan text known as the book of Chilam Balam describes the Sun as residing within a four-petaled flower. “Four-fold was the plate of the flower and the Sun was set in its center.” So too in a hieroglyphic Mayan script, the Sun is depicted as a four-petaled flower. The Mayan Sun sign in turn, finds a remarkable analog in ancient Mesopotamia, where the Sun was represented as a four-petaled flower. To bring the argument full circle, this particular image forms a close structural parallel to the Egyptian wnb flower described as follows. “The wnb flower is none other than the primordial lotus from which the Sun emerges at dawn in the east.” We see many examples of similar imagery in ancient artworks and religious iconography from around the world. We asked Ev how one might distinguish between depictions of four-petaled flowers, which can be explained in familiar terms, versus depictions of celestial phenomena. Naturally, it's important to pay careful attention to context. In prehistoric artwork, such as those from the famous passage tombs at Loughcrew, Ireland, four-petaled flowerlike forms appear alongside a wide variety of suns and starbursts, a sure indication that celestial forms are being depicted. So too in Mesopotamia four-petaled flowers are routinely depicted in conjunction with a recumbent Crescent, and alongside four-rayed stars, thereby confirming their fundamental affinity. Equally important is the fact that the so-called Ra sign also appears in conjunction with a recumbent Crescent. All modern scholars, except for Talbot and myself, accept that the image depicted in Fig. 6 is that of the present Sun. If we grant that the four-petaled floral forms are celestial in nature, how can we rule out the conventional view that the present Sun is being depicted? A systematic analysis of the respective artworks and mythological traditions, will inevitably point to a catastrophic context of the archetypal theme of the blossoming Sun. The myths of various cultures for example, make the central heart of this or that God suddenly blossom into a Sun amidst great fireworks. It is this cataclysmic background that alone can explain the otherwise anomalous fact, whereby in numerous ancient languages words for ‘to blossom’ or ‘to flower’ also denote ‘fire’. The Greek word ‘anthos’ for example, denotes ‘flower’, but also the fire stolen by Prometheus. The same linguistic connection is found in the new world, especially among the Aztecs where words for ‘to flower’ also mean ‘fire’. Witness the following finding offered by the anthropologist Jane Hill: “The metaphoric association of flowers and flames is very widespread in.. Aztecan languages. The metaphor of the blooming flower as ‘bursting into flame’ can be reconstructed as a lexical item meaning ’blossom, bloom’ for Aztecan. Given the striking association between flowers and fire in ancient testimony, we asked Ev how it can be explained in terms of natural science. The Aztec myth of creation provides the all-important clue. There a scab-laden nobody named Nanahuatl hurls himself into a great funeral pyre, whereupon he's enveloped in fire and suddenly blossoms, while becoming transfigured into the Sun. While this is a singularly informative mythological tradition, analogous traditions will be found around the globe. Pericles’ fiery death within the funeral pyre atop Mount Oeta offers a familiar example. Such archaic mythological traditions preserve remarkably accurate memories of extraordinary planetary events of a catastrophic nature, the likes of which are virtually impossible to imagine today. Events which profoundly shaped the course of ancient civilization. At our last EU conference in Phoenix I presented a number of slides that are particularly compelling. Witness the image presented in Fig. 7, dating from about 3,000 BC. It depicts a four- petaled rosette with what appear to be four dots, or points of light between the petals. As I have documented, analogous images will be found around the globe, typically in celestial context. In many examples the four-petaled flower is replaced by a four-rayed star as in Fig. 8 from Mesopotamian and Fig. 9 from Mesoamerica. Students of Archaeoastronomy astronomy will recognize the latter image as the Lamat sign, widely acknowledged to have something to do with the planet Venus. Granted that such images depict celestial forms, and it is quite impossible to believe otherwise, the question is how to explain the four dots between the rays of the central star. Readers who are familiar with Tony Perat's plasma experiments, will immediately recognize these dots as a classic signature of synchrotron radiation, as documented in the high-energy discharge experiments conducted by him. This is but one of many clues, albeit a particularly important one, pointing to the incredibly powerful electromagnetic forces associated with the polar configuration, as witnessed by ancient sky watchers around the globe.

Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info What powers the Sun? The answer seems obvious. It must be nuclear energy to allow the Sun to shine for billions of years. But that assumes, as Sir Arthur Eddington did in the early 20th century, that stars are isolated objects in space, and because it had been found that the fusion of two hydrogen nuclei produced the most energy and hydrogen dominates the sun's outer atmosphere, Eddington assumed that stars are a gravitating ball of hydrogen gas. The astronomer George Gamow wrote of Eddington, "he was able to find out everything about the interior of the Sun and other stars without leaving his comfortable study at Cambridge University. Eddington famously used to say, "It should not be too difficult to understand such a simple thing as a star." The misguided certainty of mathematical theorists becomes conspicuous as Gamow continues, "...astronomers can tell the temperature of the central regions of the Sun and of the many stars within a few percentage points and be quite sure about the figures they quote." So scientists have labored ever since, using Eddington's simplistic model, in an attempt to produce nuclear energy "like the Sun" although the model doesn't predict any of the complex features seen on or above the Sun. The certainty attached to mathematical models is entirely misplaced if the physical model is incorrect. Unbeknownst to the general public and to many scientists, an alternative electric Sun model was proposed in 1979 by an engineer. It has the critical longevity of all electric lights, it is plugged into a Galactic circuit and galactic circuits are the basis of plasma cosmology which is ignored by astrophysicists but was developed by experimental scientists and engineers in the 20th century and it has proven to be predictive, quite unlike mathematical Big Bang cosmology. Only in the last few years have the circumstances arisen to enable the Electric Sun model to be tested. Called the SAFIRE project, the cutting-edge engineering firm Aurtas international incorporated was contacted by the International Science Foundation to experimentally test the Electric Sun model. Aurtas International Incorporated is an independent body which has no affiliation with the Electric Universe or The Thunderbolts Project. Recently, the SAFIRE team shared an extraordinary update on their results to date. Today, in part 1 of this two-part presentation, physicist Wal Thornhill discusses the SAFIRE experiment, its results and its promise for the future. History was made on July 7th at the University of Bath Electric Universe Conference in the UK, when the 2019 SAFIRE project update announced the success of the SAFIRE experiment at the end of phase 2. On September 2nd, it was shared publicly on The Thunderbolts website. SAFIRE, S A F I R E, the cryptic acronym means stellar atmospheric function in regulation experiment. In plain language, it is the Electric Sun experiment which aimed to reproduce in a lab on earth the plasma features of the Sun, from the photosphere outward into space, to do so reproducibly and to show that it was self-regulating. The aim was to let nature show us, if the model was correct, how and why stars like the  Sun shine so steadily. It followed the example of an early pioneer of the Electric Universe, the Norwegian scientist Kristian Birkeland with his terella, or little Earth experiment which he performed at the end of the 19th century. Birkeland demonstrated Auroras using an electric discharge to a magnetized sphere enclosed in a vacuum chamber. Amongst other things, he predicted an electrical connection between the Earth  and the Sun, composed of electrons and flying ions of all kinds. In modern terms, he had predicted the solar wind. The concept of electricity in space was clearly not taboo in the 19th century. Montgomery Childs who is president and founder of Aurtas international and manager of the SAFIRE project, together with the physicist Dr. Michael Clarage, provided the experiment update. Monty summed up with these words, "In all our experiments and discoveries we have found no disparities with the Electric Sun model. We believe the SAFIRE experiment validates and supports the Electric Sun model." The mind-blowing consequences of these words may not be immediately apparent. The SAFIRE experiment was an independent audit of the Electric Sun model by a Canadian engineering company Aurtas international with an interest in solar energy. The project was funded by the International Science Foundation, ISF, whose mission states that it, "was established to support promising new research in the sciences, placing a spotlight on innovative ideas that have met initial scientific tests but lacked recognition or funding. The ISF places its highest value on prospects for far-reaching discovery." These goals are sadly lacking in mainstream science where experts are far too quick to defend the status quo and declare unfamiliar proposals impossible. At risk was the life's work of a number of scholars who are responsible for the Electric Sun model. Such risk-taking is not something seen in today's inventive science, where model failures are everyday occurrences but rarely seriously acted upon. Generally, they are dismissed by qualifiers such as "the phenomenon is not fully understood" which are weasel words for "send more funding to continue searching for imaginary particles and forces we may invent so as to save appearances and per chance to score a Nobel Prize." This shows that extraordinary disproof is required for modern institutionalized science. The SAFIRE results now proves, cosmologists and particle physicists don't understand stars! Eddington's complicated untestable century-old model is wrong, we don't understand the universe at any level from the subatomic to the Galactic and everything in between. Some background to the electric model is necessary here. Aurtas international had developed a new solar panel microfilament technology and was investigating new energy systems. Monty first called me in Australia, in 2011, to find out if I could help him with his research, since he had looked at the Electric Sun model and for the first time in his extensive engineering experience he could, in his words, find no disparities. That is, no inconsistencies when he compared it to the standard solar model. So I introduced Monty to my Thunderbolts partner in the US, David Talbott who persuaded him to write a paper addressing his stated concern that, if after 14 years of our Electric Universe collaboration we don't test the Electric Sun model, we may find ourselves in the same place in another 14 years. So in January 7th, 2012, Monty presented an experimental test of the Electric Sun at the annual Electric Universe conference in Las Vegas. An engineer from Flagstaff, Arizona, Ralph Juergens had his well-researched Electric Sun model published in 1979 under the headline: Stellar Thermonuclear Energy, a False Trail? Shortly after his untimely death his friend and colleague Dr. Earl Milton, associate professor of physics at the University of Lethbridge in Canada, edited Juergens' unpublished material. Both Ralph and Earl, like many others, had been inspired by Immanuel Velikovsky's 1950 challenge to astronomers in his best-selling book "Worlds in Collision". It demanded critical attention to dramatic early global stories of an incandescent cometary Venus, and battles between nine planets hurling Thunderbolts of the Gods which raised fundamental questions about recent electrical activity and orbital instabilities in the solar system. That was the gauntlet Velikovsky threw down at astronomers. Electricity plays a role in celestial dynamics. Critical support for this foundational challenge to gravitational cosmology came at a historic meeting in Portland, Oregon in 2000, where the leading expert in high-energy plasma discharge phenomena, Anthony Peratt, matched the various worldwide petroglyph representations of the cosmic Thunderbolt with the complex forms of plasma instabilities he had documented using the high-energy z-pinch facility at Los Alamos National Laboratories. He wrote later of the "uncanny accuracy of mythology originating in prehistory that precedes by millennia what is discovered in high-energy density plasma  experiments today." It explained why our prehistoric forebears around the world had laboriously chiseled the same strange-looking stick figures and concentric circles into hard rock. Whatever they were depicting must have been seen in the sky and held the greatest importance for them. The echoes of their existential doomsday fears from that time, still reverberate in us today. Velikovsky's research should not have been dismissed on the mere authoritative pronouncement that it had disobeyed Newton's law of gravity. Neither Newton nor anyone after him has explained the force of gravity. So it was that Velikovsky alone predicted before the Space Age; the extreme temperature of Venus, the remanent magnetism in the Moon rocks returned by the Apollo missions, and electrically generated radio noises from Jupiter. The last prediction drew Einstein's attention, but astronomers showed they learn nothing from history. As the noted astronomer Sir Fred Hoyle wrote in his book "Home Is Where the Wind Blows,"Velikovsky's book caused a sensation both with the public and among astronomers, the latter becoming stirred to near violent displays of outrage. Such eminent figures as Harlow Shapley were heavily involved. It could be said that Shapley became angry even to the point of incoherence." They set up a metaphorical modern-day book burning by forcing the textbook publisher Macmillan to cease publishing their best-seller and hand it to Doubleday. Astronomy is still ruled by its fearful high priests. Hoyle seemed to intuit the answer, could it be that somewhere in the shadows there is a past history that it is inadmissible to discuss? So I'm pleased that, inspired by Velikovsky's leading research into the recent catastrophic history of the Earth and humanity, the Electric Universe has an unparalleled record of successful predictions in the Space Age and is freeing astronomy from its misunderstood past. In 1977, Juergens wrote, "One would think that the sheer weight of Space Age discoveries -- most of them pointing to an Electric Universe in the Velikovskian mode -- might have rallied at least a few professionals. But strangely enough, this has not happened. And it is left to us who might rather be bystanders to take up the study." Earlier, in 1973, Juergens wrote, "As I pursued the phenomenology of electric discharges, it gradually dawned on me that, structurally, the atmosphere of the Sun bears a striking resemblance to the low-pressure type of electric discharge known as the glow discharge..." Of course, this questions the Sun's internal thermonuclear energy source. Juergens stated the obvious, the modern astrophysical concept that describes the Sun's energy to thermonuclear reactions deep in the solar interior, is contradicted by nearly every observable aspect of the Sun. He opened up another major front in the battle for recognition and acceptance, this time with particle physicists. Only now, it seems it's time for change, with experts declaring a crisis in physics. But the experts don't know where to turn. Their training gives them no historical perspective beyond the October 1927, 5th Solvay international conference in Brussels, where the world's most notable physicists met to discuss the newly formulated quantum theory, which to this day no one understands. That is inexcusable. 
You have just entered the theater of an alien sky. If the words and images seem strange to you, there's a reason for the this - our world was once a vastly different place. To experience this won't hurt you and there is nothing to fear. Before we get too deeply into these presentations, I'd like to leave a few thoughts with you as to what we hope to achieve. We're exploring solar system history, Earth history and human history from a radically new vantage point. At each step, our attention will be on a bedrock of fact - yes! a bedrock of fact. I'll be using that phrase a lot, because reliable conclusions do emerge from human testimony despite a thousand contradictions. The underlying concrete agreement will be impossible to deny. The first segments in this series will come largely from talks I've given in recent years, but will move as efficiently as possible into a much larger library of evidence. Our goal is to reconstruct the celestial spectacles that defined an early phase of human history, what we've called the 'myth-making epoch'. Well established facts will force us to reconsider many entrenched beliefs about the evolution of our planetary system. For several centuries, the space sciences have been trapped in the spell of an unjustified dogma. That dogma just assumed that planets have moved on their present courses for a billion years and more. But always remember, this was just a theoretical guess. As we'll see, that guess can not withstand scrutiny. The facts I'll present will add up to a readily testable story. That's one of the promises I'm happy to make since we'll be drawing on 3-dimensional representations of named planets gathered in a unique configuration extremely close to Earth. The electric discharge forms between these gigantic bodies metamorphosed in the sky above ancient witnesses. In the course of these segments I'll talk about physicists, astronomers, plasma scientists, geologists and others in the sciences who've already acknowledged the power of the evidence. We will respond as best we can to comments and challenges, even answering questions that may have lingered in your own mind for years. This series is about the predictive power of a reconstruction. The global archetypes present to us a verifiable substructure of cross-cultural memory. Seen in 3-dimensional space, the celestial forms will not allow us to just make things up. Hundreds of predictions will follow inherently and inescapably from the details of the reconstruction. If the forms and events reconstructed really did occur, what should we expect to find? And would anything presently experienced account for a single instance of the global patterns? How about memories of a primeval sun god ruling before the present sun. Or memories of a mother goddess identified globally as the planet Venus? Or worldwide descriptions of the planet Mars, always as a male figure, a great warrior whose far famed weapon turns out to be a cosmic thunderbolt, nothing like terrestrial lightning however, but exactly like electric discharge configurations in the plasma laboratory, Suddenly, the ancient obsession with planets and planetary motions will make sense, and the concrete descriptions of planetary gods will no longer surprise us. But the acid tests noted here are just the first scratches on the surface. Countless thousands of ancient drawings, sacred chronicles of the gods and ritual re-enactments must now be addressed in terms of an underlying agreement. That agreement is entirely coherent and it's parts are fully interdependent. One story told around the world.

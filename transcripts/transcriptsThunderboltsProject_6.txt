Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info New scientific reports are again forcing planetary scientists to rewrite the history of our Moon. A new study into the lunar surface contradicts the notion that cratering on the moon occurs incrementally over vast eons of time. A team of scientists studied several thousands of before-and-after images of the Moon's surface with the visual data covering nearly a million square miles. What they found is that lunar cratering appears to occur at a rate more than 100 times faster than the standard impact model has predicted. The lead author of the study states: "Before the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter was launched in 2009, we thought that it took hundreds of thousands to millions of years to change the lunar surface layers significantly. But we've discovered that the moon's uppermost surface materials are completely turned over in something like 80,000 years." A Phys.org report on the study states: "The number of craters is greater than anticipated by standard impact-modeling rates used by lunar scientists. The discovery has the effect of giving lunar surface features younger ages. Theory says that a lunar geologic unit should accumulate a certain number of craters of a given size in a million years, for example. But if it turns out that impacts are making craters more quickly, then it takes less time to reach the benchmark number, and the geologic unit is in reality younger than theory predicts." Unfortunately, the only process the scientists have considered for the astonishingly high rate of cratering is impacts from space. However, many of recent discoveries reported on this series should provide a doorway to alternative theoretical possibilities. A clue can be found in investigations into dramatic electrostatic dust raising events on various bodies in the solar system. In August, we reported on a recent NASA funded study which confirms that electrostatic dust transportation occurs on airless bodies in space. This includes the electrostatic dust storms and electrical discharges that are regularly observed on the Moon when it passes through the Earth's magnetotail. As described by NASA scientist Tim Stubbs: Earth's magnetotail extends well beyond the orbit of the Moon and once a month the Moon orbits through it. It's gonna have consequences ranging from lunar dust storms to electrostatic discharges. Could at least some of the new lunar craters be the result of this kind of electrostatic activity? Electrical discharges to solid surfaces and to plates of dust result in cratering and many other geological features familiar to planetary science as we repeatedly referenced in these experiments by Billy Yelverton. In fact, in recent years the scientific mainstream has begun to recognize the role of electrical forces in altering the lunar soil. A scientific paper in 2014 explored the possibility that so-called "electrical sparking" may occur under the Moon's surface. But the surprisingly high rate of new lunar craters is only the latest of many unresolved problems with the Moon's speculative history. In the 20th century the discovery of apparently discrepant ages of melted lunar rocks contributed to the invention of an era called "The Late Heavy Bombardment" though astronomers do not roundly accept the theory and it's not clear where the bombarding objects would have come from. In the Electric Universe theory, as developed by the chief principles of The Thunderbolts Project, the massive cratering on the Moon and every heavily cratered planetary body was a product of electrical discharge scarring at an interplanetary scale. Numerous references to past presentations on this theory can be found in the description box of this video. Of course any new electrical cratering occurring on the Moon today would be at a vastly smaller scale than the events that violently scarred its surface from pole to pole. In any case, new scientific data will continue to make it more clear that cratering is not the result of periodic impacts from space over eons of time. Electrical cratering is just one of many new pathways of discovery waiting to be explored in our electric universe.

[Music] [Music] he's expert at image acquisition and analysis we've talked a lot about common sense and common sense is essential to having keeping our feet on the ground and forming cogent understandings of the world that we live in but we know also that our senses are somewhat limited there's only so much that we can see with the eyes that we've grown in our bodies that we can touch with our hands and our are our five senses so science when it's properly functioning and serving common sense extends those senses into the realms beyond our ability to perceive - in that sense make visible that which is there but is invisible to our common senses and that is part of the expertise of our next speaker an important part of what p.m. re ro Battaglia is is accomplished at in 1996 he was responsible for developing breaking essentially the world record form in a magnetic resonance imager II developing and essentially doubling the power of magnetic resonance with an 8 Tesla MRI and I'm is going to share with us some of what he sees to add to our growing sense of the electric universe welcome professor Pierre Marie Robitaille [Applause] well thank you I would like to begin by thanking Dave Talbot for inviting me here and for providing scientists from different viewpoints the opportunity to address the scientific community it is a privilege to be here today I'll be speaking about the microwave background and as Steve tried to explain to you when you look at the microwave background if you're located on the earth you have signal from the earth itself the emissions of the oceans water around the earth and then you also have galactic emissions that are reaching the earth you have signals beyond the galaxy perhaps that that we get to see as well so there are many signals that are coming when you're at the earth but when you're at l2 the earth of course cannot hit the satellites that are at l2 therefore you will not get a monopole at l2 and the only data if you want to call it data that you get at all - will be dominated by the galaxy before I begin to speak because I'm I'm in the College of Medicine I did want to speak just briefly about anchoring now in medicine what is anchoring anchoring is occurs when a patient comes to the hospital and if and he's gravely ill and we'll assume that he's gravely ill and what happens is a physician sees him and he decides on the diagnosis but the diagnosis is incorrect the next physician comes in sees them and doesn't do his own physical and follows the diagnosis of the first physician so eventually unfortunately our patient dies the doctors get sued they lose their license and of course the attorneys get to make lots of money but in what happens in physics when we anchor well that's a different problem because we're not in a position that somebody's going to lose their life over it at least we hope not but when physics makes an error it's much harder to rectify because you can anchor and it takes tremendous incentive to go back and recheck the assumptions so relative to the microwave background to recheck the assumptions you actually have to go all the way back to 1860 and deal with kirchoff's law of thermal emission now I will talk about that law on Sunday not now because it it in of itself is actually the most important talk I will give even though this one's on the background and the other one is on the Sun also because I'm in the College of Medicine it's you know I have to figure out how this works I'd like to dedicate this work to two physicians now the first is my father he just retired from medicine after more than 50 years I think 55 years as a physician he was a family practitioner he delivered over 800 babies in his life he also helped the Saiga Mach Indians in Northern Ontario and he lowered the infant mortality rate for the Saiga Mach First Nations both for the mothers and their babies he was one of the first Caucasian men to be named as an honorary Indian chief in North America the next whoops that's the mistake that we make okay I'll get it here the next person that I'd like to dedicate the talk to is dr. Ignaz Semmelweis now I dedicate it to him as well because he's got a lesson for us right so in ninth in 1847 he advocated the physicians wash their hands with chlorinated lime solutions to reduce the incidence of mortality from child bed fever and a physician saw this as an insult because they felt that you know they were already pretty clean even though they were going for the necropsy lab to delivering women and they were killing these mothers and he he actually documented when he got the doctors to wash their hands that the mortality rates would drop so the physicians rather than just listen to him and keep washing their hands decided that he had to be incorrect his papers and ideas were largely rejected there were only a few people of the European medical community that recognized the importance of what he was saying he's actually I think the father of hygienic methods and he unfortunately died in an insane asylum he was only 47 now I've published extensively on the microwave background and I list the papers here some of the important ones relative to the stalks of Steve and I are W map or radiological analysis of course the papers on the earth contribution the paper on water the the bottom one that's listed there then you also have this all will affect global warming whether you believe in global warming don't believe in global warming for us to understand how the oceans are actually emitting is an important problem and then there's another paper on Kobe where I did a full analysis of Kobe and one on plank now dr. Reuben ski who's the editor of progress in physics has been very kind to me he's taken many many papers and enabled me to publish my work in what I consider a very new journal and of course people say well Pierre why do you publish an in-progress in physics and that's because it's a proper vehicle for what I'm dealing with now now I also want to point out that there's some parallels between MRI and the microwave background studies so an MRI scientist is actually well suited to go through this stuff because what we do are almost similar there's only the sample that changes in magnetic resonance imaging it's fundamentally a thermal method we have t1 relaxation it's called the thermal relaxation constant that was named so by Felix Bloch most people have forgotten that name their frequency of observation is from VHF to UHF but the a Tesla that I built and new scanners are now at point four gigahertz so almost in the microwave their detection methods that we use are RF antennas and they're coupled to pre amplifiers and radiometers we display our results in spectral images now if you look at the microwave background again you have a thermal problem you have a maximum emission at 160 gigahertz of course Penzias and Wilson were at 4 gigahertz and their first experiments that's only we were we are now at point 4 in magnetic resonance the detection methods are very similar at low frequency we have in microwave experiments we have RF antenna coupled to preamplifiers again and radiometers and we display our results in spectra or images so just generally what are the requirements for having an image well there's basically two requirements through the two key requirements is you have to have resolution and you also have to have signal-to-noise and it takes signal to noise to make contrast it also takes signal to noise to get resolution if an image is noisy how can you tell if it contains any information and this is critical to anybody who believes that the microwave background anisotropy maps can be real for them to be real they have to be reproducible and none of these maps are ever reproducible so they pool the data and then the their differences are from averages - a year or in Planck now they're trying to pool a bunch of data so you can't take averages you have to look when you have a low signal-to-noise image as you do in medicine when we do functional imaging for instance we're gonna have quite low signal-to-noise sometimes in the cat 5 you might have low signal to noise and how can we tell that the signal is real because it has to be reproducible so if you ever encountering somebody who's telling you the anisotropy maps are real just ask him for reproducibility he will never be able to deliver it because the galaxy is too variable now I want to show you an image that was done at the time that I did the a Tesla this is an image it's a clinical image from a human head is a sagittal sagittal slice and this is done with a conventional scanner it was a good scanner the image looks really bad and it's because I'm pushing the scanner right to its limit so I'm taking a very thin slice very little bit of the tissue and the matrix size is a 512 by 512 ya with only a two millimeter slice so when I do that there's still a little signal you can't get contrast anymore did you remember I told you to take signal to get contrast so this is a 512 by 512 and now here's an image from a Tesla and this is still a world-record today even though it was done for the year 2000 this was an image of 2000 points by 2000 and resolution same data same slice thickness a similar nutation angle everything is very comparable between these two images but the difference is of course I have more signal because I have an 8 Tesla scanner so this remains as I said a world record and resolution here's an expanded view of that so now what are the central issue is relative to understanding the microwave background well I think there are several the first is the early measurements did we have a right to assign the signal Penzias and Wilson to the universe could water have produced this signal and where is the water signal from the earth if if this if the microwave background signal really belongs to the universe where is the earth signal does that the 3 Kelvin temperature really have a real value or is the temperature really only apparent now this will be answered primarily in my talk on Sunday on kirchoff's law can we really see beyond the foreground of the galaxy into the universe and is there any real cosmological information in the anisotropy Maps the data processing produced the monopole Steve touched on the multi you touched on this as mankind truly sampled the first trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth now of a second after the Big Bang so we'll begin just by a quick review of the Penzias and Wilson experiment and when they completed their experiment they reported immediately that they had a 3.5 Kelvin signal that was unexpected and there was a this excessive signal was isotropic unpolarized and free from seasonal variations now if you look at the way the horn worked you had a contamination from the horn the noise from the horn was only point 9 Kelvin but they had the assigned 2.7 2.3 Kelvin to an atmospheric contamination so the total signal that came in was six point seven now of course they could rotate this horn and that's how they determined the amount of signal that's coming from the atmosphere they could just rotate the horn and as they rotated the horn they can compensate for this atmospheric signal but what they don't compensate for is an oceanic signal that's pumping photons into the atmosphere they also say that this 2.3 kelvin signal was due to absorption by oxygen in the atmosphere I think it had nothing to do with it nowhere in the Penzias and Wilson papers of 1965 can one find any discussion of water and where it might be expected to emit now of course they immediately say that a possible explanation is a sign is done by these cosmologists now what happens in Astrophysical Journal actually is that this interpretation by Daiki peoples and roll's and Wilkinson actually precede the dependence in Wilson publication so since when in science do we publish the finding after the interpretation you publish the finding first then you publish the interpretation so in the interpretation they say well could the universe be filled with microwave energy that behaves as a blackbody that gives us this blackbody signal the answer of course is no the assignment of a three points up five Kelvin temperature constitutes a violation of the laws of thermal emission and I will talk about that on Sunday because that in itself is quite detailed to explain but valid temperatures require a known solid no net conduction or convection or if you don't have a known solid you must be in thermal equilibrium with a rigid perfectly absorbing enclosure otherwise the temperature obtained may or may not be accurate so the universe is not in thermal equilibrium with an enclosure okay and especially if it's expanding it had no chance of ever becoming in thermal equilibrium a source which is not at three Kelvin can produce a signal if it sustains in addition to emission other means of contending with internal heat namely conduction and convection and this is by the way the reason that Max Planck said you cannot take a temperature of the Sun using thermal emission a source which is not at three Kelvin can produce a 3 Kelvin signal if it has an unexpected distribution of energy within its degrees of freedom as a result can water at 300 Kelvin produce a signal with an apparent temperature of 3 Kelvin so I thought we'd start by just looking assessing the situation here we're sitting on the earth I think there's quite a bit of water around us actually this famous poem that many of us learnt in grade school The Rime of the Ancient Mariner reminds us water water everywhere water has often complicated microwave background experiments so in their own literature when you read their papers you see that they're always having trouble with water when they're doing the experiments near the earth but they dismiss all this for instance when dr. Smith was testing a Radiometer at Berkeley he actually took the radiometer outside in the parking lot and there was a cloud that went overhead and he saw that he got a signal from the cloud so he knew his radiometer was working of course he was sampling water at the time then rain or Weiss he noticed that whenever you're doing microwave background experiments it's very simple to do when there's oceans or lakes nearby John Mather he commented in his book that the people working in the Atlantic Ocean had a very difficult time getting microwave background measurements done because the oceanic Brut signals can the oceanic patterns can produce signals that are very similar to cosmic fluctuations and dr. woody noticed that he sent up a balloon and on the ground and during the ascent they protected the antenna from condensation and then they had a small mirror to allow them to make sure that there was no condensation inside their horn well if condensation doesn't matter why do you care right now we know that condensation matters because dr. smut when he went to Lima Peru with an experiment and when he came down with the plane he got condensation as radiometers and they didn't work so what did he do he took him apart he took out all the water he dried him up put him back together and all of a sudden it worked here's one from John Mather the effect of air conduct condensing into the antennas were seen when the second window was open the valve which controls the gas flow should have been rotated so that all the gas has forced out through the cone and the horn when the situation was corrected emissions from the horn were reduced and the cold helium has cooled the surfaces on which the air had condensed and the signal returned to normal so he's telling you when I have water there my signal was too high now of course as Steve pointed out this slide from one of my papers I am just showing the structure of water and to remind everybody that there's a there's a hydrogen bond here and this is not at all like a hydroxyl bond the energy of this bond is about a hundred times the energy of that one the force constant the force constant in this bond that is characterizing this bond if we look at it as a simple harmonic oscillator the force constant here is a hundred times stronger than that one and that's a great concern so if you look at it if you look at the dot water dimer which we know exists in that atmosphere now I'm just taking the water dimer as an example the water dimer you can find it also in in in condensed water in in liquid water if you look at the structure of liquid water you'll see dimers inside of it and if you compare that if you look at this whoops I'm sorry I did a boo-boo I will get there so if you look on axis here in the dimer these are these are this is a linear these two these three atoms are all arranged linearly there is libation around this one but generally you can assume that they're linear and if you do that you can easily show that the energy in system 1 divided by the energy in system 2 will just be equal to the ratios of their force constants now the energy is related to their temperature well since these force constants are different by a factor of a hundred then the emission that you'll get will be different by a factor of 100 so instead of getting 300k emission you get 3 Kelvin emission so remember if water is a powerful absorber of microwaves then by Stewarts law it's also a powerful emitter now a little brief note on the Coby satellite which Steve also covered so the ferris horn was designed to operate over a phenomenal range actually from 30 to 3,000 gigahertz but no microwave horn has ever claimed to cover such a frequency range even 25 years later the claim is unsupported by vast knowledge of practical microwave antenna design on earth it's an engineering impossibility the COBE satellite as Steve mentioned is positioned at an altitude of 950 kilometers but the shield the satellite itself or the horn within the satellite which is located here is is this shield it has nothing to do with microwaves this is the shield for thermal photons not microwaves if it was a shield for microwaves it should be properly shielded so here I will for instance in this case what are you having you're having photons coming down from the earth below it and they're coming up and they're hitting the shield and they're diffracting against it and they come to the top of the door and they diffract right into this horn notice that the horn the fierce horn has a very smooth wall so because it has a smooth wall and because it's broadband it cannot be shielded for diffraction so so it has no corrugated surface to prevent diffraction so a horn a narrowband horn in microwave that you would use to prevent diffraction would to have walls that look something like this so now you see this corrugation and these corrugations that are put in horns they're very frequency specific that's why these are narrowband horns you never would make such a horn for a broadband signal so unlike the fierce horn on Kobe which is broad banded corrugated horns are always narrow banded the geometry of the corrugation is carefully calculated to be effective over a very narrow frequency range so there's no way that Kobe satellite could have prevented diffraction actually Wilkinson himself who was a member of the Kobe team and for which the W map satellite is named after his death was worried that there was diffraction in the we data so one of the old their own key members was worried about it so the COBE satellite of course is located just above a powerful source of microwave emissions the oceans of the earth clear signs of diffractions diffraction exist in the kobe ferrous data the data is too high at low frequencies too low at high so the Penzias and Wilson signal is very likely to be produced by the earth now we'll go through W map now I cover W map and there's a lot of lessons in W map which actually applies to all their methodologies in trying to create a nice atre P maps now as I mentioned w map is sitting far out in space this is a picture of the of the satellite and it's it's sitting over here at l2 so in this position well away from the earth there's no way W map is getting a monopole signal from the earth and W map never saw a monopole signal it's unable to by design but Planck should have been able to see it but it because planck has the capability capability to see an absolute signal but they never reported a monopole signal from l2 with the planck satellite in fact for planck analysis they use kobe ferris monopole data in their analysis and that data of course is more than is over 25 years old now or nearly 25 years old they also are worried that they have a lot of noise on their lf-i and my problem is that remember that this is a high tech device now that we've got 25 years of high technology we have a lot of noise coming into the LF I but remember that Penzias and Wilson also almost had no noise they only had point 9 Kelvin attributed to the instrument now SC showed here are the five map here are five maps from W map in each of the frequency and of course we see this enormous signal from from the galaxy okay unfortunately you can't get around this this signal is actually much much bigger than this these are cleaned images where they've already processed the data to get rid of galactic signal out here because it was so high the galactic center this is a quote from their papers the galactic center is a thousand times brighter than fluctuations in the microwave background and if you take if you take the statement as real it's impossible absolutely impossible to remove the galactic foreground and quantify any underlying signal so here's an example from NMR so it's a cosmologists really think that they can do that they can come and help us in medicine so here's an example where I take a water signal an NMR signals out so of course water is 110 molar so I'm going to take a sample I'm going to make a sample of water and I'm going to put a little bit of a compound in it just point one molar of this compound well when I take the spectrum which is a in here all you see is the water line okay this is just water I can blow it up and when I blow it up a factor of a hundred I now see some resonances from this compound now the resonances are not below the water peak they're next to it but for the microwave background they are under the water peak the same it's not water that they're looking at at l2 but it's a similar situation they're sitting over here under a strong strong microwave signal they got a little tiny signal they have probably similar line shapes they don't know what the line shapes are it's absolutely impossible for them to resolve these two signals it's a physical impossibility so the problem for the microwave background studies is that the signal of interest is exactly at the same frequency as a contaminated galactic signal in every single channel so under these circumstances the Galactic contamination of any magnitude cannot be properly addressed how does one distinguish the Galactic contamination from a constitution made by a primordial source so now you've got this this enormous signal and you have the primordial source I'm sorry and you have now the primordial source this little tiny signal well actually very very tiny compared to this this is really off scale right I do have to use a slide here so I have an analogy okay Paul and Mary may or may not be real there's a bowl containing six cups of water on the table how many cups of water if any did Mary pour in the bowl that's the question they want to answer all we really can tell is that there's a bowl with water of the table that's as bad as my jokes get now the situation is further complicated with W map with 300 known point sources so now we've got a whole bunch of point sources that we have to take out of the map so now we've got the Galactic contamination we got the point sources and we got the Galactic signal now for Planck they've got 15,000 point sources we'll try to put 15,000 point sources on this image and you could basically build any image you want so the problem for the microwave background studies is that the signal of interest is exactly at the same frequency as the contaminated Galactic and point source signals in every single channel in reality there are millions of microwave point sources in the universe because every star Kadeem it in the microwave and every galaxy can these problems potentially exists at every single point in the map when one looks at the anisotropy maps all the points matter even the points with near zero signal because they are contained in the multiple analysis but the interfering galactic signal can be greater than the signal of interest by a very very large amount because the signal of interest can be close to zero that is why the Galactic signal can be viewed as contamination of a hundred a thousandfold or more so this is shown here you have your your map and your resolving this in these multiples now these are the poles that they really care about in cosmology they don't care about this map they care about this stuff but this stuff has positive and negative contributions that means you're going through zero right so all the points even the points close to zero are extremely important and you have no signal to noise the entire Assembly of laboratory experiments will say even in medicine demonstrates that it is not possible to extract a weak signal from a powerful overline contaminant unless the experiment has perfect knowledge of the signal strength involved or the ability to control the signal at the source it is physically impossible to remove the galactic foreground so how does the W's map team do it because I've just said it's impossible well they use different methods over different years however the methods have nothing that can salvage the underlying problem so I just want to highlight again what the maps really look like so these are this is the five channels down in the lower part of the page of the slide and in the middle over here you have these right the three on the right the qw v and w band shown a gift at lower resolution but here's what they look like before they're cleaned now do you see how much there was galactic contamination before it's cleaned see how it looks when they present it to us this is the this is what people typically see they don't realize that cube and actually has that much galaxies in it and they don't even show the other two because they're going to be red now how do they get rid of the galactic foreground well this is a great experiment what you do is you break up the signals in eleven regions some away from the galaxy which you call region 0 and then eleven regions in the plane so I guess twelve regions total so what do they do well I now they're going to they're gonna do some addition here they've learned some algebra so what they do is they take signal K and they negate it and then they add it to ka they negate Q they add V they add W now this is what they did in region 4 now in the adjacent region this is what they did so you see that the coefficients are completely different they're changing by a factor of a thousand percent in two regions adjacent to one another but the reality is you're not allowed to negate this signal all negations constitute a violation of the laws of thermal emission as they make a cool sky appear warmer in the galaxy in addition one one can be violating the third law of thermodynamics because when one inverts these signals he can mathematically create negative temperatures which are prohibited temperatures do not exist below Absolute Zero just imagine if there is no monopole at l2 now in magnetic resonance I'll confess that we can have negative temperatures because we can have spin populations and invert them so we can talk about negative temperatures in our spins they don't get to touch the galaxies so here's what is happening now for region zero look what they're doing each channel is either positive as choose to make it there's infinite number of combinations we can all sit down and come and take it some to add to one and pick any numbers you want as long as they add to one it's a valid solution so what have they done it's positive this term is negative okay then they're negative again then positive but look this I told you the data has to be reproducible look at the coefficients that they use for addition see how they're changing over the years this one has changed 43 percent that's a big change in the same region just oh and by the way the three year average contains your one so when one inverts the channels you're creating the monopole the multiples you're creating these negative temperatures and you are in violation of thermodynamics so what is the signal to noise in the M R in the W map images so people see oh they see these images oh my god this is a real image we imaged the universe that's because they don't really understand what is an image so this is this famous image after the removal of the galaxies now here's the noise that they plot in their paper so they give us a noise of plus or minus a hundred micro Kelvin at this resolution and we know that their images I'm sorry we're at plus or minus 200 at this resolution these I can't remember I don't think these are identical resolutions but you can gather from their data if you look at it carefully they have signal-to-noise of about two to one relative to the noise of their instrument now I just want to show you some some Mr images of things or different images Wilson we won't say they're all mr so what's the first one right here I want you to guess this is a 2.1 signal-to-noise two to one signal-to-noise image this is an actual image probably of my head this one is of importance to us here this is an image of the moon and this one no one will guess it's the image of my right hand so when you have no signal-to-noise guess what you don't have an image unless it's reproducible and their image is not reproducible so since the W map images are not reproducible from year to year this is seen in the need to take different images at lower resolution which you're not allowed to do when you take a difference it has to be at the same resolution because this makes things look better than they really are and their coefficients are changing from year to year so here we have year one we have the three year average now this three year average actually contains your one but when you take the difference of these oh this does not look too good because now you have to degrade the resolution well when you degrade the resolution you lower the scale right this 30 doesn't mean anything now because this is on a different resolution see how big the blocks are versus the tiny points here you have to keep the resolution the same so actually these two images don't agree at all even though this image contains that one so that gives you an idea how bad it is so to give it in a different perspective I did a color difference map with the resolution preserved so in this case now I'm taking the three year average which again contains year one and I subtracted from year one do you see all the leftover and I can blow it up for you and you can see that there is a lot of leftover and some of this signal is red so the difference image indicates that the data has nothing to do with cosmology because these maps are not stable from year to year let alone on a cosmological time scale so if you have a point that moves remember we're measuring a signal that is not supposed to have moved with the universe they tell us as 13 billion years old so it doesn't move a year-to-year basis so in order to make cosmological interpretation the W map images must be perfectly stable from year to year even fluctuations at the level of a few pixels is disastrous and it's a lot more than a few pixels since the data must be stable on a cosmological time scale so this is an impossible experiment it cannot be done now if you look they also give us new analysis of the foreground and they actually try to tell us well this galactic signal I could break it into free--free emission spinning dust thermal dust it doesn't matter it's all galaxies now the Planck satellite I wrote a paper on the Planck satellite which Steve talked about about the conduction out of the four key reference targets well when you have a conductive path out of a blackbody it's supposed to be a blackbody it doesn't need to emit any photons to get rid of its heat it can use conduction so conduction is strictly forbidden so if the satellite isn't even designed properly the combination of data collected at all of Planck's nine frequencies this is a quote from them is crucial to achieve the optimal reconstruction of the foreground signal in order to subtract them violate thermodynamics and reveal the underlying Cosmic Microwave Background so now we have nine signals with Planck and now we're going to play the subtraction game with these guys I don't care how they subtract it you cannot invert any of these because these have real physical meaning oh and we have our fifteen thousand point sources now and they tell us it's right for follow-up characterization so here are my conclusions Penzias and Wilson are not allowed to assign a temperature of three point five Kelvin to their signal they don't know the temperature because they don't know that the source adheres to the condition by which the laws of thermal emission can be applied the applications of the laws of thermal emission in obtaining a real temperature requires that the source be enclosed with a perfectly absorbing enclosure or that it be a solid and furthermore to have a thermal spectrum you need a vibrational lattice as you find in condensed matter and in the BIGBANG they will never be one as such the 3.5 Kelvin temperature is not real it's only an apparent temperature and we have no evidence that the measured signal properly samples the entire energy content of the source because if you think of water water can put some energy in the hydrogen bond it can put some in the hydroxyl bond and we know from the oceans that they can be a lot in convection currents as so the temperature assignment stands as a violation of the laws of thermal emission since Penzias and Wilson cannot ascertain that this that the source of their signal was devoid of the effects of conduction and convection that is that they properly sampled all the degrees of freedom of the system in which they're interested also relative time of the monopole given the chemical nature of the hydrogen bond and it's proven ability to emit in this frequency range we know that as Steve mentioned from microwave ovens or submarine commanders know it because as soon as they break the surface of the sea microwave is dead when they go underwater that shows that the oceans are very very powerful absorbers it is certain that the monopole signal arises from the oceans and that other water containing bodies on our planet there is no monopole at l2 this implies that the earth cannot emit as much radiation in these frequency bands as some might believe that has consequences for those who are interested in radiative balance of the earth and everybody who's now with global warming so it's important to reassign the signal because humanity cares about its proper assignment this signal belongs to geophysics gnostic cosmology now of course we do have galactic signals source signals which we also sample from the earth but we don't care about those because they have no meaning they have no meaning in cosmology and they have no interest relative to understanding the earth the central signal that pen Justin Wilson won the Nobel Prize for and that signal is still tremendously important and believe me I still believe they get their Nobel Prize that was a great discovery but the thing is it has been miss assigned by others and now it has to be reassigned and this is an example of improper anchoring in physics microwave signals come primarily from our own galaxy and the the billions of galaxies found in the universe the point sources are innumerable this is relative to the anisotropy Maps the microwave anisotropy maps have no meaning and science so it would beat it the microwave anisotropy maps have no physical meaning in science they represent signal processing errors and artifacts violations of thermodynamics it is scientifically inappropriate to negate some microwave signals and then use those results to remove the foreground this creates images with both positive and negative signals or temperatures something never found in nature it constitutes at the minimum a violation of the laws of radiation and at worst a violation of the third law of thermodynamics once again multiples have no physical meaning in science the anisotropy maps are devoid of year-to-year stability required of a signal of cosmological importance as Steve also talked about the axis of evil' so the axis of evil which has been a subject of recent discussion in cosmology is nothing more than image processing artifacts which arises from an attempt to move the foreground and create the multiples the Copernican principle remains valid we do not live in a geocentric universe so even though I said the water signal comes from the earth I'm not doing cosmology here I'm just telling you the oceans are emitting in the microwave we do not live in a geocentric universe we have never seen and will never see the first trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang thank you very much [Applause] [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info On this series, we are presenting what we consider the ten most compelling and clear-cut reasons why electromagnetism is the force that rules the cosmos. This exercise provides an invaluable opportunity to juxtapose the theoretical predictions and explanations of standard cosmology versus those of the Electric Universe. In our first two episodes, we explored the significance of pervasive, vast cosmic magnetic fields and filamentary cosmic structures respectively, neither of which are predicted or explained by gravity-centric cosmology but they are expected features of an electric universe. In fact, at all scales throughout the cosmos, both the structures and energies of the most stupendous phenomena reveal an underlying cause that continues to elude space scientists. Today we explore why spectacular emissions across unimaginable cosmic distances are the third of ten reasons why the universe is electric. Cosmic Jets It is a mystery that space science must openly confront, what force is capable of producing high energy jets spanning not millions of miles but many light-years across the cosmos. What confines the jets to narrow streams across cosmic distances and what prevents the, so called, streams of gas from dispersing in the "vacuum of space"? These questions are posed by the discovery of Herbig-Haro objects, or jetted stars, which have sometimes been characterized as "cosmic tornadoes". The image on your screen appeared as the Astronomy Picture of the Day in 2006. The stellar jet of Herbig-Haro 49/50 was detected at the incredible velocity of 100 km/s. The caption of the APOD, entitled Cosmic Tornado, reads as follows, "Though such energetic outflows are well known to be associated with the formation of young stars, the exact cause of the spiraling structures apparent in this case is still mysterious." Of course, terms like tornado and outflow are derived from the familiar behaviors of wind and water on our own rocky planet. But how could such terminology be applicable to the behaviors of "gases in a vacuum"? The inappropriateness of the analogy is highlighted in the scientific paper, The Formation of Stars and Solar Systems. It states, "Stellar jets are analogous to giant lawn sprinklers. Whether a sprinkler whirls, pulses or oscillates, it offers insights into how its tiny mechanism works. Likewise stellar jets, billions or trillions of miles long, offer some clues as to what's happening close into the star at scales of only millions of miles. Material either at or near the star is heated and blasted into space, where it travels for billions of miles before colliding with interstellar material. This explanation raises more than one fatal objection. It begs the question, if one were to turn on a "lawn sprinkler in space" what would happen to the stream of water? The aforementioned paper acknowledges the problem by asking the following question, "Why are jets so narrow? The Hubble pictures increase the mystery as to how jets are confined into a thin beam." Of course, heat alone does not explain the ejection and confinement of the jetted material. Discussing the jet of Herbig Haro 1/11, the aforementioned paper admits that a disc around the star, which is supposed to provide the "nozzle" from which the theoretical lawn sprinkler emanates, is not evident in this image. The authors then entertain a rarely considered possibility; they state, "One theoretical possibility is that magnetic fields in the disk might focus the gas into narrow beams, but there is as yet no direct observational evidence that magnetic fields are important." We note that this statement was published more than a decade ago and, as we outlined in the first episode of this series, even in the last 10 years space scientists have had no choice but to much more freely acknowledge the pervasive vast cosmic magnetic fields. A dramatic recent example of this is the magnetic field scientists have detected associated with the Magellanic bridge, a thread-like filament stretching an astounding 75,000 light-years and connecting the small and large Magellanic Clouds. One of the researchers said of the finding, "Not only are entire galaxies magnetic, but the faint delicate threads joining galaxies are magnetic, too. Everywhere we look in the sky, we find magnetism." Jane Kaczmarek of the University of Sydney said of the finding, "In general, we don't know how such vast magnetic fields are generated, nor how these large-scale magnetic fields affect galaxy formation and evolution." Just as electric currents sustain and confine the vast filament connecting the small and large Magellanic Clouds, it is electric currents flowing through plasma that produce the extraordinary structure and energies of the Herbig-Haro jets. An ongoing astronomical mystery is both the beaded structure and "kinkiness" of stellar jets. Of course, as plasma physicists will attest, beading and kink instabilities are two of the most easily recognized features of electrical discharges in plasma. In fact, as we turn our attention to an even greater scale, to the spectacular cosmic jets seen emanating from galaxies, we see the perhaps inevitable confirmation of the jet's electrical nature. In 2011, a team of scientists including radio astronomer Philipp Kronberg, measured the electrical current in the jet shooting from the galaxy 3C303. The New Scientist headline "Universe's highest electric current found" states of the finding, "A COSMIC jet 2 billion light-years away is carrying the highest electric current ever seen: 10 to the 18th power amps, equivalent to a trillion bolts of lightning. Philipp Kronberg of the University of Toronto in Canada and colleagues measured the alignment of radio waves around a galaxy called 3C303, which has a giant jet of matter shooting from its core. They saw a sudden change in the waves' alignment coinciding with the jet. 'This is an unambiguous signature of a current,' says Kronberg."     Unfortunately, the team of scientists can only conclude that a black hole produces magnetic fields which then generate the current. But more recently, the study of cosmic jets at the vastest scale has provided findings that can only be described as fatal for this theory. In 2016, astronomers reported a finding that will never be reconciled with conventional black hole theory. A Royal Astronomical Society press release states of the finding, "...supermassive black holes in a region of the distant universe are all spinning out radio jets in the same direction.." A lead investigator, professor Romeel Dave writes, "This is not obviously expected based on our current understanding of cosmology. It's a bizarre finding." As noted by Professor Andrew Russ Taylor, "These black holes don't know about each other, or have any way of exchanging information or influencing each other directly over such vast scales..." In the Electric Universe it is not black holes at the centers of galaxies which are responsible for the observed energies and mass. Rather, the plasma discharge phenomenon, called a z-pinch, creates plasmoids at the cores of galaxies. As the plasmoid's charge density increases, it creates the well-known plasma feature called a double layer which can explode or release energy in the form of cosmic jets and other spectacular emissions. As we explained in the previous episode, plasma scientists have provided persuasive experimental proof for the dominant role of electromagnetism in influencing the structure and rotation of galaxies. In the Electric Universe, space across the vastest cosmic distances has a substructure of electrical potential, typically extremely subtle at any point but sufficient to affect cosmic directionality. Both stars and galaxies occur like pearls on a string revealing a filamentery or even cellular structure to the universe at unfathomable scales. Plasma physicists have demonstrated experimentally that plasma discharges can be scaled up to 14 orders of magnitude. In fact, the Nobel prize-winner, the father of plasma cosmology Hannes Alfven proposed that plasma phenomena could be scaled up to an incredible 28 orders of magnitude. As we will continue to demonstrate in our following episode, standard astrophysics will never successfully explain the most stupendous electromagnetic events in the cosmos through theoretical models in which electricity doesn't cause anything. The breathtaking form and energies of cosmic jets are yet another of countless reminders that we live in an electric universe.

[Music] First off, I think I'd better apologize that I'm going to talk more about gravity than Electric Universe, but I think you can see a few connections as we go along. I didn't know how to organize this. Clearly I'm going to present it in a way that it wasn't derived, and what I'm trying to do here is simply to show some agreement with facts and ask questions. What does theory say, what does the evidence say? And what's next, I'm going to talk a little bit about the Electric Universe, if I can get through it. I've got too many slides, I'll admit. Okay, we'll go ahead. First of all, I think there's some guiding principles we need to follow. A reliable experiment trumps any theoretical claim, and rational explanation trumps any magical mechanism. There's quite a bit of magic in special relativity and that's partly why I say that one. I like this verse from Proverbs by Solomon. He was probably the leading scientist of his day and I think it's insightful. Here's a few nice quotes that I just couldn't help from putting in. The tendency of a group of human beings to quickly come to believe something that its individual members will later see is obviously false, is truly amazing. It is controversy that keeps science alive and keeps it moving. And, science is the organized skepticism in the reliability of expert opinion. I tend to agree strongly with those statements. Just a little background. I've written a bunch of papers; I figured I'd put them here, so if you have questions you can probably find them. The last one there hasn't been accepted yet, but I'm fairly confident it will be in the near future now. It's been in process for two years, fighting with some of the reviewers. Okay, now into some of the questions and answers. I've tended to put in red things that I disagree with (I haven't followed that carefully) and green are things that are true. And here's some things about GPS that I think they have pictured properly. And one of those is, what effects does gravitational potential have on atomic clocks? Clocks higher in the gravity field run faster. And, also, in motion, what does kinetic energy, not just velocity but kinetic energy, speed of movement, have on atomic clock rates? And it slows them down. And there's clear evidence for this. GPS in an elliptic orbit (it's not highly elliptic, but elliptic enough), when it's near perigee,, it's going faster, and it's slower in the gravity field. The two effects are identically equal and add together, and in fact the equations in different uses sometimes will compute the velocity and use that and double it. And sometimes they'll compute the potential and double that. Similarly on the surface of the earth, because we're spinning, a clock at the equator for example, is farther away from the center of the earth, it's got a [higher] gravitational potential, and that [higher] gravitational potential caused it to run faster. However, it's spinning which causes it to run slower. [These two effects] exactly cancel each other. So, if you had a mean sea level all the way around the earth, all the clocks would run at the same rate. Kind of interesting. Next is the theory of the Equivalence Principle. Gravity acts on electromagnetic radiation and here's what the recognized authorities say. And here is where we run into some real problems. The claims [that] the frequency/energy of electromagnetic radiation when rising in a gravitational field has a redshift. I.e., it decreases. When falling, it has a blueshift or increases. I show four people here, Einstein, Feynman, Clifford Will, and Neil Ashby. Will and Ashby are current theorists that are well recognized, and they all claim that this is the case. Well, they use an energy argument from Feynman and Einstein. One of them talks about frequency, one about energy. [This is the] same thing. The argument is made by the conservation of energy. It takes energy to move an atom up in a gravity field, and then you let it emit some radiation. You lower the atom back down and let it absorb the electromagnetic radiation. Well, the energy of the atom is different, they claim, and therefore the energy of the radiation that's gone between them has to change, or you wouldn't get back your original energy. Well, what's the problem with that? The critical assumption in the Einstein and Feynman energy argument is that the same amount of energy is required to emit radiation from an atom, independent of the gravitational potential. Well, this is not obviously true, and I will show that in fact it is obviously not true. First of all, the Transit system and GPS, both show that in fact, the frequency as it falls from satellite to ground, does not change. In fact, I find it highly interesting that Clifford Will admits on page 50 of his “Was Einstein Right?” that clocks are affected when you move them up and down in the gravity field. But he says, we can't really know if it's a clock rate because it's not measured in real time. Yeah, just some real beautiful logic here. So I claim that it is the frequency emitted which changes and not the frequency in transit. For example, the famous experiment at Stanford where they let radiation fall in a tower, it was the fact that the clocks that they measure the frequency with, is different, not the fact that the radiation changed. There's direct proof available from GPS to show that this frequency does not change in transit. I think this is the best case that I can make. GPS sends a modulated signal from satellite to ground that's binary encoded, and encoded in it is the time at which the signal left the clock, left the satellite, and the time at which it reaches the ground then can be measured. The difference in time sent and the time received is multiplied by the speed of light to get the distance. If the frequency or energy increased in transit during that time, the phase reversals would be wrong and the major distance would be short. Well, maybe it is short. But the integrated carrier frequency would get shorter and shorter because it's all continuously decreasing. And in fact, my old Hatch filter where I smoothed the code measurements with the carrier, to get higher accuracy, would diverge. It doesn't diverge, therefore the frequency cannot be changing as it falls. And here's that ‘outstanding logic’ again from world famous relativists. Clifford Will, I already mentioned he says you don't know whether it happens in real time or not. Neil Ashby, I call this ‘double or nothing’ quote, “Second, the strong equivalence principle implies that light traveling downward in a gravitational field is shifted to a higher frequency; i.e., it is blue-shifted and gains energy. As a consequence, atomic clocks at a higher elevation of the gravitational field run faster.” I say what kind of logic are these people trained in? I think, quoting from Peter, just a phrase in the New Testament, “they are willingly ignorant.” I happen to know, for example, Clifford Will a graduate student of his called me once after he read one of my letters and said, I talked to Will about this and he says, “you're wrong and when he gets back from vacation he'll let you know.” Well, that was two years ago. I presume he's back from vacation by now. And Ashby recently submitted an article to that same magazine that I had my first paper in, on that list, and it essentially addressed the same issue that I addressed seven years earlier. Well, he came up with a weird explanation for the same thing that I explained, I think, logically. I criticized it back to the editor; turns out the editor is a friend of mine, or I would never have got the original paper published, so I sent the criticism back and that's been four or five months ago and the paper still hasn't appeared. So, I'm beginning to think that they are, as I said, ‘willingly ignorant’. They don't want to look at the facts. Okay, there are a lot of related questions though if you follow this logic to its natural conclusions. Incidentally, this Sheldon Harris again I saw one earlier of this same picture I think. “He hasn't made any progress with his theory, so he's beginning to work on his resemblance to Einstein.” Okay, where does gravitational potential energy come from? How does the gravitational force arise? Do inertial and structural mass diverge? How is the total energy split between structural energy and kinetic energy? Is the matter wave frequency or energy, defined by twice the classical kinetic energy? And can black holes exist? So let's look at some of the implications of that fact that the frequency doesn't change as it falls. It has some huge implications. First of all we can reverse Einstein and Feynman to say, obviously if the frequency hasn't changed going up and down, then the energy hasn't changed of the particle itself. Well, that means that this energy of falling must have come from the structure itself. In other words, the rest mass energy (maybe I'll show later, I prefer to call it structural), the structural mass energy is what has changed and provided us our gravitational energy. Since radiant energy doesn't change, the kinetic energy of fall must come from the decrease of the rest-mass energy. And that's a big implication. There's some gravitational force implications. If gravitational energy comes from the rest-mass, the spatial gradient/derivative of the energy should give us the gravitational force. And it does very closely. If I use a gravitational scale factor for length and energy, etc., which we will go into a little more, Einstein has the square root one there. I have instead an isotropic one, (it's called that in some of the literature), but it's the one I get when I say that matter is made up of resonant, spinning ether blobs if you will, and because it takes reaction time of the ether at sea, that's where we get m c squared. In any case, if I use the exponential form, you'll see it differs only out there in the second order. But when I take that potential energy and take the gradient of it, a big difference. In the isotropic form I get the scale factor in the numerator here, right there, and if I use Einstein’s it goes in the denominator. In other words, the force would increase as I fall, even though I know I'm losing energy, structural energy, which I think is the gravitational potential energy. So, the isotropic form has to be the correct form for me to gain energy from the particle itself. Well, this has other interesting implications. In fact, if you pursue it to its logical, the G itself has a scale factor. I almost neutralize that by putting c-fourth in the denominator, and saying the force is generated by the energy of the rest mass energy, or structural energy of the source, and acting on the structural energy of the particle which now is decreasing in energy as it falls, and in fact this explains the Halton Arp low energy, I think. Because as you add more and more mass, it has less and less effect. Incidentally that rules out a black hole, among other things. But it also explains quite a bit of Halton Arp’s observations, I believe. Since they measure how much mass there is in a star by the orbiting stars around it, or whatever, this decreased force (because of this decreased F) also says that they're measuring the mass too low, which explains why some of the blue stars have a redshift that Halton Arp explained and fits together with it being a gravitational shift, and works out very nicely. Gravitational Scaling and No Black Holes. Shapiro experiment did radar time delay from Mars as it passes behind the Sun and showed that in fact the speed of light slows as the square of the gravitational scale factor. Local time intervals get longer by the inverse of s, clock frequency slowing, which implies that lengths shorten by s, and that means the structural energy decreases by s. The mass itself increases as the cube, but the energy decreases because of the speed of light changing. And black holes, the gravitational force is self-limiting, the structure and gravitational energy decrease proportional to s. Gravitational force does not act on electromagnetic radiation which means that any emissions from a black black hole if it were there, if it were straight up, it would have no effect. What you're seeing is just simply the lower frequency at which it was emitted. Now it is true that there's some refraction effects, so if it came out at an angle it would dim that result. But the major effect is there obviously could not be a black hole. Okay, Weak Equivalence Principle. Gravitational and inertial mass are equal, is the claim, and the energy implications of that. The velocity scale factor I give over here, and there's the total energy - the potential energy plus the kinetic. The components of the total energy, I say the structural and the kinetic are given here, and you'll notice that I've doubled the kinetic energy. And that's because I claim that there's a hidden component which is evidenced by the fact that a moving particle emits lower radiation. So, it has converted part of its structural mass, when it moves, into kinetic mass and that works out for a number of reasons, and it looks like it's great. The identification of the structural/gravitational and inertial mass then becomes like this. Inertial mass times the speed of light times s gives the total energy. And then the gravitational energy and the kinetic energy. Okay, problem is [that] the decreased potential energy causes the frequency radiated to decrease, and therefore decrease structural energy. Increased kinetic energy also causes it to decrease and the solution is the same. The structural and inertial mass diverge with velocity. There's actually been some evidence of that in some other papers that I don't cite here. The theory says rest mass is invariant with frame and energy conservation. The invariance of the rest mass - it's really interesting here. In special relativity they claim that the rest mass doesn't change. Well, if we work through the equations and we expect energy to be conserved, what we'd expect would be that the energy of the moving planet or whatever, would be decreased by the kinetic energy. And sure enough, when you plug that into this equation, you get that the structural mass has apparently decreased by the gravity’s motion factor. And that in fact resets them, so that if I'm going to measure them on the earth, they'll look like they're the same. We'll go into a little more of that. Note that it's numerical invariance and not physical invariance, for both speed of light, inertial mass and a number of other things. Confirmation of structural mass decrease and inertial mass increase with velocity, which is contrary to theory. The frequency of emission (and absorption) increases with potential energy, but decreases with kinetic energy (e.g. Pound-Rebka experiment) that I mentioned earlier. The frequency (energy) of matter waves is twice the classical kinetic energy. I've never seen anybody try to explain why. Direct tests of inertial and gravitational mass divergence (with fall) have always been performed at the same velocities. So, they're not even really looking for it. In a given frame the structural (gravitational) mass and the inertial mass are equal when stationary, because the kinetic energy is reset to zero in your moving frame. In a given frame, the structural (gravitational) mass and inertial mass may vary by the same amount as the gravitational potential energy is changed, if you're not moving up and down in that potential. Okay, on to the next. GPS and the Strong Equivalence Principle Theory. Here's what the experts say. The effects of acceleration and gravity are completely equivalent. Einstein said it. Feynman said it. Ashby says it in chapter 14 of the Global Positioning Bible, if you will, and let's just go on: What experiment says. Gravitational potential causes clock rate changes, but acceleration causes Doppler frequency changes. Well, there's a significant difference there. I can integrate my clock frequency changes and get time. I can't integrate Doppler frequency and get time. But by the previous argument from GPS, the frequency does not change when falling and the radiated frequency (clock rate) changed as a function of the gravitational potential. In GPS, the Doppler frequency can be distinguished from the clock rate by sending the clock reading via the same electromagnetic signal, i.e. it is modulated on the signal. Tracking millisecond pulsars can distinguish between clock rate and Doppler rate and [this] clearly shows that they aren't equal. Clock rate integrates into clock time but Doppler does not. The effects are not equivalent. I do admit there is one minute [tiny] effect that cancels and that is with the earth falling towards the Sun as it orbits, and the GPS also falling, it turns out, over that 70 milliseconds, there's just enough tiny acceleration of the earth that it essentially cancels out that clock effect instantaneously. But, as we shall see, the integration of it still has good effects. On to theory again. Infinitesimal Lorentz Boosts (or transformations). The theory claims that there are valid means of adjusting SRT to accelerated frames. And I give a bunch of references for that. Experiment instead, agrees with Goy's hypothesis. He's a Prof. in Italy and he says that you can't do Lorentz transformations instantaneously, but you can set your clock rate instantaneously to whatever the velocity is at that point. And that's proven by the fact [that] in a muon storage ring the acceleration has no effect, but the velocity does directly affect it. And here I want to do a couple of experiments to illustrate a little bit of this. If you use GPS and free running clocks to measure the time and the speed of light in orbit around the earth, and I'm going to measure the speed of light across this bar, or even perhaps across this bar, if I gravity gradient stabilize it for example, so that this always points towards the earth, then these two clocks on the two edges run at exactly the same rate, because they're traveling at exactly the same rate and exactly the same potential. Meanwhile these two are traveling at slightly different speeds, and that speed is just exactly enough to cancel the difference in the potential. And so, all these clocks will run at the same rate if I'm not rotating this. The horizontal leg is just like GRACE and the GRACE satellites use GPS for time and they clearly show that, yes the clocks run at the same rate. They agree with the GPS time and GRACE is just two satellites in the same orbit, separated by a couple of hundred kilometers. But there are some interesting things that we can also learn here. For light traveling between those two satellites, it turns out it will be measured as c minus v, the velocity of the satellites. Because of the transit time, how far the satellites have moved in that transit time, we can reduce that to a distance traveled. We can compute a change in clock that would compensate for it and it turns out that it's exactly that v x over c squared negative. And for carrying a clock, if you look at the gamma factor and look at the center part term, which is caused by the orbit, you get that same correction. The first term can be made arbitrarily small by moving slowly. And this one is common to anything on the earth, so you can get exactly the same effect by carrying a clock from one to the other. Slow clock transport induces a clock bias, and Einstein two-way synchronization produces that same clock bias. So they will measure the speed of light as c, if in fact you try to synchronize them. But if you don't synchronize them and it's not rotating, you won't. Next: spin. What if we rotate it, or what if we stop the rotation (we were rotating the last one pointing towards the earth)? This one we’re not. And one way of doing that would be to spin this thing around its vertical axis, and now it won't rotate as it goes around the earth. The spin we could use to see that it would create the clock bias between the two that make it look like the speed of light is c between the two. These two clocks run at different rates, because of their gravitational potential. But lo and behold, if you integrate those two rates as this goes around the earth, this one will wind up being behind it, once you've gone a quarter of the way around, and it creates just exactly the right amount of clock bias to measure the speed of light of c again. Well, this is exactly what happens on the earth: the spin of the earth keeps the earth oriented the same way in space, and the spin and the gravitational potential of the sun, wind up causing it to make it look like the speed of light is c on the earth, even though it's not. Okay I think that's good enough. Next, theoretical claims for Lorentz transformation or boosts. If you make two non-collinear Lorentz transformations, they claim it'll create a torque. Nobody knows where the torque comes from, but Thomas gave an original derivation for that on the electron. Lorentz boosts of the earth causes the cancellation of the Sun's gravitational field, according to Ashby. Muller attempts to explain the torque and he actually gives a physical explanation which I think makes sense. The trouble is, if he were right, and if the Thomas procession explanation were right, you'd get twice as much. I do believe that the divergence of structural mass and inertial mass can cause the precession effect. The experiment: gravitational potential of the Sun does not affect the clocks. This does affect the clocks, whereas they claim that it didn't. The frequency effects integrate into the clock biases. And that's exactly by the process I just explained on that spinning ‘thing’. The earth is spinning; as a result you get some clock biases, that wind up making the speed of light look like it is the same in all directions. And when the orbit direction changes, the gravitational potential of the Sun is just enough to keep that bias the same amount. So, Ashby's claims are wrong. The fall of the earth does not cancel out any effect on the clocks caused by the gravitational field of the Sun. There's another fundamental question we can get back to. What about length contraction? Is it real? If so, what's the mechanism? I claim that the conservation of momentum requires length contraction of an orbit in a moving frame. How do I get this? Well, when you're moving, the inertial mass increases as the experiments have shown. It turns out that, if I'm in orbit around the earth for example, up here, my orbital speed adds to the earth speed. I'm going enough faster, then my mass is a little higher. Conservation of momentum says I have to move a little bit slower, therefore I'm going to wind up closer to the earth in front. Down here just the opposite effect. It cancels some of it. I get lower mass, therefore my speed has increased and I get a little closer to the earth on the tail end. I believe that exact same thing happens in the atoms and so forth. So, we get length contraction caused by conservation of momentum. Well, there's another amazing fact about it and that is it's exactly the same clock bias that will counteract that slow tiny velocity change and make it look like we have uniform momentum in an orbit around the earth, even when the momentum is not uniform. And the clock times. I could use this as a clock and see that there's clock slowing etc. Okay, theory says the speed of light is physically invariant. Wikipedia questions it and I say the real question is, is the speed of light physically invariant, or simply numerically invariant in a local inertial or local gravitational frame? Shapiro radar time delay shows the speed of light varies in a gravitational potential, and I say: lengths shorten, frequency decreases, speed of light decreases as the square, but it's locally invariant numerically. In other words, it's physically changed, but it has not mathematically changed in terms of a number I would measure locally. Now back to transformations. We get the Selleri transformation. Again, a Prof. in Italy, has developed a transformation where he says there's clock slowing and there's length contraction, which is why I've argued for those two. And he gives a simple set of equations for that Selleri transformation. It's the same as the Lorentz transformation except there's a time difference equation. If you manipulate the mathematics of that time difference and simplify it, it turns out that it's that same clock bias that you get from Einstein synchronization. So, yes, the Lorentz transformation works, but it's because you've changed the clock. And it turns out you've changed the scale. Over here we're looking at that clock slowing and it winds up when you look at everything, the speed of light is physically decreased by gamma squared, if you're going one way. If you're going back the other way, for example the earth. I call the earth a child frame of the Sun and the Sun a parent frame of the earth because the speed of light is physically different in the two frames, from what we've just looked at. And of course, there would be a galactic frame that's parent of the Sun, etc. So, numerically c is invariant, but physically it's not. Okay. One-way Sagnac effect on the earth. The measurement is the result of earth's rotation around its axis. I claim that that's absolutely false. Wang has done some experiments with conveyor belts and shown that their circular equation, right there, is really equivalent to the length, it  can be put in terms of the length. Well, on a one-way path, you'd expect it to  be half as big as the GPS experts claim. There's this triangle that it follows and they put it  in the same form for a one-way because of earth's rotation. But again, if you work it out, it turns out it's just v l over c squared. And when you put it in terms of where the satellite and the receiver are, it works out to be exactly the same as that v x distance along the equator. And so there's clock biases that have to be accounted for in GPS, to remove the Sagnac effect. Everybody asks why  there isn't one for orbits. Well, there isn't one for orbits because they're all affected by the same amount. So, you just adjust your clocks. The clocks have been adjusted and are automatically kept that way from the argument we've already given. A little bit more proof of that is GPS has to include all receiver motion in the effect, whether it's just rotational or not. And that's the ICD document that claims that that's the case. So again, it's not a rotation, it's the fact that the receiver and source  are moving. Okay. I then come up with what I call the Apparent Lorentz transformation. And I say it's the result of the Selleri transformation along this axis, added with a clock bias, or removed from a clock bias. There is a scale change across this, one way when you're going one way, and the other when you're going back the other way. Okay. And that has some implications later on. I say  why call the transformation an Alternate Lorentz transformation? Why not call it the Lorentz transformation? And I say, that's because the interpretation is dramatically different. Yes, the mathematics is the same, but the physical speed is different and there is a length contraction, even of the earth on the order of a few centimeters. Which incidentally, I came across the paper a long time ago. I haven't checked on it recently. When they tried to compute precise orbits with radar, of the planets, they did not get the right values. They tried it with and without Einstein's theories, and it didn't work either way very well. I claim that they're not taking into account this flattening effect and the speed of light changes as a function of direction here. The length contraction is different in different directions and incidentally that'll cause a very tiny change in your VLBI measurement of the milliarc seconds. So, there's some fun things that they don't account for, that I believe we're beginning to see the residual effects of that. The speed difference, the need to distinguish between parent frame and child frame, to know whether the scale  is changing up or down. It clarifies the need for a specific bias mechanism  to account for the clock bias. Special relativity in general, seems to think and is evidenced by the infinitesimal Lorentz transformation claims, that  the clocks will automatically be biased under acceleration, to still measure the speed of light to c. And that's clearly not the case. They have to be  in a gravitational field that's adjusting the clocks properly, or that will not happen. And as just seen by the great satellites they are not synchronized to measure the speed of light to c, because they have not been biased by that proper amount. Okay. So, I say it clarifies the need for Einstein re-synchronization if the acceleration is linear and not in a gravitational field. Okay. What's next? This is from Sheldon Harris's same ‘Einstein Simplified’ book. He says, “As I mentioned next week in my talk on reversible time!” So, I'm going to look a little bit here at what's next Next week (or later): To be explained. The anomalous Earth Gravity Assist. It's my  hypothesis that [it is] that same flattening of the earth’s gravitational potential upon  a solar orbit. It works fine for any orbit around the earth, because they have the same phenomena effects. But once I use the earth to send somebody else, I believe and in fact the largest earth gravity assist observed, came in directly orthogonal to what that flattening would be. So, I think (I haven't worked out  the details), but I believe that that will explain the extra acceleration seen on earth gravity assists. The apparent relativity of gravitational and electromagnetic forces. My last paper, that I still haven't had published, I show how a gravito-magnetic effect looks like a gravity effect in a moving system. I intend to try to do the same thing electromagnetically and I have that outlined and I believe it'll work. It's a little more complicated than the gravity one. Another interesting thing is that there's a speed kick of millisecond pulsars whenever they collapse down  more. I believe that's just a conservation of momentum effect and the direction of that momentum. They speed up and I believe it gives them a kinetic kick along the axis. Incidentally,  in that gravity one I found that if I have a spinning orbit and I speed it up, I also get the part of that spin energy goes into kinetic energy. So again, it indicates it's just like that hidden kinetic energy elsewhere. Spin energy can create hidden kinetic energy when you start moving. I haven't really done any work on this last point in 20 years, but 20 years ago I did do some work on the relationship between gravitational and electric forces. Now, this is hypothetical and you may have big objections to it. But never- theless, my conjecture is that there's a relationship between gravitational and kinetic. Gravitational potential, I believe, arises from compression of the ether and that's why it exponentially decays with distance from the planet. Gravitational forces arise from the compressive ether gradient. Gravitational force is locally generated by the local gradient (no travel time). Kinetic force is due to the shear gradient induced by the motion in the ether. Electric and magnetic, I believe, are simply oscillations of the other two. A lot of people think, and properly so, because there's 40 orders of magnitude difference between them, that gravity is residual electric. I believe it's just the opposite and when you  look at how concentrated the mass is in an atom for example, I think this might help explain the effect. The electrical potential arises from an oscillation in the ether density, I believe. And the electric force is due to the interaction gradient and direction of flow of that ether oscillation. I believe an electron, for example, is anti-rotating a phasing structure and makes it look like it’s coming in phase motion because of the rotation, while a positron would rotate in the opposite direction and it would look like it would be going out. Magnetic force is due to the oscillation of the shear induced by the motion, I believe. What is a little bit of supporting evidence for that? Well, for example in gravity there's no travel time. In the electromagnetic to the best of my knowledge and from what I've seen, it travels at the speed of light, and it looks like that next paper I'm working on. And that explains one of the differences between the electric and magnetic as well. There's only one sign to the charge, no repulsion, but if I have an oscillation, I can get plus and minus inward and outward phase motion. Apparent morphing of gravitational and kinetic into gravity-only. Same way, apparent  motion of electromagnetic forces with motion into electric only. Earthquakes induce electro- magnetic phenomena. With the one in Japan recently, they saw the ionosphere bump up right above it. So, I believe that motion of mass, oscillation of mass in particular, can create an electric field, a strong electric field. Io was mentioned in the talk before mine. I looked at it again, 20 years ago, and the decameter radiation occurred as Io was in front and behind [Jupiter] and had opposite patterns. So, I believe that's when you'd get the most oscillation of apparent gravity, because one's following the other in either case. And I believe it's what creates that strong electric field. And of course spiral galaxies. You saw that electric radiation between the stars, well those stars are following one another and create an oscillation. So, I believe that it's the gravity or the mass oscillation, which causes these huge electric forces. This is a big quote. I'll skip it since we're probably  low on time and I'd like for a little bit of time to ask questions. But one of the famous professors that looked at biochemical processes said at the tail end of explaining it to people, “There's no possibility whatever that this system could have arisen by chance.” I tend to think the same thing of physics. There's some remarkable mathematics and remarkable design as evidence. So, I say, “Be a King, like Solomon. Search out matter.” [Applause] [Music] 
[Music] In previous episodes of this seven-arc series, we covered how the development of new instruments has accompanied, or gene- rated, fundamental shifts in scientific thinking. The instruments measure overlooked discrepancies and detect unimagined qualities. The previous explanatory ideas won't stretch over the new evidence without patching, and the patches become awkward  and arbitrary. At some point scientists decide that the old patched ideas are too much of a nuisance and they come up with new ideas that fit better. Brahe’s more precise instruments arguably led to the replacement of Ptolemy's kinematic model of planetary motions with Newton's dynamic model. Patching Ptolemy's perfect circles  with ellipses, especially when strong objections were already raised against his linear equant element, would have been playing with dogmatic thinking. The great increase of instrumentation in the 18th and 19th centuries, led  to the replacement of Newton's dynamic model with Einstein's rubber space-time model in the 20th century. Gravity as a force was abandoned in favor of gravity as a warped coordinate system. But the use of the same term for both conditions caused confusion. People still talked about gravity as a force. The invention of electronic instruments and the ability to send them into space, has now brought a flood of new data that doesn't fit Einstein's space-time. But  instead of looking for clearer explanations, theoreticians are playing with dogmatic  thinking. Early in the 20th century, astronomers categorically ruled out the possibility that electricity might compete with gravity as a cosmic force. That decision became a dogma that prevented them from even looking at plasma experiments. With little knowledge of the actual behavior of plasma, they hid the new data behind ad-hoc excuses of collapsed matter, and undetectable dark matter, and unexplained dark energy. They patched Einstein's rubber idea with fantasies that were invented to make the math work and to save the theory. But  the theory is obscured by the stitches. For example, the idea of neutron stars began as a patch to conventional gravity and gas theories. Some stars appeared to be too small to contain enough conventional matter to produce their observed gravitational influence and light output. So astronomers invented an untestable form of collapsed matter. They imagined that the increasing and unresisting gravity of a shrinking star would squeeze the electrons of atoms onto their nuclei. This allowed many more atoms to be packed together, enhancing gravity and radiant output. When they found motions and energetic outbursts that exceeded the neutron star's capacities, they presumed that the now irresistible bending of gravity followed their equations of collapse to the mathematical point of zero. They didn't seem to realize that they were crossing the empirical border into metaphysical nonsense, because gravity would bend space-time  so strongly nothing - not even light - could escape the collapsed star. So it  would be unobservable. Hence this second patch was named a black hole. Only crackpots remarked that the point that exploded at the beginning of the Big Bang would have been the mother of black holes, and therefore the Big Bang couldn't have happened. But it turned out that much was escaping, if not from the black hole, at least from  nearby. The black hole was reconceived as the mathematical point, as well as the nearby phenomena. It could be observed after all. In fact, black holes often appeared not just to pull everything in, but to blow everything out. They were transformed into white holes with magical mathematics. Astronomers never considered that the nearby phenomena might be caused  by something other than a black hole. Similar difficulties of too much energy in too small a space, also turned up in observations of galactic motions. Galaxies and clusters were moving too fast for their mutual gravity to hold the cluster together. Most clusters should have dissipated long ago, and stars in the arms of spiral  galaxies should move slower, the farther they were from the center. But they appeared to be moving at about the same speed, regardless of their distance. In fact, the entire universe was more energetic than could be explained by the gravity of its calculated mass. So  dark matter and dark energy were imagined to save the theory of gravity from complete falsification. Those patches made 96 percent of the resulting universe of theory unobservable. Astronomy abandoned scientific principles and sank into dark speculations about dark phantasms. Black holes and collapsed matter are not explanations, they're excuses. They try to squeeze the abundance of energy that's observed and that's available in electrically active plasma, out of the dearth of energy that is all theories of gravity and gas can supply. Dark matter and dark energy hide a pretense of bloated gravity behind an empirically dishonest claim of invisibility and untestability. Because astronomers believed in the 19th century gravity and gas universe before plasma was discovered, they believed that electricity, in what they imagined to be empty space, was impossible. The  old theories became a belief system, a dogma that was absolutely true and  unquestionable. What else could it be, believers exclaimed, transforming the question into a foregone conclusion. Many observations confirm relativity, they declared. But confirmation only confirms what the believers already know. The new evidence and new ideas  confront them with what they don't know. Discovery lies in the dis-confirmations, the  anomalies. Discovery lies in searching for and testing alternative explanations. Even as the traditionalists retreated into dark dogma, the pioneers of radiant matter that Langmuir later renamed plasma, and Birkeland's terella, were exploring electricity in space. Striations and bubbles, plasma - not gas - bound by double layers and sorted by its various characteristics, and moving by a hand that could be much heavier than gravity. Theoreticians shunned the new experimental findings, because they couldn't be expressed in prestigious mathematical generalities, from which the real universe of observation could be  deduced. Hannes Alfven, an early plasma experimenter and one of the founders of  plasma cosmology, wrote this about the situation. ”The cosmical plasma physics of today is to some extent the playground of theoreticians who have never seen a plasma in a laboratory. Many of them still believe in formulas which we know from laboratory experiments to  be wrong. Several of the basic concepts on which theories of cosmical plasmas are founded are not applicable to the condition prevailing in the cosmos.” ”They are generally accepted by most theoreticians, they are developed with the most sophisticated mathematical methods; and it is only the plasma itself which does not  ‘understand’ how beautiful the theories are and absolutely refuses to obey them.” Hiding in conceptual darkness and playing mathematical games with imaginary objects negates the found- ational assumptions of scientific thinking. The objects of investigation must be sensible, that is able to be sensed, able to be detected. They must be amenable to experimentation. They must be explainable, not solely predictable. Theoreticians must not only follow the math, but also follow the language, theories must mean something. Scientists must search for alternative explanations and test them for coherence and correspondence with the alternative interpretations of the selected evidence . Ad-hoc patches complicate theories. The Standard Model is suffocating itself under its arbitrary patches. Plasma is detectable with many instruments. It can be generated in laboratories and its properties observed. Explanations of its behavior can be proposed and tested. Its observed properties correspond with the observed behaviors of cosmic phenomena, and provides simple and straightforward explan- ations. But its electrical properties are not allowed in the Standard Model. Mechanical inventions and the mysterious mathematics must stand in for electrical  activity. The alternative to patching is the development of new fundamentals. The  old theories and the old thinking served well to get us where we now are, but they're becoming a hindrance. They're becoming obscured by dogmatic thinking. Space age evidence is surprising and unexpected. Predictions from the old theories are not found. Contrary evidence that falsifies them is found. We should stop pretending that the old gravity- and-gas thinking is adequate for our needs. But the revolutionary effects of such  a change in thinking will not be limited to one discipline. The previous metaphysics of uniform and gradual change affected all of thinking. Now the possibilities of larger and faster changes in the natural world will revolutionize all disciplines. The  empirical world has moved into a new conceptual space. A new way of  thinking is emerging, one that rejects the worshipful belief that only gravity is of importance in cosmology. An awareness of the greater energy and power of electrical activity and plasma systems in space opens our thinking and our worldview to larger and faster working explanatory possibilities. The Electric Universe model of cosmology is one such possibility. [Music] [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info Comet science stands at a crossroads with enormous implications for the future of astronomy, institutional science as a whole, and perhaps the entire culture, in more ways than might be imagined. In our last episode, we explored recent comet discoveries that provide the final, definitive refutation of the more than a half-century old ”Dirty Snowball” comet hypothesis. Since the mid-20th century institutional science has subscribed to the belief that comets are fluffy aggregates of ice and dust that formed through condensation or accretion in the solar system's infancy, four and a half billion years ago. But for decades the chief principals of the Thunderbolts Project have proposed a radically different theory of comets. Comets are not billions of years old, nor are they snowballs of ice and dust. Rather, comets as well as asteroids and meteoroids, were excavated from planets and moons through high-energy electrical discharges or interplanetary Thunderbolts. This theory has always predicted dry and rocky comet nuclei which should be burnt black, covered with extremely fine dust and rubble, and displaying distinctly planetary features. Every space mission to date that has imaged a comet nucleus, has dramatically affirmed the Electric Comet theory. Scientists have marveled over comet nuclei that appear indistinguishable from asteroids and have, without exception, displayed a stunning lack of the abundant surface ice that Standard Theory predicted. For three years on this series, we have reported on the amazing revelations from the ESA Rosetta mission to the comet 67P. Despite insurmountable preexisting evidence to the contrary, mission scientists had expected the comet nucleus to resemble a snowball of ice and dust. As we showed in the previous episode, recently released close-up images of the nucleus could not more dramatically refute this expectation. Numerous forms of stratified rock appear stunningly obvious on the comet. Again, we compare them to planetary examples such as those on our own Earth. Of course, comet scientists never predicted the feature and how could they? Stratification is thought to result from planetary geological processes such as wind and water erosion shaping sedimentary rocks over millions of years, or volcanic magma or lava producing igneous rocks. In standard comet theory, as a comet approaches the Sun, comet activity, including the production of the familiar coma and tail, is thought to result from sublimating surface and near surface volatiles and outgassing. Sublimating snowballs do not produce features indistinguishable from the desert regions of rocky planets. As we reported many times previously on this series, other uniquely planetary features on the comet include sand dunes, wind-streaked rocks mesas. And of course we see the sharp-edged cliffs, giant boulders and endless fields of rubble that we must find if a comet was in fact torn from a planet. In the previous episode, we also reported on another devastating discovery for standard comet theory: scientists’ observation of a comet that has become active at the incredible distance of one and-a-half billion miles from the Sun, or 16 astronomical units (AU). Comet ice is not supposed to sublimate at distances beyond just 3 AU, yet in the official NASA Hubble press release we see that neither this discovery, nor the vast library of evidence, disconfirming the dirty snowball hypothesis have had any effect at all on NASA's view of comets. The press release states, "A solitary frozen traveler has been journeying for millions of years toward the heart of our planetary system. The wayward vagabond, a city-sized snowball of ice and dust called a comet, was gravitationally kicked out of the Oort cloud, it's frigid home at the outskirts of the solar system..." As we also noted previously, it's a bizarre paradox that a lead Rosetta scientist, Dr. Nicolas Thomas said in 2015, "Rosetta has blown the dirty snowball idea out of the water." And yet the Rosetta team has collectively held steadfastly to the standard fiction of icy comets that formed four and a half billion years ago. Of course, the required surface ice was never observed on the comet. In January of 2016 the team summarized their findings as follows, "...the great majority of ice is believed to come from under the comet's crust, and very few examples of exposed water ice have been found on the surface." Here, as in the aforementioned Hubble report, we see an inexplicable devotion to falsified theory. It seems fitting that the language in an official scientific report includes the word  “believed “. To describe the small patches of water ice on the comet as "exposed", implies a faith that an invisible reservoir of ice exists underneath the comet’s desiccated rocky exterior. This was the logic that scientists employed, who have taken to referring to comets as "deep-fried ice cream". Yet, how one gets stratified rock in ice cream be it deep-fried or not, remains mysterious and here we see again a disturbing disconnect between science theory and science discovery. Recent discoveries in planetary science affirm the continued conjectures about subsurface comet ice are not necessary. Scientists today are attempting to explain why the planet Mercury has a surprising abundance of ice in craters at its North Pole. One theory that scientists are proposing was summarized in the September 19th, 2017 blog of the American Geophysical Union. It states, "...Mercury's exposure to solar winds containing protons, could have combined with oxygen and hydrogen on the planet to form water." For several years, scientists have employed the same reasoning to explain the discovery of water on our own moon. We suggest that a similar process may be responsible for the scant ice seen on desiccated rocky comet nuclei, yet another reason to end speculation about invisible subsurface ice. Other obstacles remain before institutional science will likely entertain any real alternative theories of comets and comet origins. One is the detection of the signature of water molecules in cometary coma, which comet scientists have always interpreted as proof of sublimating ices. But long before the discovery of an active comet at a billion and a half miles from the Sun, ample reason existed for scientists to question such an interpretation. Comet 67P was not the first comet to puzzle scientists with its ironically overactive "water output", In June of 2014, the ESA reported the surprisingly early detection of water "sweating" off of the dry rocky comet. They wrote, "ESA's Rosetta spacecraft has found that comet 67P is releasing the equivalent of two small glasses of water into space every second, even at a cold 583 million kilometers from the Sun." the principal investigator of Rosetta's microwave instruments stated "We always knew we would see water vapor outgassing from the comet, but we were surprised at how early we detected it." But on a body that is covered with stratified rock, where is the water coming from? A theoretical path that comet scientists have yet to explore is complex cometary electrochemistry. In recent years, Thunderbolts colleague Dr. Franklin Anariba, a specialist in electrochemistry, has been presenting his thesis on comet water production by electrochemical means. In a five-part Space News presentation in 2015, Dr. Anariba proposed that a process of electrons stripping releases O₂, OH, and other chemical species into the cometary coma. The discovery of an electron density in the vicinity of the 67P nucleus is therefore important. It could mean that the chemical O₂ can absorb a negative charge through charge exchange, which is then followed by a process called protonation via solar wind at the comet. Water formation can then be explained via a series of pathways, as Dr. Anariba has outlined. Electrochemistry may also be the cause of the production of rich gases that comets have produced at a great variety of distances from the Sun, as Dr. Anariba has also discussed. And it can account for the completely unexpected detection of molecular oxygen at comet 67P, yet another reason why no basis remains to suggest that comets are four and a half billion years old. As reported in India's national magazine Frontline, "The detection of O2 was unexpected... all the primordial oxygen molecules, which would have been there in a comet's evolution around 4.6 billion years ago, should have disappeared by now... the Rosetta discovery of O₂ in 67P is an astrophysical enigma." In fact, in March of this year, in a scientific paper published in the journal Nature Communications, the authors essentially proposed that water molecules, coming off a comet, become electrically charged. Then the solar wind accelerates the charged molecules back to the comet’s surface. There they pick up an oxygen atom from the surface from materials such as sand, forming the detected O₂. The electrical theory of comets is based on sound scientific foundations and nothing in the theory is at odds with discovery. In the Electric Universe, most comet activity results from comets moving through regions of changing electrical potential. Comets that spend most of their time in the outer reaches of the solar system develop a "negative charge" with respect to their environment. As they move toward the Sun's more positively charged domain, they can experience voltage spikes in their dynamic plasma environment and begin to discharge electrically. The Sun's electromagnetic influence is now being shown, through science discovery, to be far more vast throughout the solar system than Standard Theory has ever imagined. In 2016, the Cassini spacecraft made the surprising discovery of so-called magnetic ropes that stretch nearly 900 million miles from the Sun to the gas giant Saturn and interact with the planet in a manner similar to the Birkeland currents that are now known to produce Earth's auroras. Comets can also become active when passing through any more positively charged region of space, including when encountering the vast magnetotail of a planet. This theory can explain much comet activity which has only proved baffling to mainstream theorists, including comets that have disintegrated or exploded at impossibly vast distances from the Sun and the astonishing electrical energies measured when comets have closely approached planets, including Shoemaker-Levy 9 at Jupiter and comet Siding Spring at Mars. This, of course, explains why comet activity can occur at distances from the Sun where invisible hypothetical ices cannot sublimate. Another obstacle for comet scientists is a faith in their measurements of a comet's density. After all, said measurements in 67P would suggest that the images do in fact lie and underneath the obviously rocky surface is a more fluffy, icy interior. However, investigators might have been given pause shortly after the landing of the Philae probe on the comet nucleus. After the lander bounced and rolled into the shade of a towering rocky cliff, the team attempted to hammer the probe into the comet’s soil but the hammer was bested by the comet’s obviously rocky composition. The ESA describes the event as follows, "The probe then started to hammer itself into the subsurface, but was unable to make more than a few millimeters of progress, even at the highest power level of the motor." Similar surprises awaited NASA's Stardust-Next team when they reimaged the surface of comet Tempel 1 after the Deep Impact mission fired a copper projectile into the comet nucleus. The team found that the projectile’s impact crater was nowhere near as dramatic as expected, indicating a much tougher surface than the comet’s density measurements would seem to indicate. But incredibly, the team proposed the projectile did in fact leave a dramatic crater which somehow achieved a miraculous self-healing. They hypothesized that material exploded off of the comet at tremendous velocities and then somehow fell back down in the comet’s near-zero gravity to refill the crater. As Space.com reported in 2011, "Temple 1’s man-made crater partially healed itself as the ejecta settled and refilled part of the depression." The ramifications of this problem reach far beyond comet science and affect all of cosmology. For decades, the chief science advisor to The Thunderbolts Project Wal Thornhill, has argued that measurements of an object's density cannot be accurate if one fails to account for the electromagnetic stresses on the body. In 2004, when NASA's Stardust mission imaged another comet Wild 2, which also appears indistinguishable from an asteroid, Thornhill wrote "Density calculations based on gravitational perturbation theory are worthless. Gravity is a weak dipole electric force between subatomic particles. So, the charge distribution in a body affects gravity strongly. Comets are highly charged bodies and will exhibit anomalous gravity. Newton's gravitational ‘constant’, G, is a dependent variable. It is dependent on the electrical state of a body.” Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson is famously quoted as saying, "The good thing about science is that it's true, whether or not you believe in it." Those who have followed this series will surely recognize the amazing irony of deGrasse Tyson's statement. In our previous episode we concluded with the question, ”Is science self-corrective?” Apply the question to comet science today and the answer is self-evident. Yet deGrasse Tyson is correct. A thing is either true or not and Nature has no regard for human beliefs. The repetition of the conjecture of our solar system’s four and a half billion year history does not make it true. The repetition of the conjecture of comets as dirty snowballs does not make it true. The consensus nature of any belief does not make it true. What is the truth about comets? As Galileo Galilei stated, "All truths are easy to understand once they are discovered; the point is to discover them." We again implore viewers to simply look at the pictures. An easy path of discovery awaits, leading one further into our electric universe. For continuous updates on Space News from the Electric Universe, stay tuned to Thunderbolts.info 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project at Thunderbolts.info. A new discovery is again challenging planetary scientists' ideas about impacts from space and the rate at which they are thought to strike the Earth. For decades, many scientists have believed that asteroid bombardments, such as that which is thought to have killed the dinosaurs, occur on our planet at regular intervals of about every 26 million years. A popular theory was that a dim companion star called Nemesis would approach our Sun at 26 million year intervals, inevitably causing mass extinctions on Earth. However, the companion star has never been found and the problems for the hypothesis have continued to grow. Recently, a team of scientists performed analysis of 22 craters on Earth, which are thought to have formed from impacts within the last five hundred million years. A phys.org report on the study describes the research as follows, "The timeline of events was represented in a circle with a particular range - in this case, 26 million years. If events repeated themselves regularly within this time- span, the points would have arranged themselves in a particular area of the circle. The researchers showed that there was no such accumulation." The greatest problem that the study revealed is that some massive so-called impact craters appeared to be almost precisely the same age, even though they appear on different continents. The co-author of the study states, "Some of these craters could have been formed by the collision of an asteroid accompanied by a moon. But in other cases, the impact sites are too far away from each other for this to be the explanation." When asked to explain the appearance of Chicxulub crater in Mexico and the Boltysh crater in the Ukraine, which are thought to have each formed from impacts around the same time about 66 million years ago; the author states, "We have no definitive explanation for that." But one of the greatest mistakes in modern geology is the assumption that the only processes responsible for craters are either impacts or volcanism. On this series, we have repeatedly reported on the experimental research which has proven that electrical discharges produced almost every known type of crater, including many heretofore anomalous crater types; from crater chains to hexagonal craters, smaller craters appearing preferentially on the rims of larger craters and the improbably high rate of highly circular craters. In fact airless worlds, such as Mercury, the dwarf planet Ceres and our own Moon, reveal bodies that bear startling resemblances to the cratered surfaces in an industrial process called electrical discharge machining. In the Electric Universe theory, Earth also features dramatic craters which formed not from impacts but from high-energy electrical discharges. Let us look closely at one of the most dramatic and widely studied alleged impact craters on Earth. The electrical interpretation changes everything institutional science tells us about so-called extinction-level events due to giant impacts from space. The aforementioned Chicxulub crater is widely accepted to be the impact site of the asteroid that killed off the dinosaurs. In 2006, The Thunderbolts Project published The Picture Of The Day article that analyzes in depth the evidence that, scientists believe, supports the giant impact theory of the crater's formation. We summarize the analysis here. The crater is a circular structure up to 300 kilometers across, which mostly lies under the water off the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula in the Gulf of Mexico. The crater's multiple concentric rings are thought to have resulted from the shock of the impact which would have blasted debris high into the atmosphere and around the world. A layer of iridium-enriched sediment has been found worldwide, supposedly the result of the debris cloud from the theoretical impact event. Other evidence is thought to exist in the form of melted spherules and shocked quartz crystals, found in formations around the Gulf, which are believed to be debris left by the impact induced tsunami. Above the bed of spherules is a thick layer of jumbled rocks, including large boulders and cobbles. The distribution of the iridium layer is contrary to the expected drift of a debris cloud. Impacts from various angles have been proposed to try to explain both the crater asymmetry and distribution of ejecta. Cores inside the crater reveal Upper Cretaceous fossils in undisturbed layers -- fossils of the creatures that the impact was supposed to have wiped out. Clearly, these layers were laid down after the events. Additionally, the alleged tsunami deposits in Mexico, Guatemala and Belize, show layering that suggested some were laid down over a long time. These include separate layers with embedded spherules that had been claimed to be direct ejecta fallout from the Chicxulub impact. Recent investigation linked two such layers to "two events separated by thousands of years during which limestones accumulated and invertebrates burrowed down on the ocean floor." Extinctions always seem to coincide with both continental flood basalts and imagined meteorite impacts but under the prevailing interpretation the odds of this happening simultaneously are vanishingly small. The electrical origin of the Chicxulub crater and surrounding geology resolves all of the contradictions of the evidence. The electrical current of the cosmic thunderbolt, lasting longer than the forces of an impact, would have melted large amounts of material and formed vast clouds of spherules, a key signature of electrical discharge. Indeed, more than 99 percent of the global iridium layer is made of the spherules-- droplets that condensed from vaporized rock. Only the remaining 1% of the debris consisted of rock pulverized directly into dust. The spherule-producing ability of discharges has been demonstrated in laboratory experiments. Also, the electromagnetic pinch effect in a discharge channel can generate extremely large pressures sufficient to shock quartz crystals. When it comes to the question of mass extinctions, it is not clear that an impact like the one claimed to have created the Chicxulub crater is sufficient to cause such a thing. The complexities of the evidence for extinctions do not find simple explanations in either impact or volcanic models. But the one obvious factor that is never mentioned is that the dinosaur megafauna cannot survive on the present Earth because they are too heavy to live. It seems to be forgotten that the early dinosaur discoveries forced scientists to conclude that they must have been waders to offset their great weight. Whatever happened to the dinosaurs was far more than a puny asteroid impact could inflict. Nothing was the same on Earth after a global alteration of Earth's gravity. The triumph of the impact model was not so much because of its adequacy in explaining the evidence as it was a default result. Only impact and volcanic explanations were considered. And the spherules and shocked quartz clearly ruled out vulcanism. As theoretical geophysicist Jay Melosh says, "We know so little about impacts." But an electrical mechanism was never considered because astronomers assure geologists that the planets have always been under present orbits and electrical events in space never happen.

Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info The following presentation is an adaptation of the Mel Acheson Thunderbolts Picture Of the Day article 'Plasma versus Gravity'. The link to the article may be found in the description box of this video. Kuhn’s 1962 essay (The Structure of Scientific Revolutions) exploring the nature of changes in scientific theories, and a plethora of commentaries since, have made it out to be a Big Deal and to be also somewhat mysterious: “revolution”, “incommensurability of paradigms”, “new world”, etc. It seems to me the essence of it is simply different viewpoints. Just as the landscape looks different when viewed from different locations, the facts and theories of the sciences appear different when understood from different conceptual locations in the intellectual landscape. Ptolemy drew a picture of what the universe looked like from the Earth. Copernicus described how it looked from the Sun. Newton depicted the view from gravity. Notice that the terms “Earth”, “Sun”, and “gravity” are not “something out there” but are concepts that make sense of or create meaning from a selection of observations. Gravity, for example, made sense of falling apples and revolving planets. The other viewpoints “saw” no connection between apples and planets. Definitions changed: The observations once considered important in the term “planet” were replaced with other observations. New mathematical techniques were developed which would have seemed nonsensical to people occupying the old viewpoints. The resulting view of the “gravity universe” was that of isolated “billiard balls” occasionally perturbing each other. This replaced the old views of a system of nested spheres or an assembly of epicycles. Now the “Electric Universe” is a different viewpoint. Notice, for example, that its definition of “plasma” is not the conventional one of “ionized gas”. That latter definition jumps to the conclusion that you can understand something about plasma by falling back on what you know about ideal gasses and thermal ionization. The ideal gas law is an important insight in the conventional view, but it becomes a blindfold in the electric view, preventing you from seeing what’s before your eyes. Rather, “plasma” is an emergent (i.e., higher-level or statistical-level) orderliness of complex electrical forces: such properties as filamentation, long-range attraction and short-range repulsion, braiding, characteristic velocities, formation and decay of plasmoids, and identity of properties at different scales. The mathematical shorthand that was developed for articulating the gravity view and for using the technologies based on it doesn’t work for the plasma view. A new mathematics - and new technologies - will need to be invented. The view of the universe from a plasma vantage point is one of persistently interacting aggregates with wide-spread resonance effects: a “driven” universe rather than one rolling to a stop. So the definitions are different, the facts are different, the math is different, the theories are different: The universe looks different because the plasma physicist is standing in a different conceptual location from the gravity physicist. And although the content of each paradigm can’t be compared with the other, the respective viewpoints can be compared. B. J. F. Lonergan’s 1957 work (Insight) on the nature of understanding provides one ground upon which different viewpoints can be compared. Theories come and go, but the underlying function, purpose, and construction of theories arise from the nature of cognition. As one of the ways in which people relate to the universe, cognition fashions intellectual tools-theories-to accomplish particular goals. Hence, from a selection of theories, one can be preferred on the basis of its utility value - the one which seems most likely to achieve the goal with the greatest efficiency and least effort. One criterion for the efficient achievement of the goal of understanding the universe is comprehensiveness. Again comparing the intellectual landscape with the physical, the higher the viewpoint the greater the purview. In this sense, Kuhn’s process of periods of cumulation of knowledge within a paradigm separated by episodes of paradigm shifts can be understood as the progressive achievement of higher viewpoints affording greater purviews. Notice that from this understanding the often-used (and abused when applied outside a paradigm) judgements of “right/wrong”, “correct/incorrect”, even “true/false”, are meaningless. Upon this ground for comparing viewpoints, the case can be made that the plasma paradigm is “higher” than the gravity one in that it encompasses a larger domain of evidence. Not only does it explain more phenomena, it explains those phenomena with a comprehensive and unitary theory. It “sees” more landscape, more features of that landscape, and more relationships among those features. Gravity, in contrast, “sees” fewer features and “sees” them as disparate events, each requiring a separate ad hoc explanation. For example, every feature on every planet has its own theory: impact craters, volcanoes, tidal cracks, floods of disappearing water, lava that runs uphill, runaway greenhouses, etc. The generality of gravity is obscured with ad hoc inventions, and those inventions fail to account for details intrinsic in the plasma view. Gravity fails to account for entire new observations, extrapolating itself beyond reality and into denial: Super-massive stars spinning super-fast, exploding stars whose shock-waves create intricate structures, cannibalistic galaxies, dark matter that overwhelms observed matter, photos cropped between galaxies and connected quasars, silence in the face of the quantization of redshifts, etc. More and more evidence is being ignored. Newton was unaware of plasma. Today his disciples spend years in training learning when and how to shut their eyes to it. It’s not just the Big Bang, General Relativity, and Quantum Mechanics that are in trouble but the foundation of them all: Gravity is an exhausted and bankrupt concept. A higher, more comprehensive foundation is needed. The technologies of gravity have lifted us to a viewpoint that’s bigger than gravity, and we need new ideas and new tools to make sense of the new vistas. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info In the first three parts of this presentation, Thunderbolts contributor Andrew Hall has explored the electrical nature of wind and powerful storms on planets throughout the solar system including Earth. Of course, mainstream geology tells us that wind plays a significant role in shaping the landscape of our planet, supposedly incrementally over countless eons of time. But, as Andrew has proposed in numerous past videos, the Earth's wind sheared landscape reveals unique patterns which may have been produced by ionized shock waves in primordial electric storms. In part four of this 10-part series, Andrew argues for a new perspective on wind in Earth geology, not as a slow erosional force but a short-lived and violent one. If you study Earth's surface and look at details in its form, there are obvious patterns: arcing patterns of mountain ranges and island chains, strange swirls and looping cracks on the ocean floor, and on close inspection there's harmony in the shape of mountains and other terrain. Sometimes it's geometric with triangles, arcs, and star patterns. But usually it's more fluid, like a crazy paisley. Consensus thought is, this is a result of a series of unrelated events that occurred over billions of years, driven by the slow churn of Earth's crust subducting the continental plates and the constant wear of erosion. EU thinks it didn't happen that way. We think it was caused by electricity and the patterns we see make more sense if viewed in the context of our theory. The face of the Earth was shaped by three primary means: volcanic eruption, lightning, and wind. It occurred in primordial storms which ionized the atmosphere, charged the ground like a battery, and discharged energy the same way we see today: earthquakes, volcanoes and storms. Only these storms were beyond biblical. They occurred before man arrived. What we are talking about today are the storms of creation, which shaped the face of the planet. Because wind played the biggest role in laying and piling the sediments we live on, its effects are most visible. The evidence is in supersonic shockwaves imprinted on the land. Once you start recognizing the characteristics of wind-formed topography, it becomes almost impossible to ignore. To identify wind direction, look at mountains. Mountains, not volcanoes, are all essentially wind blown dunes. With exceptions for shifting wind conditions, a mountain's shape will show a windward and leeward side like a dune. The leeward side is generally steep and slab-sided and the windward side dips at a shallower slope. The windward side actually portrays the shape of the wind itself, as pressure waves undulate across moveable sands and mold them. If the wind reaches Mach speeds, standing shock waves reflect from any protrusion in the wind's path causing a sharp change in wind direction. Distinct patterns form at this crease called shock diamonds, where the wind direction changes abruptly. The reflected standing shock wave forms a fan-shaped interference pattern of compression and rarefaction. This pattern can be found on most mountain forms, including Cordillera mountain arcs, continental divides, lone  inselbergs, and basin and range. Dust-laden supersonic winds deposit their heavy cargo where the crease in the wind forms. A tetrahedron-shaped zone of rarefaction, or low pressure, develops at the root of the standing wave, it's called a "separation bubble." Wind-born dust collects in this bubble as the wind deflects upward with a shock wave. As material deposits in the separation bubble, it forms a new barrier to deflect the wind, which moves the standing shock reflection backwards into the wind. The separation bubble migrates into the wind with the shock wave, causing new dust to overlay the old in layers that stack into the direction of the wind. The shock wave is a discontinuity in density, temperature, and ionization. Remember, we're talking about a primordial storm where much of the atmosphere ionized. So, standing shock waves reflected from the ground back into the clouds providing a path for discharge. The separation bubble is not only a pressure sink, which collects heavy matter, it is also a current sink, being the lowest potential region connected to the high potential current in the reflected shock wave. It, therefore, draws current to bake, compress, and fuse the deposited dust. It creates a distinct pattern on the windward side. Dragon's teeth -- triangular buttresses, or sometimes called flat-irons, formed by the sonic, ionized shockwaves of supersonic winds. They rise and fall in amplitude and wavelength, and display harmonic frequency shifts, as well as many, many other features which can only be produced by the sonic effects of supersonic winds -- please see the "Arc Blast" and "Monocline" articles previously published, for more details. Understanding how winds form these shock patterns and examining the result on the landscape reveals a wealth of information. Let's consider this very simple dune, called El Guaje, in the Sierra Oriental mountains of central Mexico. The shock patterns of triangles is very apparent on its windward side. This next image is annotated to show El Guaje highlighting the four consecutively formed pressure ridges that are visible. The first is highlighted in green and it's almost buried by later deposition, so only the tops of its buttresses are exposed. The second is marked in yellow and is another small ridge caused by a period of weaker winds. It's also partially buried by the third, and the largest ridge which obviously deposited much more material. Large triangular buttresses at one end of the large ridge shrink in amplitude with geometric progression until they almost vanish. This indicates the jet- stream velocity transitioned from supersonic to near subsonic velocity along the wind-front of this dune. The faster jet-stream region advanced the growth of the dune, depositing material faster and pushing the shock-wave into the wind. It advanced the ridge line at the top of the page into the wind, shown by the violet arc, and built this portion of the mountain thicker, taller, and with larger amplitude reflected shocks forming bigger triangular buttresses. Each layer of the buttresses is formed by a new shock front from winds impinging on the last layer. New shock fronts formed as the wind gusted, piling new layers on the old. A final diminishing wind created a final fourth shock front which deposited a small pressure ridge, shown in purple, on the foot of the mountain. The highlights obscure natural features so please contrast the annotated image with the first, naked image, to see the buttresses better. The winds that created these ridges were like any storm, just quite a bit more violent. They stiffened as the storm grew, reached a crescendo with electrically charged, gusting blasts at Mach speeds, and then ebbed away. Their formation precludes any notion that the winds that created them were caused by a meteor or comet. A large impact might produce supersonic, dust-laden winds, but they would crest with the first shock wave and then dissipate, not slowly build to a crescendo as these mountain ridges do. Take a look at the surroundings of El Guaje ridge, and it becomes even more apparent how it was made. It's part of a larger structure -- an oblong crater, it's 200 feet deeper in the center than outside the rim. The pressure ridges, including El Guaje, form the rim of the crater. It wasn't made by an oblong meteor. This is the result of a down-burst wind. The pressure ridges are the rims of the crater, with triangular buttresses showing the wind direction as it blasted the Earth like a blowtorch, and blew out radially, depositing dust along the standing shock waves it created. The outward blast is interfered at the top end by two, round mountains formed by lightning discharge which altered the wind flow around them and disrupted the symmetry of the crater. Taking another step back in altitude reveals this entire mountain region in Mexico is shaped by a turbulent shear zone in the wind. These mountains were formed by uni-polar electric winds screaming from the south, and mixing into plasma storms along the shear zone with an opposite polarity wind screaming from the other direction. It's eerily similar to the turbulent shear zones adjacent to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter, creating kinked circulations that have a crab-claw shape. I call this mountain formation in Mexico -- the Mexican Kink. Turbulent winds fold back and forth to make these kinks, but they also fold up and down and twist into tornadoes, blowing and sucking at the land. In turbulent zones, the downdrafts form cyclones that are often stretched out-of-round into oval, polygonal, and U-shaped structures. The winds are electric currents, so these turbulent kinks are semi-steady-state keep their form for a long time, molding the land. Downdraft turbulence also means there is updraft turbulence. So next to downdraft craters in Mexico are mountains formed by updrafts. An updraft wind will create a dome or ridge of layered deposit with a rim around it also, but the inflow to the updraft leaves the triangular buttresses from shockwaves on the outside of the mountain, pointing inward. The updrafts deposit linear and lobe shaped mountains around and between the downdraft craters. The turbulence is in a shear zone, so deposits occur in narrow lanes between conflicting winds. Updraft deposits are composed of more material than craters and have the triangular patterns of shock wave reflections on the flanks. As it relates to clouds on Jupiter, a long, rising column, like the one highlighted here, would create such linear mountains. One can see the dark depths of the hole in the clouds from which the updraft column rises. The winds roll upward from the ground and curl over, leaving a broom-swept linear ridge on the land below. The turbulent kinks are fractal forms, so taking another step back in altitude reveals the fractal clab-claw shape emerging at a larger scale. The smaller feature with the crater shown above is nested within this larger repetition of the wind pattern shown next, aligned along the same axis. Nested fractals are very evident in Jupiter's clouds as well. The similarity between Mexico's mountains and Jupiter's clouds is due to capacitance in the planetary circuits. The strongest winds are vertical winds driven by the electric field. Following is a sample of images taken from the southern leg of storm centers that molded South America, Australia, Africa, and Eurasia. The winds pushed and pulled on the land with electric force, literally molding it from wind action above and volcanic action below. The fluid shapes are a dead giveaway for magneto-hydro-dynamic forces. But deeper levels of evidence are there, in Mach speed sonic shock effects, arcing effects, and sputtering effects that provide a holistic electric picture of everything that was happening. Look close at the following images and note patterns of stratification and liquid deformation evident from waves of heat and pressure. Turbulent winds lifting off the land, arcing across the sky, and returning in downdrafts were filaments of plasma that varied in charge density in cross-section too. Take note how a tornado is a coaxial circuit with the outer wall of the tube being the fastest, most dusty region, and the inner core often a clear draft. The plasma filaments of primordial storms varied in dust content, charge density, and velocity in cross-section as well. The result is stratification of mineral deposits vertically, where the rock morphology and mineral composition discretely change from the core of the feature, to the walls of the feature and then to the outer surroundings. It's a coaxial arrangement. The following images show where the storm pulsed and ebbed with current, stratifying these layers of dust with different composition from the inside-out, where the coaxial up-and-down draft winds created domes and craters. Layerings of varying mineral composition are particularly evident where winds abruptly changed direction, from horizontal to vertical at the rim of craters and the buttress flanks of mountains. There, charge densities in the shockwaves and the effects of magnetic pinch were the greatest. The stratification of species within the electric winds of Jupiter matches the pattern of stratification in landforms here on earth. They are coherently layered from the inside-out of each turbulent kink, or vortex, unmixed by the turbulence, in accordance with charge densities in currents that are primarily moving up and down. That electromagnetic fields sort species and recombine them is predicted behavior in plasma. We use a multitude of techniques in manufacturing based on this fact. Different materials respond to magnetic fields differently. The electric field responds to charge density so shapes itself around conductive flows of material and vice-versa. The result is stratification, and it's apparent the stratification in Earth's landscapes matches the stratification in Jupiter's winds. Some mountains do not conform to the wind-blown dune shape, exhibiting triangular buttresses on both flanks of the mountain, or not conforming to the windward/leeward angle of slope. This doesn't mean they're not dunes, but indicates they were formed subject to shifting, or competing winds. In some cases, mountains formed as sastrugi, or linear deposits parallel to the wind in the shear zone between channels of wind of different velocity. So, it's possible by looking at the land to deduce wind patterns. Following this method of identifying wind direction from triangular buttresses in the mountain ranges and craters that are formed, the next image shows the Colorado Plateau with wind formed pressure ridges annotated by blue lines. These are pressure ridges formed perpendicular to the wind. Each line is drawn parallel to a pressure ridge, and perpendicular hash marks indicate the wind direction. The red lines on the map indicate pressure ridges formed parallel to the wind, at shear zones between the conflicting winds. This map provides one layer of dimension to the storm, the dimension of ground level winds. But to add another layer, we can look at the domes and craters that formed by updraft and downdraft winds. The red areas on this map are updrafts, the yellow are downdrafts, and blue are precipitation footprints. Adding this layer of information to the map of pressure ridges produces a wind map of the Colorado Plateau and the Rocky Mountains that looks like this. Now to describe this storm. There are two jet streams coming to the Colorado Plateau from the north. One poured through the Snake River Valley, arcing east towards Yellowstone. The other jet stream swept into the Great Basin rippling Nevada with rows of windblown mountains. There's an S-shaped range in central Nevada that defines a center of rotation, as this mesocyclone scraped the ground like one incredible tornado. It down-drafted into two streams. One pressing down on the Unita Valley in Utah, and the other sweeping northern Arizona forming much of the Mogollon Rim. The Great Basin storm also spun air south, bypassing the rotation to help define the Sierra Mountain arc, and scoured the Owens, Amorgosa, and Death Valley. The Sierras were formed by winds from the west (not shown here on the map) which pressed against the Great Basin rotation as the winds bypass south. From the south, winds collected and then split, forming the Mexican Kink and the El Guaje mountain. They reformed in a ground-hugging laminar flow near Four Corners, sweeping across Colorado, Utah, and northern Arizona, laying the foundations of the Colorado Plateau. The southern wind fed a multi- vortex cyclone over the plateau, where it divided its path to feed thunderstorm updrafts. These winds threaded up and back down through mesocyclone-cyclone pairs in looping currents like lacing a shoe. The updrafts are defined by San Rafael Swell in Utah and Monument Valley and Black Mesa in Arizona. Winds from the south also circulated to the east over the Great Plains to be sucked into the cyclone through thunderstorms that built the eastern face of the Rockies. These down-drafted, forming huge craters in the mountains, like San Luis Valley in Colorado. Each of these features -- the Great Basin mesocyclone, the multi-vortex cyclone over the Colorado Plateau with arching colonnades of mesocyclone-cyclone pairs can be identified in the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. It's because the shapes and actions of the wind are driven by the fractal process of charge diffusion in the planetary circuit. The difference in chemistry and thermodynamics of Jupiter's atmosphere compared to Earth's doesn't make much difference, because circuits are the forcing mechanism of nature. So this completes the view of winds at the very eye of the storm. The Colorado Plateau received the hottest plasma torching in North America. Surrounding areas were also ravaged by storm but none so severely. In fact, the whole Earth was wrapped in storms. So, we'll look closer at some of those regions, as well as more details on North America in the next installment. Thank you! Stay tuned for part 5 
Welcome to Space News  from the Electric Universe, brought to you by the Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts. info. Since the dawn of the space age, perhaps no celestial body in the solar system has proved more surprising to astronomers than the planet Venus. Before the arrival of the earliest space probes, some noted scientists believe that Venus would be Earth-like, with water clouds,  oceans and abundant vegetation. However, well known to those who have followed this series, it was Dr. Immanuel Velikovsky who  made the outrageous prediction that Venus would be superhot, based  on his hypothesis of the planet's recent cometary origins. Today, countless Venusian phenomena continue to puzzle planetary scientists, including  the planet's super-fast winds; its odd, slow backward spin; its  vast magneto tail; and even the recent discover by the ESA's Venus Express spacecraft of a surprisingly powerful electric field. In recent decades, Wal  Thornhill, the Chief Science Advisor to the Thunderbolts Project, has outlined his own reconstruction of Venus' role in the recent, extraordinary  history of the solar system. In Part One of this two-part presentation, Thornhill begins by recounting this history, which he offered in his  2004 article, Cassini's Homecoming, which he wrote prior to the arrival of the  Cassini-Huygens spacecraft at Saturn. As Thornhill explains, while astronomers to this day refer to Venus as Earth's twin, the most likely Venusian sibling may be found  in the Saturnian system - that is, the moon Titan. I must explain that Cassini's Homecoming was published just before the arrival of the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft at Saturn. It's perhaps one of my most important  articles. My analysis and predictions were the result of applying Electric Universe principles to the remarkable forensic research of David Talbot and Dwardu Cardona  into the global mythic history of the solar system. Naturally we like to believe the  solar system is boringly predictable, with no recent catastrophes. We ignore the fact that prehistoric astronomers obsessively recorded the motion of the stars and planets. Yet those forgotten people built monumental pyramids and monolithic stone observatories, carefully aligned to the heavens which we couldn't reproduce today with modern technology. So the question is,  what motivated them to such monumental efforts? Why were the tiny specks of light, the planets  worshipped as apocalyptic thunderbolt- wielding gods? hy was the planet Venus globally described as female with long flowing hair? Why was the planet Mars globally described as the sword-wielding red god of war? Why was the ringed planet Saturn globally remembered as our first Sun, our best Sun? This makes no sense according to our modern myth of a mostly safe, eon's-old, clockwork solar  system. In Cassini's Homecoming, I wrote “Until recently Saturn was an independent  brown dwarf star with its own entourage of close-orbiting small planets. As a  small star approaching the Sun, Saturn flickered like a faulty electric light when the two stellar magnetospheres or, that is plasma sheaths, touched together.” Saturn's electrical power was then usurped by the Sun, and its  appearance changed dramatically. Such rapid variability in the appearance of stars is well documented. ”Before dimming forever, Saturn would have flared up to relieve the stresses caused by the sudden change in its electrical  environment. Saturn still radiates more than twice the heat it receives from the Sun. We also have a simple explanation for the origin of Saturn's mysterious short-lived rings.” Chet Raymo, the physicist, noted writer, educator and naturalist, once wrote, as if responding to that deep primeval memory,  ”Nothing so evokes gasps of delight of Saturn's ring. The reason I think, is a  collision of the expected and the improbable. A ringed sphere is the  archetypal planet of our childhood, familiar from a thousand  comic strips, coloring books, classroom poster boards, stickers, rubber  stamps, birthday cards - you name it. So, when we see Saturn, there  is a kind of instant recognition, like meeting a relative one knows only from the family photo album. But there is also the shock of reality, a  sense of ’Oh my God, it actually exists!” In the year 2000 a pivotal meeting was held in Portland, Oregon of key figures in the Electric Universe, including  Anthony Peratt, where it became clear that petroglyphs are an enduring record of the frightening collapse of a former cosmos. Where are Saturn's children now? As I explain in some detail in my April 2006 report, ”Venus  isn't our twin! The only common features are their size and relative closeness in the inner solar system. In every other way they could not be more different.” Thornhill's writings on Venus have included an expansive picture of the solar system's recent history. In this  picture, Venus was born recently by its parent proto-Saturn, and  the Saturnian moon Titan was a member of the same family. Based on this radical hypothesis, Thornhill has made remarkably accurate predictions about Titan, including its surface features and atmosphere. You just summarized the conclusions of many lifetimes of work, principally  by Talbot and Cardona into the detailed sequence of events surrounding the entry into the solar system by the body we now call Saturn. But  the inspiration for all of us came initially from the scholar Immanuel Velikovsky. In 1950, years before the space age, he concluded from his extensive interdisciplinary research that the planet Venus was remembered from the time of the dawn of the modern era as a brilliant newborn cometary body. He concluded in his best-selling book, ”Worlds in Collision”, that the night-side of Venus radiates heat because Venus is hot. Here we have two theorist’s beliefs being demolished at once; that something the size of a planet  could be a comet, and that Venus recently had a different orbit. Typically,  later findings from space probes supported his conclusion, but  made no difference to consensus opinion. Astronomers minimized the importance of Velikovsky's remarkable claim, or simply dismissed it as a lucky guess. Although one noted scholar acknowledged at the time that Velikovsky had a remarkable record of successful predictions and no failures. The discovery that Venus was almost red-hot made it imperative for scientists to invent an explanation. The result was the fictitious enhanced or runaway greenhouse effect. All  the space-age data shows Venus is not a twin of the earth at all. Its magnetospheric tail has been described as cometary; the entire planet is said to have been resurfaced. Of course, the idea that Venus  is an infant simply doesn't occur. If the view about twinship is mistaken, then the belief in a common origin is without foundation. What's more, climate scientists have allowed themselves to be misled into thinking that the hellish conditions on Venus awaits us due to a runaway greenhouse effect, if we don't mend our ways. Ignorance is infectious. So much for twins. Now for Venus' sibling, Saturn's moon Titan. I wrote “What can we expect Cassini to find, based on this dramatic recent history of Saturn? We should expect to see family traits amongst the members of the Saturnian family- including the departed Earth, Mars and Venus. For example, the moon Titan, which  is larger than the planet Mercury, seems to be a close sibling of Venus...” ”So we should be alert to similarities between Titan and Venus. It is  already known that Titan has the densest atmosphere of any terrestrial planet, after Venus. That is a huge puzzle for scientists.” The New Scientist of November 6, 2004: ”Titan images add to the moon's mystery.” Stephen Battersby reported, “The  world got its first peak at the surface of Saturn's moon Titan last week. The  images were taken as Nasa's Cassini- Huygens spacecraft swept past the moon. The images show a landscape that is clearly still being shaped. Although Titan must have suffered numerous meteor impacts in the past, its surface today is largely crater-free. Somehow these scars must have been eroded or filled in.” But that's precisely what we said about Venus when the Magellan orbiter revealed that planet's surface. I also wrote, “Titan has a global layered haze like Venus... We may expect to find that Titan's atmosphere has some of the smell of Venus about it. Both Venus and  Titan's atmospheres, being very young, will not yet be in equilibrium. So calculations  about atmospheric constituents that assume equilibrium as a starting point will be wrong.” ”The methane found in Titan's atmosphere is quickly destroyed by sunlight so it  has to be replenished. That has led to the suggestion that Titan must  have a hydrocarbon ocean for the methane to have lasted for the conventional age of the solar system. However, radar, infrared and  radio observations of Titan have not found signs of a hydrocarbon ocean. In fact one radar return was, and I quote ’of a type that we should expect to get back from Venus.’” End of quote. Titan is most likely a baby brother of Venus. Six  months after writing Cassini's Homecoming, I wrote another article, ”Titan a Rosetta stone for early Earth?” There I wrote the Electric Universe conceptual model can claim a number of successful predictions. Most  importantly it was the only model to predict the surface features of smog- shrouded Titan before they were  revealed in detail by Huygens [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by TheThunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info How do objects in our universe form? In the unimaginably vast cosmos at all scales, from comets and asteroids in our solar system to the vastest superclusters of galaxies stretching for hundreds of millions of light years, astronomers and astrophysicists imagine gravitational processes and only gravitational processes governing these objects' formation. But the objects we see tell a different story and demand new theoretical pathways. In our own solar system, one of the most puzzling forms is a double-lobed shape of most common nuclei imaged to date, a weirdly similar form also seen in nebulae and even in the peanut-shaped cross-section of the galactic bulge of our own Milky Way. In this episode, physicist Wal Thornhill will explain why the pairing of celestial objects is a predictable effect of a universe governed not by gravity but by electromagnetism. It is almost 50 years since Hannes Alfvén predicted the inevitable death of gravitational big bang cosmology. Why is it taking so long? The reason seems to be that cosmology has become a dogmatic belief system as firmly entrenched as any religion within a global fraternity who have been taught that computer modeling based on those beliefs will provide the answers someday at whatever cost. But computer models tend to have a life of their own. New parameters, forces, particles and imaginary celestial objects can be introduced and endlessly adjusted to match almost any observation. Gone are the classically-trained scientists of the 19th century who aimed for simplicity and matched theory against physical experiment. Today, theorists waste most of the computing power on Earth generating virtual reality objects and universes. They sit in front of computer screens reflecting back to them what they know about what they know about what they know. Meanwhile, the key is to be found in what scientists don't know they don't know, which is a consequence of dogmatic training that there is no alternative to gravity as the governing force in the universe. Yet no cosmologist will admit that the force of gravity remains unexplained in the 21st century. Einstein had the crazy idea that there is no force, just our warped perception. This requires, according to the media celebrity Brian Cox, that you ignore the surroundings and define a falling object as being stationary. It works fine until the ground, for no apparent reason, smacks into the stationary object. The product of this nonsense is a fictional universe containing dark matter, dark energy and black holes. Physics, be damned! Clearly, theoretical Big Bang cosmology is fake science when there's another peer-reviewed and experimentally tested cosmology available, based on real electrical plasma behavior. And remember, practically the entire visible universe is in the plasma state. So plasma cosmology is where real physics answers are to be found. Alfvén, who was both a practical electrical engineer and physicist in the classical tradition, told very publicly in his acceptance speech for the 1970 Nobel Prize in Physics, what theorists don't know about plasma. But it seems mathematical theorists don't like an alarm going off when they're busy playing computer games. Alfvén later wrote about the pressure by theorists on real astronomers, "...the result was the development of a cosmological establishment, like that of the Ptolemaic orthodoxy, which did not tolerate objections or dissent." Alfvén accentuated the essential role of electric circuits in space plasma and a circuit by definition, carries electric current. Of course, there are no wires in space but nature always contrives to do things in the simplest and most effective way. Charged particles encounter least resistance by following magnetic lines of force and producing what's known as field-aligned current filaments. Two parallel current filaments interact electromagnetically to draw closer and rotate about each other. The resulting twisted pair of plasma current filaments is named after an early pioneer of the electric universe, the Norwegian Kristian Birkeland. So the key signatures of cosmic electricity are "doubleness" or pairing and rotation. On August 24th, phys.org published 'The Origin of Binary Stars'. It makes the admission that "The origin of binary stars has long been one of the central problems of astronomy." It's been found that protostars and young stars are more likely to be found in binary pairs strung at intervals along a filament inside a molecular cloud. About half of the binaries are in elongated core structures, and they conclude that the initial cores were also elongated structures... One of their most significant major conclusions is that each dusty core of material is likely to be the birthplace of two stars, not the single star usually modeled." This raises the real issue that astrophysicists don't understand how either the filaments or the stars are formed, something that plasma cosmologists have shown for half a century or more. Here's an image taken at submillimeter wavelengths of a star forming core, showing that it contains two young stellar embryos. The caption says, "Astronomers have concluded from a systematic study of very young cores that most embryonic stars form in multiple systems and later some of them separate." The problem is that astrophysicists are using a gravitational accretion model based on the concept of a center of mass which doesn't lend itself to preferentially producing pairs of stars. Meanwhile, the plasma cosmology model is electromagnetic, driven by a linear twisted pair of Birkeland current filaments. It's an inherently binary phenomenon. In the Electric Universe, stars and planets are formed along the Birkeland current filament by a powerful and long-range 1/√r electromagnetic scavenging force acting on the diffused dust and gas in a molecular cloud. This compares to the puny short-range one over r squared gravitational force which cannot form a filament anyway. On the basis that nature doesn't do anything the hard way, gravity just isn't the answer! To emphasize that science is only trivially self-correcting and has to undergo periodic revolutions or paradigm shifts, Hannes Alfvén argued, 40 years ago, that stars are born in interstellar clouds by magnetic pinching along plasma current filaments. Infrared space telescopes, like the Herschel Space Observatory, spectacularly confirmed this 30 years later, but Alfvén remains ignored to this day. Old beliefs die hard. Plasma physicist Anthony Peratt was a student of Alfvén. Peratt's plasma cosmology textbook 'Physics of the Plasma Universe' has on page 119 a section on doubleness in current conducting plasmas. He writes, "The 1/r dependency of the Biot-Savart force law between current conducting filaments leads to a curious phenomenon: a pairing of filaments. This pairing leads directly to a "twoness" or "doubleness" when many filaments are present in plasmas in which the magnetic field plays a major role." The supercomputer simulation shown here is based on the electromagnetic interaction of a large number of charged particles moving in a magnetic field, and demonstrates the evolving sequence between three filaments. It shows the two closest filaments interact strongly to form a spiral while the third remains quiescent. So what do we find in the paper referred to by the phys.org report? "The higher-order [star] multiples generally contain a mix of components at wide and tight separations, and all systems have at least one component far from the center of the [elongated] core." This matches Peratt's simulation of multiple Birkeland current filaments. On the galactic scale, the elongated core is the central bar of a spiral formation. Here we see an X-ray image of the active galaxy Cygnus A, a relatively nearby galaxy containing a powerful quasar. It's the second strongest radio source in the sky. You can see three X-ray hotspots along an elongated core. X-rays peek out where matter and current density is highest. The two hotspots at the end of the elongated core or bar, of the galaxy, are the footprints of twin galactic Birkeland currents. In a repeated pattern at the galactic scale, it has been found that like stars, galaxies are also strung like Catherine Wheel fireworks along cosmic wires. But instead of producing twin stars, they generate spiral arms full of stars from the ends and along the rotating bar. The central hotspot in the bar is due to the electromagnetic plasmoid jet engine at the heart of all active galaxies. It is the quasar factory required by Halton Arp's research. Since the twin Birkeland currents are great plasma attractors, they will form a thick toroid of matter as they rotate about the galactic center. Seen edge-on, it gives a peanut profile to the galactic bulge. So what do scientists find? A Hubble News release in 1994 titled 'Hubble Uncovers a Hidden Quasar in a Nearby Galaxy (Cygnus A)' says, "Though Cygnus A is categorized as an elliptical galaxy, it has an unusual peanut shape due to a dark band of dust encircling the enigmatic nucleus." Needless to say, the hidden quasar in Cygnus A is a mystery. "I was stunned when we realized we had a quasar; it was a total surprise" said Dr. Anne Kinney of the Space Telescope Science Institute, Baltimore, Maryland. The report explains that, "Most quasars existed billions of years ago in the early universe, and, so, it's unusual to find one in our own epoch... Though this provides an unexpected opportunity for close-up study of the mysterious 'engine' behind a quasar, these results add further mystery as to the true nature of the powerhouse." Finally, the report adds, "Previous ground-based radio observations show that there is an elongated optical object in the Cygnus A's core. This is inconsistent with black hole models that predict a compact point source of radiation." Forget imaginary gravitational black holes! Overpowering electromagnetic forces dominate in galaxies. All of these observations are consistent with plasma cosmology and Halton Arp's observations of quasar birth from active galactic nuclei. It supports his evidence against redshift being a measure of great age and distance of quasars. Galactic redshift is a measure of youthfulness of a quasar. In other words, the universe isn't expanding. There was no Big Bang. The universe is of unknown origin, age and extent. There is no need for cosmology to compete with creation myths. I wrote in 2006, "On this website I have made many successful yet unusual predictions based on the Electric Universe cosmology. For example, what would be seen when close-ups were taken of Io's 'volcanoes'; the initial flash and unexpected outburst from Deep Impact; what would be found beneath the clouds of Titan; and the link between spiral forms at the poles of Venus and the 'hot spot' at Saturn's South Pole. If the test of a good theory is successful predictions, the Electric Universe is unparalleled. Even better, if it can simply explain details in the new images of Saturn's South Pole. Earlier in February, 2005, I've written about Venus, "...we should expect to see evidence of the twisted pair configuration at the poles of Venus, if the input current is sufficiently strong and this model is correct. The Venusian polar dipole shows the precise configuration and motion of Birkeland current pairs in plasma discharge experiments. That includes a surrounding spiral vortex." Professor Fred Taylor of the University of Oxford Atmospheric Oceanic and Planetary Physics Department, wrote about the Venusian polar vortex, "...the absence of viable theories which can be tested, or in this case any theory at all, leaves us uncomfortably in doubt as to our basic ability to understand even gross features of planetary atmospheric circulations." Yet the same phenomenon discovered on Saturn, years later, again puzzled scientists. My web article titled 'The "Spiral Galaxy" at Saturn's Pole' quotes a NASA report that describes a hurricane-like storm at Saturn's South Pole with a well-developed eye ringed by towering clouds. The storm is approximately 8,000 kilometers or 5,000 miles across or 2/3 of the diameter of the Earth. "It looks like a hurricane, but it doesn't behave like a hurricane" said Dr. Andrew Ingersoll, a member of Cassini's imaging team at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. It is locked to the pole and doesn't drift around. A movie taken by Cassini's camera over a three-hour period, saw the shadow cast by a ring of towering clouds surrounding the pole and two spiral arms of clouds extending from the central ring. These ring clouds, 30 to 75 kilometers that is 20 to 45 miles above those in the center of the storm, are two to five times taller than the clouds of thunderstorms and hurricanes on Earth. Though it is unlikely moist convection is driving Saturn's storm, the dark eye at the pole, the eyewall clouds and the spiral arms together indicate a hurricane-like system. "The clear skies over the eye appear to extend down to a level about twice as deep as the usual cloud level observed on Saturn," said Dr. Kevin Baines of Cassini's visual and infrared mapping spectrometer team. "This gives us the deepest view yet into Saturn over a wide range of wavelengths, and reveals a mysterious set of dark clouds at the bottom of the eye." Those dark clouds are the footprints of twin Birkeland current filaments, seen here reflecting the maxima in a computer simulation of the magnetic energy distribution between two Birkeland current filaments in the inset. Notice particularly, the energy hot spots distribution is identical to that seen in Cygnus A. It indicates that powerful storms on Earth, like a hurricane with eye wall clouds and spiral arms, are driven electrically and not simply by solar heating rising moisture. This in turn suggests that climate scientists are missing the most powerful influence on extreme weather events. It seems to be clinched by the Mount-Everest-high dust devils on Mars that generate a planet-wide dust storm for months. There's not much solar heating or air mass on Mars sufficient to drive this remarkable phenomenon. In fact, it is the Martian dust devils that form the dusty atmosphere and warms it by trapping sunlight. A change in external electrical energy causes a change in climate. So we should look to our electric Sun's activity for answers to climate change on Earth. Our recent Space News on the double-lobed form of many asteroids and comets, receives a simple explanation based on their formation in an electrical exchange between two planetary bodies. Each filament will tend to concentrate matter excavated from the more negative body into two lobes joined by a bar or neck. It explains the mixture of planet-surface-formed minerals and high temperature minerals found in comet dust. Comets do not hold the secrets to the formation of the Earth, but to the violent electrical encounters between bodies sometimes captured by the Sun. The twin filament nature of electric currents in plasma, causes us to see double effects at the galactic scale, at the stellar scale, at the planetary scale, the cometary scale and right on down to the laboratory scale. Such vast scalability of plasma phenomena is an overwhelming advantage of plasma cosmology over gravitational big bang cosmology. It has been shown to be highly explanatory and predictive. These are the hallmarks of a successful model. Plasma cosmology doesn't require fudging with dark matter, black holes and dark energy. It suggests the hugely expensive high-energy particle physics and gravitational wave experiments are a waste of money when gravitational theory has no physical basis. The mathematician John Wheeler described gravity in metaphysical terms, "...matter tells spacetime how to curve and spacetime tells matter how to move." The words 'spacetime' and 'tells' are physically undefined. It isn't physics! Alfvén was right, astrophysics is in crisis as shown by the perpetual state of surprise at new discoveries. Charles MacKay was right when he wrote Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, in 1841. "Men, it has been well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds while they only recover their senses slowly, and one by one." 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info For almost three years on this channel, we have reported on the theory-shattering discoveries from the European Space Agency's Rosetta mission to Comet 67P. While science media celebrated the first-ever landing of a space probe on a comet nucleus, the actual findings of the mission ultimately falsified the more than half century old, "Dirty Snowball Comet" hypothesis. Increasingly fine images of the Comet's surface provoked deeper and deeper expressions of surprise from investigators. The most notable surprise was that the comet was, in the words of one ESA scientist, "dry like hell" and its rubble-strewn terrain seem to bear a greater resemblance to the American Southwest than the slowly sublimating snowball envisioned by Fred Whipple. But proponents of the Electric Universe theory, as it is proposed by the chief principals of The Thunderbolts Project, were not surprised by the geology of the comet nucleus. The tortured and complex cometary terrain seems to fit perfectly with the radical theory that comets were excavated by electrical discharges from planets and moons. No geological feature on the comet was more surprising than its sand dunes, a planetary feature that is thought to require an atmosphere that can produce mechanical winds. The initial response of some scientists around the world was borderline disbelief. As planetary geologist and blogger Emily Lakdawalla wrote in October 2014, "Other features are odd because they look familiar and yet have no right being on a comet. I've called them 'rhythmic ridges' but to pretty much everyone who looks at them, they look like sand dunes. Which are just plain impossible on a body that has neither atmosphere nor much of any gravity." The comet's sand dunes were not the only evidence for the seemingly impossible "winds" acting on the comet. In fact, images revealed well over a dozen rocks or boulders which appeared to have so-called streaks of wind trailing away from them. ESA scientists first attempted to explain these features by proposing that the comet's jets were somehow creating sufficient "winds" to transport dust material. Investigators gave this ad hoc theory the name, "Localized Gas Driven Transport." Later, scientists proposed an even more extreme process, similar to saltation in Earth geology. Today, investigators are proposing yet another strange process to explain the comet's sand dunes. A Phys.org report describes the research published in February of this year. It states, "The formation of sedimentary dunes requires the presence of grains and of winds that are strong enough to transport them along the ground. However, comets do not have a dense, permanent atmosphere as on Earth. Faced with this unexpected finding, the researchers show that there is in fact a wind blowing along the comet's surface. It is caused by the pressure difference between the sunlit side, where the surface ice can sublimate due to the energy provided by the sunlight, and the night side." However, a scientific basis exists why none of the strange mechanical processes investigators have proposed are necessary. In the Electric Comet Theory, as proposed by the chief principals of The Thunderbolts Project, a comet's environment is far more dynamic than the standard "Dirty Snowball" theory ever suggested. It has always been the Electric Universe position that electric fields, acting on the comet nucleus, will shape surface material in dramatic ways that cannot be explained in standard reasoning. A powerful test of this story came with NASA's 2005 "Deep Impact" mission to the Comet Tempel 1. Mission scientists had believed that the comet would only lose about one third of a meter of depth in each orbit. But when the Stardust's next spacecraft reimaged the Tempel 1 nucleus in 2010, it found that the wall of a prominent mesa had retreated about 35 meters. The astonishing excavation of material was precisely focused at the location of mysterious pixel saturations; which, according to proponents of the Electric Universe, was the focal point of electrical arcs. A key point about the sand dunes on the Comet 67P is that ESA scientists have confirmed that the dunes are active and are seen to change over a period of 16 months. This follows previous reports of astonishingly rapid changes on the Comet's surface. In September of 2016, scientists reported that, over a period of six weeks, they witnessed mysterious erosional markings appearing and expanding at rates exponentially faster than predicted by standard comet theory. As one mission scientist stated, "These spectacular changes are proceeding extremely rapidly, with the rims of the features expanding by a few tens of centimeters per hour. This highlights the complexity of the physical processes involved." These discoveries confirm an explicit prediction from an earlier Space News episode, which stated that electric fields, acting on the comet, would reconfigure surface material with unexpected rapidity. Electrical activity could profoundly reconfigure the dust layers in the course of the next few months. Electric fields acting on the comet can also produce ionic winds, similar to those produced by air purifiers. In this series; we have repeatedly referred to the experimental research of Billy Yelverton, who has produced countless familiar geological features including sand dunes, simply by applying electric fields to plates of dust and other materials. It's especially puzzling that scientists continue to propose strange exotic mechanisms to explain winds acting on the comet's surface. When increasingly mainstream research confirms tenets of the electrical interpretation. As noted in the previous Space News episode; a recent NASA-funded study affirmed that electrostatic dust transportation occurs on airless bodies in space, and is responsible for many heretofore puzzling features on planets, moons, comets and asteroids. A Phys.org report on the study states for the findings, "[They] bring closure to a long-standing issue of electrostatic dust transport, explaining a variety of unusual phenomena on the surfaces of airless planetary bodies, including observations from the Apollo era to the recent Rosetta comet mission." The article continues, "The movement of electrons in the tiny spaces between dust particles can generate surprisingly strong charges and forces, which can lift and move dust particles off the ground. In addition to single particles, clusters of dust were lofted, which showed that electrostatic processes may be responsible for the Rosetta detection of fluffy dust particles released from the surface of Comet 67P. These laboratory observations reveal that dusty surfaces can become smooth due to dust mobilization and could help explain the 'dust ponds' like those seen on asteroid Eros and Comet 67P..." Unfortunately, it seems that countless assumptions about our solar system and the universe as a whole continue to endure even in the face of revolutionary discoveries. The assumption of charge neutrality in space has been refuted. Comets discharge electrically because they experience voltage spikes, passing through regions of changing potential. And the assumption that comets are icy primordial leftovers from the solar system's infancy 4.5 billion years ago is now also refuted. Indeed, regardless of how comets form, the comet's environment is so dynamic. How could one possibly hope to accurately document the comet's history and origins, tracing back a billion plus years? The Rosetta comet mission was a remarkable technological feat and a historic human achievement. Yet, how will history judge institutional science and its enduring beliefs about one of nature's greatest mysteries, the comet?

Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info New reports in popular science media highlight some of the theoretical limitations in planetary science and geology today, limitations which have resulted in countless mysteries related to the planets, moons and comets. The reports in question propose that volcanism on various bodies throughout the solar system is more pervasive than scientists have ever previously believed. Even supposedly occurring on comets. On March 6, 2017 Astronomy.com published the article, "Planetary scientists are turning up volcanoes everywhere they look." The report focuses heavily on a theoretical phenomenon called cryovolcanism, or ice volcanoes. On planet Earth scientists theorize that the shifting of tectonic plates is a cause in both earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. But on several other worlds which are not thought to have plate tectonics, planetary scientists believe they observe another type of volcanism called cryovolcanism. A cryo volcano or ice volcano is hypothesized to result when gravitational forces produce tidal heating and other effects in an icy body, producing volcanic eruptions. For decades planetary scientists have believed that tidal heating is the cause of the most dramatic volcanism in our entire solar system, on the Jovian moon, Io. The Astronomy.com article outlines the hypothesis as follows: "Io and other Galilean satellites (such as Europa and Ganymede) are in synchronous rotation around Jupiter. Io then becomes caught up in a tug-of-war between Jupiter's gravity and the gravity of these other satellites... This in turn leads to the bulging of Io’s crust up and down and the resulting friction produces a large amount of heat and a molten interior. When the pressure builds, it occasionally erupts melted rock and plumes of gas. However, as previously reported on this series, observations in recent years have effectively falsified the tidal heating model for Io’s so called volcanoes. In 2013 a geological survey found that the surprising locations of the plumes “...can't be reconciled with any existing solid body tidal heating model.” But the problems for the volcano hypothesis on Io began almost immediately after their discovery. In fact, in 1979, it was the world-renowned astrophysicist Thomas Gold who first proposed that Io’s so-called volcanic plumes were in fact high-energy electrical discharges. Nine years later plasma scientists Anthony Peratt of Los Alamos Laboratories and co-author Alex Dessler also proposed an electrical mechanism for the “plumes” If the plumes are in fact electrical discharges, this would account for numerous anomalies with the standard hypothesis, including their filamentary structure, a completely anomalous feature for any volcanic plume; as well as their surprising movements across the surface of Io. But perhaps most significantly, the electrical interpretation explains the electrical currents that have been found connecting the Jovian atmosphere and its icy moons. Planetary scientists insists that the source of the electrical currents is charged particles from volcanic eruptions. But this hypothesis was complicated when scientists also found the auroral footprints of the moons Europa and Ganymede. A research team wrote of this discovery “Europa is not thought to be volcanic, so what could produce the electrical current that zips along and eventually gives rise to Europa’s auroral footprint?” Similar problems also face planetary scientists who seek to explain the high velocity features seen jetting from the Saturnian moon Enceladus. More than a decade ago the discovery of the enormous jets and plumes at Saturn's south pole astonished scientists working on NASA's Cassini mission. Scientists had expected the moon to be geologically dead and the last place they expected such activity would be the moon’s south pole, as reported by Space.com at the time. "The finding flipped everything scientists knew about Enceladus on its head, because what should have been a dead moon appeared to be geologically active and while it's supposed to be the moon’s coldest region, turned out to be its warmest. A co-investigator of the Cassini mission said of the discovery, “This is as astonishing as if we'd flown past Earth and found that Antarctica was warmer than the Sahara.” The tiny moon is a mere 504 kilometers in diameter and the icy plumes were seen to reach up to 480 kilometers high. Investigators settled on the notion that liquid water must be present under the surface like a Yellowstone geyser in order for it to erupt in high speed jets. A NASA news release stated, “The rare occurrence of liquid water so near the surface raises many (new) questions about this mysterious moon.” But the immediate assumption of liquid water near the surface only showed that the surprising discovery caused no reassessment of a theoretical framework. Scientists settled on the notion that Saturn must be ”gravitationally leading Enceladus”, producing so-called cryo volcanoes at the moon's south pole through friction heating. In 2015 planetary scientists made the surprising discovery that particles in the Enceladus plumes are electrically charged. A lead investigator studying data from the Cassini plasma spectrometer said of the discovery, “What are particularly fascinating are the bursts of dust that CAPS detects when Cassini passes through the individual jets in the plume. Each jet is split according to charge though. Negative grains are on one side, and positive ones on the other.” As in the Jovian system we see an electrical connection between Saturn and Enceladus. The comparability of the gas giants’ respective environments is summarized by Thunderbolts Picture of the Day managing editor Steven Smith in his article: ”Enceladus Is Plugged in,” “It is easiest to get an idea of what is happening on Enceladus by comparing it to another moon in the solar system: Jupiter's moon Io.... Io acts like an electrical generator as it travels through Jupiter's plasmasphere, inducing over 400,000 volts across its diameter at more than three million amperes.” "That tremendous current flows along its magnetic field into the electric environment in Jupiter. The same kind of electromagnetic activity connects Enceladus with Saturn's poles..." In the Electric Universe interpretation, neither the one-way electrical transaction scientists propose, nor the assumed charge neutrality of Jupiter, Saturn and their respective moons, can be valid. The electrical discharge activity that scientists misinterpret as cryovolcanism on Io and Enceladus may be comparable to the filamentary jets of comets, which are also electrical in nature. Ironically, in the March 2017 Astronomy.com report “Are there volcanoes on comets?”, the article suggests that so-called volcanic activity has occurred on Comet 29P Schwassmann-Wachmann in its orbit between Saturn and Jupiter. It states, “The strange activity may be due to the comet’s unusually long day/night cycle. Unlike most comets, which rotate on hourly scales, 29P rotates only about once every 60 Earth-days. During the comet’s long night, material may pool in chambers beneath the surface. When the comet rotates into its long day, the gas expands, flexing the surface. High pressures can help the gas break through the surface, exploding outward in a volcano-like event. Instead of hot magma, frozen gas streams from the comet.” However, neither the imagined subsurface cometary ice, nor the theoretical nozzles from which comet jets supposedly emanate, have ever been found. The 2012 paper, “Cometary jet collimation without physical confinement” published in the American Geophysical Union acknowledged the dilemma as follows, “Contemporary models postulate that these jets collimate when the expanding gases and dust pass through a physical aperture or nozzle. However, recent high-resolution spacecraft observations failed to detect such apertures on comet surfaces. Furthermore, these models do not explain why cometary jets appear to be directed normal to the local gravitational potential, and/or to originate on the faces of scarps.” In fact electrical discharges producing comet jets on the faces of scarps is a prediction of the Electric Comet theory which states that electrical activity will always center on the sharp points of a body which act as kinds of lightning rods. Yet today consensus scientific theory remains that comets are slowly sublimating ice balls that produce outbursts or sometimes disintegrate due to increasingly strange processes. In the Electric Universe theory, a comet's activity is a result of its experiencing voltage spikes in its changing plasma environment. One of the most promising, yet still overlooked pathways of discovery is the growing evidence for a link between cometary outbursts and dramatic solar activity. At the 2016 Thunderbolts Project conference, “Elegant Simplicity” Russian scientist Dr. Subhon Ibadov presented the talk, “Nature of electric comets, electric discharge mechanism of comet outbursts and thunderbolts lightning in comet nuclei due to solar flares.” On the planet Mars recent discoveries may provide a clue to the electrical phenomena that planetary scientists sometimes interpret as volcanism. In 2012 amateur astronomers spotted enormous plumes jetting from the Martian surface. The plumes were more than 250 kilometers high and several hundreds of kilometers in length. Similar bright enormous plumes have occasionally been spotted on Mars since 1997, leaving astronomers completely baffled. However, in 2016 scientists reported that a dramatic appearance of the plumes occurred immediately after Mars was hit by a coronal mass ejection. In standard reasoning there is no reason why charged particles from the Sun would produce such a dramatic dust raising event. As one scientist stated, “It's very surprising that was affecting Mars right before the plume was first observed.” A New Scientists report on the discovery acknowledged the unavoidability of an electrical interpretation. It stated, “One possibility is that plasma could be interacting with ice grains or dust lower down in the atmosphere and electrically charging them, boosting them higher, but it's not clear how the effect would be big.” It's surely no coincidence that Martian plumes appears strikingly similar in structure to the plumes on the moons Io and Enceladus. Perhaps the single greatest obstacle in the space sciences is the ongoing assumption of charge neutrality for celestial objects. On our own Earth, scientists are still making extraordinary discoveries, completely unexpected in standard theory, confirming our planet's dynamic electrical environment. This includes the recent discovery of “supersonic plasma” jets high up in our atmosphere that could push temperatures up to almost 10,000 degrees Celsius. A Phys.org report on the finding, which will be the topic of a forthcoming Space News episode, states, “The theory that there are huge electric currents, powered by solar wind and guided through the ionosphere by Earth's magnetic field, was postulated more than a century ago by Norwegian scientist Kristian Birkeland. While much is known about these current systems, recent observations by (the ESA’s Swarm mission) have revealed that they are associated with large electrical fields.” If our own Earth so presents such mysteries for institutional science, what further surprises might distant world still hold? Moreover, how many ongoing mysteries will finally be resolved when space scientists abandon the notion of an electrically sterile and disconnected universe?

[Music] ”Sometimes it's better not to know one wrong thing than to know a hundred things that are right.” That was a favorite saying of Halton Arp, an astronomer who pioneered the study of discordant redshift galaxies. Stephan's Quintet is a good illustration of this. The Quintet is a closed group of five distorted galaxies that on first sight appear to be interacting. Their arms are stretched and twisted and in some places they appear to be intertwined. The two galaxies closest to each other seem to be mashed together. They're often said to be colliding. The apparently larger galaxy at the southeast side of the group has a spectrally measured redshift z=0.0026. Under the consensus conjecture that redshift is a Doppler effect of the hypothetical expansion of the universe, this translates into a recessional index velocity of around 800 kilometers per second. Three of the other four galaxies have index velocities of 6,700 kilometers per second and red shifts of 0.0225. One of the two that appear mashed together has an index velocity of 5,700 kilometers per second, a thousand kilometers per second less, redshift of 0.019. Under the additional consensus conjecture that the index velocity represents distance, the apparently larger galaxy is 250 million light years closer than the others. The two that appear mashed together would be about  50 million light years apart, farther than the larger appearing galaxy is from us. They appear together only by coincidence, yet the consensus opinion is that they are in fact colliding. Another fact that's consistently overlooked is that the bright H2 ionized hydrogen regions in the background galaxies are about the same angular size as those in the foreground galaxy. Since it's also believed that H2 regions tend to be of similar linear size, the consensus has simply ignored this fact. Perhaps the assumed dark matter in the foreground galaxy can be assumed to be positioned exactly right to magnify the H2 regions beyond, through selective gravitational lensing. Long tails on both the foreground galaxy and the one immediately north of it, are occasionally mentioned and then dismissed as due to complex interactions in the past. The interactions must have been complex in the extreme to have affected the foreground galaxy over a distance of 250 million light years. Knowing the one thing, that redshift can only be a measure of distance, overrides all observations indicating that it's something else. A seldom noticed bias of astronomy, perhaps caused by the tunnel effect of its primary instrument, is a flight into tunnel vision. Attention is narrowed to single objects, or even to parts of objects, and  larger connections and contexts are overlooked. So with the long tails. On deep images both tails trail off in parallel, far toward an active large galaxy NGC 7331. Radio observations reveal a bridge of radiation that follows the path of the tails and connects Stephan's Quintet with the active galaxy. The bridge continues on the opposite side of NGC 7331 to a cluster of quasars, which coincidentally have similar redshifts to the high redshift members of the Quintet. The bridge also appears on X-ray images. This is obviously another instance of paired ejection from an active galaxy and plasma astronomers would call the bridge an intergalactic Birkeland current. Of course, what's obvious to one eye is not to another, because eyes tend to see what they believe. It's no shock that consensus eyes refuse to see ejection pairs and their connections. To acknowledge those connections, would be to falsify the belief in redshift as an indicator of distance and by extension to falsify the Big Bang hypothesis. That would cause job losses for the consensus of astronomers. A universe of quasars, ejected from active galaxies and growing into companion galaxies, replaces the exploding Big Bang universe with a birthing maternal universe of pregnant galaxies and their children. A similar consensus blind spot obscures a high-redshift quasar that lies in front of that northern galaxy. According to its redshift, the quasar should be billions of light years behind the galaxy. The galaxy is full of dust, completely opaque, and therefore the quasar should be as invisible as dark matter. The consensus opinion, is that the galaxy has a small tube of empty space through it, that coincidentally aligns with the quasar along our line of sight. The galaxy also displays an energized region, another Birkeland current, from its core to the quasar. When looking at this galaxy, consensus astronomers blink in unison. A ridge of X-ray radiation is located between the background galaxies and the foreground one. Consensus astronomers ascribe it  to gas, heated by shock waves from the collision, and one can't help but wonder what's colliding if the foreground galaxy is 250 million light years in front, but at 70 million Kelvin the heating is truly shocking. Overlooked is the fact that long before such a temperature is reached, gas has been fully ionized into plasma in which electric and magnetic forces  dominate. That then the ridge would be due to double layers, and gas astronomers would be  out of work. The 70 million figure is, like the redshift velocity an index figure, an artifact of uncritical extrapolation from gas theory. With a recognition  of plasma behavior, the X-rays are synchrotron radiation from high-speed electrons, accelerated across the strong electric fields of double layers, and spiraling in magnetic fields. Since temperature is based on random motions, and the electrons are not random, but aligned in a magnetic field, the concept of temperature is not even relevant. A final consideration that appears not to have been mentioned before, concerns this X-ray ridge. Stephan's Quintet is considered to be a compact cluster of which several thousand are known. George Abel cataloged many of them before X-ray observations were possible. A review of several of them shows similar ridges of X-ray radiation across their cores. Others show simply a spot. If these compact clusters are fragmenting quasars, on  their way to becoming companion galaxies around the parent active galaxy from which they were ejected, the X-rays delineate a central pinch in the parent’s ejection circuits. Ridges of radiation show up in clusters whose ejection circuits are inclined to our line of sight. The spots result from our looking down the barrel of the discharge. Arp commented in the book he wrote in 1987 about the discordant redshift controversy ‘Quasars, Redshifts and Controversies’, ”What happened in the present case was typical in that more detailed observations with new and advanced instruments were selectively interpreted with old assumptions; the net result  was loss of perspective and an actual retrogression in scientific knowledge.” The loss of perspective with which images from the new and advanced James Webb Space Telescope are being interpreted, confirm Arp's judgment. The new images reveal connections between galaxies that ‘surprise’ astronomers and send them back to the drawing board. But instead of finding new and advanced assumptions with which to draw a new and advanced cosmology from a new and advanced perspective, they trace over the palimpsest of the old and obsolete. The Electric Universe model is a step in the direction of recognizing a new universe of plasma connections. [Music] [Music] 
Let me give a brief hypothesis: fundamentally that the Earth has been influenced by electrical discharge. It's not the only thing it's been influenced by, but how can we quantify that? So with that background I'll have to talk about the geological effects of running water, an important component of our past and it still is measured today. Electric discharges on dielectric media is something we can do in the lab and as you've seen in the past few talks, electric discharges are scalable. The fundamental aspect of these studies is that what we do in the lab, if we have a source for it, at the galactic scale or at the earth scale, it can occur and we can measure it. You can't do that with water. That's the only drawback to water, you can only scale it a few orders of magnitude in the laboratory. And the fractal analysis is a tool which we'll use to measure these items. So, I'll take you through how I measured some of these landforms and compare them to existing electric discharges. So, really what is water? Water flows all over the earth, you can find many pictures of it, we can measure it, we can measure what it actually does on the earth. Electrical discharges however, are a little bit different. They have fractal patterns, they're somewhat chaotic, but also ordered in their discharge patterns. I'll show a few other pictures from captured lightning. They do a lot of great work with these Lichtenberg patterns in polyacrylic-type resins and you get these beautiful dendritic patterns. So, we can actually measure these items in the lab and we'll talk about that a little bit more. So, let's be honest. Many of you flew here, looked over the earth and saw some pretty perplexing landscapes. And now we can view that on our laptops, and we can measure things on our laptops. Okay. As a chemist - I'm a chemist, I'm not a geologist, but I understand the concepts behind some geology - I was wondering if the current geological paradigm is missing something. As I flew over the earth, I saw these tremendous dendritic patterns and cratering and mountain tops right next to floodplains and other different topological features. So, I was wondering, we can talk all we want about other mechanisms, but if we don't have a quantitative way to measure that, no one will hear us. So is there a quantitative relationship to the various topological aspects of the earth? And I believe there is, and that's what fractal analysis will tell us. I'm from New Jersey, Northern New Jersey. It is more than Newark Airport, there are some beautiful regions in New Jersey. Where I live there are a lot of granite outcrops, a lot of very strange hogbacks that run from the north to the west or north northwest. Beautiful Lake Region. So that's about 10 square miles there on Google Terrain. As we back out an order of magnitude, we see some interesting aspects to the topology. We see our Appalachian Mountains here. Folded patterns. Supposedly these are ancient mountains that have been eroded away. But right up, buttoned against them, are dendritic patterns and caverns, extensive canyons in central Pennsylvania, formed by water presumably. This butts up against the coast which is thought to be a flood plain, and there's beautiful Newark down there. If you back out more on the East Coast, it then comes up to the flood plains of the Mississippi region. Ozarks are down here. New Hampshire, the granite state. Granite outcrops everywhere. Fairly high mountains up there. But again, the Appalachians stretch down throughout Virginia. And you have your Chesapeake Bay there. So, in terms of scaling - when we back out from our small 10 square mile aspect - we see some very unique features at different scales. We've already seen in the past number of presentations - there haven't been that many already - that we can assume, at least for the hypothesis, that the earth was bathed in equilibration of electrical energy. From the Sun? From the galaxy? From other bodies? We don't know. That was the past. That is an ’origins’ question. That is a different conversation. But what we can do, is we can measure what's left over, and we can see if we can draw any conclusions from that. So, in that sense - this is a slide borrowed from Wal Thornhill - if the current is coming in on our galaxy. We are just a very small subset of this. Again, it goes back to scale - Michael Claridge showed that so well - it goes back to scale. We are just a very, very small speck of dust on one of these arms. If there is electric current flowing through these arms, it is reasonable to assume that we've been influenced by that in the past. Again, from Wal's presentation, this is just a local hypothesized environment of the plasma solar system. And where our incoming charge is coming from. From our plasma pinch currents. Again, look at the scale. The sun is still but a small speck on this overall space of things. And then from a size scale from a NASA view, our little blue dot of earth here, we are very small compared to the sun. So, it's reasonable to expect that large changes in the sun's output could influence us dramatically, now that we know we're tied electrically to it. We know that in the late 1850s, a tremendous corona affected telegraph lines, blew out many of them. If such a corona would happen these days, we'd be in loads of trouble. But we also have to realize that electrical effects are not the only effect. Many years of very hard work by very smart people have established certain aspects of fluvial erosion. Erosion by glaciers. It does occur. We can't deny that. But on what scale? What is the order of magnitude of a fluvial erosion versus a massive electric thunderbolt brought about by discharge across the earth's atmosphere? So, these discharges across dielectrics do exhibit fractal type patterns. What is a fractal? Many of you might be familiar with the Mandelbrot set. It's a very fun whirlwind through YouTube. If you zoom in and it goes and then repeats to infinity no matter where you increase your magnification on this set. That's a fractal. It is the same as it is near as it is from far. So, discharges across dielectrics - a dielectric being some sort of insulator - exhibit these kind of fractal characteristics. The ‘capture lightning’ folks do this marvelously. This is a discharge across polycarbonate and as you zoom in to infinity, you could theorize that it extends down to a single electron path in these dendritic patterns. Now, interestingly enough, when fractal analysis started coming about (Mandelbrot pioneered this in the early 70s and 80s, published a book) shorelines were the first to be analyzed [because] they did exhibit some sort of fractal characteristics. In this case it's Chesapeake Bay. We see our dendritic pattern here, and also some could be brought about by flow of the rivers, from rainfall, from constant season changes. But what are the main effects? How much of an effect does the fluvial erosion of a riverbed have versus an electrical origin? Can we quantify that? So that's what we'll explore. If you go walking down a street or on a muddy path and it rains, the rain is going to fill in the path. It's that simple. We can see that every day. So the hypothesis is, what if the earth did experience these discharges which had a profound effect on the topology of the earth? But now we're under the influence of a [steady] state of rain and snow erosion. Could these processes that had already sculpted the earth, influence what we see in the rivers today? Now, we do know that fluvial erosion happens. We can measure it. We've seen it in the earth. These are pictures from Alaska where you see the snowfall actually freezing and then melting and carving river channels. And then you have what's called alluvial fans towards the bottom. As the water decreases its energy and dissipates its energy, it spreads out. So this can be measured. But there are other places where it does not happen so clearly. Especially on Mars, when you look at craters. At the last electric conference we had a wonderful tour of the Mars geology. And the big discrepancy here is that these alluvial fans actually go downhill. So it's the wrong direction. So, there is a problem. This is the edge of the Victoria crater. We would expect these alluvial fans to actually increase as the fluids run down to the bottom of the crater, but that does not happen. There must be another mechanism in place, because it does not account for fluvial creation of these dendritic patterns. Fluvial patterns we know happen. Again, Google Earth. Thank you! So, you can increase your magnification. This is Canyon Lake down in Texas. They had a lake dam breach and you can see what happened to the limestone, the surrounding limestone region. You can then pixelate that and visualize that and do some measurements on it. It's fairly linear, goes straight downhill to the river where it feeds into the river. We know it's a fluvial pattern. In the same way you can do that on the great Mississippi. I'm sorry, this is Mount St. Helens. I'll get to the Mississippi on another slide. The Mount St. Helens eruption happened. The pyroclastic flow flowed down to the lowest region. You can also quantify that, pixelate it and look at the flow of where it occurred. It also  had some side channels here that I forgot to put in. Now we get on to fluvial patterns. This is like Armistad down in Texas. This has been dammed, so this has restricted the flow of the river over the course of time. And what we see, in stark contrast to an existing river flow, is a dendritic pattern occurring. Why does this occur? Because you're changing the base level. The base level is an important fundamental aspect of geology that says water is going to flow to the lowest level. And if there's an erosive layer there, it's going to eventually erode it away and create a new base level. If there is a level there that cannot be eroded away, that will be your base level. So my question is, if this is an existing base level and this is the river, how did these existing dendritic patterns form? If you increase your base level, it's going to fill into what was already there. But those should have already flowed from somewhere else into the base level of the river. So it's kind of like a cat chasing its tail now, and we're trying to figure out how to deconfound these factors. In the same way you can look at the Mississippi flood plain. This is a part of the Mississippi River here, in terrain mode, and you see extensive arrays of dendritic channels, especially in the Ozark region, rolling channels. If you ever driven through Missouri, it's just constant up and down. The problem here is, if these were all fluvial as a result of flooding, they would also have this similar drainage pattern to a base level. But they do not. In the same way if this had a base level, we would see the same dendritic patterns brought about by constant flooding of the Mississippi in the near past, but we don't see that. These dendritic patterns further do not drain to anywhere; they are there on their own. So this begs the question, what brought about these dendritic patterns, and how can we measure them in the differences between them and effluvial patterns? As I mentioned, this concept of base level. Reading through some of the basic textbooks on geology written by Tarbuk. Say if you've taken an introductory geology course Over and over he says, “Running water is the single most important agent sculpting the Earth's land surface.” That is a constant mantra of current geology. And that's to be said, because they have come up with the hypothesis as to how this water erodes, and some models that are validated by experimental research. The major factors include slope, bed, suspended loads, the types of materials, depth, width, physical barriers rainfall. These can all be measured and modeled. This introduces the concept of ”design of experiments.” You have factors which you can control, or at least monitor. And then you have your responses including sedimentation; what's being brought down this slope by rainfall or some sort of flood that gets deposited on this new bedrock layer; the river flow; the flow rate; the erosion rate - how fast the sedimentary layer is deposited in the new area. So all these factors can be measured and you can come up with models. This in particular is from the Department of Agriculture, a general technical report that people can use to measure stream characteristics. And because of these extensive stream characteristics, and also rivers - this applies to rivers as well, but there are not as many classifications, because it's pretty difficult to classify larger systems. But you can see that the larger slopes lead to straighter channels, in a very fundamental sense. Lower slopes lead to what's called meandering and stream capture, so these guys can capture over here and then you can form other circular regions and that happens all the time along the flood plains and also deltas, where the river runs out to its current ocean and base level. So, we have these pictures and we also can study what kind of erosion rates happen with different types of gravel or base material. But again, it all goes back to a certain base level; it all has to eventually flow to the lowest point where it  can get to. So right now 47 plus streams - I think the the classification of rivers is around 30. What  does that do for us for electrical discharges? So now on to discharges simplified in one  slide. So the charge buildup here. We have two plates powered by an electrical source. We have an electric field that builds up across the dielectric - the blue being a dielectric, whether it be solid, liquid  or gas. Eventually it's going to discharge if you get enough charge built up. That's why capacitors eventually break. The charge equilibrates by discharging across the path. The factors: again we go back to the ’design of experiments’ and monitoring what we know in the system. Many things can influence how this discharges your electrode materials; the type of dielectric; the potential of electricity there;  the surface topology of these two electrodes; surface morphology; etc., etc. - small points will increase the local electric field there. Now the response is what you get out when this occurs. Much like a lightning bolt, you get magnetic fields around the current flow. You get a full spectrum of light, anywhere from X-rays to visible light. You get heat, manifested in heating up the local surroundings; and possible nuclear interactions if it's strong enough and you have a pinch effect. That's a very, very simplified version of discharges. But it enables us to measure things in the laboratory so we can monitor our factors, we can measure our responses and build models from them. And because electricity is scalable, we can assume that things scale up. Now a lot of work has been done on fractal analysis of dielectric discharges, because this is very important for the wire and cable industry, for those who make transformers and power supplies. You can see, as early as 1990 to 1984, people have been doing work on the fractal dimensions of dielectric discharges, and fundamentally what they found is that they all possess a certain fractal dimension that's characteristic of the material. This is actually an internet picture of a discharge across a transformer and to the insulator, but these are from the papers that I studied. From Kudo’s paper where he measured the fractal properties of those items. Typically, they were performed in high- voltage discharges across solid plastic or a gaseous medium. So now it's quiz time. Some of you have seen this already, so don't cheat. So I'm going to tell you there are three pictures here that I've pixelated and turned into a binary picture to illustrate the scalability of electricity assuming that the Grand Canyon was formed by an electric discharge - probably not the only thing that was going on. But let's just for the moment assume a certain part of it is. Try to match each letter with the particular  picture. I'll give you a minute here. So we have orders of magnitude scale here: centimeters from a polycarbonate discharge to meters of a discharge on cement, and then kilometers for the canyon. So everyone got their choices? All right. I heard some awe’s. How many people got it. Be proud of yourselves how many people got it right? Just for curiosity. All right. Okay. It's not that easy, when things  are pixelated and you normalize everything. So what you're doing is you're normalizing all of your particular topography, only that which you can see in terms of what was formed by the discharge. And we'll come back to that in just a moment. So you can see here that scalability is an effect. So, I thought about how rivers are formed, how discharges could affect the surface of the earth, and I kind of dug it down to the main effects here. This is called a Cause-Effect (Ishikawa) diagram. We use this a lot to identify problems in industry or whatever we're working with. On the left here is ‘riverbed’. How do they form? Well, we know they're formed somewhat by fluvial events. But they could also be formed by electrical discharges. Ignore the [characterization part] for the moment. Technically, you're not supposed to have characterization tools in with this diagram. But I wanted to share this to run parallel with these. So the fluvial factors - again the factors that influence the fluvial erosion of rivers - include the following. You have age consistency, sufficient rainfall, et cetera. You can read through these: high slopes, low slopes, tectonics, dissolved flow, suspended load, all these factors. And then what I did, is I kind of assigned categories - colored categories - to those that are measurable and testable by what we can do in the lab or in the field. Also red, which is not testable, it fails requirements to be a scientific study. You cannot repeatably measure it. And also historical accounts, because there are a lot of historical accounts of certain electrical plasma discharge phenomena which we now know. So, in terms of the rivers, I don't know if this color is going to show up enough, but  really what I saw (and we can talk about this afterwards if you disagree), but really tectonics and pre-existing geology are the assumptions. They're not testable. But nearly everything for fluvial, existing rivers can be measured, but you can't measure that which has happened in the past. So that automatically eliminates some aspects of this. For electrical discharge, we have a few different items here. Either a large solar outburst, or close-to-earth encounters, with various items. You could probably come up with some other factors here. But for the most part, we now know that there is evidence of current in space. Right? We've talked about that a few times. Even in the popular press, I shouldn't say popular, but academic press, there is measurement of electric current and [large] scale jets coming from galaxies. So it does occur in space. We can now use that as part of our toolbox. To say, electric current is scalable. We know what happens at the galactic scale. ”For one component of this jet we obtain for the first time a determination of galactic-scale electric current and its direction...” This is in the Astrophysics Journal. Okay, so that's encouraging. So from a factor we know that compositional changes can affect how electric discharge occurs. So, you can see that all these things add in to electrical discharge, making it somewhat of a feasible phenomenon. We have some historical sources from the ancients and interplanetary distances being less than they [are] in the present. It could be debated, but I do believe we have some historical accounts of that. But anything that's [stated] without drawing on any references, is inferred. Breakdown of the atmosphere. Thomas Gold and some others have said that you need a magnetic flux of greater than about 20 Gauss to have that discharge occur across the Earth. So it could have happened in the past. Now for characterization. The only things we're missing here, anything that draws on the past geologic time scales and is non-measured (or kind of the present is key to the past). Because we don't know if that riverbed was flowing as fast as it is now. Especially if we can't find a sediment load that it left over. That's an important  aspect. So that's one way we can break down the problem, and trying to visualize it as to what factors are most important. I mentioned measurement methods here. So now we're going to get into what I looked at. A fractal is a self-similar pattern. In other words, it's ”the same from near as they are from far.” Very few things are perfectly self-similar in nature. That means if you increase your magnification all the way, they look the same as you back out. Most of the time they're known as self-affine. In other words, they're  scaled by different amounts in certain directions. That's more the case with riverbeds. But [some] of them are known to be self-similar, and there's some separate tests you can do that I have not done yet. Now it's  interesting in all the research with riverbeds, it's really only confined river networks that exhibit self-affinity, as well as some self-similarity. Regular flowing networks of rivers such as the Mississippi and other large river networks do not exhibit that. So already we're looking at the landform confounding our analysis of this. So the landform is dictating how the river flows. So, we tested the dissimilarity between these measured fractal dimensions of electric discharges on what we know in the lab with landforms that we know on the earth. Taking it back to the picture. Think about the picture. You can think about any picture here that has a hole and then rain or some sort of flow rate moving in. It's going to be  captured. Measuring the fractal analysis of the earth. As I mentioned, Mandelbrot did a little bit of  this in his book. It's a great book; I think a trendsetter. He did a lot of analysis of the coasts and now people are taking that into three dimensions and measuring some aspects of geomorphology. Most recently, I came across a  paper that I think is very powerful in that it studied ‘isolines’ at varying altitudes, and I'll show you what I mean by that in just a moment. So basically, they're taking fractal dimensions at varying altitudes on the whole earth's surface because they have data for that. I'll read you a little bit of this, “The quantitative analysis of natural relief represents an objective form of aiding in the visual interpretation of landscapes, as studies  on coastlines river networks and global topography have shown. Still, an open question is whether a clear relationships between the quantitative properties of landscapes and the dominant geomorphologic processes (rain, wind, water) that originate them can be established. In this contribution, we show that the geometry of topographic isolines is an appropriate observable to help disentangle such a relationship.” Not totally disentangle it, but they're getting there. Really the conclusion though I found is kind of surprising. ”A more detailed inspection points to a relationship between the observed features and the geological processes that shape the planetary surface. We suggest that the erosive action of a solid or viscous phase, the erosion of a flowing liquid phase  or its action through wave breaking, and tectonics, are geological agents which work towards increasing roughness in the landscape. On the other hand, agents causing sediment deposition, formation and pronounced smooth slopes, or erosion through hydrostatic pressure (glacial) caused by large masses of liquid or ice, represent smoothing agents able to decrease the characteristic fractal dimension.” The rougher you are, the higher the fractal dimension. The smoother you are, the lower the fractal dimension. The problem I have with this is that they're referring to water as doing the same thing. That's how I interpret that. So typically what they get on a map is a function of fractal dimension D as you can see that 1.8 from 1.0, and you can see that mountains obviously are the highest fractal dimension. Okay. .....? drawn by the coastlines which are fairly smooth due to wave action and sediments on the layer and then your intercontinental, I guess, sea floors and your trenches, they also were able to resolve. I'll go and draw some conclusions from this with the  next graph. But really a study of isoline. So, basically what they're doing is, they're  measuring a box-counting relationship. So the measurement of your fractal dimension d is a logarithmic relationship with the number of boxes that they can fill into a certain area that's scaled, and the scaling factor being eta. So, on this map of New Jersey, another beautiful region in the Congleton Preserve, you can fill in an area at a thousand meters say, in height. You can fill in that isoline with a certain number of boxes and count them. You then do the same thing with a larger box, larger area for a different isoline. For larger area you'll have a different number of boxes. You can then get a plot. So this  is from Baldassari’s paper which I just showed you. You can see that at different elevations, you have an increasing d-level as you increase your elevation up to about 4,500 meters. That D-level is the slope  of this line, and interestingly, below the sea and right at sea level you have very low fractal dimensions brought about by fluvial erosion. So again, the fractal dimension increases with increasing height, in elevation. I think that says something about the mechanism of how these mountains were formed. So what did I do? In my spare time I took ImageJ, which is a microscopy analysis software, a little bit wordy chart here. I apologize, but I took the fractal dimension by the box counting method, typically between 1.0 and 2.0. The area of each image was between 500 and 1000  miles squared. I was able to get a resolution of about one pixel per 1/25th of a mile. So you may say, okay well, these are three dimensional figures, how can you project them in 2D? In some of the electrical studies they said that this is valid as long as this projection on a 2D plane has D values of 1.7 [or less]. So, the color- coded data sets are from fluvial, which are blue, known electrical events from the laboratorium from literature papers, and then unknown structures from terrain load captures. The image processing you can accomplish fairly readily. It requires a little bit of footwork to get rid of some of the roads and whatnot on Google Earth. You grayscale it, and then you binary it, and you get this binary pattern, which you can then do your analysis on. But furthermore, I skeletonized it because I knew we were dealing with different elevations. So the pattern that this follows can be a validation of about 600 meters from the center of this channel up to the side. A way to kind of normalize your overall patterning and distribute it to only the branched pattern, is to skeletonize that. You can do that with your software. So eventually, what you're getting is only a skeletonized pixelated version of only the pattern. And then you can measure your box counting map method for your fractal dimension. So here's a  picture of Mississippi that I was talking about. Numerous flood plains here, from the pixelated binary you get a D value of 1.3. This is up in Newfoundland. You're getting a value of about 1.7 even just with the standard binary image. A lightning bolt: again we're projecting this onto a 2D which is valid. Again about 1.3 and again this is limited resolution. This is far away. You can't get all the little dendrites that are coming off this. So that's one aspect that I think the electrical analysis is missing. In that we can't resolve all those fine dendrites, except with some of the laboratory  tests that I took. So a little bit of statistics here. You all remember your Students t-test? 95 confidence  interval. I'm confident that this is different than that. What this is doing is, because I have different values of population sets, it's a different kind of Students t-test. So, when I did that with just a straight pixelated version, nothing was different. And with the skeletonized version, some differences did appear, namely when you skeletonize the landforms you don't have that drastic of a drop in D-value, as opposed from your river values. And indeed you get a very big significant difference with that skeletonized value, because you're normalizing all the elevations. And what happens here is the fluvial value decreases to about the same value that Baldassari  found in all the fluvial erosion studies: between 1.0 and 1.2. The unknown structures that I measured on the earth, are equivalent to electrical structures. So, statistically speaking, the unknowns are more statistically dissimilar to fluvial events than they are from electrical events in the laboratory. So, really what that skeletonized value is doing is it's normalizing the depth. Okay. And we can say that these structures are self-defined. These D-values are fairly high, enough to be self-defined. So, really in conclusion the present data set is limited right now to only 33 counts. I'm working on getting more. I think electrical patterns are better matched towards our landforms and the fluvial patterns. But we have to realize that other data includes fluvial erosion, because rivers have been flowing for some time. So, we have to account for that. We have to know the systems that we're measuring very well, to account for the fact that some fluvial erosion may have occurred. So it's consistent with the literature trend. There's a lot to do, there always is. But really, what  effects do such discharges have on an environment? I'm interested in shock-induced changes. That's  something I do all the time. What does that do to rock and what does that do to populations of organisms around that, if it did occur? Does that account for many mysterious losses of populations of ancient cultures? Was that due to temperature? Also radioactive decay that was already mentioned earlier. Some profound implications on geological sciences here that we have to explore more. So again, hopefully the further augmented data set, with more analysis [will give us] a better picture of what's going on. I'd like to acknowledge Michael Steinbacher and Montgomery Childs also for their discussions. I got a copyrighted copy of Google Earth, so we won't get sued. And if anyone wants to contact me, there's my contact information. I'll be happy to take any questions. Thanks. [Music] 
[Music] We recently looked at the new discovery of filament structures that were located in our neighborhood. We also saw that the nearest open star cluster to us revealed an important part of the filament structure of the galaxy spiral  arms. Mainstream science agrees that much of the interstellar medium is not simply filled with  empty space. Instead, they see that it is a hierarchical structure and facilitates the formation of filaments that are governed by the galactic potential on a large scale. We already know that there is a network of hydrogen filaments that is structured mostly parallel to the galactic plane. In 2010, astronomers discovered a highly filamented dark cloud which they called Nessie. They believe that it is one of the first filaments whose morphology is likely governed by the structural dynamics of the galaxy. Because of this, they dubbed this type of filament the bones of the Milky Way as they think that its formation, evolution, and shape could be closely linked to the global spiral arm structure. Within molecular clouds they discovered giant molecular filaments. These seem to have the highest masses, while exhibiting the lowest column densities and star forming activity, making them good candidates to be intermediate descendants of the atomic interstellar medium structures. These  structures are not only associated with spiral arms, but are also located in inter-arm regions. The recently discovered Radcliffe wave is yet another example of filaments in our local neighborhood. Even in their own simulations they found that giant molecular clouds often form as large filaments. Now obviously, they see the formation process a little differently and quote things like “In our simulations the galactic shear between the spiral arms plays a critical role in the formation of highly filamented structures.” Their assumption is also that these giant molecular clouds tend to sustain their large filamentary shape, before entering the spiral arms, where they are prone to being disrupted by local events of star formation and stellar feedback. And yet, we have examples of large filaments that are located in our neighborhood. Peering through our galaxy is not easy, and now astronomers think that they have spotted a massive filament of atomic hydrogen. This is one of the largest structures ever observed in our galaxy. It is  located about 55,000 lightyears away on the other side of the Milky Way. The research is based on data obtained by THOR, an observational program that relies on the Very Large Array in New Mexico. The project studies molecular cloud formation, the conversion of atomic molecular hydrogen, the galaxy's magnetic field, and other questions related to interstellar medium and star formation. The ultimate purpose is to determine how the two most common types of hydrogen gas converge to create dense clouds that give rise to new stars. These two types are atomic hydrogen and molecular hydrogen. The process of how atomic hydrogen transitions to molecular hydrogen, is still largely unknown, which is why finding this huge filament is so important. To put the size into context, the largest known clouds of molecular hydrogen are around 800 lightyears in length. This new cloud which they call Maggie, measures just shy of 4,000 lightyears long and 130 lightyears wide. More interesting is that parts of this filament extend about 1,600 lightyears below the plane of the Milky Way. When they analyze the speed of the material moving in the filament, they determined that it had a mean velocity of 54 kilometers per second. They  were also able to show that the velocities along the filament barely differ. They determined that this filament might be remotely linked to the global spiral arm structure of the Milky Way. They were not able to detect any carbon monoxide emissions or dust in the filament, and there were no signs of new stars forming along the filament. On closer inspection, the team noticed that the gas converges at various points along the filament which led them to conclude that the hydrogen gas accumulates into large clouds at these locations. The Maggie filament discloses a hub-like feature in the East, on which small-scale filaments appear to converge, and a tail that thins out towards the West. The North-Western part shows a connection to the midplane, potentially feeding off hydrogen material located at higher latitudes. So, many of you will not be surprised by these findings, but is there more that we can learn from these observations? An important point to note is that, although these filaments are composed of atomic hydrogen, that doesn't mean that they are not a plasma. Even if only one atom in 10,000 is ionized, it can be considered a plasma. Therefore the motion will be dominated electromagnetically. If we examine the overall structure of the filament and look at the centroid velocity, we can see that this speeds up and slows down. What might cause the velocity to speed up? Around these areas we also see a much higher density of the cloud. This is likely an indi- cation that electromagnetic pinching is occurring. This would tend to compress the material, increasing the density, and also increasing the velocity. In larger, more dense filaments, these are probably the areas where most star formation is taking place. At these points we would also expect Marklund convection to be strongest, creating a greater spread of material around these points, which is what we see to some extent in the images of the filament so far obtained. In Marklund convection, a hydrogen is the outermost ion from the center axis which becomes deionized or recombines with an electron. The diffuse nature of Maggie and  the lack of a CO signal, except on the smaller scale along the axis, suggests that this is a juvenile filament. One important aspect is also that they see the movement of the material in the filament. This once more confirms the idea, that it is the movement of this material in the filaments, which powers the stars that reside in them. [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe brought to you by the Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info The following presentation is an adaptation  of the Mel Acheson Picture Of the Day article, Blindness, Stupidity and Speculation. The link to the article may be found in the description box of this video. Ignorance is not bliss. In discussing the question of progress in scientific revolutions, Kuhn noted “There are losses as well as gains, and scientists tend to be peculiarly blind to the former.” In a footnote, he elaborates, “Because science students ’know the  right answers’, it is particularly difficult to make them analyze an older science in its own terms.” Noting that in his broadest use of paradigm, Kuhn included instrumentation with theory. I would apply his footnote to data. Because scientists know the right procedures, it is particularly difficult to make them attend to evidence outside the sensitivities of their instruments. Chapman refused to look at, or even to discuss Alphén’s experiments that contradicted the ”perfect insulator” theory of space. Modern astronomers refused to look at Arp's display of connections among objects of different redshifts. Now Thomas Gold presents a most clear-cut example of scientific blindness and loss of data in his book The Deep Hot Biosphere. He writes “The invention of the seismograph meant that it was no longer necessary to experience an earthquake directly, or to interview someone who had, in  order to assemble data on the event. Eyewitness reports were no longer believed  to hold any value for the scientific venture.” Gold then proceeds to describe many eyewitness reports from ancient times to modern. A constellation of recurring phenomena becomes apparent: ”Eruptions, flames, noises, odors asphyxiation, fountains of water, and mud” often occur before the quake. Gold concludes on page 147: ”The accumulated observations maintained in folklore and contemplated by the intelligentsia of the time, meant  that the ancients recognized a variety of phenomena that seemed to serve well as warnings of an impending quake. In some ways, folklore is  of more practical value to residents of earthquake-prone regions than is our modern science.” He describes several incidents where people were able to evacuate their villages and towns a few hours before an earthquake because they were alerted by odors, fogs, or unusual animal behavior. Folklore has saved many lives; seismographs and stress meters have yet to achieve one correct prediction- probably because they're measuring only effects, not causes. Gold adduces this evidence, and several chapters more, to support his theory of upwelling primordial gas from deep within the earth. He also mentions the near impossibility of attracting any attention to the theory, or even to the observations that call into question the prevailing assumptions. He writes, ”Thus many scientists seem to have fallen into the rut of the nearest convenient theory. They explore the terrain of this rut very effectively, down to the minutest features within the walls, yet they will not climb out for another look. This fear of “another look” is more than mere scientific blindness. It's a deliberate squeezing shut  of one's intellectual eyes, a rejection of insight, a refusal to learn. It's directly connected to belief, to the assumption that one possesses the only possible right answer, which therefore obviates one’s considering further questions or “other looks.” Ignorance can be overcome with persistence and study. Ignorance, indeed, is the beginning of  learning. But the refusal to learn is stupidity, and for it there is no remedy. Scientists have limited time, as do we all. It's understandable that they should ignore many things not immediately pertinent to their current work.  Sometimes even the pertinent must be ignored. But that's merely “ignore-ance.” The mark of stupidity, and of the belief behind it, is the use of the term “impossible” and the accompanying rejection of speculation. Let us consider Thomas Gold again. He writes, ”The history of science offers example after example of apparently inexplicable features for which perfectly rational explanations were finally found. In nearly all such cases, assumptions that were universally believed obscured the truth so effectively that no progress toward a solution seemed possible.” ”Yet it is to just such apparently inexplicable features that we must hope to find clues that will show us how to un- burden ourselves of false beliefs. ”Speculation is a vital step in this process. It was once speculated that the earth revolved around the sun. Without  this speculation, I do not think that any systematic avenue of research would have produced the evidence that clinched this theory. At a time  when proposed solutions are still speculative, they are  the driving force for the researches that will prove  them right or wrong and will thereby put our thinking  on a new and better track.” [Music] 
In 2013 the SAFIRE project was created. The objective was to replicate the Sun's atmosphere in a laboratory on Earth. A lab was designed and built and at its heart was the SAFIRE plasma engine, the only one of its kind on the planet. Okay we can see you and Colin and you see me in the background talking to you on the cell. Today, four years later the SAFIRE team gives a tour of the lab, via the web to a scientific review panel scattered all over North America. Two things define SAFIRE: a unique premise, and a remarkably powerful methodology. The premise driving the project is the idea that electricity plays an essential role in the functioning of the Sun's atmosphere. The methodology used to build and run the SAFIRE lab comes from the world of engineering and manufacturing. It is a statistical procedure that allows for incredibly precise control over the design and managing of experiments. This combination of premise and methodology has yielded remarkable, if not startling results. In August of 2017 the SAFIRE team presented its most recent discoveries at the Electric Universe conference, ”Future Science” in Phoenix Arizona You were just listening to SAFIRE and that's just the beginning. So, SAFIRE has proven itself to be capable to contain, control and stabilize, high energy dense plasmas. And you're going to see that tonight. We're seeing chemistry changes; we are slowing the speed of light down; we're seeing variations in electron density, comparable to the photosphere-heliosphere; and nuclear bombs. Electrical confinement of high-energy photons. These are just some of the things, and all of these things here, are due to charged plasma affecting matter of a different electrical potential. So, this time I want to take the opportunity, which is usually saved until the end of the presentation, because time is short, to thank the other very key members who are contributing so much the success of this endeavor. So, first of all I like to thank Scott and Bruce Mainwaring for their ongoing and unwavering financial and moral support. Dr. James Ryder for your insight, for an ear to hear, and with help herding the cats; and Dr. Lowell Morgan for your amazing knowledge and insight into the complexities of plasma physics. Wal Thornhill for your work in the Electric Universe model in cosmology, and Dr. Donald Scott for your work in developing a more mature model of the electric Sun. Jan Onderco for your hard work in data acquisition. Leighton McMillan for your hard work and the assistance in building SAFIRE in such a short time. Jason Lickver for your work in mechanical engineering and telemetry. I'd like to thank you Susan Schirott for your untiring help in administration, finance and legal matters, helping to make this project go so much smoother. Tracey Childs for your ongoing financial work and for always being an awesome woman in my life. Ben Ged Low for your work on the team and pulling this presentation together. And none of this would have started without you David Talbott, making that providential call to persuade me to take on this project. So now I would like to introduce part of our team who are joining me tonight to assist in presenting our discoveries. Please welcome Dr. Michael Clarage and Dr. Paul Anderson Research objectives: there's a lot of detail to it but fundamentally SAFIRE stands for: Stellar Atmospheric Function In Regulation; the objective sounds way out, there but basically the contract says we’re to do everything we can to recreate a “Star in a Jar” and test the Electric Universe and test the electric Sun model. So, the technology we're going to use in SAFIRE or have been using in SAFIRE: We have Floating Potential, Plasma Potential, Plasma Density, Ion Current Density, Electron Energy Distribution, Electron Temperature, Mass Spectroscopy, Optical Spectroscopy, Thermal Measurements, Infrared Thermography, Radio Frequency Measurements, Electromagnetic Measurements, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Optical Microscopy, Voltage across the Plasma, Current across the Plasma, Voltage feeding the Plasma Current feeding the Plasma, and Video Capture of the Plasma Phenomena. And we're going to discuss each one of these with you in detail tonight; just kidding. What we will show you however, is how we use this technology to reveal some of the most startling discoveries we made this year instead. Now, Michael you're up. - I'm up; - Let's get started. Optical spectroscopy. So, Jim Ryder said everything we know is from light I'll think about that but almost everything we know about the Sun is definitely from light. And optical spectroscopy is a really good friend, as a scientist. Every element emits very characteristic frequencies; a lot, you could imagine, like every species of bird has its own song, and you would never confuse a chickadee with a seagull, right? So, if you study these elements spectrographically, each one is quite unique, and we can learn a lot about what's going on for those atoms, by things like the relative heights of those spectral lines; the widths of those spectral lines; the shape of those spectral lines. Here's three different discharge regimes in our plasma. On the left, you can see there's the center anode, very bright and then around it is halo, okay. Those are double layers in a halo around that. In the middle panel you can see that the double layer is gone, right? Just the center anode is there and on the right-hand panel we basically just cranked all the dials up to 11 and that got a super high-powered discharge. You can see there, that's our spectrographic probe tip it's a fiber optic that we can move around anywhere we want in the chamber, to study what's going on. And so right there, that fiber-optic tip is looking right into the double layer. Okay it's not looking at the anode, it's looking at the double layer. The next one the double layer is gone so the probe tip is just looking at the general plasma discharge. And then the last one we moved the probe, but it's looking at this super high power discharge. So, we'll just look at one spectrographic line. This is like one note. One note being emitted by the hydrogen, okay. It's the 656 nanometer line, one of the most famous spectrographic lines in the universe. And we can measure the width of that, and inside the double layer we see the width is 0.12 nanometers, okay? That's pretty tiny; these are pretty good instruments we have. We boosted the resolution spectrographically by about a factor of 4 or 5, just recently. So we're getting... it's good right? That's pretty good resolution. Then the double layer goes away. The width of that line, same line, hydrogen emission, the width goes down to 0.07 nanometers and then for the third one, the super-high power one, it jumps back up to 0.09. This made us super excited to be able to see this and measure this. Because one of the reasons these lines can change their shape like this, and get broader and more narrow, is the number of free electrons running around in the plasma and if there's a lot of free electrons running around the plasma, you can kind of picture that they're crashing into hydrogen atoms, and causing extra wobbles on top of the note that's being emitted, that tends to broaden the line more, okay. That may seem like a small change, you know, 0.05 nanometers from 0.12 to 0.07, but that represents like 50 to 100 times change in the free electron density. So double layers have within them about 100 times more free electrons running around than not, okay. This is super exciting that we can measure this. If you just stick in a probe into one place, and you get one measurement, you're not necessarily so sure you can guarantee what you're looking at. But if you can measure changes like this, then you have much more confidence as a scientist, that you're actually observing something that you can talk about. And where do we see comparable changes, you know, in free electron density? Well, we see those changes going from the photosphere to the chromosphere, from the chromosphere to the corona out at the end of the heliopause. So, we're actually getting into the realm where we have changing conditions in our chamber, and the ability to measure them, that are also going on in our star. That summarizes that. Yeah, it’s too early to stop. Do you think it's too early? I think it's too early to stop. I think they're just absorbing right now. So we'll just take a breath and keep going? Sure you can take a breath, I'll keep going. Okay. It’s not always this much fun in the lab. Some more yelling and screaming going on, things like this. So, the next section is where we get into the fun part: statistics, okay. But it's really, really important, because Design Of Experiments (DOE), actually is the mainstay. It's the foundation of the work that we're doing, because in science today there's a lot of stuff that's in question, and we're not going to be subject to those kinds of questions. So we impose what's called Design of Experiments and Dr. Paul Anderson is going to take you through what we've been doing with SAFIRE and I think you're going to be amazed about some of the findings with them, all right. Thank You, Monty. So just as Monty said, we want to investigate some basic plasma physics that is occurring in our chamber. The first thing we did, was in looking at our chamber, was that we wanted to tame the plasma, okay. And I'm going to show you first a video here, of the plasma as we know it now. We can move the cathodes as you can see, we can stabilize double layers, we can change the double layers as a function of distance. At the same time we can also change gas concentration and type of gas in there. It wasn't always that pretty; some of our initial plasmas were pretty dirty, very unstable. If you look at a lot of old plasma literature before they even named it a plasma, they commented on how difficult it was to contain this energy, and understand it. So, these are some of our initial discharges. Lots of impurities on some of the materials that we use for the anode; striking different discharges; a lot of instabilities in the plasma. And what we wanted, we eventually wanted it to look like this. Right? This is a very simple plasma, which entails a simple anode on the left, and a cathode on right, and this is basically a 1D plasma where you're striking a discharge between these two electrodes. You can adjust the gas pressure, the gas type in this, as well as the voltage in this system. Fairly straightforward. This is a top view of SAFIRE; it's not as straightforward as the plasma tube. This is looking down on SAFIRE from Monty's model here, and as Monty listed previously, all the instruments that we have, we have them there for a reason, and every single run we use all the control instrumentation for the chamber as well as driving all the detection that Monty mentioned. So there's a number of detectors on here as well as the fundamental control of the chamber. So, through a lot of data acquisition and controlling, we're able to now control that plasma chamber and carry out experiments. So, one of the first things we had to confront is how to drive it and understanding the gas input like this is just one aspect of the gas input here. This is the gas and vacuum control system. We also had to understand our SOPs, to implement safety procedures when you're working with 2,000 liters of hydrogen at high temperature, right? So, we had a number of things to control, in addition to wanting to control the plasma. So, we looked in a literature and we talked about it and we said okay, well learning to drive this, let's concentrate on plasma experiments that are well documented and that's why we came up with Paschen’s law. We decided to choose Paschen’s law to understand the plasma ignition in the SAFIRE apparatus. So, Paschen’s law describes a point of current flow at a particular electric potential through an ionizable gas, or gas between two electrodes, okay. So, fundamentally we have two electrodes, positive and negative; you have a gas, you have a certain pressure of that gas, usually conducted under vacuum, and you have a distance between those electrodes and you strike a voltage and there's no current flow initially, until you get to a certain point where that voltage can overcome ionized gas and conduct a current. Now, when that occurs, (there) is a certain voltage. Okay, so we decided to do that in SAFIRE. So, this is a classic Paschen curve in hydrogen. The other gases also have other curves that are very similar. They exhibit the same minimum; so if you notice here in the graph, or X-axis here, being a term of PD, pressure and distance. Notice it's in a logarithmic scale. So, it's a reduced variable, you have both pressure and distance in one axis. In our Y-axis, we have our voltage that we strike to obtain a discharge. So, if you go ahead and do a bunch of plots at different pressures at different distances, you'll end up falling on a curve like this for your electrodes. So, what we did in SAFIRE we went ahead and did a SAFIRE apparatus with a spherical anode and our two cathodes at various distances, equidistant. As much as we wanted to vary both of them, we kept them constant. And we discovered already SAFIRE is acting very differently than a typical plasma discharge apparatus. We had to use a modified version of Paschen's curve which you see there, of the law, and we also found that the gamma term which is in that lower denominator, in the denominator, that did adjust with different distances, and so that's something new that we're exploring, and we hope to get a publication out of this. So you'll notice that already we have a departure from regular plasma physics in a regular anode-cathode discharge; say a discharge tube. Another reason why we did this is, okay we ignited the plasma, but what is the morphology of the plasma, what does it look like at these various settings? So it's kind of an experiment with killing two birds with one stone, in that we determine the ignition characteristics, which we needed to control the plasma, and we also explored the morphology of the plasma. So, that was a very powerful thing: we were able to pursue some various regimes and then establish our Design Of Experiments. So, we discovered that the configuration is a significant departure from typical plasma apparatus, that you may have from its typical anode and cathode. So then we went into the Design Of Experiments. We decided on where we're going to look, what kind of plasma regimes we want, because ultimately we want to dial in stability for experiments. There's no use in doing experiments for double layers if they appear for one microsecond and then go away. We wanted them nice and stable. Now to obtain stability in any system, whether it's in SAFIRE or whether it's in your kitchen, baking bread we, need reproducible results. But that only comes from understanding your factors; factor is another word for variable. So, to understand those factors and variables, you need more experiments, right? Traditionally this is called the Edisonian approach: you have more factors, you do more experiments, you get more data. The problem with that is, that just because you do more experiments, you might not be increasing the resolution. In other words, the signal-to-noise. The signal-to-noise that you're looking for; you need to increase that signal from the noise, so you get reproducible results, and you know you're stable. And what Design Of Experiments does, it's a methodology. It increases the resolution, but also it decreases the number of experiments you have to do. So, I urge many of you who are experimentalists, or who are curious, to look up Design Of Experiments and to learn the techniques. Because it is extremely valuable in both saving time and resources and it greatly increases your resolution. Now, again I won't go into why that is. I discuss a little bit of it in my past presentation and you can read about it online, but basically what you're doing is, you're conducting experiments where you're making sure your points are orthogonal. So, in other words two factors are always opposite each other; you're making things symmetric in your design space. Just an example of what that does for you: on the on the right column here, you can see the efficiency. That's a measure of the experimental variance. You can actually calculate the variance in your experiment, prior to even doing experiments with your design. Now OFAT is stands for One Factor At a Time. That's how traditional experimentation is done; that's how the Edisonian approach is done. And so, you can see here, it's comparison between a traditional number of runs, where you're kind of a shotgun approach to experimentation, and what's called a full factorial DOE. There are many types of DOE’s out there, but this is just the most basic taught DOE. You can see that just with three factors, right? say pressure, type of gas, and distance of the cathodes, right? that's three factors, three variables with the number of runs for OFAT you need 16 runs, that gives you a certain experimental variance, or efficiency, of 2. But you're half that number of runs with your full factorial DOE. And as you get upwards, now you say, wow 128 runs, that's still a lot of runs. But as I said, there are other DOE formulations that you can pursue to help with this, to help decrease that number more and still maintain that experimental efficiency, without having to do 512 experiments. So, in a nutshell that's really what DOE is. We explored this first in phase 1; this is our phase 1 setup. Very simple; we had an anode in a bell jar surrounded by a cathode; we had a voltmeter did add some other instrumentation crammed in there. But for the purposes of this, this was a just a snapshot of one of the bell jar experiments with a small anode. And really what we determined through Design Of Experiments is these various regimes that the plasma goes through. So, we were already kind of dialing in the anode, even in a small bell jar, so logic would assume we could do that when we scale up as well. And actually it does, when you use the right approach, when you use Designs Of Experiments. So, we're really happy with our various regimes. This is a snapshot of, I would say, the main regimes we work with. That's not to say that there aren't others in between there. So, I'll just go through here a little bit and show you close up. I call this a dark quiescent phase; this is right on the edge, very small changes here, this is not stable. Very small changes in either voltage or current, can lead to this extinguishing. But there is still a plasma layer around the edge of the anode. Now as we increase our current, we obtain what we call ”tufts” These are anode tufts. These have been experimentally seen before, but we can now control them, we can control the number, the concentration in a square area, and they're always equidistant from each other. As you increase the energy, and as you increase the current in the system, they start to grow in size and also squeeze together, until you reach a point where they actually start to coalesce. And this is what we refer to as moving tufts. This can also be adjusted in terms of pressure and current. So, as these things start to move, they actually spin more, and eventually what comes into being is this double layer phase, multiple double layers, that are controlled by current and gas pressure. So this was probably the most double layers we obtained, I would say, with a three inch anode. This is a 3-inch anode. This is a 3-inch anode so those tufts, I think we reached up to about 7 or 8 tufts at least in the Design Of Experiments that we got. Monty: “Yeah they're big”, and they're stable and also we have quiescent phase: this looks familiar, doesn't it? We even got some holes in that, arising from something, we don't know. And that layer is fairly significant. It stands off the surface of the anode, and we also have these asymmetric double layers that occur over time. Time is also a factor, but we weren't able to quantify it yet because what happens over time, is your anode heats up. Thermionic emission happens, it changes the properties so that's the one factor that we have to dial in a little bit more. As we don't understand the effect of time on this anode yet, but we know it affects it. And also the Zeppelin high-intensity, kind of let it loose phase. So, those are stable regimes, all right, so to dial in the plasma, also we want to work with different anodes, different size anodes. The top is a 1.5 cm [errata: inches, see 26:16] anode, the bottom is a 3-inch anode. You'll notice that we're obtaining the same regimes; a little bit different shapes, but for the most part we're getting the same numbers, and at proportionally the same current. And what do I mean by proportionately? Well, when you're impinging a 1.5-inch anode compared to a 3-inch anode, the current density is a lot higher on that, right? So, we had to adjust our current density properly to obtain the same response. So, that's what we did in this experiment, and these are just some numbers. If you want to have fun with the numbers, we're calculating that we're getting about 85 W/cm2 in the top discharge, but you can see in the bottom one, where we throw in 22 Amps, we're getting a little bit less wattage there with the calculation, but within error you're almost there. So we're tracking very well with scalability of the plasma between different sizes and as you can see, the current is the main driver, that's what has to be adjusted. Now you say here, I may say indications of a transformer. Well that's only in a way. That's why we have it in quotes right? Transformer. So, as double layers form, plasma resistance decreases and current flow is less impeded. Michael alluded to that earlier: electrons are more intense or more concentrated in these double layers. Why is that? We want to study some more. But now is where we get into our statistics. What you see on the graph is an actual by predicted plot. This is what comes out of Design Of Experiments, okay? It may just look like a straight line to you, but this is very powerful, because what it enables you to do is to predict things, okay? So, the top graph here has, as you can see on the Y-axis or the vertical axis (thank you), on a vertical axis you have voltage actuals. So that's the voltage we actually measure and what do you see here? voltage predicted. So, when you read papers scientific papers, or any kind of reports that have prediction values, that's what they're referring to. They're building a model and they're seeing how well the model can predict the voltage, or whatever response they're studying. So, we can look here that the equation of the line is pretty darn good, considering the fact that we're working with a plasma, okay? it's R-Square value is about 0.92. You look at the error, it's only plus or minus 10 Volts in that prediction. We had a number of responses, or a number of observations in this set of experiments, 31 experiments. So, we have sufficient degrees of freedom, when we're only looking at three or four factors, to determine which of the factors do what. We want to know, is pressure a factor, is the number of double layers a factor, current, right? And that's what this is, so you can see here the green circle. The parameter estimates are what you'd back out of statistics. That tells you the most important factor in your model, and what is this telling us? It’s telling us the pressure is actually a pretty darn important thing in this Design Of Experiments. So, your pressure is leading those significant changes in your voltage. Kind of makes sense, right? Followed by your number of double layers. Now double layers, and we're struggling with this right now, double layers can either be a response or it can also affect the system. Just like V = IR, the typical Ohm's law V = IR what is your response and what is your factor? It depends on how you set up your measurements, and it depends on what you're measuring. So, our current though, is also an important factor, as you can see there: parameter estimate of about 10, but you see these other things down here. The pressure is multiplied by the number of double layers and the number of double layers is multiplied by current. These are what's known as second-order interactions, higher-order interactions right here. And what that means is that they also have an effect and they're needed to explain the model. They're significant enough to be needed to explain the model. Actually I left this last one in here; you see that 0.14 p value p-value is a measure of statistic. That one is below 0.05, that means that that parameter is significant, it's real in a model. You should definitely include it so that one's 0.15-ish and so that's not a significant factor. I just left that in there, just so you could see, but all the other ones are significant, they're below 0.05. So, pressure exerts the largest effect, followed by double layers and the second-order interactions decrease that voltage response. Again, what happens, what can we do now with that? That's just a bunch of numbers. How do we visualize what happens in a dynamic system? And that's where modern software and modern computers come in, because they enable us to do these Designs Of Experiments. So, as we create double layers, what you see here on this graph, you have three factors which are your X-axis which you can vary now. We have a model that's about 92% accurate, and we also have a voltage, our predictive voltage in our system. So as we change these factors we can observe what happens through the voltage, so if you keep your eyes on the number of double layers I'm going to increase the number of double layers here. Now what happens to the other curves? There's slope changes right? I'm going back and forth here. So, if the slope changes, that means that there's a second-order interaction. There's a higher-order interaction between all these factors. What it also means is that this model says, that if we change our current, or our pressure, does the voltage change? No, it doesn't according to the model. Now one statistician said “all models are wrong, but some are useful”. So, that's where we're at right now. But you can also see something else. You can see the unfortunate area here that says, hey you've got to do more experiments there. That's a confidence interval, it doesn't have enough data to give you a smaller confidence interval. So this curve could actually come down a little bit as long as it’s within the confidence interval. But that's the power of Design Of Experiments: you wouldn't be able to plot this out if you were to do one factor at a time in a shotgun approach. So again, I changed another factor here. I decrease the current so you can see the spread in the confidence interval across all these guys here. So we have a little bit more work to do. That's the end of a kind of plasma, physics, stability and spectroscopy. I don't know; you feel like keep it going, or you want a question and answer session for a little bit? Okay, let's move on. Monty: Let's move on, well, predictions in thermodynamics, like Paul was saying, what did you say about models? All models are wrong, some are useful. Yeah, all models are wrong, some are useful. I stood up here two years ago, we spent a lot of money developing and designing SAFIRE, predicting the kind of thermal responses we get out of this. Because we knew we had a lot of energy, of 180 kilowatts. That’s what the design was predicting at the time, and the thermodynamics model is based on what's called total heat flux. You heat up the core, okay? And I'll show you a picture of that. Well the thermal response is 120 degrees Celsius, but basically we heat up the core and we put an certain amount of energy in there that heats up the gas and other things are starting to respond, but the final response, based on the design, is a 110 degree chamber temperature, and the temperature in and around the core here... I think I can do this, there it is..... would be about 2500 degrees Celsius. And this also is telling you how fast the gas is moving. It's moving quite slowly, and that's what we were predicting. Now the people who are working on this, would be guys like Dr. Lowell Morgan, Tommy Mello who actually develops the coding for what's called computational fluid dynamics. This is really high-end stuff, it's stuff that we use to develop to do analysis on, rocket engines and jet engines, and so many other things. And we're very good at what we do. This is how we kind of make a living. However you're going to find out that our predictions were wrong. So, we did another model and this here, what you're going to look at here, right in this area here, this is our analysis of putting in one of our probes and see what the kind of thermal response that we get, and what the model is telling us is that the temperatures of the gas, just off and around the surface of the anode, should be around 2,300 to 2,500 degrees Celsius: well within the constraints or you might say the operating limits of tungsten, which is what the tips are made of, our Langmuir probe tips. But what really happened, and you want to watch this video. Show you here, what you're looking at here is the probe tip and we're going to play this video and this is a very low-power plasma [Laughter] So, where you say, “now you see it, and now you don't.” Langmuir probes are about 8,000 bucks a pop, and I had to make a telephone call because we pull it out. Before I get into that, I just want to let you know the actual power at that time was 182 Watts, that's a 182 Watt light bulb imagine, okay? and we're going like, what is going on. So when we opened up SAFIRE, we discovered what was left, and this is what the tip looked like after it vaporized. This is just the residual tungsten you see here, on that kind of nodule. That's what was left of it, and everyone who knows anything about tungsten, it takes about 6,600º C to boil it. To vaporize it, you need more energy, and in thermodynamics, some of you probably already know, there's a time domain associated with it. How much heat is lost in the system as well. So, it's not just 6,600 degrees; if you're gonna vaporize it that quick, it would typically point to temperatures that are much higher than that, not the 2,300 degrees we predicted, because you know the tungsten should have heated up, might have started glowing a little bit, but it should have lived in there. Well, obviously it didn't, and this is what a tip looks like at the top, before and after. Now, the white stuff is alumina and its melting temperature is about 3,600 degrees Celsius. So, I made a call. Actually, I should back up a little bit here because I got a story to tell you. I called a company, a great company. I'm not going to mention who it is. We had gone into great detail with them, as to what kind of process we were going to get. And they said, “We have the probe for you.” And so we bought two of the probes and we put the one in and I showed him, he talked to me and I said, “this is what happened” we showed them what was left of the probe tip and he came back and said, “Your plasma is too hot”. I said, ”Really, you think”? I said, ”You guys knew and understood the plasma we have, and we went over this with you guys in detail” and I'm thinking, “What am I going to tell Scott?” Then these guys say, “Let me know when you like to buy a new one”. So, I called Scott and I told him, ”We just vaporized a Langmuir probe and we did it with only 182 Watts, and we don't understand what's going on in SAFIRE; it shouldn't have done this.” And Scott says, ”Wow, you know what that means?” I’m thinking, I just lost my job. ”Yeah it means that our thermodynamic modeling is wrong.” I'm thinking “I'm out of my job”, and he says, “Well, yes, maybe, but what's amazing, it means that you have a lot of energy impinging on the probe tip. You might have an effective way of boiling water” and the he said, in his deep voice “Do it again”. I'm going nuts: the (probe) guy just said, my plasma is too hot. The boss is saying, do it again and I'm thinking I'm gonna have to spend another $8,000 on probes. These things like eight thousand, I said eight thousand bucks a pop, we got to get control over this thing. Because otherwise you know we're going to burn through money pretty quick, so we decide to make a new one. Bigger, stronger. I'll put higher pressure nitrogen into the core and cool the core and make all of it ceramic to withstand the temperatures. That's going to work, so that's it. That's the new and improved Langmuir probe, much bigger, thicker tip we figured that, since the plasma is so intense, we don't have to worry about the small wire. We'll put something in thicker and even get some measurements. What really happened... again. So, I'm going to play a video here, and this is where we got some serious questions and Lowell got involved. Just watch what happens here: this is a macro lens. Everything looks wonderful and good; we're happy. Adiós! Yes, that’s what we said. Well, we’ve lived so far; that's good, let's just keep it going.... The motion I can see in the probe, is from the forces that are in the plasma and then it really did some amazing stuff. So, we were happy, it actually survived but the thermionic emissions which we're going to get into, that's what you call thermionic emission. That's not, you might say, the plasma; the plasma has gone out by now, so this is just a radiation. This is like when you light a tungsten light bulb. This is what you get, so the radiation here just grows immensely. We don't know right now why the color changes, we know that we're obviously getting other emissions in here, probably from the tungsten, and this is happening in like nanoseconds. So we go from this beautiful violet color to these colors; we don't know what this stuff is that's flying around in there. We think it could be copper and/or iron or whatever. We were able to capture some of these images, but we would have to say that the atmosphere in SAFIRE is somewhat hostile. What was interesting is the crater on the side of the anode. So, we decided, well you know what, let's take a closer look at this thing, because we were still getting information back from the tip, which is good news and so this is what tungsten looks like after it's been machined with diamonds. It has a kind of a sintered look to it, a powdery look, and this is what the tip looked like after we pulled it out of the chamber. So, we're seeing some cracking within the alumina a little bit; we weren't too concerned. The bright blue color was kind of interesting, but we had a closer look at the tip, and we were seeing the grinding marks from the diamond wheel. We didn't see any physical deterioration of the tip, and that was just great news for us. And we thought, okay we've got something that looks like it's going to survive; and we took a look at the alumina and it looks like it will start to melt, so we knew that the temperature was around 3,600 degrees, maybe a little hotter, but still in good shape. And then what I did, is I just took my pliers and we changed the probe up; we just retained and I put my pliers and pull it out, and it crumbled. If you know anything about tungsten it doesn't normally just crumble and I thought well we you know we've got a bit of a problem here so I put it under the microscope. I looked at it and I said that doesn't look like tungsten; comparatively to the two, there's been a huge change in its structure, but not on the outside. The surface on the outside just looked like it was when we put it in. So, we started taking a closer look at this and it was like, what is all this white stuff. And you can see the fracture in the tungsten is very sharp; it's very clean; it's not like we've bent it or anything, it just broke. So, we decided and this one Paul got involved; he says, listen I know some guys on the University of Toronto; let's get this thing and get some scanning electron microscopy done. So, we did and I'm going over the material in the tungsten. If you know anything about materials, what you're looking at here, well the black stuff, could be contamination, but the kind of geometrical shapes that you see there, above that other stuff that looks like shale, is tungsten. It looks like it was getting melted. That shale isn't how it normally looks, but this is on the inside of the tip. On the outside of the tip it wasn't being affected at all. Not at all. When we did the scanning, when we did the SEM, it was coming back it was tungsten. the molecular structure, the crystalline structure, looked just like it should. We looked inside and this is what we found, and we found a lot more. So, we took a look at the anode, that big crater that was left on the side. There's some interesting stuff. It was kind of like, okay there's an intense plasma discharge kind of steel material. So, we thought okay, this is kind of like, you know, it's really cool artwork. We didn't see anything that was kind of, you know, too outrageous. We saw this area here and I thought, well let's take a closer look. I don't know why, I just picked a spot, and I thought what the heck is that nodule at center of the top of that mountain that's in the crater here? And this is what the scanning electron microscopy showed up. Now, if you know anything about this, when you have really bright spots in SEM, it usually means you have really heavy materials in there, heavy elements, and they start to emit. So, now I'm going to head back to Paul, and he's going to go through SEM and tell you what we found. Thank you, Monty. So, scanning electron microscopy. There's also an additional technique on here: energy dispersive spectroscopy and what I'll do is I'll show you a quick slide on where that energy dispersive spectroscopy comes in. I should have had a slide on the scanning electron microscope as well, but if you picture just a regular optical microscope that you can find. You look through the top and it goes through a series of lenses; the light comes up from the bottom, through your sample and you can see it. And really the way SEM works, is that you replace your eye with an electron source, an electron gun that gets shot through a series of magnetic lenses, which then hits your sample, which is mounted and again this happens in a vacuum, and then a detector is off to the side to detect the electrons I bounce off your sample. So, not only do you get a secondary electron image if you will, an emitted image, but you also get other stuff coming off of that as well. So, if you have the right detectors in your electron microscope, you can detect other things. And in this case, energy dispersive microscopy, is where the beam hits the material and more of the inner core electrons get excited, and then relax back and emit the X-rays. So, you see these characteristic X-rays, it’s just a depiction of an atom, that electron gets excited, gets bumped off and then relaxes down and emits that characteristic X-ray. So, each element has a fingerprint, much like spectroscopy that Michael was speaking about. It's another technique to look at elemental quantities in materials in an electron microscope. So, clean iron: this is just the iron anode. We're going to look at both the iron anode, as well as the tungsten tip here. So, what do you get from clean iron? You get a slide here; this is the probe tip. You can adjust that to be a line graph, or an area; you can integrate over an area. In this case, we were just looking to see what was there, so we did the probe tip. And you can see that the composition, the oxygen comes from surface oxygen absorbed on it. You have your silicon and manganese as well, which are impurities in your iron, but mostly iron. You can see there: almost 98% iron. And you get that from these characteristic X-ray energies. These energies are in Kilo Electron Volts, and again each atom, each element has a characteristic series of frequencies that it will emit at certain electron impingement energy levels. So, another clean iron spectrum. We did a series of these, just to look, kind of get a feel for the average here. In this case, there's a lot of oxygen on this one, which is not too surprising. Sometimes you get lots of oxygen. So, going back to Monty's original optical spectroscope: here you can see this nodule; and the secondary electron image here, you can see this lighting up. It can either be heavier, it can also be something that doesn't conduct electrons very well; so it brightens a lot. It can emit electrons; it charges. So what Monty did actually, Monty did all this microscopy here. He put the probe actually on that nodule first. And what did we see? We see some of these other elements here, namely aluminum and oxygen, a lot more oxygen, so that's kind of in line with aluminum oxide. It could be something from the probe. It could be something, some dust particle from the probe that's embedded in there. But there's also these other amounts in there. We saw manganese before. There’s titanium, there's also cerium. Cerium might be an impurity from that probe housing. But then, when you increase your magnification and you go look at the morphology of the crater around this material, it gets a little bit unusual, in that we are finding barium, significant amounts of barium. We also saw the other materials as well, that you would associate with the alumina from the probe tip, but it's also dispersed in that crater. But, nonetheless a lot of elements there that weren't originally there. Now, in the same way we can look at the tungsten probe tip and we look at the clean probe tip: the aluminum, the silicon, probably from the housing, right? It’s got alumina around the actual metal. We also detect sodium and potassium. I put in a question mark, because that could come from contamination; it could come from whatever the preparation was. And then we have ytterbium (Yb). That was also a shoulder peak on a few of these. So, it might be peak overlap, or it could be real; we need higher resolution. Then we start to see some other elements here, such as cobalt, tin. Copper is probably from the cathode, but this is the inside of the tungsten probe. So, it could be contamination, or it could be there from other mechanisms. We don't know, we got to do more experiments. Electron microscopy is very selective: I spent many years doing electron microscopy and you can find anything you want in your sample, to make your professors happy. Not that I did that, but I was very careful, because that's exactly what they taught me. They taught me, listen you don't just take a few pictures, you got to take a lot. You got to go through it, so that you're representing your sample honestly. And that's something that we did: we looked at a lot of parts of this. We still need to do more experiments; one set of experiments is never enough, especially when you're doing elemental analysis. So, obviously, we need some more verification and we got to think of where these impurities could come from. But looking back at this micrograph you see that this area here is sintered. And as a reminder, like Monty said, the melting point of tungsten is around 3,600º C - well, melting really. Boiling is 6,600 right, yeah. Now, our anode was only at 1,000 C. So, we have some temperature disparities here. We also have sintering of the material; we have stress fractures here, along the grain boundaries and we have this weird sintered kind of explosion from the inside of the matrix. So, again: impurities maybe? Calcium, aluminum could arise from alumina materials. As far as we know there is no barium, cerium, titanium in the chamber. You look at all the materials that go in; the next step is looking at the processing of the materials we use. Maybe there are impurities in the processing of materials that we use. Highly likely not, because a lot of these materials are very pure. So we know what’s in the chamber, we know there are impurities. What we see in this analysis, we see something that is not accounted for. Now I'll go out on a limb here, I mean there's a lot of data out there, and take it for face value in the Low Energy Nuclear Reaction (LENR) community that has done a number of studies on transmutation. A lot of the craters that they observe and that they see transmutation occurring in, have the same kind of characteristics. They actually come out from the lattice of the material. Now they work a lot with palladium and platinum and noble metals that are highly loaded with hydrogen. So, they load these things up with hydrogen and then they observe these reactions that occur over time, and they're very minute. Very small changes in the overall concentration of materials. Nonetheless they are real, because they can pinpoint these craters, they can analyze the materials they’re in, and they see these changes happening. So, these are just a few select papers, recent ones that came out with some transmutation reports. Commercial enterprises have repeated this as well. Mitsubishi, and recently Toyota replicated Mitsubishi studies here with some of their R&D investment, seeing that there's transmutation in certain complexes. So, validation of results. As I said, one data set isn't enough, especially when you're dealing with certain kinds of reactions. At the University of Toronto I am going to follow up, using laser ablation-inductively coupled mass spectrometry. So, that's pretty much the SEM. But now instead of just doing a probe and looking at the X-ray energies coming off you're actually going to laser ablate, or laser vaporize materials that are in certain areas that you highlight, that is then analyzed with a mass spectrometer, a very accurate mass spectrometer. So, this is a technique that the Toyota folks used to validate Mitsubishi's results and will hopefully eventually return, and do augmented studies on, not only the anode but possibly other parts of the reactor. We're about to pause now again, if we want. Yeah, go ahead, yeah, sure, you need the microphone, you need the microphone. “We know that in the Sun will happen, in the nuclear reaction that happen is, hydrogen the main fuel in the top, and reach a million degrees in the solar corona. So, what do you aim, what temperature do you aim to reach in the container. What kind of container? Is it going to be a magnetic container, like the one that they use, or are trying to use now? We were actually going to talk about that, because the temperatures that we're seeing right now, there are two responses. And why I was talking about the thermodynamics, is because right now, standard thermodynamics cannot answer for why we're getting some of these, for what you would see, for what we call, “thermal responses”. So, think of your microwave at home. In fact, the energy you are putting in there isn’t thermal, like a convection oven, but you can still heat up materials that are in there. So, the kind of energies that we're going to be getting into, we're going to be talking about this very shortly, would be analogous to that kind of thing. So temperature,... ... that's a whole discussion and we can get into what temperature is in the context of plasma physics, which isn't, you might say, standard, thermal or black body radiation kind of responses that you got. So, the temperatures that we're seeing here, would be looks like (they are) orders of magnitude beyond what we predicted, in layman's terms. But in real terms it's not a thermal temperature in that context. We're going to be getting into this. Okay, another question? Well presumably, you were going to use your probe to test different things, but then your probe got destroyed. Does that mean you've been kind of sidetracked into to figuring out what's going on to the probe, before you get on to what you're going to use the probe for? Well, obviously, you have to look at the failure mode to determine what it is you're going to be doing next. And we're already looking at that, so we take a look at the actual time component that it took in order for this to happen. So, the amount of time it took for the probe to see this much damage, is about 15-20 seconds, which if anybody who knows anything about TIG (Tungsten Inert Gas) welding, that's not a very long time, because normally some of the arcs that you get in TIG welders, and this is type of tungsten we're using, you could weld for half an hour, or maybe even an hour, before you have to take the tip out and grind it. But we weren't seeing any deterioration on the tip. This is internal. We got big questions here; this shouldn't be happening in that context. So, those temperatures, in some of the TIG welding, the arc itself can reach 19,000 degrees. So, [we could be seeing], the responses that we're getting here are an indication of much higher temperatures. So now, what does that mean? Well, we did get the tip and in we did get it out. And it was in one piece, and we were still getting data. So, what we have to do now, is come up with a way to get a controller that, as we move it down through those double layers, and back out again, we can collect the data and bias the probe quickly, we are talking milliseconds, and grab that data and get the heck out of Dodge before she gets smoked. Okay, that's what we have to do, and that's not going to be easy, because you get into floating potentials, and other types of technologies, which to do that, there’s going to be some challenges. One more? Yeah, okay maybe one more. It might be a quick question, may not be long one. It's really quick. As a control, did you look at the probe by SEM before? I know you looked after, but did you look before? Yeah, we have one shot of the probe tip in there; the standard tungsten, like I showed. No, I see tungsten; we didn't show the graph, but we did do it. Yeah, we use different types of tungsten you can get, with thorium and a bunch of other types of elements that are in there. Though this was just a pure tungsten tip. So, I mean 99.5% or 99.9% tungsten. Okay, let's move on. So, now we're going to get into the measurement of the plasma and double layers. Data that we were able to get from the probes once we got them to a place we could use them. So, we found quite by accident what appeared to be a small voltage drop, just off the surface of the anode and according to our research objectives, we were supposed to find. But it wasn't much at all. We saw initially about a 30 Volt drop, just off the surface, but it got us to thinking that maybe the probe tip is just too long. And so, these are the double layers, and this is not scaled properly, but just to show you how it works. So the tungsten tip that you see there, between the two red marks, is the length of the tip that's exposed to the plasma. And that's actually what picks up the electrical characteristics of the plasma that's measuring it. So, as you can see right here between the two red lines there's a few double layers that are in there. And what happens in effect is that, because the tip is long and it's measuring a few double layers, we think what we get is more of an average of what the voltage is. It's measuring across those. So, we decided well let's just shorten it down. And so, we did, and when we did, basically, this is what we saw: and the voltage drop here was almost 300 Volts. It was 270 Volts, I think or something wasn't it? And the distance was 0.03 millimeters. It's really thin, okay? But it's a very powerful double layer. So, we've done the test a number of times and we validated this particular measurement; this sharp voltage drop. The actual curve coming off of the back, can vary a little bit, but the sharp voltage drop that you see here, is typical of all the plots we're seeing in SAFIRE. So, we can confidently say today, in fact there is a sharp voltage drop that Dr. Donald Scott predicted and that is in fact what we're seeing here. And it's pretty big. So, with that, this is where Michael is going to take over, because he was doing some analysis on this and this is getting into his area of expertise. You get all the fun stuff. I do. So, we can look at global properties of the plasma, the discharge, electrical properties, or we can also look at properties at a particular point in the plasma. So, what Monty just talked through with the Langmuir probe, that's because we're trying to get measurements at particular points in the plasma. But it's also worthwhile knowing and analyzing what's going on with a discharge as a whole. So, here's plots of current and voltage across the whole discharge and you can see in the bottom some pictures of what's going on in the chamber at that point. So, at Point A, we have a pretty quiet discharge, with a few anode tufts on there. Then we crank up the current. What happens? The plasma responds by increasing the voltage drop across the plasma, and by creating a lot more of those little tufts, and actually eventually sending them into motion. Then at point B you can see that red line shoot up again. That's because we cranked the current knob; so, we pushed more current through the plasma. And in response, you can see the voltage goes up again across the plasma, and we create a lot of double layers; six or seven double layers there. That wiggle in the blue line, we don't know what that is yet. That's not our power supply, so to be looked at later; and I'm not actually going to talk much about what happened at the end there. We had a big release of energy, but I can't talk much about what was going on there. Okay, then you can also look at the resistance across the chamber and the power consumed by, or transformed by the discharge. So, the green Line is the resistance across the whole discharge, and the black line is the power consumed or transformed and it's those same regimes, same A, B, C and D. So, the first thing that happened, when you created all the little tufts: that green Line drops way down. That's the resistance of the plasma. It goes way down, when those tufts are created and there's that initial increase in the power consumed. Then, at point B they've cranked the current more, the resistance goes down even more, as we're creating double layers and the power consumption goes way up. So, the plasma is responding to how we're pushing it and one of the ways, and we can repeat again and we need to study more, is it responds in ways to lower its resistance and greatly increase the amount of power it can transform. We designed SAFIRE to be able to vary voltage and current independently. This particular run, we were just varying the current, but no one knows yet, in a cosmological setting, what the driver is. Whether voltage primarily drives things, or current drives things, or some combination of them. So, we have built in the flexibility to control them independently. And this may seem like basic research, but it is, and it's so needed because, even though we know double layers are everywhere, they're over our heads right now, they're in the magnetosphere, they're in solar flares etc., there's not that much known about how to write down the circuit diagram for double layers in astronomy. There is almost nothing known about that. So, this research that we're doing here is entirely done largely to help give direction to future astrophysicists, so they know what to look for in magnetospheres and solar flares etc. and how to interpret what they're seeing in terms of electrical circuitry. This is absolutely fundamental, what we're doing. So, let's switch then to the point measurements, okay, so now we're not talking about the global plasma, we're talking about that point where the Langmuir probe is. And we go up close, the left-hand side is close to the anode. The anode actually starts at the number 1, not at zero, the surface of the anode, and then we move out to the right and we go out basically to the end of the chamber. The red X's are the floating potential, with our new probe. That means you stick a probe in there, it's going to raise up to a certain electrical potential on its own, just from being inserted in the plasma. We measure that, we move it out and we take measurements, that's the red line. And you can see that it goes from 300 Volts down to zero. Totally makes sense: we had our anode of 300 Volts, you move the probe all the way out to the end of the chamber, it goes down to zero. Then the fun starts and you can calculate other parameters in the plasma, like the electric field strength. So, electric field strength is how much your electrical potential changes with distance. And so, if I had a chamber that had a 300 Volt anode here, and the end of the chamber, which was a meter away, went down to zero, you would say that the change in the electric potential is 300 Volts per meter. Okay, that's how you describe electric fields: 300 Volts per meter, is the change. But what we found very clearly from this data, and I'm sorry I didn't label the vertical axis better, but that green peak, that's the electric field, that peak has nothing to do with those numbers on the left. That green peak is at about 8,000 Volts per meter, not 300 Volts per meter, which you might think, if you just looked at the rough numbers. So, this is great because it's showing us that these discharge plasmas, they have the ability to sustain within them, much more intense regimes, much more intensive is going on than you would ever guess, if you just were stepping back and looking at your power supply, right? If you look at your power supply, you would never guess that there was 8,000 Volts per meter electric fields in there. The black line is charge density, so these double layers exist because charge is positive and negative charges build up next to each other. So, we can see we're starting to be able to measure those charge density fluctuations. It's the left hand side there, the black line when it gets a little bit closer to the anode, it drops way, way down. I didn't include it on this graph. I couldn't get that on there but just so you know that that black line drops way down, if we get one fraction of a millimeter closer to the anode. And then the blue one is the resistance of the chamber. So, since we have a designed a double probe also, we didn't show you that one, we can stick those two wires in there and measure the resistance of the plasma across that little gap between the two wires and so you can see the resistance is basically infinite, as you get closer to the anode, drops to almost zero, climbs back up, falls back down and that last rise at the end there of the resistance line, I'm pretty sure, is heading back up to essentially, you know huge, huge numbers. I love this graph. I'm very proud that we were able to make this, because you don't often see so many plasma parameters, all taken together and displayed together and, similar to what I was saying about the overall plasma electrical characteristics is so needed for astronomy so you can start making circuit diagrams, this sort of ability to see all these different parameters in the plasma, at the same time, on the same graph, is what we need in order to start digging into what's going on, what's the physics inside of this plasma here. And since a lot of these results were done pretty recently, more analysis kept coming in the day, we were supposed to submit it. Lowell gave me this graph, okay, I'll put this in there, before we hit ”send”, he sends me another graph. Okay, I'll put this one in there. This is the electron temperature in the different areas, that plasma close, we're getting close, to the anode, okay? So it's going up and down; see how, that close to the anode there, it's at 7. Okay, that's Electronvolt, 7 Electronvolt electrons. That's pretty hot for earthly conditions. If I had a jar of 7 Electronvolt electrons, and you stuck your thermometer in there, it would read about 81,000 degrees. That would be the effective comparable temperature to it. So, we have in SAFIRE tens of thousands of degree fluctuations in temperature taking place over millimeters or centimeters, safely, no one's being hurt, right? Not yet, and we can control it, we can reproduce it, and as we saw with the probes, we're starting to see how to release that energy. But we'll talk more about that very soon; about the release of the energy. Now, it's important to point out that the team does have a paper published from previous work. This was written by Lowell Morgan and Montgomery Childs. It was published in the Plasma Sources Science and Technology journal. This looked at previous discharges, mostly from the point of how much light was being emitted. So, a really good analysis by Lowell on this one. One of the main conclusions from this, we're trying to answer, how do these double layers form. Believe it or not, no one really knows how these double layers form, okay. it's pretty interesting; Lowell's idea was, that the production of negative ions and electrons, creates instabilities in the plasma, which leads then to the segregation of the charges. If you want, we can certainly get you this paper, that you can dig into his analysis on that. Again to remind people, I'm excited by some of our results, because we're seeing fluctuations in these parameters, that are comparable to the sort of fluctuations we need to have to be able to say, yes we're looking at astronomical quantities here, comparable quantities. We should just take a breath in, before getting into radiation. So everybody breathe. We were talking about the ITER, Tokamak experiments, you know and see the sheer amount of money that's going into them. And it seems like we're trying to force nature to do something it doesn't want to do, with these magnetic confinement fusion experiments. And you know, you put another 50 million dollars into it, and then you get much stronger magnetic fields to try, and it still just doesn't work. You can't make the plasma do it and I don't know if you can see it from the videos, but we're in the lab working on this plasma. We're not actually driving it so hard, we're not forcing nature to do anything. That's certainly how I feel it. It seems like, we turn it up and then the plasma responds, and everybody's happy, we're not forcing anybody to do anything, right? So, I feel that's one of the things that, it feels to me like we're on the right track, because it doesn't have that feeling of forcing something that nature doesn't want to do. Plasmas are certainly Dr. Morgan's specialty. We said, could you please, take a look at this. Take a look at why, what happened to our tungsten probe. Okay, from what you know, can you please dig into this. So, we spent some time looking at that. Radiation trapping. So we're going to talk about that really soon. How to envision that. So, I knew that biology had complicated chemistry. Biochemistry, is complicated stuff, right? Light and life, it has all these things and I'm starting to realize: plasma chemistry is really also equally complicated, and it makes me wonder about what sort of chemistry is being done on stars. It's really complicated stuff. So, Lowell came back with... right, this is not a result of thermodynamics. traditional temperature that melted this probe. You have to look at radiation hydrodynamics which, he explained to us, is really one of the most complicated areas in Applied Physics. There's not much that you could say is more complicated; it's why Livermore and Los Alamos labs always have the best computers, because you need supercomputers to do these analyses. I wrote down this quote from him that ”nuclear weapons have very little to do with nuclear physics and a lot to do with radiation hydrogen dynamics” Okay, let's talk about radiation trapping and slowing of the speed of light. Imagine that this whole room is the SAFIRE chamber, okay. The stage is the anode, and all of us are hydrogen atoms, okay. And being hydrogen atoms, like we said that every species of bird has its own song, so we can all talk to each other, for all hydrogen atoms, we can exchange thoughts and tell each other things and exchange photons and energy, stuff like that; and the anode is up here, and electrical energy is being pushed out to all of us, from the stage here. Okay, so you got the picture, right? Now imagine that that whole side of the room, you're now all helium atoms, Okay? To the rest of us, that side of the room just went dark. We can't see them anymore, we can't hear them anymore, because we are now on different wavelengths. We cannot exchange energy with them anymore. Okay, so we'll leave them for a second. We'll just focus on this side. Electrical energy comes off of the stage and let's imagine that it gets absorbed by two people on the front row, okay? They hold on to it for a while, they get excited, they're bubbly, they can't sit still in their seats; they're getting all kind of pumped up, but they hold onto the energy, hold onto the excitement for a while; maybe 30 s. While they're holding onto it, two more people on the front row get some of this energy. They get all excited, they can't sit in their seats they can’t wait to tell somebody something. After about thirty seconds, those first two people finally can turn around and they communicate their excitement to somebody behind them. But then that person who gets that excitement behind him in the second row, they also have to hold on to it for a while. They can't just turn around and tell the person behind them. So, there's this slow progression of this excitement. If it were a different scenario, if you weren't hydrogen and I wasn't communicating to this specific frequency of light, which I'll mention soon, then as soon as you got excited, you would just turn around and talk to the person behind you. As soon as you told, they would just turn around and tell the next person behind them, and that excitement would go out through the hall at the speed of light, right out. But that's not what happens. There's a specific resonant frequency that hydrogen has. It's 122 nanometers; that's pretty hot stuff. That's the level of energy that we see coming off of solar flares, coronal loops, things like that. That's how we see that level of intensity. When hydrogen gets that, it holds on to it for a while. In fact, it holds on to it thousands of times longer, than it takes to just exchange the information with another hydrogen atom. So it's that particular way that hydrogen manifests that slows down the speed of light, the progression of light, by thousands of times, and ends up building a huge amount of energy in that region. We didn't forget about the helium’s. So, the helium's they don't see anything going on over here. It's dark, they can't hear anything, and one of you gets the bright idea: let's build a probe and we'll put it across the aisle and we'll see. So it's like a couple of guys go running back to the breakout room, they take apart some of Ricky's paintings. They get the wood frames, they stick some dried sage that I saw over there on the table in that, and two guys put the probe across the center aisle and it touches into that region and bursts into flames. Ashes fall on the floor. So that's how they know: that look, we couldn't see it, it wasn't visible to us, but as soon as we put our probe in there, it got fried. That's radiation trapping and slowing down the speed of light. That's what we have going on in our chamber, and that's my.... Now you know all about radiation hydrodynamics that you need to know. How'd I do Lowell, was that okay? ... yeah and you know what's interesting also is that this whole arrangement is... You could call it electrostatic. We just have a battery, we just have 300 Volts. So it's an electrostatic machine we have. So we have an electrostatic machine that can trap photons, high-energy photons. We have an electrostatic machine that can slow down the speed of light. We have an electrostatic machine that can release in an instant very large quantities of energy. And we're controlling it. We can predict how to get to these regimes. This is a plot of the expected temperature the probe tip would get to. And so, you can see under certain regimes, which are the left and right axes there, of hydrogen density and electron temperature, the red area there: 10,000 degrees predicted. When that poor probe goes into the hydrogen section, you could expect that much energy to go into the probe, raising it up to about 10,000 degrees. Now, does that explain everything we saw? I don't know, but it certainly is the right way to start analyzing this problem. Monty: A lot going on this year and we were really getting concerned towards the end of the project, whether or not we were even going to do this. We started getting the analysis back, and we sure were getting really excited. There was actually hope, even though thermodynamics can't resolve for these things, radiation hydrodynamics can; plus a lot of other things. So, we see ourselves as, now that SAFIRE, I would say, is stable, we can get these stable plasmas, we're now in a place where I would say, with pretty good confidence, that we can start to actually do a number of experiments and get really good data back. But these results are, in my view spectacular. The chemistry changes: (we) don't know. We shouldn't have barium in there, or titanium, no idea where the stuff came from. We can be guessing, but we should find out. Variations in electron density comparable to the photosphere, heliosphere and nuclear bombs. Those are the only places that we see these kinds of intense, dense plasmas. Electrical confinement of high-energy photons. That's a lot. And what we're saying here in effect is that, and what Michael was talking about, and the transformation characteristics of the plasma, the double layers, those double layers, when Paul's talking about second-order interactions, what we're talking about, it's like an audio feedback loop that just keeps getting bigger and bigger except that in a double layer it gets to a point that the double layer forms, and the plasma now becomes stable. Up to that point, electrically you can see a lot of activity, but when the double layer forms, it goes stable and it it's very robust. So, it'd be like the double layer, and I'm going to jump out here a little bit too, because I think we're really at that place, where we have our atmosphere in the Earth, 350 miles up. Conventional science says, it is gravity that holds our atmosphere here. But mechanical engineering, I mean, we have big machines that try to contain, or get vacuums that aren’t even close to space vacuums. What I'm trying to say in effect is that only 300-mile distance, we've got a space vacuum that can suck your eyeballs out of your house. I mean, out of your head (it has been a long day), out of your head, and yet there's no mechanical device retaining our atmosphere. And what we are seeing, what we forgot to mention actually, is we do have a pressure delta in SAFIRE. That's a big deal because I think Langmuir predicted theoretically, that we should see this. I mean that's what Lowell is.... What we're saying in effect is, when we get a vacuum in a chamber, a gas would fill this room, or the chamber, and the pressure in itself would be equal throughout the chamber. But when these double layers form, that's not what's happening. So, we do actually have higher pressure inside these double layers than we do actually have outside, in the greater part of the chamber. So, you actually have a plasma force field that actually can contain these molecules, these gases. That's a big deal. So, the core of SAFIRE is cooler. The highest temperatures we thought we saw was maybe around 1,000º C; and obviously the temperatures, or the effective temperature, or you might say, the response temperatures we are getting with the probes, are many orders above that. Way, way, way above that. So these are things that we're exploring with SAFIRE and I think that's really it. These questions we are going to leave on the screen here and I guess we're open for questions and answers. [Applause] Other way that's good! eighty-five ”So the temperature of the anode right now in the hydrogen is 600” ”It has been at 600, even though we had like kilowatts going through there. Yeah, that's good.” ”..a lot hotter with the nitrogen..” Shortly after the 2017 Phoenix conference, the SAFIRE team discovered a unique process that initiates and sustains the plasma double layers. This was a major discovery, because it is these plasma double layers that produce both the extraordinarily high energy densities and the electric field that contains these energies within the plasma. This new advancement in plasma science demonstrates a process, that consistently creates, contains and controls the plasma double layers in stable exothermic plasma reactions. Although the energies and densities are comparable to the Sun's photosphere and nuclear bombs, the data shows no harmful side effects, such as radioactivity. But the science of what is actually happening at the molecular and atomic levels is not yet fully understood. Understanding these reactions, will give valuable insight into the way the Sun's atmosphere functions, and provide the foundation by which these energies can be beneficially harnessed This research will be the top priority of 2018. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info The following presentation is an adaptation of the Mel Acheson article Error Probes, Truth Probes, and Space Probes. The link to the article may be found in the description box of this video. Christiaan Eijkman discovered that a bacterium in polished rice caused beriberi and an antitoxin in the coating cured it. Eijkman verified his theory with a massive study of 280,000 people. He ruled out the possibility of other causal factors; sanitation, hygiene and so on and he cured victims by feeding them unpolished rice, just as his theory predicted. He was awarded a Nobel Prize for his achievement. Gerrit Grijns followed in Eijkman footsteps but Gerrit was a crackpot, that is, he had an altogether different idea. He imagined beriberi was caused not by something in the rice but by something not in the rice. He began looking for data that would raise doubts about Eijkman's theory. Beriberi was also associated with diets of tapioca root, foods other than rice polishing could cure it. And no one could find Eijkman's bacterium. Both theories explained the facts. Both theories predicted the cure. Both theories were verified. But Grijns's theory could be applied to a much larger assemblage of data and had benefits far beyond the domain of rice diets and beriberi. Today, astronomers attribute the non-Newtonian motions of stars and galaxies to an infection of dark matter in the universe. Gravitational theory which has been experimentally verified many, many times can explain the observed motions only by assuming there's some unseen matter swirling around outside what we see. The cure is in the galactic polishings. Now along comes a crackpot idea: perhaps the non-Newtonian motions aren't caused by something out there but by something not out there. Perhaps gravity is not out there. An abundance of anomalies raises doubts about gravitational theory: galaxies that are supposed to be astronomically far from each other are interacting. The primary distance indicator, the cosmological redshift is quantized in sharply delineated bands; matter is collimated into extremely thin, long, and coherent filaments; concentrations of matter that should be pulling everything in are spewing everything out. And the quantity of dark matter needed to explain those anomalous motions turns out to be over 90% of the universe. Douglas Allchin's paper 'The Epistemology of Error', discusses the episode of Eijkman Grijns, and beriberi. He emphasizes that the important distinction for characterizing knowledge is not the conventional "dichotomies of fact/artifact, true/false, and right/wrong." Rather, "...key epistemological distinction is between empirically unresolved questions or uncertainty, and resolved questions." "Grijns's challenge was not to show ... that beriberi was a nutrient deficiency. Rather, he had to show first how initial evidence consistent with a bacterial interpretation was ambiguous. Then ... it could indicate something else." Allchin identifies "...uncertainty as the primitive state. Fact an artifact co-emerged from undifferentiated perception." He goes on to assert that simply confirming a theory doesn't provide reliability. Verification must be accompanied by a search for alternate explanations, which he calls ― 'error probes.' He presents the idea of error probes in a rather static way: a theory, such as Eijkman's which is verified, is later shown to be "erroneous" But in moving from one to the other, a dynamic process occurs. One can't assume, as the term 'error' tends to do, that the process stops with the second theory. The later theory may eventually be shown also to be erroneous. The concept of "domain of validity" fits better with an ongoing process of discovering alternative explanations. The domain of Eijkman's theory was the data then available about rice diets and the effects of polishings. Within the boundaries of that domain, Eijkman's theory was true. Verification, then, is a 'truth probe' that probes no further than a theory's frontier. Eijkman's efforts were limited to truth probes. He neglected to perform an error probe because he assumed (albeit unconsciously) that the domain of the bacterial theory was infinite. You can't learn anything new if you limit yourself to verifying what you already know. Presumably, Eijkman was not in a position to be able even to imagine a cause bigger than bacterial infection. But his work began the process of differentiation that prodded Grijns to imagine a bigger concept. Similarly, Newton was not in a position to imagine anything bigger than gravity. His error and that of his mainstream followers down to the present day was the assumption that the domain of validity of gravitational theory is universal. Newton didn't know about plasma or galaxies or redshifts or error probes. His followers, however, don't have this excuse of simple ignorance. Their efforts to preserve the theory at the expense of the phenomena are culpable. To establish what Allchin calls 'deep reliability', it's necessary to investigate possible alternative explanations. He states, "Reliability hinges on a dual process of confirmation and ruling out error." Today there are a number of alternatives to the Newtonian idea of universal gravitation. Tom Van Flandern developed a theory of "limited action" gravity. Fred Hoyle and Jayant Narlikar have proposed a variable mass version of gravitation. And there are several proposals of electrical and plasma dynamics that largely or entirely replace gravity. All these theories explain more data and have further reaching implications than the mainstream theory. Their domains are larger. Their potential benefits are larger. Their promises of increased understanding of the universe are larger. Universal gravitation suffers from "shallow reliability" that extends no further than verification. Even that is eroding as space probes discover anomalous details to once confirmatory data. Ambiguity is increasing. Knowledge heretofore assumed to be secure is slipping back into the primitive state of uncertainty. It will re-emerge transformed by a new resolution. The error probe, when finally it's forced on a stubborn and blind establishment, will find the error to be Newton's. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info A discussion with Wal Thornhill on the  "accelerating expansion of the Universe." A few weeks ago, a new scientific study based on data from the Hubble Space Telescope was published which affirms what many other papers have reported in recent years and that is that the so-called expansion of the universe, after the hypothetical Big Bang explosion, appears to be accelerating much too quickly to explain through any kind of known physics. Now, of course it was decades ago that scientists on Earth first noticed this kind of discordant data, while this problem led to the invention of a new type of energy ― called dark energy ― which we are now told, composes about 75% of the universe. Well as we've reported previously many times on Space News, even taking into account the invention of dark energy's influence, the Hubble data has only deepened the problem. There is a discordance between the apparent expansion rate of the so-called early universe and the later universe. Let me briefly read to you from a phys.org report on these findings, "This discrepancy has been identified in scientific papers over the last several years, but it's been unclear whether the differences in measurement techniques are to blame, or whether the difference could result from unlucky measurements. The latest Hubble data lower the possibility that the discrepancy is only a fluke to 1 in 100,000. This is a significant gain from an earlier estimate, less than a year ago, of a chance of 1 in 3,000. These most precise Hubble measurements to date bolster the idea that new physics may be needed to explain the mismatch." Now as members of the electric universe community have always known, Plasma Cosmology in the Electric Universe have always proposed that there was no Big Bang. The overriding issue in astrophysics is not just the raw data gleaned by telescopes and by spacecraft, but rather how is that data interpreted. In fact, Plasma Cosmology and the Electric Universe have challenged the underpinnings of astrophysicists' methods of assessing the age and distance of celestial objects. Objects that appear very distant and very bright and thus very huge, could actually be very close and very faint. And there is an abundant body of credible scientific evidence that this is indeed the case. So today we're going to discuss all of this, and more, with the chief science advisor to The Thunderbolts Project, Wal Thornhill. Wal, why don't you begin by sharing what the official NASA report on this new Hubble data says, and what your thoughts are. The NASA report dated April 26, this year, states, "Astronomers using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope say they have crossed an important threshold in revealing a discrepancy between the two key techniques for measuring the universe's expansion rate. The recent study strengthens the case that new theories may be needed to explain the forces that have shaped the cosmos." They go on to say, "...scientists have run into an intriguing difference between what they predict and what they observe." But this has been a pattern throughout the Space Age, and the basic problem boils down to the origin of the Big Bang Theory and their notion of an expanding universe. Now science is a cultural activity and unfortunately, students are not taught the historical context to any degree, which gives them some idea where these original ideas came from. But fundamentally, the Big Bang Theory is a direct outgrowth of the dominant cultural Western Judeo-Christian religion myths and as a result, it had to have its own creation story. This is a feature of all cultures on Earth that they have their individual creation stories. None of it has been understood until recently by some scholars who had not been recognized, but the fact is that the story that has been concocted has no more anything to do with science than the books relating the creation myths globally. In fact, it's only by understanding the origin of those global creation myths that you understand the universe, because they are trying to tell us something that we desperately need to understand. Well Wal, it's interesting that one of the most common comments we receive in response to Space News, is from viewers stating that they can no longer stand to watch any mainstream documentaries or TV shows on cosmology because they're just too painfully aware that a more promising alternative exists with no acknowledgment from celebrity science personalities. When it comes to the Big Bang Theory, to me it does seem incredible that we still see this posture that it remains the best and most plausible story of the origins of the universe, despite its intractable problems which only continue to grow with discovery. So if I were to ask a cosmologist, why he or she still believes in the Big Bang Theory, in your opinion, what response would I be likely to get? I find it difficult to watch science programs particularly those based around cosmology these days, because so many so-called facts are presented which are not facts at all but merely conjectures. The idea of the expanding universe was picked up by Einstein who thought it was a very neat idea, it seems, and of course it gave him room to produce his own theory of the expansion of the universe involving his gravitational theory and that was picked up by Eddington. And Eddington, who was also a Quaker, and had strong religious views associated with his science was the one who championed Einstein's ideas. In fact if it wasn't for Eddington, Einstein may have withered on the vine, because his papers, as they are presented now, would not pass peer-review these days. The expansion of the universe is based on Hubble's work and of course, they say that he discovered the expansion of the universe through his measurements of redshifts of distance galaxies. But that's not correct. His view was that the expansion idea was the least likely answer to this discovery of the redshift-distance relationship, and that there would be some new physics involved. But no one ever tells you that, so we now have the Hubble telescope in honor of this so-called discovery, and I'm sure he'd be spinning in his grave if he heard the sorts of things that are attributed to his research these days. The very idea of the expansion of the universe makes no sense, because we understand space in three dimensions, and it is a concept of locations in three dimensions. There is nothing about space, physical, which can be expanded or contracted or twisted. It is merely a mathematical concept by adding extra dimensions. What has to be made clear is that the dimensions that are used in mathematics have nothing necessarily to do with the three physical dimensions, we both observe and existing in this universe. Those dimensions are merely degrees of freedom and those degrees of freedom; the more they add, the more dimensions they add, the more freedom they have, the mathematicians, to invent whatever they like. And this is what's happened. Well as I alluded to in my opening, one of the things that physicists have invented in response to unexpected discovery is dark energy. But as I also alluded to, the whole idea of an expanding universe depends on the validity of the redshift equals distance assumption. We've talked many times about the importance of the late astronomer Halton Arp's research into that question. So why don't you explain the reasoning, why an expanding universe is actually not necessary in light of science discovery? The NASA report states, "...measurements of the galaxies' light that reddens as it passes through a stretching universe." But of course, the idea of a stretching universe is non-physical and makes no physical sense. "The reddening is used to calculate how fast the cosmos expands with time, a value known as the Hubble constant." But Halton Arp, the notable astronomer who was dubbed the modern-day Galileo, because those who believed in the Big Bang refused to look at his data, said that he had discovered that the light from these highly redshifted objects occurs in discrete values, which means that there was something going on in the matter within the quasar, and not with space. But of course, this is one reason why his work was not looked at and Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar even scribbled across the top of his submitted paper, which was rejected of course, 'this exceeds my imagination' and for that very reason should have been published. So then we read in the report, "The Hubble tension between the early and late universe may be the most exciting development in cosmology in decades," said lead researcher and Nobel laureate Adam Riess of the Space Telescope Science Institute and Johns Hopkins University, in Baltimore, Maryland. He goes on to say, "This mismatch has been growing and has now reached a point that is really impossible to dismiss as a fluke. This disparity could not plausibly occur just by chance." In other words this is saying, just send more money! And then we can invent more unobservable particles and mysterious energies. No one at any stage in any of this has suggested that we go back and have a look at the origins of the notion that Einstein's theory of gravity actually explains what we see in deep space. Because the simple answer to that is, it doesn't. Galaxies do not behave or rotate as if they're responding to gravity. What's more, Einstein's theory did away with the force of gravity. So you've got to ask the question, what is it that I feel when I hit the ground when I'm not supposed to be falling? There are so many problems with Einstein's view of the universe, it's amazing that people have actually taken it seriously. And I would suggest that more people have read about his theory of relativity, and fewer people have understood anything at the end of it than any other book on any shelf. The reasons for this I can point out is, that the idea that all of his observers are equivalent and have inertial frames of references that are equivalent, cannot be so. Because, as Newton found with his bucket experiment, it seems that the water in his rotating bucket was aware of the matter in the rest of the universe. In other words, if the rest of the universe was rotating around that bucket, and the bucket was stationary, the water would rise just as it was seen by Newton. And he understood that, but somewhere along the line people have forgotten that, and in the days of classical physics when real physics was being done, it was recognized that there had to be a connection between the matter on Earth, and the matter in the rest of the universe which is referred to as the fixed stars. But that's been lost, and as a result we can no longer define mass, length, time, energy. None of these things are defined in any physically sensible manner. It requires that we set the context for physics, otherwise you stop doing physics. The report continues, "In this new study, astronomers used Hubble to observe 70 pulsating stars called Cepheid variables in the Large Magellanic Cloud. A special class of pulsating star called a Cepheid variable, which brightens and dims at a predictable rate that corresponds to its intrinsic brightness. Once astronomers determine that value, they can measure the light from these stars to calculate an accurate distance to the galaxy." Now this behavior, a Cepheid variable relies on an extremely complex model that has never been tested. It is far simpler to explain both the change in period and the brightness of a star by an electrical model of the star which modulates both the apparent size and the brightness of a star's photosphere together. It should be pointed out that, the standard gas model of stars has so many special conditions and assumptions built-in that it could be tweaked to reproduce almost any observations. I should note that a Cepheid variable is a type of star that pulsates radially varying in both diameter and temperature and producing changes in brightness with a well defined of stable period and amplitude. A strong direct relationship between a Cepheid variable's luminosity and pulsation period established them as important indicators of cosmic benchmarks for scaling galactic and extragalactic distances. As for the Large Magellanic Cloud, it's a member of our local Group of galaxies. It's only 180,000 light-years away, the second closest galaxy to us in the Milky Way. It has a low redshift interpreted as a velocity away from us, of 278 km/s. You put it in terms of the redshift z, it's about .001 which is probably a true Doppler shift. But you cannot simply assume the high redshift of the more distant galaxies is due entirely to the Doppler effect of the velocity away from us. There is this assumption that the Cepheid variables will be operating under the same conditions in distant galaxies at high redshift. The Electric Universe suggests that the fact that these objects are highly redshifted shows that the energy contained within those objects, and therefore the masses of the protons and electrons in the atoms, will be different. They will be lighter and the frequencies, the energy being emitted will be lower, which gives you, in effect, redshift. What's more, being an atomic phenomenon it will be quantized. And yet this hasn't been recognized, it's quite remarkable. That means that you cannot use Cepheid variables simply as a distance measurement, because any redshift involved must also take into account possible quantized redshift which is intrinsic and not Doppler shift. When Halton Arp did that, he figured that the universe appeared to be static, which was a puzzle, if you just assumed that the universe was operating gravitationally because the whole thing should collapse inwards. But he found that this meant that gravity must also be a balanced force that can repel as well as attract, and this was the puzzle that the Electric Universe set out to solve some time ago. 
 Welcome to Space News from the Electric  Universe, brought to you by the  Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts. info. The following presentation is an adaptation of the Mel Acheson Picture Of The Day article “Conceptual Chromatography.” The link to the article may be found in the description box of this video. Is the Earth at the center of the universe after all? Or is the expanding universe an artifact of conceptual chromatography? Chromatography has been quite a useful invention. The high-school science demonstration of it is to place a drop or two of ink in a beaker of water and to suspend a length of filter paper over the water, with the bottom of the paper barely immersed. The various pigments in the ink will travel up the paper at different speeds, producing a “spectrum” of colors. This technique can be used with various mixtures to detect the particular compounds composing them. But an analogue of this process can occur with theories, and the results can be misleading, instead of enlightening. Let's start with an example from cosmology: the ”paper” of the Doppler effect is dipped into the “beaker” of redshift measurements of galaxies and quasars. The Doppler paper imposes a distance proportional to redshift on the measurements. Low- redshift galaxies don't get far. High-redshift quasars ”chromatograph” into the farthest reaches of space. Hence, what could be a relatively nearby cluster of mixed galaxies and quasars, becomes a “spike” or ”finger” of objects stretching away from the Earth. What does this have to do with reality as we imagine it? Halton Arp in his book, Seeing Red plots all the galaxies in the Virgo cluster at their Doppler interpreted redshift distances. The galaxies stretch out in a long narrow strip, exactly along a radius vector from Earth. If quasars were to be included in the plots, the entire universe would like spokes of a wheel, with Earth at the hub. Well, that was an amusing exercise. Let's look for some more “paper” theories. Time, some wag has said, is what keeps everything from happening all at once. But what if some things did happen all at once and a geologist came along with a quote “geologic record?” Single episodes of flooding have been known to build up many layers of sediments, sorted according to fluctuations in the velocity of the water. Afterward, “dipping” the concept of geologic record into the strata, would stretch out each layer in time, marking off thousands of years at each stratum. Obviously, the flood would have to be slowed considerably. Equally obviously, the easy way to do that would be to freeze it. Our conceptual chromatography has created an ice age. But this is just idle speculation right? Well, there is the matter of the Bretz floods in eastern Washington. It took a long time and much careful argumentation, but it's now accepted that Eastern Washington was shaped by monstrous floods instead of by ice. One entire lobe of the Ice Age has been conceptually melted. Now I hear talk of similar floods coursing into the Atlantic from Central Canada. The conceptual climate of the Ice Age just got a bit warmer, and a few things have started happening all at once. What if we “melted” the entire ice age and recalled the mythical stories of the collapse of the World Mountain or Tree which resulted in global floods from the north? This is fun. Let's play the game with plate tectonics: instead of counting to a million years with every magnetic stripe on the Atlantic seafloor, let's use smaller numbers. Just to up the ante, let's use smaller units, too. How about a few minutes! We'd have to imagine SOMETHING ripping the Americas away from Europe and Africa all at once. It would have to be something so big that the continents and the energy to move them would be small potatoes in comparison. it would have to be something of astronomical proportions. Velikovsky already proposed other planets sweeping by and causing somewhat similar commotions. Let's take a clue instead from the Electric Universe: instead of moving the Americas, we can leave them be. A “thunderbolt”- an interplanetary electrical discharge just a bit more energetic than that alleged to have machined Valles Marineris out of Mars' surface arcs along the Earth from pole to pole. It blasts out and lifts large chunks of lithosphere along each side of the more sinuous central channel. It melts the bottom and leaves stripes of reversed magnetism every time the oscillations in the discharge channel reverse polarity. The pinching of the discharge channel confines the excavation to a parallel- sided gouge in the Earth that afterward fills with water. A few thousand years later, a geologist comes along with a strip of geologic record.... If modern theories of astronomy and geology are vulnerable to chromatographic suspicion, can biology be far behind? Speciation and extinction color large areas on the paper of evolution. Natural selection works slowly but surely to bleed colorful moments into pastel millennia. A bit of color has been restored to moments of extinction with proposals of impacts from asteroids and comets. it's fairly easy to kill off large populations suddenly, but building up those populations surely takes time. the J-curves in S-curves of population growth have long initial tails. Gestation times and birth rates (for mammals- reproduction parameters in general) keep initial increases low. That is, if you start off with only a few individuals. If it all happens at once - replacement of one population with another - the new population must be created ex nihilo. But what if the parents were another species? There have been several proposals for mass mutation. But their requirement for some direct linkage between genetic and environmental parameters is too Lamarckian for comfort. As long as we have chromato- graphic evolution, we don't need Lamarck. But if natural selection is augmented with forces of extinction that can be confined to extraordinary events of short duration, why not also augment the forces of speciation? The direct linkage between genes and environment would become a kind of “driven” genetics in which active groups of genes are ”switched on and off” by extraordinary environmental changes. This leads to something like metamorphic evolution: if butterflies do it today, why not other creatures under other conditions? 90% of our genes don't seem to do anything. What are they waiting for? A full moon? Let's perform one more thought experiment with this conceptual chromatography. Modern linguistics postulates a development of language gradually over thousands of years. A band of “oral color” spreads out before the band of “written color.” But the earliest expressions contained in this linguistic “spectrum” testify that both utterance and symbol were given all at once by the gods. In the beginning was the word, and it was both an audible and a visual emanation from a planetary deity. Perhaps a prior language was obliterated and forgotten in the wake of the terrors and traumas accompanying the ”sacred word.” But linguistics is not concerned with the forgotten; it's concerned with the remembered. And languages remember “sacred sounds” that are tied to “sacred symbols” by way of ”sacred stories” which memorialize an all- at-once creation witnessed by and imposed upon humankind. Linguistic chromatography dissociates the sound from the symbol and misses the story. 196 00:08:18,290 --> 00:00:00,000 [Music] 
Between the Borrego Desert and the pine- covered peaks of Cleveland National Forest in eastern San Diego county, California there's a domain of solid granite  called the In-Ko-Pah mountains. The In-Ko-Pah’s have nary a tree, only course manzanita chaparral that springs from chinks in the rock like the hair of an armadillo. It's a bare and broken land, forsaken to brooding hoodoos, rodents, snakes, and decomposing granite. Place names give its mood, Valley of the Moon, Devil's Canyon, the optimistic Boulder Park and Coyote's Flying Saucer Retrievals and Repair Service. Most notable is the Desert View Tower in In-Ko-Pah Canyon. The tower is made of the native granite and stands Tolkienesque, commanding a view of the Wizard’s Cauldron around it. As a child, I remember the tower had a coffee shop. We never stopped because we're almost there - there being still two hours away. I wistfully watched its golden glow suffused with coffee and sweet roll smells passed from the back seat of a 50’s Cadillac, 60’s Lincoln and two 70’s Ford LDT’s. It presented a glowing warrant for the traveler, standing high above the road in this stark, alien landscape. As it happens, I'm living here now in a rural mountain community called Potrero, which lies in this cauldron or granite region where I've taken the opportunity to look at the rocks. What I conclude from observations is that these granite boulders are bubbles of boiled sand - not hollow bubbles, but solid drops of granite formed as boils at the surface of a hot fluid matrix. ’Cauldron of Granite’ is an accurate description as the energy came from below, and by electrolysis in thermal convection, boiled through layers of sand to the surface, liquefying the sand in the process like one would melt metals in a cauldron. As exemplified in these photos, many boulders look like the kind of candy made with drops of molten sugar, a viscous thick material that quickly cools to form a skin that holds its drop shape while the inside remains hot and liquid. The shapes are like frozen beads of molten glass. Bubbles and drops take a cellular form due to surface tension that forms the skin around the fluid and a pressure density differential across this membrane. The bulging  rounded shape suggest these formed in atmospheric pressure, rather than deep underground as consensus science tells us. There had to be a lower pressure and density surrounding these drops as they form to allow the free-form shapes found only by surface tension in the skin. We'll observe multiple other points of evidence that these boulders are electrified boils, including evidence of how the mountains were formed and how they became electrified to boil boulder fields. In this, part one of a two-part series, we'll discuss the boulders. In part two, we will discuss  the cauldron and what caused these mountains to boil. As we review the evidence and discuss the potential causes and processes, bear in mind the situational context of Earth at the time. Earth was in upheaval due to some cosmic disturbance. The atmosphere and ground, all through the crust, was charged. In some places, saturated zones eroded away, electronically machined by sputtering and arc discharge. Other areas had lower levels of saturation, where charge diffused through the ground and caused secondary and tertiary events at the surface that  aren't easily identified with something purely electrical. Thermodynamics, chemistry, fluid dynamics, all conspire to increase the complexity of nature's products. The Granite Cauldron is a display of such complexity. Examination of the rocks, and the region as a whole, leads me to conclude that the granite was boiled as a consequence of electrolysis in an underlying aquifer, where oxygen and hydrogen became segregated and channeled through layers of sand and water. The oxygen channels reacted with elements in the layers of sand, creating blossoms of hot boiling silicon compounds that solidified in contact with the atmosphere, suddenly cooling, recombining and recrystallizing as granite, but still in the shape of fluid drops. The evidence to back my theories, is in the shape of the boulders, which precisely conform to the shape of fast-cooling drops and clusters of drops. In fact, the boulders conform to shapes made of melted glass - silica dioxide - which is what these rocks are largely composed of. They do not conform to the expectations of conventional erosion. There is also evidence in the topography of the coastal mountains which display the clear patterns of a large discharge current  from the Earth. This differs from the consensus theory which has granite form deep in the Earth as a volcanic flow that didn't erupt or surface, but became trapped under extreme pressure and temperature for eons as its  crystals grew. Then an accordion-like action in the Earth's crust, triggered by subduction of the continent, caused these granites to be shoved 5,000 feet above sea level, where they have been lashed by wind, rain and freeze for millennia, to produce the polished and rounded, but sometimes square, granite boulders that we see. At least the consensus and I agree - there was extreme heat from within the Earth. My boiling drop theory suggests things pretty much happened all at once though, due to a high voltage electrical impulse, diffusing through a sandstone aquifer. Evidence that boulders formations are boiled, is their shape as depicted in the images previously shown, where singular drops formed and froze. While some retained an ovular shape, they dehydrated and contracted as they cooled, which often left conical or flattened drops. Well, this is exactly what one expects from a hot molten drop that cools, dries and solidifies quickly. More often, however, one finds clusters of boulders that were once co-joined, like bubbles in  a foam. In a foam bubbles and drops conform to each other, matching shapes across cellular membranes. It's very obvious, the bulges shown in the next set of images, are clusters of drops that have dried and fallen apart, leaving matching surfaces where they were once co-joined. Steam and other gases exited the rock as it cooled. The  expansion of gas and steam at the surface contact with the atmosphere likely helped cool the surface faster, increasing the surface tension in the skin, and causing shrinkage of the drop. As the drop shrank, it separated  into lobes, which further shrank and broke apart. Comparing the boulder cluster shown, to the bubble clusters in the next group of images, one sees the same polygonal interfaces, the same segmenting, and the same interstitial bubbles, wedged between larger bubbles. The only difference shape-wise is that boulders are solidified drops, not bubbles, and they shrank as they dried causing segmented lobes to separate and  fall apart. When bubbles and drops cluster, those on the interior of the cluster tend to be polygonal shapes. Because the internal pressure between cojoined cells in a cluster is more or less equalized, internal membrane walls experience no pressure differential and are flat. Outer cells in the cluster however have a differential between interior pressure in the atmosphere and therefore they bulge outwards. That is exactly how these boulder clusters are structured. If one makes a symmetrical cluster of five bubbles, the one inside the other four will be a perfect  cube. There are several examples of polygonal bubbles in the images shown. Singular boulders tend to be rounded, while boulders in clusters tend to be polygonal, especially the ones in the cluster  center. The squared shapes and flat surfaces between boulders is proof they formed as drops in the atmosphere. This granite has no grain oriented in a certain direction, or any other internal structure that would cause them to break in a particular way, as a result of earthquake or erosion. The only explanation presented by physics, is if these rocks were clustered drops. A child can make a perfect square with soap bubbles; I challenge any PhD to do so with erosion. Surface tension had to conform to the volume reduction. So, one of two things happened. If the skin had cooled and recrystallized, it became rigid and further shrinkage of the hot interior caused the hard shell to break, leaving a sharp crack. If the skin was still plastic and viscous when  the drop shrank, the skin conformed around it and the fluid interior, leaving rounded edges. Most, if not all, rock  structures display one or both consequences of shrinkage. Separations that occurred from shrinkage after the skin set into a hard shell, couldn't conform and broke, leaving sharp edge cracks, as shown in these photos. These breaks tend to form an s-shaped curve; not orthogonal segments. Drops in clusters with membranes still soft and pliable however, show rounded edges and concavities where drops separated and shrank. These cellular segments tend to break parallel and orthogonal, at specific angles particular to each cluster. The angles or dip of the horizontal surfaces vary widely. It seems likely some force was pushing some clusters over, like the wind  or perhaps gravity, was making them topple. The angles from one cluster to another are not consistent, which suggests variable winds or something perhaps expected over a boiling cauldron. Another compelling evidence these boulders are boils, is the columnar geometry of the largest structures. The segmenting is cellular as already discussed, caused by cooling, shrinkage and surface-tension-related skin effects. The  columnar shape however, indicates convection. Vertically elongated clustered polygonal columns are a known effect of heat convection called, what else, convection columns. And what is boiling? It's a process of heat convection. Flat surfaces are left where bubble walls were pressed in tall squarish columns and then fell apart after cooling, shrinking, cracking and segregating. Everywhere boulders are co-joined or conforming to each other in shape, interfaced with puzzle-piece concavities and bulges, because they were fluid and plastic during formation. The granite boulders are visually patterned, precisely as one would expect a viscous frothing fluidized matrix to look, if it were frozen in mid-boil. Compare these formations to viscous drops, bubbles, foams and boils of various fluids, and you can find analog formations with these shapes and features. Look at the sequence of images below, and it's apparent how these bubbles separate. It begins with a thin crack, where a shrinking drop begins to segment into smaller drops. Look at the top left and bottom pictures in this grouping. Then the drops begin to separate and the edges round off along the seam in a fluid-manner, like a bubble. And then they separate completely, like water balloons. These are examples of shrinkage when the skin is still plastic and molds around the coin drop of molten material. Another evidence for boils are top hats - one boulder stacked directly atop another. Consider a viscous mold and drop where the surface  rapidly cools and crystallizes the semi-solid crust. And then more hot fluid pressures up inside, but the bubble's crusty skin can't expand, so fluid gushes out the thinnest skin of the bubble at the very top, thus creating a new bubble stacked atop the old. In the case of a cluster of bubbles, they can stack into these columns. A similar feature is the necklace, where interstitial drops seep out around the base of larger drops forming, a beaded necklace. And one evidence I consider irrefutable is the  ‘water balloon’ effect. The next group of images is of the same rock structure from different angles. I'll just point out the obvious: the top segmented rocks were once fluid sacs, like viscous water balloons that erupted out the top of an older boil and flowed down its back before shrinking, segmenting, and solidifying. Opposite the dripping side of the balloon is a concave site, where drops in the cluster pressed against other drops that have since fallen away. Wind, I suspect, flattened and pressed these bubbles together, forcing the concavities instead of forming the more typical orthogonal cracks and separations seen in the majority of older clusters. The inner folds of the concavities have fluid ripples, the actual impression of turbulent waves and ripples in the separating skin between bubbles. I interpret this as an indication that wind, seismic, or some other cause, was vibrating the bubble. In the following gallery are several more examples, where drops in a cluster pressed together, leaving these concavities beneath overhanging water balloons. There are multiple other patterns in the rock that display fluid-drop-bubble behavior. Large waterfalls of rock can be found where a molten mass erupted from the flanks of a mountain and sheep flowed down its side like a volcanic lava flow. Close examination of sheep-flow patterns show even more evidence, such as the appearance of standing waves. They look just like river waves flowing over a rock. The pattern of a viscous river shows where flows join to form standing waves. Look at the foot of the granite flow and it resembles the foot of a glacier or of a lava flow. Perhaps the most compelling, singular example - this rock formed as a boiling fluid and suddenly froze when exposed to the atmosphere as shown in the next example. Liquid rock has poured out the side of the pillar and froze like a faucet of running water. And here's another example of the same thing - a pouring outflow from a standing column. Like injection molds, the rocks have nubs and tubular pore spouts, where fluid passed between cellular structures. And there's something to be said about the regularity of how rocks section in proportion to their volume. As if there were a frequency causing a harmonic response in the  body of the rock. It could be a seismic vibration from the fluidized boiling cauldron itself, or it could be from sonic shock due to atmospheric winds. It's also possible that the piezoelectric effect of current in the crystallizing skin of the boils, cause vibration. However, there's harmonic resonance that seems to play a role in how these drop segment and separate apart. There are many questions that remain to be answered, about how this rock formed. The atomic and chemical reactions are complex, given the unknown amounts of current and potential involved; the perfusion of elements involved; and the unknown state of Earth's atmosphere. Even Earth's orbit and what it orbited around at the time these rocks formed, is unknown. One thing is for sure, however. These rocks formed in atmospheric pressure. There is no possible way these shapes were produced while confined deep underground. Nor is it possible they were produced by any form of erosion. Forms were caused by a viscous plastic fluid confined only by surface tension. Their shape is self-evident. There is no argument that can be made to deny it. They look like drops and bubbles because they are. There's a reason boulders boiled from the Earth east of San Diego. To understand how this happened, part 2 of the Granite Cauldron will look at the mountains in cells and how they formed. Thank you and cheers! [Music] [Music] 
We first began exploring the crisis in cosmology in 2021. Since then, it has only gotten worse. The word ‘crisis’ as we use it here, does not refer to crisis in the traditional sense. Such as a natural disaster or physical danger. I am referring to crisis in the Kuhnian sense, meaning a stage at which a leading scientific paradigm breaks down due to the accumulation of anomalies and contradictions that the prevailing model cannot adequately address, as well as an unwillingness to question the existing model and/or explore alternatives. Now, since I began the series, I have received numerous messages from individuals in other fields, such as archeology, geology, biology, virology, and even history, telling me that the same thing is happening in their field as well. This suggests that model breakdown is presently widespread and is happening beyond cosmology and beyond the hard sciences. While it is not possible to explore each of these crises individually in the scope of one video, it is possible to conjecture a possible underlying cause for all of  the crises. Arguably it has to do with the nature of predominant paradigms. Thomas Kuhn’s work revealed that once a paradigm becomes deeply entrenched and institutionalized, it becomes dogmatic, hegemonic and unyielding to falsification and change. However, his work does not deeply explore why this happens. In today's show, we will begin to explore the why and the how. Drawing on my background in critical discourse analysis, I posit that a predominant paradigm, meaning an institutionalized paradigm that is officially entrenched and accepted, functions as a form of power, insofar as it operates as a dominant discourse. In order to flesh out what this means, let's define  our terms. Generally speaking, ‘discourse’ refers to the communication of ideas. As a noun, discourse is defined as any form of written or spoken communication or debate. And as a verb, discourse means to speak or write authoritatively about a topic. There are four traditional modes of discourse. They are' ‘narration’, ’description’, ‘exposition’, and ‘argument’. To define these briefly, narration is story- telling. At its simplest, ‘description’ tells us what things are like according to the five senses. It is a form of describing what is observed. ‘Exposition’ is the kind of writing and speaking that are used to inform. The final mode of discourse is ‘argument’. The purpose of argument is to convince through logic. Argument is typically expressed as a theory or hypothesis and involves persuasion. Now, while there are several definitions of paradigm, the most common is quote “a framework containing the basic assumptions, ways of thinking, and methodology that are commonly accepted by members of a scientific community or field”,  end quote. By this definition, a paradigm will necessarily contain each of the aforementioned modes of discourse. In this way, a paradigm can be understood as a type of discourse. Indeed, the word ’paradigm’ and ‘discourse’ are often used interchangeably. And a predominant or entrenched paradigm therefore  can be understood as an official or dominant discourse. As the name suggests, dominant discourse is the language and actions that appear most prevalently within a given society on a given topic. It is the official and officially recognized narration, description, explanation, and communication of a particular idea or topic. Dominant discourse entails the ultimate emergence of one discourse as dominant among other competing discourses, and this requires  power. In critical discourse analysis, we know that dominant discourses or dominant paradigms, reflect the beliefs and ideas of those who have the most power in society. This is partly because the meaning-making apparatuses are traditionally in the hands of the powerful. Simply put, those with the most power are able to define the narrative. And once this narrative becomes deeply ingrained and institutionalized, it is taken for granted as true, or obvious. According to CDA, a problem with dominant discourse is that it can become so ingrained within a society that few people challenge it. Without these challenges, quote, “...few new ideas enter the mainstream. The society thus may stagnate and fail to progress.” End quote. Because it has the power to define the parameters and move the goal posts, a dominant discourse or paradigm narrows and limits the response to the discourse, and furthers the uncritical participation by individuals within it. While a dominant discourse may be brought in scope, such as in the case of a broad scientific paradigm for instance, it narrows and/or reduces the public's options for dealing and interacting with it. In addition quote, “...even when people want to challenge the dominant paradigm, they may fail to do so if they lack the power to get their message... far enough into the public eye.” End quote. Now it cannot be overstated that the power to widely disseminate ideas, especially new ideas, is linked to money and funding. This is  especially true in the field of cosmology. As plasma physicist Eric Lerner points out in an open letter on cosmology published in the new scientist on May 22, 2004, the development and dissemination of alternative cosmological theories and models has quote,”...been severely hampered by a complete lack of funding. Indeed, such questions and alternatives cannot even be freely discussed and examined. An open exchange of ideas is lacking in most mainstream conferences.” End quote. Lerner goes on to lament that quote, ”...virtually all financial and experimental resources and cosmology are devoted to Big Bang studies.” End quote. In addition, all peer review committees that control funding are quote “...dominated by supporters of the Big Bang. As a result, the dominance of the Big Bang within the field has become self-sustaining - irrespective of the scientific validity of the theory.” End quote. The American theoretical physicist and philosopher Sean Carroll published a response to Lerner's letter only one week later, on May 29, 2004. In his response he brazenly maintains that funding alternative research is a waste of time, since the Big Bang theory is so well  established. Carroll states that quote, “...at what point does a scientific theory become so well - established that it's no longer worth listening to alternatives. There's no easy answer. Scientific theories are never ‘proven’ correct; they simply gather increasing evidence in their favor, until consideration of alternatives becomes a waste of time.” End quote. And when exploring whether or not the scientific community should devote a fraction of funding to consider alternatives to the Big Bang, Carroll responds with an emphatic no, stating that funds are finite and quote, ”...we have to use them the best we can.” End  quote. He maintains that the chances that the basics of the Big Bang model are wrong, are quote, “...so infinitesimally small that it's just not worth the bother.” End quote. Now, given the growing inconsistencies with the Hubble constant and the contradictory observations that are coming back every day from the James Webb Telescope, Carroll may have been forced to temper his stance somewhat if he were writing this today. Returning to Carroll's letter, in response to Lerner's point about the lack of alternative ideas allowed at major conferences, Carroll boldly admits that quote, yes “...young people who disbelieve in the Big Bang are unlikely to get invited to speak at major conferences, or get permanent jobs at research universities.” End  quote. Carroll's response to Lerner is a perfect example of dogma and gatekeeping in science, and sounds more like something one would expect a politician to say. In order to be truly empirical and to honor the principles of falsifiability and open debate which (if we recall from the previous show) are supposed to be the driving principles of science, a scientific community should, as a general rule, allocate a percentage of funding to exploring alternatives to the prevailing model, and/or testing the veracity of that model. This is why Carroll's comments and the candid nature with which they are delivered, are so shocking. How can a scientist claim that we have come to the end of the road with respect to our quest for empirical knowledge and exceptionalism and superiority of the Big Bang mirrors claims by politicians and political theorists about politics and governance. For instance in the book, “The End of History and the Last Man” American political scientist Francis Fukuyama argues that liberal democracy has proven to be a fundamentally better system than any of the alternatives. As such, liberal democracy represents quote-unquote, “the end of history.” In other words, liberal democracy is the best and final political paradigm and thus there can be no alternatives, ever. Talk about circular arrogance and self-interest. How can anyone who call themselves a political scientist, declare that history ends with their particular model of  government? The irony of the claim that Western liberal democracy is the best and final form of government for all countries everywhere, is evidence of the reality that many Western liberal democracies are presently in a state of utter chaos and societal collapse or decline. For instance, the United States, with its exemplary and enviable constitution, has been in decline for decades and is currently plagued by the chaos and confusion of government-sanctioned identity politics and relativism run amok. In addition, the U.S has one of the highest poverty, unemployment, incarceration, mental health and addiction rates in the western world. These are all signs of a culture in deep crisis and let us not even begin to mention the role of the mainstream media in all this. As is the case with standard cosmology, rather than address crisis and breakdown, those presently in power in the United States tend to double down on a broken and failing model. Whether we are talking about the crisis in cosmology or the crisis in Western culture, reluctance to question a broken model or system, reflects the dogmatic, hegemonic and unyielding nature of institutionalized ideas and predominant paradigms, including within the institution of science. As the American economist Thomas Sowell once noted quote, ”Some things must be done on faith, but the most dangerous kind of faith is that which masquerades as ‘science.’” End quote. Sowell has also observed that oftentimes, what makes an idea or theory correct is the fact that people's careers depend on it not being wrong. And he has stated that quote, “It takes considerable knowledge just to realize the extent of your own ignorance.” End quote. One can also argue that it takes considerable wisdom. The Philosopher Socrates was once told by the Oracle at Delphi that he was the wisest person in all of Athens, to which he replied something along the lines of, ”Nobody knows anything and I know that I know nothing. Thus, if I am wiser than others, it is only because I recognize my own ignorance.” This statement by Socrates can more or less be interpreted as, “The wisest person is the one who knows that he know nothing.” It is similar to a Chinese proverb that translates to quote, “The wise man knows he knows nothing, but the fool thinks he knows it all.” End quote. Now, we can probably assume that Socrates did indeed know that he knew many things and was very wise, but the implication or lesson of his statement is that we should never stop learning, and never stop seeking. That just when we think we know, there is so much more to discover. Another way to say this, is that we don't know what we don't know. And this is why we must never stop seeking, especially for those who claim to be scientists. So, how do we go from the humble wisdom of ancient philosophy to the dogmatic arrogance of present-day science and social science? The answer is very complex and cannot be explored in one show, but much of the problem lies in industrialization and the related specialization of knowledge and science. Since industrialization, science and scientific peer review, funding has become increasingly specialized and linked to capitalist enterprise and big business. This growing government-science-business alliance demands and forces specialization and acquiescence to particular dominant ideologies and interests. For instance, the unquestionable greenhouse theory of atmospheric change currently directs everything from city planning to corporate investment. Some examples are the city planning initiatives known as green cities, and more recently, 15-minute cities. These are official initiatives that aim to make municipal developers and businesses conform to particular social environmental interests. Now, when policy demands consensus in science and dictates what type of science is acceptable, and when institutionalized science is happy to oblige, then  we are no longer dealing with objective science. This suggests that there's a growing relationship between institutionalized science and institutionalized power. If scientific change was merely about gradually shifting scientific perspectives that come about due to model falsification, as Austrian-born philosopher Karl Popper and others have claimed, then why was Galileo imprisoned for life for his new perspective on cosmology? And why  was Italian philosopher and cosmologist Giordano Bruno burned at the stake for his? Both of these men promoted alternatives that challenge the cosmological narratives of the catholic church, which was  the dominant power structure at the time. It should be noted that many believe that Bruno was executed for his views on religion and not cosmology. But it stands to reason that his oppositional cosmology did not help his case. Now, while predominant paradigms and power structures no longer burn opponents at the stake or sentence them to house arrest for life, they do still demonize and mock opponents and critics. For instance, in his response to Eric Lerner's critique of Big Bang cosmology and the lack of funding for alternative theories and models, Sean Carroll goes as far as to call Lerner dumb and quote, ”...a crackpot who claims that the Big Bang has no empirical successes.” End quote. It should be noted that, in addition to Lerner, the open letter in cosmology was signed by 33 scientists, the first among them being Halton Arp. Halton Arp was an American astronomer and critic of the Big Bang, along with other observational astrophysicists, Arp maintained that redshift observations of galaxies and quasars contradict the Big Bang theory's hypothesis that redshifts are caused by universal cosmological expansion. This is one of the hallmarks of the crisis in standard cosmology. Many of its assumptions and suppositions are contradicted by observational data. Now, are we to believe that a credentialed and highly regarded astronomer and observational astrophysicists such as Halton Arp is dumb or a crackpot? Of course not. What Arp and others are actually being condemned for, is daring to criticize and oppose the predominant cosmological paradigm. When a scientific paradigm and its gatekeepers appear far more interested in self-preservation and forced consensus than empirical observation and debate, then we are no longer talking about science and are firmly in the domain of predominant power. However, despite the present state of science, and cosmology in particular, there is reason to hope. If we recall from previous shows, in the ’Paradigm Shift’ cycle, crisis is followed by ‘Model Revolution’ and eventually ’Paradigm Change’. While it may take decades, or even centuries, for the change to happen, once a prevailing model is at the crisis stage, Revolution and Paradigm Shift are inevitable. Indeed, it is the crisis that triggers the eventual  revolution. In this respect, one can argue that the crisis in cosmology is actually an opportunity. As one  viewer pointed out in a comment to the previous show, the Chinese word for crisis is a combination of the words [danger] and opportunity. According to ancient Chinese philosophy, opportunities often arise from crisis. With respect to science, this suggests that crisis or model breakdown, is also an  opportunity for innovation and breakthrough. The current cosmological model has given us a hundred years of darkness: dark matter, dark energy, black holes - these still unproven concepts have done little to help us understand the nature of the universe. While theories like general relativity have helped to usher in an acceptance and celebration of paradox and absurdity. Both within cosmology and in the broader culture. The Standard Model ultimately views the universe as dark, random, disconnected and  incomprehensible. As such, it offers little hope or meaning. So, how might a different cosmological model impact  society? The answer to this question depends on the nature of the new model and its world view. One alternative that presently exists, and which has a radically different perspective than the present Standard Model of cosmology, is the Electric Universe model of cosmology. The EU model posits that electricity is the driving force in the cosmos and also that countless electromagnetic fields connect all things in the universe at all scales in a complex dynamic structure. This notion of an integral connectivity is especially interesting and thought-provoking. The idea of a force that permeates all things from the most infinitesimal to the most massive or galactic and connects all things, is one that should pique our interest. Not least because it hints at a far more cohesive universe than we are led to believe exists. This has  both practical and philosophical implications. It is impossible to know which model might one day replace the Standard Model. But one thing we can say for certain is that we have not reached the end of history with respect to cosmology and our understanding of the universe. Far from it. Like Socrates and the ancients, it may be wise to concede that there's still so much that we do not know and so much to discover. It is an interesting and exciting time to be alive. [Music] 
You've just entered the theater of an alien sky. If the words and images seem strange to you there's a reason for this. Our world was once a vastly different place. To experience this won't hurt you and there is nothing to fear. In these discourses, we've followed the evolution of a planetary configuration close to Earth stretching across the ancient sky. Centered at the north celestial pole, it remained stationary for an extended period at this position. That's the underlying nature of the primeval Sun remembered around the world. We've noted that the named planets progressively emerged from a dusty plasma cloud, identified in mythic accounts as the great sea of primeval chaos. The differentiation of the planets, and their observed movements in relation to each other, and the electrical activity between these bodies provided the core content of ancient creation mythology. In the original accounts, creation meant events visible to humans on Earth. We've named three planets in the mythic Great Conjunction based on recorded astronomical traditions that trace to the birth of astronomy in ancient Mesopotamia. Saturn as the overarching luminary, named as the primeval Sun; Venus as mother goddess and radiant eye, heart and soul, and Mars as the dark, reddish innermost body, the child in the womb of the goddess, the pupil of the feminine eye of the primeval Sun. We've followed the emergence of a triangular form, recalled as the first form, the luminous seed of creation. And we've identified this unique form as the concrete celestial referent for the popular 3-fold goddess, three faced goddess, or three goddesses in one. We've noted as well the explosive discharge activity associated with this triangular form, and the essential role of the discharge ejecta as the mythic primeval matter of creation, the very material from which, in the creation stories, the gods were said to have constructed a great citadel in the heavens, the legendary homeland of the gods. Through local storytelling and re-enactments across the centuries, this celestial dwelling came to be remembered as the ancestral homeland of every nation recounting these events. These core themes of an archetypal memory have taken us to the critical moment at which a bright crescent, appeared on the gas giant Saturn due to light from the Sun. This moment provides an extraordinary test of the reconstruction as a whole. Once we place the named bodies in 3-dimensional space, centered at the celestial pole, and allow for an illuminated crescent on Saturn, an inescapable conclusion will follow. The crescent must have rotated visually with the rotation of the Earth, in a precise relationship to a cycle of day and night, with no counterpart and no analogy in anything occurring today. A star in the center of a rotating crescent. The image is recorded around the world. A crescent which, given the circumpolar placement, must have turned around the polar center in a daily cycle of brightening and dimming. No ambiguity, no compromise allowed. When seen with eyes wide open, how credible are the popular claims of historians, archaeologists and comparative mythologists when they identify the symbolic crescent as our moon? By what reasoning would ancient skyworshipers have extravagantly and irrationally placed our little crescent moon into a configuration never seen, but recorded independently by humans around the world? Always keep in mind that the mythic crescent does not stand alone. The great star of Venus in the center of the crescent is just one enigma in a crowd of unsolved mysteries. A particularly powerful addition comes from the mythic world mountain, a column of fire and light rising along the polar axis to pierce the crescent. That's what gave the crescent it's mythic identity as the cleft peak, the horned peak, the twin arms or twin pillars of the sky - a subject we'll review one theme at a time. In it's juxtaposition with the revolving crescent, the polar mountain adds crucially to the midnight appearance of the crescent in the most celebrated moment in the archaic daily cycle. No contrived reconstruction will ever account for this symmetry. And that's why a radical break from common understanding is so essential, as we intend to make crystal clear in the episodes to follow. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project at Thunderbolts.info In a recent Space News episode, we reported on two 2016 scientific studies that each serve potentially fatal blows to the hypothesis of dark matter. The first of these studies, reported in September of last year, found that the acceleration and the rotation curves of both spiral and irregular galaxies could be explained by visible mass alone with no Dark Matter necessary. Professor of physics and astronomy David Meritt says of the findings: "Galaxy rotation curves have traditionally been explained via an ad-hoc hypothesis that galaxies are surrounded by dark matter. The relation discovered by McGaugh at al. is a serious, and possibly fatal, challenge to this hypothesis, since it shows that rotation curves are precisely determined by the distribution of the normal matter alone. Nothing in the standard cosmological model predicts this, and it is almost impossible to imagine how that model could be modified to explain it, without discarding the Dark Matter hypothesis completely." Another study reported in December presented a statistical analysis of mini spiral galaxies, and found a so-called "unexpected interaction" between dark matter and ordinary matter. A co-author of the study states: "Most dark matter, according to the most credible hypotheses, would be non-baryonic or WIMP. It would not interact with ordinary matter except through gravitational force. Our observations, however, disagree with this notion." In this episode, physicist Eugene Bagashov analyzes additional recent studies that raise even further doubt of the Dark Matter hypothesis and he explores the growing scientific case for dark matter alternatives. Following the recent Space News episode featuring astronomer Barry Setterfield, I'd like to briefly review some of the other recent studies regarding the dark mater hypothesis. First of all, there have been news from several experiments that theoretically could detect processes involving dark matter particles. For example, the team of researchers working with Fermi Space Telescope indicates that there are no signs of dark matter particle annihilation nor decay. These processes should take place if dark matter particles could interact not only gravitationally but also perhaps through weak nuclear force. The gamma-ray flux, measured by the Fermi telescope from low Earth orbit, over the course of several years, so far have not shown the evidence for any significant Dark Matter presence. Experiments on and below the surface of the Earth have also failed to detect any specific Dark Matter processes. There have been news from PANDA X experiment in China. They've used 300 kilograms of liquid xenon to detect the collisions of its atoms with the supposedly present dark matter particles and over the course of at least 66 days, haven't detected any single event. At the same time the article published by the team of experimenters, claims that this laboratory at present is the most sensitive to dark matter on earth. Another similar experiment called LUX is also using liquid xenon and it also have recently reported the complete absence of events of Dark Matter candidate detection. 20 months of observations, from October 2014 to May 2016, had yielded zero observed events. Third experiment, using the same technique, is Xenon 100. 477 days of data taking have not resulted in a detection of a single dark matter particle interaction. The Large Hadron Collider, which once was a big hope for finding lots of what is called new physics, has also not produced any new findings in the recent years. What it does now is basically refining the previous measurements with more and more statistics and putting more and more strict constraints on the theoretical physicists' proliferative imagination; speaking of which I would like to remember a story from the end of 2015 when there was a message from experimenters at LHC stating a possible detection of a two-photon peak at the energy of around 750 Giga electron volts. This was quickly followed by literally hundreds of papers submitted by theoretical physicists, each stating his own hypothesis on what this peak might stand for. Some of the versions included possible Dark Matter connection, but perhaps the most embarrassing was the fact that this peak just disappeared a few months later after accumulating more data. It turned out to be just a statistical artifact. But the social phenomenon of these theoretical physicists to rush has itself turned into the object of public and scientific attention, including some jokes and sarcastic publications. In the previous episode of Space News on dark matter, Barry Setterfield has already made the point that there is a more or less suitable mathematical alternative to the Dark Matter hypothesis, the Modified Newtonian Dynamics or MOND for short. In the recent years other theories have also appeared. Some of them are quite eclectic, trying to tie various physical concepts with gravitation. I think the most interesting of them is the so-called entropic or emergent gravity. It seems that a few people were developing it even earlier but the most popular version of it nowadays is the one proposed by Erik Verlinde. In his paper, published in 2010, he states that the amount of information associated with matter and its location could be measured in terms of entropy. Changes in this entropy, when matter is displaced, lead to an entropic force which, as he shows later, takes the form of gravity. So its origin lies in the tendency of the system to maximize its entropy and is thus thermodynamic in nature and isn't actually a result of any fundamental force of nature. I'll remind that, today, four forces are considered to be fundamental and that is electromagnetism, gravitation, weak and strong nuclear forces. In case of Verlinde's theory, the fundamental interaction that leads to emergence of gravity would most likely be electromagnetic. He also gives examples of other emergent forces such as osmosis and similar entropic forces in colloidal systems where the fundamental interaction is clearly electromagnetic since all the mechanical forces, such as pressure or elasticity, are electromagnetic in nature. Now I'll try to explain, in simple terms, how I interpret the basic idea of Verlinde's theory. Let us consider, as an example, the system of two point masses, A and B. We always might draw a sphere centered on one of those, for example A, with the radius equal to the distance from A to B. In this case, the mass B would lie on the sphere. Such a system might be treated in informational sense. That is, for example, the position of the body B with respect to A, might encode some information. Let's say we'd divide the whole sphere in 100 sectors of the same area and each sector would correspond to some number. Then the current position of the body B on the sphere would point at one of those numbers, thus giving us the according information. Let us now consider another case when the body B is slightly closer to the body A. Now we might repeat the same drawing procedure but soon we would find that the number of sectors, that we might divide the sphere in, is actually less. If we try to keep the same area of sectors it is obvious that we couldn't fit the same amount on the smaller sphere. So the amount of information that we might encode in this the smaller system became less. Thermodynamically, this means that the entropy has increased and the system now might provide less ordering. So the system with masses situated closer together is thermodynamically more stable and it is in this direction that the evolution of the closed system would go. And there is an effective entropic force that arises to guide this evolution. It is possible to formally derive the according equations and Verlinde does that in his paper. In my opinion, the idea is quite interesting and, at the very least, deserves a careful and thorough analysis. However, there are some problems and perhaps the weakest part of this theory is its reliance, at least in mathematical terms, on the so-called holographic principle and AdS/CFT correspondence. Both of those are pretty specific theoretical conjectures and are highly speculative in nature. Anyway, what interests us here in the given context is that, based on his own approach, Verlinde seemed to have succeeded in acquiring equations that are practically identical to Milgrom's MOND equations for large-scale gravitating systems such as galaxies. And more than that, in December of 2016, there appeared a publication that claimed incredibly accurate confirmation of Verlinde's predictions for the case of gravitational lensing. Of course, the very phenomenon of gravitational lensing is somewhat doubtful though Verlinde's theory could actually shed more light on its nature. If gravitation is not even a fundamental force but some emergent effect, maybe this would also concern the propagation of electromagnetic waves. That way or another, the theory is there and the publications that seem to suggest its practical value are starting to appear. So now, not only we don't register any dark matter particles but we also have at least three alternatives to Dark Matter hypothesis itself. First one comes from plasma dynamics, the second one is MOND and the third one is Verlinde's emergent gravity. In my opinion, it is a very good situation for science as such and one should try to encourage the existing controversy since it is the controversy that is the real life of science. This actually brings hope for the academia as a whole with its dogmas of settled science and possibly could even serve as a sort of a pivotal point for the scientific revolutions in other areas in the coming years. With the current political situation in both the European Union and the United States, as well as the imminent stock market and banking system crisis, it is entirely possible that they would spark major scientific debates in the areas that only recently were considered to be totally settled. But as the scientific institutions would try to adapt to the new reality and shifted financial flows, the situation would become different. In my opinion this provides a certain opportunity for many alternative schools of thought, including the Electric Universe paradigm.

[Music] ”The plague of 1348 A.D. was  the greatest, most universal and mortally devastating that ever ravaged this globe! It never had a parallel either before or  since”. Thus wrote scholar Thomas Short in his historical scientific treatise of 1749 A.D. He remarked, ”We have a more particular history  of it, than of any that preceded it; for as it visited every inhabited corner of the Earth, so every nation or people that understood letters, kept records”. Its  spread was implacable, relentless and devastating. Short minutely details the cataclysmic death rates that followed it from nation to nation and town to town. Death rates varied but collective data suggests that in the final mortality count, perhaps as much as 80 percent of the world population perished. Hear this typical quote “In some few places it was as favorable as to leave a third part of men alive, in others it took fifteen out  of sixteen.” Compare this to one of the most devastating of modern human infections, the  Spanish flu epidemic circa 1920. In this recent event, some 50 million perished out of a world population of around 2,000 million or around 2 percent worldwide. The bubonic plague of 1348 A.D. where Short alludes up to 80 percent of all peoples perished was by  comparison a horrendous scenario. More modern sources believe it was more like 30 percent of the world perished, but the comparison is still vast. So, what made this plague, normally attributed to the bacteria Yersinia pestis, so virulent, highly contagious and invasive? In modern times this same bacteria is still deadly, but the death rate is comparatively mild. Why this  modern comparative lack of virulence? We have much evidence to examine, for as Thomas Short notes, the event is well documented. For  instance, the prices of all foodstuffs, the treatments, incubation times, localities, death tolls, spectrum, vulnerable victims and numerous well-recorded data of let's say the obvious, more mundane type. But what is more baffling, interesting, and highly contentious, are the accompanying geophysical dramas. These clues, I contend, lead us to a deeper understanding of the tragic virulence of this, and indeed other related catastrophic, but less virulent,  plagues that followed. Let us look at some of these intriguing observations that raise questions as to how unusual the events of that time were, compared to the relative stability of today's placid environment. Thomas Short draws from the chronicle of Magdeburg and numerous sources, to illustrate the accompanying phenomena, in  the 1348 A.D. bubonic plague. It began in Cathay in Asia. By reason  of an igneous vapor or sulfurous fire, breaking forth from the Earth or falling from heaven, which utterly consumed men, beasts, houses, stones, and trees to the very ground. And stretch forward, rolling on smoking balls of stinking pestilential fire for 60 miles of the continent, killing insects and vermin. This plague killed  men in two or three days. In Greece and Italy earth- quakes swallowed many cities, castles and towns. Mountains in  Cyprus were thrown together as one. Famine was everywhere with terrible floods, storms and tempests. Fearful meteors of flames and fire in the air, succeeded  by excessive drought and want of water, with the destruction of most animals and vegetables. The fens of marshes dried up. A great comet, called Negra, appeared, during which followed great earthquakes, tempests, great thunder and lightning. Several towns, villages, mountains  and thousands of people were swallowed up. The courses of rivers were stopped, and great chasms in the Earth opened up, and sent forth bloody liquids. Strangely, women spontaneously aborted in all countries. The rivers gushed crimson, comets, meteors fire beams, and the heavens were on fire. To our modern skeptical ears much of these lamentations seem ridiculous. But remember, these are not from just one isolated witness, but from many sources of many countries, and the death toll supports what one would otherwise read as something out of Dante's inferno. However, let  us take at least 50 percent of these testimonies as valid. They strongly suggest electromagnetic phenomena that are seen even today in volcanoes, earthquakes and tornadoes and the electric phenomena observed in dramatic weather. However, these historical observations in 1348 A.D. suggest a grossly more vigorous scenario. As we contemplate these extraordinary factors, let's dwell on what we can reasonably deduce the overall controllers of weather, volcanoes,  earthquakes, and tsunamis are, and their relationship to causative cosmological  factors. The Sun, planets, meteors, comets and the broad spectrum  of electromagnetic wavelengths, such as gamma rays, cosmic rays and relativistic radiation, are all implicated as moderators of life on Earth. Least we forget, the effect of the plasma environment in the solar system and  beyond and its support of electrical and magnetic phenomena such as Z-pinches. The rigorous foundational work of Danish physicist Professor Henrik Svensmark at the Division of Solar System Physics convinces us that the Sun with its CMEs, solar flares, and various radiations, has much control over Earth's cloud cover, via their moderation of cosmic ray effects. Svensmark comments, “There is a beautiful correlation between the number of cosmic rays hitting the Earth and its cloud cover.” He notes, that it is apparent that the Sun moderates that by means of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and other phenomena. Thus the Sun directly influences Earth's  weather. Noted meteorologist Paul Dorian sums this up. “Over the long term  the Sun is the main driver of weather and climate on Earth and it is also connected to such phenomena as the Aurora Borealis. It controls the upper atmospheric high- latitude blocking, and the influx of cosmic rays into Earth's atmosphere. The influx  of cosmic rays into the Earth's atmosphere from outer space tends to increase dramatically during solar minimum”. Interestingly, there is evidence that solar activity plays a role in volcanic activity on our planet. In fact, in times of low solar activity such as the current solar minimum, volcanic activity tends to rise. The Tambora volcanic eruption in Indonesia during 1815 is connected to the unusually long period of low solar activity known as the Dalton minimum, 1795-1823. The following year of 1816 was unusually cold throughout much of the world, and it is now referred to as the year without a summer. Yet another study suggests that the increasing cosmic rays during times of low solar activity, actually  causes an increase in volcanic activity. Another theory suggests that solar flares may cause changes in atmospheric circulation patterns that abruptly alter the Earth's spin. It's now recognized that earthquakes are heavily influenced by electrical factors, whether from distortion of rocks and the subsequent generation of electric currents, or by telluric currents from within the Earth that are probably linked to the Solar-Earth axis. Similarly, volcanoes have a high incidence of lightning discharge, often explained by friction between gaseous particles, radon or, in my opinion, directly from solar influences. The influence of electricity on living forms, and more particularly, on viruses, molds, and bacteria and other  possibly pathogenic organisms. For instance, an atmosphere of largely positive ions encourages bacterial growth. The influence of sunspot minima is characterized by weakening of the interplanetary magnetic field near the Earth which allows for the entry of cosmic rays. Additionally, Svensmark notes when galactic cosmic rays collide with the atmosphere, they produce a cascade of secondary particles, including neutrons and muons that continue to penetrate the atmosphere. The cascade continues until the particle energy becomes so low and cosmic rays are effectively stopped. This happens around the 16- to 20- kilometer mark. However, under more intense bombardment, or lack of moderating solar influence, significant neutrons, and other electromagnetic radiation, reach ground level and increased mutation rates along the mitochondrial axis. This could dramatically affect the virality of any  microbe, or cell for that matter. Modern studies also reveal the carriage of bacteria, viruses and micro particles at very high altitude vectors above the Earth, making them more vulnerable at sunspot minima to the effects of all radiations, including X-rays as they descend back to Earth. This combination of what I regard as electrical phenomena, lends a powerful case to its effect on biological growth of all organisms, but not only with phenomena such as death from drought and famine, but at a molecular level. I postulate the very large electromagnetic influence from comets, the Sun, and extraneous electromagnetic invasions, influenced the Earth's electric status and led to chaotic growth and virulence of the plague bacteria. Both in 1348 A.D. and in preceding and  future events, such as the little ice age with its Wolf, Spörer and Maunder chaotic weather minimums. These were also times of sunspot minima. These world-changing weather patterns were not only extremes in temperature, but more particularly a collection of chaotic, as distinct from predictable seasons. For instance, crop destroying rains at harvest time, pollen destroying super winds, long hot droughts bringing famine and pestilence, rainy summers, encouraging mold, destroying fungi. Nature often uses triggers based on hard to pinpoint factors when losing its newest progeny. We see swarms of termites loosed under precise signals, bad weather or clever triggers. We see inexplicable mice plagues seasonal flus, wars and lotus swarms. Many and varied are nature. But what if nature relies on electromagnetic signals and these become chaotic. I suspect the devastating 1348 A.D. bubonic plague illustrates just such a black picture. [Music] 
The Electric Universe The Electric Universe -- The Essential Role of Plasma -- What does it mean to say we live in a plasma universe? And why is the plasma universe, an Electric Universe? We typically describe matter as solids, liquids, and gases. But across the cosmos, plasma is the most pervasive and fundamental state of matter. It's the electrical behavior of plasma that assures us there's no empty space, in space. No domain anywhere is entirely free from electric and magnetic fields. That's the reason for our oft-repeated mantra: There are no islands in space. The continuous electrical conversation occurs everywhere. if we're better at detecting this energetic conversation today, that's because advanced instruments give us a much closer view and not just across the sliver of visible light on the spectrum. It's freely moving charged particles that give plasma its electrical characteristics, including its conductivity. Electric currents are essential to comprehending the new picture of space. Electrified plasma creates surprisingly lifelike responses, and it creates similar behavior at all scales. From microscopic up to galactic dimensions, the responses to an electrified environment are fractal-like: plasma in the lab, plasma in computer simulations of charge, and plasma structures in remote space show virtually identical geometries. So, it's the plasma universe that makes our Electric Universe possible. Now, it's the job of astronomers, astrophysicists and mathematicians to take up the challenge. How far can the discovery of the Electric Universe take us in our understanding of events in space? Events close to home and in the farthest reaches of the cosmos. One thing you can count on is this, the story at the Electric Universe will continue at Thunderbolts.info 
[Music] Dave Talbott and myself have been collaborating on a historical reconstruction for over 40 years now. I thought the audience might be interested in a  walk down memory lane and a bit of ancient history. The following video is the first of several that will attempt to outline our principal findings. In 1979, shortly after the publication of the archaic Sumerian hymn, ‘The Exaltation of Inanna’, I wrote an article arguing that Inanna as the planet Venus was best understood as a comet-like phenomenon.  I was inspired to investigate the Inanna traditions by the eccentric writings of Immanuel Velikovsky whose ‘Worlds in Collision’ had caused a scientific uproar when it was published in 1950. It was Velikovsky's claim that Venus presented the appearance of a giant comet during the mid-second millennium BCE, and that this catastrophic event could be used as a benchmark to launch a revolutionary new approach to ancient chronology. Shortly thereafter, while attending a Kronos-sponsored symposium in Princeton, New Jersey, I was informed of the recent publication of ‘The Saturn Myth’ by one David Talbott. Talbott, it will be remembered, was the publisher of the seminal and hugely popular Pensée series during the early 1970s, examining the scientific basis of Velikovsky's writings. Upon contacting Dave by phone, I learned that he too had arrived at much the same conclusion vis-a-vis the cometary origins of the Inanna traditions. Finding a kindred spirit in Dave, we eventually agreed to jointly author a series of articles for Kronos on the Venus comet. The basic thrust of our findings was that yes, while Venus did indeed present the appearance of a comet-like apparition in the distant past, since the catastrophic events in question were already attested in the earliest Sumerian and Egyptian texts dating to the third millennium BCE, such events most likely occurred during the prehistoric period, and thus could not be used as a linchpin in any reconstruction of biblical or Homeric chronology as per Velikovsky's thesis. During the 80s and 90s, Dave and I continued to fine-tune and bolster our historical reconstruction, this while authoring dozens of scholarly articles on comparative mythology. We also traveled about the U.S and Canada presenting our findings. In the mid-90s Dave and I were regular participants on such internet fora as talk.origins and sci.astro, where we argued our case and debated top astronomers and other scientists. Suffice it to say that during the decades in question our arguments fell on deaf ears, both within the catastrophist community as well as within the scientific community at large. In 1994 Dave published ‘The Great Comet Venus’ in Aeon, a masterful analysis of the cometary imagery attached to the planet Venus in ancient sources. In 2001 I published ‘The Many Faces of Venus’, offering a cross-cultural analysis of Venus mythology. Other books fleshing out the evidence pertaining to Venus's recent catastrophic pass followed in subsequent decades. From my perspective the jury is in. During a relatively recent prehistorical period, the planet Venus was involved in a series of extraordinary catastrophes, involving the planet Earth and other neighboring planets, during which it moved on a different orbit than at present and presented the appearance of a long-haired comet-like apparition. Short of a shared delusion, how is it possible to explain the confidence that Talbott and I have in the general accuracy of our historical reconstruction? The short answer is the compelling nature and apparent universality of the human testimony pertaining to Venus's former comet-like behavior. Briefly, Talbott and I analyzed the mythological and linguistic traditions attached to Venus in archaic cultures around the globe, in order to discover whether common patterns could be found. Those patterns, which were otherwise inexplicable by reference to the present solar system, were of a special  interest and, in our judgment, sealed the case. Very early on, Dave and I noticed that Venus was  directly connected with a cosmic tie or band of some sort. In ancient Mesopotamia for example, the planet Venus was intimately associated with the royal headband marking the king as a universal sovereign. The Sumerian word for the headband in question is ‘mus’, a word which is written with the very pictograph denoting Venus in the earliest Sumerian script. Quote, “Numerous texts mentioned the ‘mus’ as a kind of headband or diadem, which is tied on deities and kings...”, end of quote. As more than one scholar  has noted, the pictograph in question certainly resembles the pre-scientific picture of a comet. As we have documented, analogous traditions will be found around the globe. In ancient Meso-America for example, the  planet Venus was specifically associated with the verb k’al = to tie, a term used to describe the tying on of the royal headband during coronation rites. Venus's apparent connection with the tying on of the royal headband in turn, corresponds precisely to Inanna's function in Mesopotamian royal iconography, where she is said to secure or tie on kingship. Already during the third millennium BCE Inanna Venus is said to tie on the kingship for an early king. Quote “When Inanna had tied the lordship with the kingship for Lugalkiginnedudu, she let him exert lordship in Uruk”, end of quote. Now, here is an interesting, albeit unexpected and improbable finding. What in the world could the distant planet Venus possibly have to do with the royal headband and the origins of kingship? As Talbott and I suggested in our very first article together, the Venus tie had reference to a celestial band that at a decisive juncture in Earth history appeared to encircle, or otherwise crown or adorn, the planet Mars. A classic example of this motif occurs already in the pyramid text, wherein Isis Venus was credited with tying on a headband on Horus, the latter identifiable with the planet Mars. Quote, ”She who tied on the headband on her son Horus as a young boy in Akhbit.” End of quote. The Egyptian word for headband here is mdh. The Egyptian hieroglyph depicting this royal tie in turn is virtually indistinguishable from the pictograph employed to denote the planet Venus in the early Mesopotamian script. The fact that both ideograms were employed to describe the head-banding of the king during the sacred coronation ritual confirms their fundamental affinity, and  suggests that their spiraling volute-like form traces to a common celestial prototype. Egyptologists have long noted that Isis Venus was celebrated as a kingmaker. Witness the following observation of Jan Assmann, renowned Egyptologist. ”As mother of the Horus child, Isis is the bestower of legitimate kingship...Isis is the ‘kingmaker’ par excellence...” End of quote. If the historical reconstruction offered here, is based upon an accurate reading of the ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian sources, it follows the Venus's crowning of Mars as a decidedly extraordinary celestial event and as such was likely witnessed around the globe. It stands to reason therefore, that such memorable events would be reflected in the sacred traditions of other ancient cultures. This, despite the fact that this particular conjunction of planets is impossible in the modern sky. As a superior planet Mars cannot appear in front of Venus in order to be crowned by it. Is there any evidence then that ancient cultures conceptualize the planet Venus as a crown? The ancient cultures of Mesoamerica had a long history of astronomical observation, and as a  result more than one of their few remaining codices attest to a detailed knowledge of astronomical phenomena. Maya astronomers took a keen interest in Venus and succeeded in calculating that planet's period to within a fraction of its true value: 584 days. In this instance, as in various other astronomical achievements, the Maya rivaled anything achieved by contemporary astronomers of the old world. How curious then to find that certain hieroglyphs believed to represent the planet Venus, are occasionally depicted as crowning kings and gods in these same  codices. Plate 45 of Codex Borgia for example, depicts a denizen of the underworld with a Venus crown. According to Bruce Bylan, a noted authority on the Codex, the enthroned figure wears a Venus star as his head- dress. Maya monuments elsewhere represent the planet Venus as a half star. In light of this fact, it is notable to find that the half star elsewhere appears as a crown-like headdress. As Talbott and I have emphasized since our first writings on the subject, it is important to underscore the formative nature of these astronomical events involving Venus and Mars. In ancient Mesopotamia, as in the New World, it is the tying on of the Venusian headband that makes the king. A Sumerian text describes the situation exactly. Quote, “Ninurta put on a crown as a sign of kingship, tied on a lapis lazuli ‘mus’ as a sign of enship.” End of quote. According to the Sumerian King List and other early texts, kingship descended from heaven. There is much truth in this archaic  belief. Indeed, Sumerian texts make it clear that it is the planet Venus who endows the local king with kingship. Thus, it is the mythical king and Murkar announces in an early hymn, quote “My kingship the starry lady gave me.” End of quote. The word translated as ‘starry’ here is mul-mul-e, to shine, or radiate, a verb formed from the Sumerian word for star, mul, and hence referring to the luminous splendor of  Venus itself. The clear import of this passage accordingly, is that kingship itself is a gift of the planet Venus. Far from being figurative in nature, the language of this early hymn is best understood in literal fashion. It is  the planet Venus who makes the king by investing him with a luminous headband or crown of glory. What is true of the rights of kingship is also true of the primary rights surrounding marriage, the founding of temples, the layout  of ancient cities, and other rudiments of human civilization. Simply put, human civilization as we know it, would not be recognizable without the extraterrestrial stimulus provided by mind-altering catastrophes associated with the neighboring planets.

Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info The Electric Universe theory proposes that electromagnetism, not gravity, is the predominant organizational force in the cosmos. In the Space Age, countless discoveries; from the networks of filaments connecting objects across vast cosmic distances, to the pervasive magnetism seen at all scales in the universe, to the structure and motions of galaxies themselves; are all better explained from an electrical, rather than gravity-centric, viewpoint. However, this is not to say that the Electric Universe denies gravity's existence. For more than 40 years, the leading proponent of the Electric Universe, physicist Wal Thornhill has worked on an explanation for gravity that actually links gravity and electromagnetism. In recent years, retired nuclear engineer Dr. Raymond Gallucci discovered Thornhill's electrical theory of gravity. Today, Dr. Gallucci presents the simple mathematical modelling he has performed to test the theory's plausibility. I first came across the EU Theory back in 2011 and I don't recall if I first came across the electromagnetic gravity theory at one of the early conferences or via the website but it doesn't really matter because I did come across Wal Thornhill's theory, I know he's presented it at the conferences and there's some videos of it. And given that there's 39 orders of magnitude between the strengths of electromagnetic and gravitational forces, it makes one wonder just what's going on, plus the fact that electromagnetism can have a repulsive aspect as well, at least with coulombic forces. So EU Theory has asked the question: is it even conceivable that these two could somehow be related given such vast differences in their strengths? And the EU theory says yes. And so, my background is a nuclear engineer, I'm not up too much on electromagnetism so what I try to do with my papers is, I tend to take other people's theories and I try to look at them for plausibility from an independent aspect. And so I figured that maybe this electromagnetic gravity is something I could tackle without having, you know, too much electrical background. So I went ahead and gave it a try, and I'll just read, this is from the Holoscience.com website--Electric Gravity in an Electric Universe, and this is Wal's theory that gravity is due to radially oriented electrostatic dipoles inside Earth's protons, neutrons and electrons. The force between any two aligned electrostatic dipoles varies inversely as the fourth power of the distance between them and the combined force of similarly aligned electrostatic dipoles over a given surface is squared. The result is that the dipole-dipole force, which varies inversely as the fourth power between co-linear dipoles, becomes the familiar inverse square of gravity for extended bodies. The gravitational and inertial response of matter can be seen to be due to an identical cause. The puzzling extreme weakness of gravity, and again we're talking about 10 to the 39th power with electromagnetism or electrostatic force, is a measure of the minute distortion of subatomic particles in a gravitational field. And there's that nice diagram on the Holoscience and the Thunderbolts website, that shows the three atoms in a vertical line and the slight off-center of the charges of the protons and electrons which, EU Theory alleges, may be what gives rise to gravitation. Continuing with the EU theory on gravity, the 2,000-fold difference in mass of the proton and neutron in the nucleus versus that of the electron means that gravity will maintain charge polarization by offsetting the nucleus within each atom. And that's what's shown on the diagram. The mass of a body is an electrical variable--just like a proton in a particle accelerator. Therefore, the so-called gravitational constant, the G, with the peculiar dimensions of length cubed over mass times time squared is a variable! That's why G is so difficult to pin down. And so, that's just the background which I guess, anybody can find if they look under the electromagnetic gravity, slides from Wal Thornhill. So what I tried to do, and it's shown in my paper, is I took the diagram from the Electric Universe theory of the three atoms, I took three hydrogen atoms for simplicity and they're shown vertically on the EU website. I turned them horizontal, so I put them, I spaced them, I said: three hydrogen atoms of radius R are aligned and equally spaced, at distance of three R, R being the radius of the hydrogen atom from center to center. We are interested in a distortion on the leftmost, which is the reference atom, due to its two neighbors; that is the net electrical force from each neighbor's proton which is shown in the diagram as a gray circle, and the electron which is shown as a dotted orbit. This is a classical representation of the atom, it's not a quantum representation, it's the Bohr atom with the electron orbiting. On average, the electron spends half its time in each hemisphere, as it's going around in its orbit, in each of the neighbors, with the average position being along the alignment and it turns out, if you do the math, the distance is 0.6366 R, so it's about almost 2/3 along the radius, i.e. it’s the average position when it's in each of these hemispheres. And again, that can be seen on the diagram. Both the reference proton and electron will be subject to six forces: attractive one of opposite charge, repulsive one of the same charge, and that's because on the diagram, you'll see that relative to the reference atom, I have two atoms that are to the right of it and each of those atoms has a proton, so that's two of the other forces, and then I've shown the average position of the electron in each hemisphere on those two atoms, and that comprises the other four positions. So I'm basically looking, I've taken what's a dynamic situation, I've tried to make it static so I could do some calcs. And I'm showing the reference atom, its electron, its proton being affected by basically, six other charges, two of those being the stationary protons, the other four being the average position of the rotating electrons in each hemisphere on the other two atoms. The vector sum of these six forces will constitute the net electrical force on the reference proton and electron and indicate the degree of distortion imposed on the reference atom from its two neighbors. Remember that the EU theory is that there is a distortion due to the presence of other atoms, and this very slight distortion is what accounts for the gravitational force. Based on symmetry, the center atom should experience no distortion, that's the atom, the hydrogen atom in the middle, it has two, one on each side of it, so it's a symmetric position, so it wouldn't experience anything in this diagram that I'm showing. The rightmost atom should experience the exact opposite distortion to the reference atom, my reference atom is the one in the far left and so the one on the far left and the one on the far right, I can analyze for either one of them being affected by the other two, and just for convenience, I worked on the left atom. So I did some trigonometry and I came up with this formula that shows the distance between the electron's position and the reference electron position and the position of each of the other average positions of the electrons in the other atoms. And after I've worked out that formula, and I had to do some calculations, and I set up a spreadsheet to analyze each of 360 degrees as the electron on the reference atom goes around in its orbit at each of those three hundred and sixty degree positions, I calculated the distance between it and the other reference electrons and protons, and knowing those distances, I was then able to calculate the net force on that electron from each of those positions and do an averaging over time in order to get the, you know, the average net force on that electron to show whether or not there would be the distortion that is part of the Electric Universe theory. And I have a graph that shows this in the paper, after one performs all the calculations to derive the net force on the reference electron, which is a vector, so direction must also be addressed, it is, fortunately it's, I'm dealing in two dimensions, not three dimensions, I'm not looking at an electron cloud, I'm looking at electron in a circular orbit, again, the classical view. The results can be plotted as shown, they are presented in terms of the near, the closer hemisphere to the middle atom and the far sides, the farther hemisphere from the middle atom. For the electron as it circles the proton, to simplify the presentation, I scaled the results by 4 pi epsilon 0 over q squared, which I put everything relative to that and I set the radius of the atom equal to 1 for the purposes of scaling, so I could do my diagrams, and what I have here on the figure on the paper, it shows that when theta equals 0 when the electron is in the same line as the three protons from its reference atom and the other two atoms, we have the reference electron at both the farthest and nearest positions to the neighborhood atoms. Here, the difference between the net forces, which is shown as a solid line in the diagram, is maximum and it's labeled there as the maximum location. This is also the only position where the directions of the two force vectors are exactly aligned. This difference decreases as the electron positions get closer, until they are equal at theta equals 90 degrees where the near and far side positions coincide. So on my diagram, if you put the electron that's orbiting the reference proton at the top or the bottom, it's the same distance from the other six electron positions and the two protons in the neighborhood atoms. I observe that the difference between the net force peaks at around theta equals 45 degrees, so when the reference electron is about 45 degrees, either upwards or downwards from its nearest, nearest position to the other atom(s), that's when the difference between the net force directions is peak. Having said all this and shown the diagrams again, which one needs to look at to really understand this, the key observation is that over the entire orbit of the reference electron, the net force from the neighboring atoms is repulsive. This means that the electrons in the neighboring atoms push more on the reference electron than the protons in the neighboring atoms pull, so you don't have symmetric forces between pulling by the protons, the attractive forces between proton and electron, and the repulsive force between the other electrons and the reference electron, there is a difference between those two forces, and the net force is a repulsion. As a result, there should be some displacement of the electron orbit and distortion given the asymmetry between the forces acting on the two hemispheres away from the neighboring atoms and opposite to the direction in which the reference proton is pulled. The figure again, shown in the paper, this illustrates the effect on the orbit of the reference electron and what's shown in that figure where I had to scale it up because the distortion is very, it's on the order of like 0.01% so I scaled it up a little so you could see it, it shows that the circular orbit of the electron and the reference proton actually gets pushed inward a little bit on the right side which is the side nearest to the other two atoms. So it's not a pure circle, it's a slightly flattened circle. Now, I also looked at the effect on the reference proton, because now we see that according to EU Theory, we're talking about a dipole being set up, so the electron is being displaced slightly in its orbit. Does the proton also get displaced a little bit? The net force from its neighbor atoms for the proton on the scaled metric is a pull, an attraction of about 0.02 scaling to a value of one. This exceeds the push on the reference electron over the entire far side of its orbit, but remains less than that over most of the near side of its orbit, with the amount by which the exceedance over most of the near side exceeds that over the far side, being greater. So while the reference electron has its orbit pushed away from the neighbor atoms, the reference proton actually experiences a pull towards them. So our reference, as shown in the diagram that Wal presents, clearly not only do we have the reference electron being pushed away slightly from its other atoms, we have the proton on the reference atom being pulled a little bit, so we have kind of a double distortion, in the setting up of the dipole, that might account for the gravitational force due to electro-magnetism. And so, it's not only the distortion of the electron but there's a slight distortion of the proton position, not as much because the proton is more massive. The reference hydrogen atom no longer is symmetric with a circular electron orbit about a centered proton; that thereby suggests the creation of an electric dipole which is what was postulated by Electric Universe theory. So I do have a caveat that I put in here, and the caveat basically is in my calculation, this is a very simple model, I assume that the electron's orbital speed is that of light. There are some references that show electron orbital speed dropping might be maybe 10% or 1% that of light, I don't think anybody really knows how fast the electron goes, certainly not in a quantum mechanical model; I mean, it's just a probability state, anyway. So this is again talking about the Bohr type of atom where you have the classical but, if the electron slows down enough, like down to 1% that of light, then the distortion would be off-scale in my model. So my simple model is valid so long as the speed of the electron is very close to that of light. So after injecting some mathematics, and this is my conclusion, greatly simplified--I have to admit, into EU Theory that gravity can be attributed to an electromagnetic effect, although almost inconceivably smaller, again, we're talking about that 10 to the 39th due to the distortion of atoms by their neighbors into electric dipoles. The possibility of an electromagnetically induced distortion to create an atomic dipole appears plausible. So again, my goal was to take the EU theory and try to do an independent math- physics calculation to see if it was at least plausible, and it turns out that it certainly is plausible, and that's what I was trying to show in my paper and I also was able to show the ratio of the displacements between the electron and proton around the orbit of about 1 to 10,000. So again, you've got much more distortion on the electron than the proton, but the distortion is about 1% of the Bohr radius itself, so the electron doesn't get distorted very much, and the proton is about a factor of 10,000 smaller, so we do have this very very small distortion that is postulated, but it may be enough to actually give rise to the gravitational force being the result of electromagnetic electrostatic forces in atoms themselves. 
You've just entered the theater of an alien sky. If the words and images seem strange to you, there's a reason for this. Our world was once a vastly different place. To experience this won't hurt you and there is nothing to fear. The Labyrinth Dancing ground of the goddess and warrior In taking up the myths and symbols of the labyrinth we face a mystery that has enchanted investigators for thousands of years. And yet despite an impressive library of evidence, even the best experts struggle to find a plausible explanation of this mythic archetype. In these Discourses, we've introduced a radical perspective on the ancient cultures and we've offered a comprehensive interpretation of archaic myths and symbols based on an unusual and at times catastrophic solar system history. Our subject is an ancient gathering of planets extremely close to Earth and remembered around the world. We've proposed that with this referent in front of us, hundreds of ancient ideas including all of the mythic archetypes become predictable in terms that would not be possible, not even conceivable in the absence of the natural provocation we've outlined. The first mythical character we meet in investigating the labyrinth is the legendary warrior and hero Theseus who earned his reputation by doing what all of the great mythic heroes did-- vanquishing chaos monsters and unifying a legendary homeland. In the case of Theseus, the story was localized on the peninsula of Attica said to have been the site of a vast fortress-- The Labyrinth constructed by the legendary king Daedalus. Within the towering walls of the labyrinth, locked away in its central precinct, lived a devouring Minotaur, part man and part bull, usually sewn as a bull's head on a mostly human body. From this starting point, we can ask whether a persuasive explanation of labyrinth mythology could now be possible. The answer to that question will require us to follow several converging threads in the labyrinth story. For many years, in our discussion of Venus mythology, we've emphasized the planet's centrality and its repeated connection to intense electric discharge giving rise to its mythical identity as the animating female heart of heaven displaying explosive radiance and anciently described as the radiant eye of heaven and the glory of the sky. In the course of these explorations, we've also observed that electrical formations linked to Venus acquired varying numbers and varying configurations of discharge streamers, all associated with the axial center of the sky. So the first place to look for clues is the center of the labyrinth itself from which the explosive discharge or celestial glory radiated outward to become the winding paths of the labyrinth itself. An overriding archetype to be explored in connection with the labyrinth is the prototypical conjunction of the mother goddess and the ancestral warrior, the two most dominant archetypal figures in world mythology. Most significant was the emergence of a whirling aspect from the three-legged Triskelion to the swastika along with more complex variations of the symbolic whorl, so it's not surprising to find these varied forms repeatedly connected to the central source of the labyrinth's entwining paths. From these symbolic connections, we would naturally look for an explicit identification of the chaos goddess with the centerpiece of the labyrinth and that is precisely what we find in the example scene here, where the head of the terrifying Medusa with her snaky locks is indeed the heart of the labyrinth but also directly linked to the whirling triskelion formed from the goddess's disordered hair, as we should expect. We can also understand the mythic interpretation that saw the winding paths of the labyrinth as a dark cavern entered by the warrior who then appears to be trapped within the so called 'intestines' of the labyrinth or otherwise engulfed by entangling serpents, marking out the same complex pathways. A closely related theme involves the intricate windings of the rope or thread or an elaborate knot. In the following analysis, we intend to show that the mystery of the labyrinth can be fully explained by concrete, highly electrified plasma formations in the ancient sky. To simplify a complex story, three well-documented phases of this activity can be analyzed. One is radial discharge, the first witness to the evolving plasma formations. The events include changes in both the number and the morphologies of discharged streamers, which plasma science explains in a direct relationship to the energies driving the activity. The emerging symbolism of a four-fold discharge included a diversity of mythical interpretations as four etheric spokes of the so-called ‘Sun wheel,’ four rivers of paradise, four directional winds and four pillars of the sky, all discussed at length in my book 'The Saturn Myth.' With that global language in front of us, there is no stretch needed to connect the center of the labyrinths to the electric discharge activity that gave rise to the labyrinth itself. Second, the whirling aspect first arising from primeval chaos in the form of a three-legged triskelion. The discharge configuration eventually displayed a more complex whirling form, sometimes interpreted as a world-threatening whirlwind or whirlpool. Its most familiar form was the swastika, anciently occurring thousands of years before any of the familiar 20th century adaptations of the symbol. Additional, more complex forms can also be named and the connection of such symbols to the dynamic center of the labyrinth will be crucial to our understanding of the labyrinth's historical origin. As in virtually all stories of the warrior hero, there is a chaos monster close by. The builder of the labyrinth of Knossos, Daedalus was said to have constructed the palace-like fortress to imprison and protect the Minotaur. The Minotaur was half-man, half-bull and was kept in the labyrinth by Minos, ruler of Crete. In mythic terms, the monster can be compared to the bull of heaven slain by the hero Perseus, the legendary founder of Mycenae, or similarly the bull of heaven slain by the Sumerian warrior hero Gilgamesh. By placing the emphasis on the celestial context where they belong, such story elements become valuable complements to the Theseus legend. It was also said that the king's daughter Ariadne fell passionately in love with the hero, a theme placing the story squarely within the archetypal tradition, hero consorting with the daughter of a famous king. It was also said that before Theseus entered the labyrinth to fight the Minotaur, Ariadne gave him a ball of thread which he unwound as he entered the labyrinth enabling him to find his way back by following the thread. This juxtaposition of themes makes it relatively easy to see the unwinding of a coiled thread in its proper relationship to the events by which the labyrinth itself acquired its unique form. Our explanation begins with planets close to Earth and aligned in the ancient polar configuration along a single axis, when four symmetrical discharge streamers radiated explosively from the planet Venus. In this phase of instability the discharge took on a whirling appearance, a form that numerous ancient cultures recorded alternately as a swastika, then a more elaborate whorl. Eventually, the displacement of the aligned planets produced an irregular more complex streamer pattern as Venus and Mars visually danced around the polar center in unstable motions. In that dance, the labyrinthine windings of the discharge streamers acquired the appearance of a towering Citadel in the heavens recorded mythically as the labyrinth. This will explain why the towering structure was celebrated as the dancing ground of Theseus and Ariadne, literary echoes of the prototypical warrior hero and mother goddess, Mars and Venus. In archetypal terms, the labyrinth signified a fortress which the hero, be it Gilgamesh, Heracles, or Theseus, was required to enter to complete a specific task, test, or labor. The investigative value of the labyrinth in this Discourse and in the episode to follow, is that it offers an uncompromising test of predictive ability, while inviting the goddess and the warrior to open additional doorways to broader archetypal symbolism yet to be explored. 
It's rather tough, following two such accomplished story tellers. The story that I want to tell though is one of elegant simplicity. It was that, a title I suggested to David Talbott when I looked at the picture that was emerging from an understanding of gravity, which I spoke about last year, and as I worked on it I understood that the universe really is much simpler then anyone could have considered. But then, at the same time, there was something that occurred in Canada, a presentation which I watched with dismay, called the elegance or the simplicity of everything. I'll see if I can get this to.. it says the connection is lost.. Here we go. So The Elegant Simplicity of the Electric Universe. How come so many clever people can't see it? Only in the last few months that I've found out why. It's an understanding that's important for everyone, including all of you here. Today specialization is the enemy of science. It produces more complication than simplification because experts mislead each other with things, as Tom said: "they don't know they don't know." The result is a useless reflection in a shattered mirror. So, who am I to be speaking to you about the elegant simplicity of the universe? Looking back I can see how I got into this position, how I became a boundary writer of science, as the science editor of the Canberra Times dubbed me some years ago. From the earliest age I was curious about how things worked, or read books and investigated things on my own. Other kids did the same so I didn't consider myself exceptionally clever. Looking back, it seems the event that separated me from my peers was being inspired by an extraordinary story of planetary chaos by Immanuel Velikovsky and his book "Worlds in Collision". This happened while I was in high school. So, I began to question many of the things I was being taught and when I got to university I think I was the only physics undergrad who used to haunt the Anthropology shelves at the library, checking to see whether Velikovsky had cherry-picked his sources or whether he had made a real case to be answered. And I came to the conclusion that he had made a very good case to be answered. So what had Velikovsky done? He'd thrown down a gauntlet to astronomers that they rejected by having his best-selling book burned. So, book burning didn't finish centuries ago. It happened last century. Velikovsky's heresy was to publish that electromagnetism played a dominant role in the solar system, particularly during periods of planetary chaos. Many years later and shortly before Velikovsky's passing, I visited him at his home in Princeton and discussed this issue about the electrical nature of gravity because this was perhaps the single most important thing that the astronomers threw at him. That his mechanism disobeyed Newton's laws. Once again this is the certainty that there's only this law, there's no "what if?" There is some other aspect to the mechanism? So, it has taken me all of the intervening years since then, there's quite a few, to overcome the education I received as a student, to find the few true pioneers of science and to relate this to everyday experience. I firmly believe that the Electric Universe is simple and you could begin to teach it in primary school. It's an amazing and engrossing story which fires the imagination and the explanations relate to everyday experience. The Electric Universe is a cultural, as well as a scientific, revolution that has been millennia in coming. It allows us to understand, for the first time, the obsessive fear of the planetary gods and their doomsday weapon, the mighty Thunderbolt. The phenomenal thunderbolt of the planetary gods is the link between our human story and the science of the electric universe. Some of the renowned scientists of the past like Newton and Faraday, predicted that electricity is the secret to understanding gravity and therefore the universe. But in the early 20th century, following the madness of World War, we reverted to the ancient geometric religious mysticism of Pythagoras and Plato. In fact mathematicians were formerly called geometers. And wartime established a fire hose of government funding of science that hasn't ceased. It has had the unintended consequences of paralyzing progress within huge bureaucratic institutions and fostering censorship in the form of anonymous peer review which stalls even minor advances. Paradigm shifts come from individuals and are resisted vigorously by authorities. The wartime command to large groups of scientists to shut up and calculate has become, with the advent of computers, shut up and simulate! Simulations' pretty pictures are routinely used to persuade non-expert audiences. Science is now in show business producing CGI virtual reality entertainment on big screens. But computer models can only reflect back what you put in. As a scientist, one must attend to what lies beyond any model. Here is M74, a perfect example of elegant simplicity. It's called the perfect spiral galaxy. Cosmologists can't explain its formation or rotation without inventing weird stuff like dark matter and a central black hole. But adding arbitrary patches to a model to make it work on a computer screen is not simplifying and it's certainly not elegant. It's generally a sign that your model is incomplete or just plain wrong. You'll notice on the picture the strings of red spots in M74. They are star birth regions that are brought out in this image. I'll discuss this later because they confirm the Electric Universe. The definition of elegance for a scientific theory or solution to a problem is well-designed, pleasingly ingenious and simple. Symmetry and balance are also often important. But assessments of ingenuity and simplicity are subjective, like an individual's response to modern art. Paul Gauguin wrote: "The history of modern art is also the history of the progressive loss of art's audience. Art has increasingly become the concern of the artist and the bafflement of the public." So where are the art critics of modern science when presented with a chalkboard covered in mathematical symbols, most of which are undefined in any real sense? Critics of this art of branded deniers, as if consensus constitutes a religious truth. Only a belief can be denied and if it's a consensus belief it ain't science as Michael Crichton said in one of these famous speeches. The late astronomer Halton Arp lamented that investigative journalism, or in other words art criticism, in science is dead. The Big Bang is the antithesis of elegance and simplicity with its random explosions and collisions and its multiplicity of forces and particles. Despite this, he is an authority who said publicly that everything is not just simple but astonishingly simple. Neil Turok, director of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Canada speaking on October the seventh last year.. The astonishing simplicity of everything, but that implies you know everything. But I will show you that there are many very basic things that experts don't know they don't know. Neil Turok defined simplicity: "Simplicity means concepts which unify. They bring together disparate ideas, disparate knowledge, make sense of them and simplify." I agree. But adding fudge factors like dark matter and dark energy is the antithesis of simplicity. What other disparate knowledge was canvassed? Certainly not Halton Arp's observational research that shows the universe is not expanding. Certainly not peer-reviewed plasma cosmology that explains it simply and predicts so much in cosmology. Simple concepts are those that explain as much as we possibly can with the least possible number of assumptions. And I agree, that's a good test. The problem is how little theoretical physics actually explains. Quantum physics has no explanation, gravity has no explanation and the two are incompatible. Theoretical physics, as it stands today, is very limited. But as British astrophysicist Mike Disney shows, the number of free parameters (assumptions) in the Big Bang exceeds the measurements. So consensus Big Bang cosmology fails this test at the starting gate. A recent massive supercomputer simulation produced the universe of galaxies that seems to match observations. Despite using concepts that are invalid. So what good are computer simulations? With all the free parameters it could have produced a platypus or koala bear. Nevertheless, simulations are offered as experiments and proof of theories. After describing the Big Bang, Turok said: "The universe has turned out to be stunningly simple. It's simpler than any of our models can explain." But hang on a minute, if none of the models can explain the simplicity, surely all of the models have failed. Now, here's the astonishingly simple equation of all known physics. I would ask, where is life and consciousness in that equation? You'll notice that Peter Higgs gets a mention, the second from the right. Turok said: "They've found the Higgs boson"! No, they didn’t! If the Higgs mechanism explains masses it should be able to calculate the mass ratio of the proton to the electron. It can't. And who in this audience thinks that's simple? That it allows them to understand everything. But here we come to an important qualifier. "The grand unified theory is compact and elegant in mathematical terms." Turok then launches into numbers, Pythagoras' theorem, imaginary numbers, allowing the solution of any equation and an enthusiastic endorsement of mathematics for the rest of the lecture. But unless each symbol and operator can be defined.. pardon me, defined in real physical terms, an equation is physically meaningless. Mismatches with theory cause the invention of ever more particles and forces. Which violates the claim of simplicity and elegance. In fact, mathematics is an art often applied unscientifically to science. Unless you have all of the correct physical concepts and definitions in your mathematical model, the conclusions cannot be relied upon. The art becomes surreal. The genius Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe wrote: "Mathematics has the completely false reputation of yielding infallible conclusions." So we come to art and surrealism and the celebrity, Kip Thorne, Feynman emeritus professor of theoretical physics in Caltech who has this to say about simplicity: "Simplicity is the touchstone in finding new physical laws... if it's elegant, then it's a rough rule of thumb: you're on the right track." Thorne was the executive producer of the sci-fi film Interstellar. The film blurb says: "His math guided the creation of the mesmerizing and the most accurate simulation ever of what a black hole would look like. And it was the product of the year of work by 30 people and thousands of computers." Kip Thorne said: "I think the thing that makes this film different is that the science is woven into this film and into the story from the beginning. And woven in deeply. Real science." Quite the reverse is true, cosmology has become science fiction entertainment. There's nothing scientific about the slide on the right from Thorne's Wolfgang Pauli lecture in Zurich in 2011, "A black hole is made from warped space . . . and space and time." But as Steve Crothers has shown, black hole theory makes no sense mathematically, let alone physically. How do you make a material object out of two immaterial concepts, space and time? As science teacher [Evan Camp] Evan Camp's student asked: "How can smart people believe this stuff?" Recently I found the answer and it shows that our education systems damage our ability to do science. The first thing to do, I think Tom touched on this, is to first know yourself. The distinguished doctor Iain McGilchrist is a psychiatrist, doctor, writer, former Oxford literary scholar who wrote: The Master and his Emissary, subtitled: The Divided Brain and the Making of the Western World. His shorter e-book is: The Divided Brain and the Search for Meaning, which I recommend to you. There are also some excellent Youtube videos, interviews with him and also an RSA animation from which I will have a few images. He points out: The brain is profoundly divided and this organ is profoundly asymmetric. And he asked the question: Why would nature divide brains if there wasn't some use for that? He said: It's not true that one part of the brain does reason and the other does emotion. Both are profoundly involved. It seems the main function of the corpus callosum that join, joining fibres between the left and right hemispheres, is to inhibit the other hemisphere. Something very important is going on here. The right hemisphere reacts faster but inhibits less strongly. I should point out too that physically they are different. One hemisphere is slightly smaller than the other and the left hemisphere is slightly rotated and the surface convolutions are different.. And even the chemical signaling is different on both sides so they have a different job to perform. This is a slide from the RSA academies, the Royal Society of Arts academies in the UK. I presume you've probably all seen the animated swift drawing while somebody is lecturing. This is from the YouTube video that I recommend you to have a look at. In this he shows that the left hemisphere is narrowly focused and attends to detail while the right hemisphere is more broadly focused, it's alert and open to what's going on around. And he gives an example of the chicken. He said: the left hemisphere in the chicken is looking for the seeds amongst the dirt, the right hemisphere is making sure the chicken doesn't become somebody else's lunch. And I think that's a good way to look at it. In other words the left hemisphere is survival, the right hemisphere is a broad picture of what’s going on around you. I wrote to Iain McGilchrist and I sent him a copy of the paper, PDF of the paper which had actually studied the left and right hemisphere and image the activity that goes on when you ask physics questions, of a student. And you'll notice that the left hemisphere lights up like a Christmas tree and the right hemisphere is rather passive. The different colors just referred to different characteristics of what's being asked. Algebraic equation representation is red, the green is periodicity, energy flow is blue. This brings me to: we've all heard of cognitive dissonance, as if you're presented with something that you just cannot handle, it just doesn't make any sense to you. And it seems that it's a result of the differences between the two hemispheres of the brain. The left hemisphere, as I said, has narrow focus, only sees what it expects to see and has automatic machine-like responses. It's about survival. Education in science reinforces the bits rather than the whole picture. So the left hemisphere is involved in the training. It's a vicious cycle because it focuses on aspects we expect to see. You get stuck in a certain way of thinking. Also the left hemisphere needs to be in control. And the left hemisphere people, that's those who have dominant left hemisphere, exhibit denial. We can all think of many examples of this, I think, Michael Shermer's visit to our last meeting as an example. The right hemisphere: meaning comes from understanding the whole. In other words, it's trying to take in the whole picture. And being comfortable, and this is important, with not being able to grasp everything. You don't need to understand the creation of the universe. What's more, he said, happiness comes from understanding your connectedness and engagement with the world. I would say the universe because that's what the Electric Universe is about, connectedness. Left hemisphere, Big Bang cosmology is consequently, I would say, hope-less. McGilchrist's e-book is subtitled: "Why are we so Unhappy?" And this is an, this is the whole thing about the Electric Universe, there is no subject that it shouldn't touch on if it is a real cosmology. He says, happiness comes from social connectedness and a sense of purpose beyond the immediate. I would say that seems to characterize our conferences. There is a great sense of purpose. Modern goal-oriented education, on the other hand, and its constant audit and inquisition, turns off the intellectually adventurous teachers and students. We don't understand the world by putting it together bit by bit. Quite the opposite, in fact. So, Left Hemisphere Training The knowledge that is mediated by the left hemisphere is within a closed system. This is typical of the scientific approach of course, you isolate the small part of something and then try and analyze that. It has the advantage of appearing perfect but the perfection is bought ultimately at the price of emptiness. So you see, the Big Bang is a closed system. The universe expanded from a non-physical point thirteen and a half billion years ago and increasing entropy and disorder is expected but we see increasing order. The universe is not a closed system! Geology is a closed system. So geologists could simply extrapolate things seen today back a few billion years and make up any story they fancied. Biology is a closed system. Each organism is self-contained. Brain circuitry will explain consciousness. Sheldrake and others show this is invalid. The closed mechanical model is wrong! Einstein's inertial frames are closed systems. They have lost all external references. You gotta ask, the speed of light, you know, inertial reference frame with respect to what? Some arbitrary observer. So modern science is empty of real meaning. Left hemisphere dominance is the safeway. A way that minimizes risk and provides a way forward that seemingly is a more secure and logical approach to decision making. The Machine metaphor reduces things to isolated bits and loses sight of the connected whole. Stars are isolated objects, galaxies are isolated objects, we are isolated individuals. It's chickens, picking at seeds in the dirt. Of course, when you're tied up with this narrow view you end up with a whole of mirrors effect. The more we get trapped into this, the more we undercut the things that might have led us out of it and we just get reflected back into more of what we know, about what we know, about what we know, about what we know... So the greatest problem becomes the things we don't know we don't know. More information, we have it in spades but we get less and less able to use it, to understand it, to be wise. These are Iain McGilchrist's words. Instead we go searching in the crap for signals we expect to see. That's my words. "There's a paradoxical relationship", Iain says, "as I know as a psychiatrist, between the knowledge of the parts and wisdom about the whole. It's the machine model that is supposed to answer everything but it doesn't." In other words the theory of everything. This is a perfect example of a hall of mirrors. This is the large hadron collider control room. Experiments are done on computer screens, it's virtual research. In our computerized world the virtual makes something seem more real. As one scientist said, sexy images sell! We see that all the time in the media. The picture, however, has become fragmented and surreal science fiction. Mistakes no longer mean going back to the drawing board, mistakes now need to be de-bugged. It creates a classic hall of mirrors reflecting a single model. Signals buried in noise become statistical discoveries and proof. The computers are programmed to find, deep in the noise, what they expect to see. I think the, the LIGO and the gravitational wave experiment is a prime example. Images on a screen become real discoveries or proof, the Higgs boson, gravitational waves. It illustrates group-think and left hemisphere dominance, a blindness to alternatives. ...Sorry... But paradigm shifts come from individuals using their mind, not large teams using computers, the ultimate black boxes. They invent new forces and particles to reclaim control of the model. The quark, the gluon, dark energy, dark matter. So big science is failing. There have been no fundamental advances for a century. It's accepted that the basis of what we now... what is now known is more or less correct. A Copernican revolution is totally unthinkable within the current system. There are not many differences between the modern academy and the universities in the 16th and 17th century which conformed to the church and to Aristotle's text. The symptoms? Science is non-predictive. There are continual surprises. Counter arguments are ignored or unpublished and the history of science is sanitized to give the impression of progress. What's the remedy? Evan Camp is a teacher, an 8th grade science teacher who ran an Electric Universe group after school. He presented an outstanding talk at EU 2013, Exciting Students with Unsettled Science. It's available on the Thunderbolts.info YouTube channel. He said: "Every mile you go in the wrong direction is really a two-mile error. Unlearning is twice as hard as learning." In fact it's much harder than that because at the end of the first mile you are lost. Because what you have learned inhibits new learning and accelerates forgetting. This requires an active remedial process. It requires a conceptual mediation program as early as possible. Such a program has been tested by Dr. Harry Lyndon in south Australia, with encouraging results. He says, the primary goal of science educators involves helping young people to acquire scientific knowledge with greater facility. To achieve a deeper level of understanding in their studies and for these understandings to be lasting. It has been established, however, that a universal problem in schooling concerns the fact that science learning is evidently difficult for most students. A general conclusion that even students who are successful in examinations are unable to retain and apply scientific concepts. When students move into high school, many experience disappointment because the science they are taught is neither relevant nor engaging and doesn't connect with their interests and experiences. When new information or ideas disagree or conflict with what the left hemisphere already knows, the left hemisphere inhibits or denies the new information and causes accelerated forgetting of the new knowledge or skill. It protects all prior knowledge. Old learning disables new learning. According to Lyndon, it's why old habits die hard. Old Way/New Way Learning where the old and the new are repeatedly contrasted is a method developed by Dr. Lyndon and a colleague and it's an innovative teaching method. It's a system where the students actively and repeatedly contrast the old and the new until the inhibition is overcome. It forces the student to think about thinking. This is important for what is to follow. Because it will help those who follow the Thunderbolts movement to understand the problems others face when confronted with a paradigm shift of the magnitude of the Electric Universe. And also some areas of your own personal denial. So, cosmology must address the infinitesimal as well as the infinite. So let's go to the heart of the matter. Because, incredibly, mass is undefined! In every textbook and encyclopedia the amount of mass is confused with the amount of matter. Perhaps because they both begin with the letter 'M'. This means that no scientist understands E=mc² This confusion allows particle physicists to talk of creation and annihilation of matter which is impossible without understanding what matter is. It's not physics. E = mc² is simply telling us that that mass is a measure of the amount of energy held in matter. Particles have no mass, we're told. And with this ignorance the standard particle model says, subatomic particles have no intrinsic mass which is nonsense. Are they saying protons and electrons have no rest mass, no energy? It seems so. In the standard particle model mass is provided externally by a kind of cosmic trickle of imaginary Higgs bosons. The total cost of finding something dubbed the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider ran over 13 billion dollars in July 2012, at the running cost of a billion dollars a year. That makes it more than 17 billion years, billion dollars wasted, chasing the green of the Cheshire cat. The LHC operates like smashing countless jumbo jets in the mountains and picking over the debris to see how they fly. But the whole is more than the sum of the bits, we can see. We are not dealing with closed systems. Even worse, it's like asking one of Douglas Adams' telephone hygienists to do the investigation. The investigators are not properly trained. Energy is undefined. What you will find in textbooks are examples of different forms of energy. The Big Bang is supposed to have originated from pure energy which is nonsense when energy only makes sense in relation to matter in motion, with respect to all other matter. But matter hasn't been defined in any physical sense involving sensible internal movement. The quantum realm is weird. It's admitted by leading physicists that no one understands quantum mechanics. It's incompatible with Einstein's postulate of no instantaneous information transfer and it seems to involve even the experimenter's thoughts in the outcome of some experiments. Once again, any experiment is not a closed system as physicists like to assume. That is why the quantum realm appears weird. Light and the electric force are mysteriously transferred through empty space. We have all experienced the force between two magnets. What's happening in the space between them? The pioneers of electromagnetism knew there has to be a medium to transfer the electric force. They called it the ether. The ether has to be an electrically polarizable medium that fills the universe. In that way you can daisy-chain the electric force directly. It's a longitudinal force. And applying the speed of light limit to that makes no sense whatsoever because light is a wave motion. I think I've said before that's like the difference between pulling on a rope and feeling the tug at the other end almost instantly, and waving one end of the rope and waiting for the wave to get to the other end. Light is a slow process in the universe. So if we have this ether that fills the universe, space is full. There's no such thing as a perfect vacuum. Einstein knew there has to be an ether but his postulates somehow did away with it. He admitted that his theory of relativity would fail if the Earth's motion through the ether were detected. That's because his inertial frames of reference would not be equivalent. It would be like having one observer experiencing a gentle breeze from the ether wind while another might be suffering a howling gale. As it turns out, Dayton Miller repeated the Michelson-Morley ether experiments far more rigorously and at different elevations. He found an ether drift. Sadly, left hemisphere training denied and quickly forgot this fact. So let's have a look at the standard particle model. An atom, once a promise of fundamental simplicity, is really a nucleus within a hazy probabilistic fog of electrons. The nucleus is some protons and neutrons held together by the mysterious short range nuclear or strong force. The particles in the nucleus have a hidden, unknown number of weird undetectable bits inside. These bits are appearing and disappearing in defiance of a principle of science that miracles are forbidden. Meanwhile, a recent report from the Large Hadron Collider suggests new findings that don't fit this model. Here's a snapshot of a proton by Professor Matthew Strassler. He writes: "...imagine all of the quarks (up, down, and strange -- u, d, s), antiquarks (u, d, s with a bar on top), and gluons (g), zipping around near the speed of light, banging into each other, and appearing and disappearing." So, a proton is said to be some quarks held together by some gluons which are themselves the quantized manifestations of the strong force. There is no mention of how a force manifests as a particle. It gets much worse. A gluon is really one of several colors of gluon. But it also has the simultaneous property of anti-color. Gluons mediate the interaction between quarks but they also mediate the interaction between themselves and quarks. That's right, gluons are the strong force but they also experience the strong force. Happily for the physicists, quarks are unobservable in principle because they only exist inside the nucleon. It's very convenient.. This is simple? You can forget elegance. This is extreme, narrow, left hemisphere focus on a model with no basic definitions to make sense of the words being used. Andrew Pickering, the author of "Constructing Quarks", it is a sociological study of particle physics and it's interesting book, says: "There's no obligation on anyone to take account of what 20th century science has to say. To listen too closely to scientists may be simply to stifle the imagination," that is the right hemisphere. "Worldviews are cultural products, there is no need to be intimidated by them." We come to the Electric Universe model of the atom. The electrically neutral atom is made of charged particles, positive and negative in equal numbers, together with a number of neutral particles called neutrons. Stating the obvious. All subatomic particles are real with real locations in space, it's not a probabilistic fog. There is a polarizable ether which transmits force and carries electromagnetic waves. The universe is full of an electrically neutral perfect fluid of neutral particles which passes through atoms and celestial bodies practically as if they weren't there. Neutrinos fit this description. So, the Electric Universe then defines what it means by energy and mass. Energy is matter in motion relative to the matter in the rest of the universe. It used to be said, in relation to the fixed stars. This is not a closed system approach. It is a unifying relational concept first articulated by Ernst Mach. So we define mass: Mass is a measure of particle distortion instead of acceleration in response to the electric forces from all other matter in the universe. It's a bit like pushing a balloon full of water. It will tend to distort, rather than move. And it's the same with these orbital systems of electrons and protons and so on. Once again, this conforms with Ernst Mach's principle. Neutrons may not exist in the nucleus. If so, only two particles are necessary to build all of the elements. This idea came from Edwin Kaal who I'm pleased to say is here and will be presenting in the breakout room. And the problem for physicists is how do you hold together all of the positive charges in the nucleus, they should repel one another very powerfully. The repulsion of those positive charged protons should prevent it from forming in the first place. However, atomic nuclei seem to require neutrons for stability. That's because when a radioactive atom nucleus decays neutral particles are sometimes observed to leave the nucleus and exist for a few minutes before further decaying into an electron and a proton. So it was assumed, such a neutral particle pre-existed in the nucleus. The "what if" question wasn't asked. That maybe that wasn't so. This is an assumption that still does not explain how the positive nucleus remains cohesive. So a special short-range strong nuclear force was invented. The proliferation of forces and particles. Edwin Kaal suggested a simpler solution. If the electrons remain as discrete particles in the nucleus, they will tend to arrange themselves to, on average, seat equidistant between the protons; because the distance between the protons is greater than that between each proton and a neighboring electron, the attractive electric force between the proton and electron, sorry if it's too fast, will be four times greater than the repulsive force. This simple hypothesis removes the need for an extra strong force within the nucleus. It's much simpler. And then it seems that neutrons are short-lived, metastable resonance of a closely bound proton and electron. This is simple. The Electric Universe simply proposes structure within structure, repeated pattern. To understand magnetism and gravity we must go to the heart of matter a similar approach to that of Andre Marie Ampere, Carl Friedrich Gauss, Wilhelm Weber and Walther Ritz, who considered the behavior of positive and negative charged particles of different mass with great success but were ignored for political reasons. Chiefly, they weren't English, I think. Here's a simple hypothesis. The electron and proton have stable resonant orbital structures of smaller charged particles. In that case, the positron, that is the antiparticles, and anti proton are mirror particles. They're not antiparticles, they're mirrors. There is no antimatter, no creation or annihilation. But this requires that there be an ether of composite neutral particles of vanishingly small mass, the neutrinos. Neutrinos must be quite complex inside but totally collapsed so that they can accept energy and then become a particle and its mirror. But there's nothing, it is just assumed that when these particles seem to disappear, that they're annihilated, the matter has disappeared. That's not so. So the ether must be nor matter of vanishingly small mass composed of all the sub particles needed to split into an electron and a positron for example, when subjected to the appropriate energy, electromagnetic energy. For stability, and this is one of the stumbling blocks, of course, for particle physicists to go this way, is that the electric force must act between the tiny particles within the atom instantly. No speed of light delay. The two stable particles -- the electron and the proton, if we assume the neutron is just a metastable particle, form 254 stable nuclides plus another 85 metastable, that is radioactive nuclides, for a total of 339. So from this simple resonant systems of structure within structure we have all of the materials we need to see, to make what we see in the world around us. When those nuclei combine with the requisite number of negative electrons to form atoms and molecules, the possibilities are boundless in the living world. What does this mean? Only a single force is necessary, the powerful instantaneous electric force. The phenomenal strength of the naked electric force can be judged by the simple illustration in the lower left. This shows that if the charge; passing through two 120 watt light bulbs in one second, were to be transferred equally to two metal plates, the repulsive force between those plates would equal 1 million tons. So it's critical that the electric force is a balanced force, attractive or repulsive. These two propositions are the epitome of elegant simplicity balance. The little diagram there on the left, extreme left at the top, shows the attraction between positive and negative and the repulsion between like-particles. There are two forms of the electric force that we experience. One is the electrostatic, we have separated charge some distance apart, and the electric dipole where the distance between the two charges becomes so small that the field is altered and you get a different effect called the dipole field. So it just depends on the degree of separation of a positive and negative charge. It's a difference in scale. On our scale we experience the dipole field of atomic electric fields and subatomic electric fields in the form of magnetism and gravity. They are dipole fields. So, both forms of the electrostatic and the dipole field occur between atoms and is responsible for chemistry. The e-force operates between all of the particles and sub particles within each atom. In close proximity this can result in distortion of the atoms to form electric dipoles themselves. Which can result in the attraction to form a molecule or they may enter a new resonant dance by sharing an electron as chemistry. The dipole distorting action on electrons and protons produces dipolar magnetism. The diagram there is actually, I made a mistake, the positive and negative on the left and right should be reversed. But this just shows that if you... just try this thing here... if you have an electric field operating on a particle here, charged particle here, and accelerating it and on the opposite side decelerating it, the result will be an elliptical orbit with the nucleus at one of the focuses. And the result of this is that you get a transverse dipole and that transverse dipole is shown there as the magnetic force because if you have two current-carrying wires, where the electric field in the wire is causing this distortion in electrons, then the dipoles are aligned so they tend to attract and we know that current flowing down two wires in the same direction attract, in the opposite way they repel. OK, so. And the other thing is that, I mentioned the ultra-week dipolar gravity. And this is the diagram, what happens to an atom in that case. The gravitational field cannot be shielded from, so the gravitational force operates on the heavy nucleus so that it falls towards one of the focuses of the ellipse. This time it's oriented radially towards the surface of the body. But the interesting thing about that is that once you've said that, this means that the body like the Earth and the Moon, which are shown here, the negative poles on both bodies are facing outwards which means they're repelling one another. So it means that the, it's long-range repulsive, short-range attractive. We, on the surface of the earth, are like iron filings. We don't care which magnet, we go to adjust, the nearest one will do. The gravitational mass of the distant galaxies has a fundamental influence over the motion of the bodies in the solar system and this is actually shown by precession of the perihelion of the planets which is tied to the distant stars and not to the Sun or general relativity. Because general relativity doesn't have a reference frame like that. Short-term changes in the Earth's magnetic field that occur over periods of just years or decades have now been shown in new research to have a very close relationship with changes in gravity. The two are very similar, similar forces. There is no gravitational collapse in space, no black hole swallowing everything. It is the electromagnetic force alone that coalesces matter in deep space. So the assumption that gravity was the controlling force on the large-scale is incorrect. There's no need for a Big Bang to separate everything initially, gravity is a balanced force like magnetism and cannot form neutron stars or other fanciful super-condensed celestial objects. A planet's gravity is established at its birth by powerful electromagnetic forces. Once the body is formed and the charge on the surface is established, the gravitational field is set by both the surface charge and the initial coalescence by electromagnetic forces. So the outcome of all that is that all matter in the local universe is connected by the electric force instantly. That's Mach's principle. The origin of mass and quantum spooky connection. Because this force is instantaneous, this so called, entanglement and non-locality suddenly has a simple explanation. And energy is a measure of motion with respect to the matter in the rest of the universe. Mass is a measure of the energy stored in the orbital motion inside a particle. And simultaneity means there is a universal time and three-dimensional space. We return to the sanity and simplicity of classical physics. These matter resonances are interesting too because having an orbital structure allows resonant instantaneous connections and complex interactions which explains weird quantum behavior. The important thing is that the electron and proton have an orbital charge structure like atoms which explains their internal energy and their magnetic moment. And distortion in an electric field appears as an increase in mass rather than acceleration. Quantum tunneling In transistors electrons face a barrier like the illustration in the diagram. It's like having to carry a weight over a hill but in a weird quantum phenomenon called tunneling the electron passes through that barrier as if there's a tunnel. The Electric Universe model of the electron and proton, having an orbital structure of oppositely charged particles, allows us to see that the hill or the repulsive electrical force between similar charges can instantly disappear or become a downhill race. The reason is that the force between two similar particles can become attractive instead of repulsive if you get the particles together at just the right moment. In chemistry this resonance is achieved by the use of heavy metal catalyst which has numerous internal subatomic resonances. The same catalytic process is available, in my opinion, for nuclear fusion. So called warm fusion is possible by nuclear chemistry, catalyzing the nuclei to attract instead of repel. So catalytic chemistry is possible, in my opinion, in the photospheric plasma of all bright stars where the nuclei are separated from the electrons and can actually come close together in the presence of the heavy elements we see in the spectrum. And you've gotta ask the question then, is this the path to the future power? Like the Sun. But only "unlike the sun" that is believed by present science. In this way all-stars generate the heavy elements in their photospheres where we detect them in their spectra. Rare exploding super novae are the most ineffectual production means imaginable. Because having produced it you then disperse it into deep space. There's also an unsuspected resonant means of connection in living systems. The morphic field of Rupert Sheldrake, the mind-body connection, consciousness, subtle energies. The Electric Universe model explains biological transmutations at body temperature as demonstrated by Dr. Louis Kervran. His is a clear demonstration of this simple process. Is light a wave or a particle? If so, what's waving? Einstein did away with a medium to waive. Or is light a particle, a photon? It can't be both, a wave and a particle. You'll notice they merely mouthed a term that it's particle-like, they say. It's a meaningless use of language. If so, according to Einstein, to travel at the speed of light it must have zero mass. But a particle of zero mass has no energy. You can't multiply 0 x infinity and get a real number. And if it's got 0 mass it can't be affected by gravity so there can be no gravitational lensing. Lensing occurs as a simple atmospheric diffraction effect in the ether. It's like an atmosphere around the body. Evidence from stars at the galactic center show no gravitational lensing as expected from standard theory. Clearly, we depend on light to observe the universe but we don't understand light. Photons don't exist. Light is a transverse electrical disturbance in the ether. And the ether must be a dielectric medium to transfer an electrical disturbance. The wave carries energy through the medium.. ..catch up here.. ..and the energy is absorbed by the first atom that is in instantaneous resonance with the sending atom. It gives the appearance that a photon has traveled between the sender and the receiver. It's appearance only. Talking about light brings us to cosmological redshift. Hubble found, the fainter and smaller a galaxy appeared -- the higher was its redshift. In the diagram you can see the spectral lines of hydrogen move progressively to the red end of the spectrum as the distance is thought to increase. The redshift was simply assumed to be due to velocity away from us by analogy with the Doppler shift of sound. Hubble's law is considered the first observational basis for the expansion of the universe. But ironically, Hubble thought it the least likely explanation. He felt, it more likely indicated some new physics. So it was Hubble's professional astronomer assistant, Halton C. Arp, who later proved this to be so. If the redshift is not simply a Doppler effect, Hubble wrote, the region observed appears as a small homogeneous but insignificant portion of the universe extended indefinitely both in space and time. Recently and surprisingly more distant galaxies seem to be accelerating away from us. This discovery won the Nobel Prize and gave rise to the need for huge amounts of mysterious dark energy to power the acceleration. I read about that discovery on October the sixth 2011. The discovery of the acceleration of the expanding universe is an interpretation based on total ignorance of the real nature of stars and the standard candle which was used as the measurement to determine the distance away. So it's gratifying to find support once more in a report this month titled: "Could a new type of supernova eliminate dark energy?" It has been found that the near-UV light from the most distant supernovae is brighter than the closer ones. In other words, there's something going on at the atomic and subatomic level. Of course, this is unexpected and unexplained. The diagram on the left shows the difference between the Big Bang universe and the Plasma Universe. It's easy to see which one is simpler. Intrinsic redshift and Dr. Halton Arp (Hubble's assistant who was dubbed the modern Galileo). He found redshifts, quasars, physically connected to and in front of, high redshift quasars rather, physically connected to and in front of low redshift active galaxies. This observation of a quasar between the galaxies NGC 73 19 and the Earth is impossible if the quasars are over 90 times farther away than the galaxy. So, Hubble was right. Something is wrong with physics. Arp showed the redshift happened in small jumps or quanta which indicates a subatomic effect. But subatomic, these quantum effects are supposed to only occur at the subatomic level, here we've got occurring on the galactic. This requires, once again, the electric force to be operating at ultra-high speed, instantaneously. So, quasars are born at high speed and with low redshift. This is Arp's diagram, you see the parent galaxy in the center. This is one here. And the high redshift quasars, and the redshift decreases as they move away. Initially their velocity is very high, they are faint, highly red-shifted and traveling at the fair fraction of the speed of light. Over time they gain in mass. This is interesting. That means that energy is being supplied to the matter in the quasar, the mass is increasing. So that eventually they can actually become a turnaround here and become a companion galaxy. This is an example of another path that they can take where you end up with another Bi Lac objects as it's called, producing multiple galaxies here. So there is a genealogy, if you like, of galaxies. The idea that the Andromeda galaxy is going to crash into our galaxy in the future, is rubbish. It's based on the idea that Andromeda's blue shift, with respect to us, means that it's approaching us. No, just means that it's older than us. So the Electric Universe explains this. Quasars are born at high speed and with low mass. They escape the forces of the electromagnetic galactic nucleus, that's the parent galaxy, as neutrons. And because the neutrons have no charge, they can escape the intense electromagnetic forces that hold that plasmoid in the center of the galaxy. They have enough time to get away from the, those powerful forces and then they decompose into electrons and protons which are the forerunners of hydrogen. So, as the electrical energy pours into the quasar its mass and brightness increases and it slows down to become a companion galaxy. So this was an explanation, the only explanation for Halton Arp's observations. Quasars are not the brightest and most distant objects in the universe. They are among the youngest and closest, so they.. the objects in the mirror really are closer than they appear. The visible universe is smaller than we have been told. So the universe, the real universe, is in balance. It is not expanding. This is important for understanding of gravity. Gravity cannot be simply an attractive force. The universe is of unknown age and extent, the origin of the universe is unknown, there is a universal now and space has three physical dimensions. This brings everything back down to, as Tom was pointing out, conditions as we experience it on Earth. Dark Matter Galaxies Galaxies are treated as isolated objects in space produced somehow by attractive gravity in an expanding universe. Their rotation and structure remains a mystery. They're made of eighty percent invisible dark matter. Tom got a good introduction to that story about dark matter. Dark matter has been described as an invisible elephant in the room. You know it's there by the dent it makes in the floorboards. Dark matter is only inferred theoretically by using our experience of gravity on earth and projecting it onto the rest of the universe. Once again it's the geocentric problem. We look at the gravity on earth and then we just extrapolate outwards. Because that's all mathematicians can do. It needs an impossible gravitational black hole in the center, black holes exist theoretically in asymptotically flat space in an empty universe. You cannot superimpose any other matter in such a hypothetical universe. Black holes don't exist! Yet some sport long thin high-velocity jets over intergalactic distances. There's no satisfactory theoretical explanation for these jets. This is the standard, taking the standard approach. Electric Galaxies On the other hand, Plasma Cosmology shows experimentally and observationally that galaxies are governed by electromagnetic forces. Tony Peratt said that they introduced gravity into their super computer runs and it made no difference whatsoever. Spirals rotate as simple Faraday motors, that's why that curve is flat. It's as if you've got a plate and you're just spinning the plate. Stars are born in and trace the spiral power lines. Where there is a higher density of gas and dust, it's typical of an electrical discharge, where the density of the material becomes greater, the discharge becomes more filamentary. Stars form along those pinched current filaments. There are no black holes. It's a compact high-energy plasmoid and this comes down to peer-reviewed Plasma Cosmology. Their apparent mass is due to the relationship between mass and energy. If e = mc², if you got a high concentration of energy in that tiny plasmoid, it will exhibit a considerable mass. It's certainly not a black hole. The other thing is that galaxies lineup axially showing the electrical connectedness because they're threaded like Catherine wheels on a wire. And that wire is one of these intergalactic Birkeland current filaments. So let's look at stars. We've done galaxies, let's look at stars. Eddington, Arthur Eddington had the temerity to say, "it should not be too difficult to understand something as simple as a star". This is typical left hemisphere. His quote is typical. Isolate, simplify and ignore a global view because if you look at coronas, sunspots, flares, magnetic cycles etc. his gas model doesn't predict any of them. And the alternatives are not explored. He dismisses electrical aspects in a few paragraphs. The failure of this approach is shown by continual complications with each new discovery. It's treated as an isolated gravitating ball of gas. Conventionally, it's a body that satisfies 3 conditions. It's made of hydrogen plus a few impurities, having core of the lightest element is the most fanciful assumption. It's needed to allow the thermonuclear energy model to be viable. That also requires a hypothetical extreme conditions in the core. It's only required by the thermonuclear theory and is completely untestable. It also has, I mean that's unverifiable, and also the sequence of nuclear reactions that take place in the core cannot be verified. They're very complex and requires quantum tunneling which I referred to earlier, and what's more, there's a more complex different story for different stars. It's certainly not simple. It's an explosive model because one of the reactions is sensitive to the temperature to the fifth power. It also needs an unknown radiation zone to break down the x-rays from the nuclear core. There's no body known that has a radiation or the energy transferred through the body, through a radiation zone. So this is hypothetical. And also from the point of view of life on Earth and so on it has a restrictive and variable 'Goldilocks zones' distance from the star. It's not the best place to nurture life in the universe. Impossible Stars Formation by gravitational accretion doesn't work. It's never been explained satisfactorily. It has hydrogen, the lightest element in the core, the model doesn't predict the observed features of behavior, has different models for white dwarfs, neutron stars, etc and the life story of stars is super complicated and untestable. And some stars do strange things, they switch from one place to another without going through the transition stages. Renowned scientists like Eddington who made grave mistakes about the Sun and Einstein's general relativity, he went out explicitly to prove Einstein correct -- not to test his theory, continue to haunt us today. It gives the light to the belief that science is self-correcting. It is, oh sorry, it is not, given the way in which science is done today. As Eddington said, if there's no other way out we may have to suppose that bright line spectra in the star are produced by electric discharges. The clues were there but "what if" was not followed through. Herschel reveals a ribbon of future stars. This was reported on March the 30th this year. So this is a very recent picture. Stars and planets are formed by powerful electromagnetic forces like pearls on a cosmic string. This is a quote from an earlier report. Gravity can be ignored. In Plasma Cosmology there's no gravitational accretion. There's no way you can form a string like that using gravity. Gravity is a central force and material tends to come in to a center. It doesn't form a string. But this recent report says, this is important, stars are shot out of the filaments by a slingshot mechanism. And there's a diagram here which shows the filaments moving around like those in the plasma ball, they snake about. The stars having been formed in this filament are left behind as the filament moves on and these stars are shot out. And it's interesting because plasma.. Tony Peratt described to us once the effects seen in high energy discharge experiments as these plasmoids scattered like buckshot. Now it's not only stars that are formed here, it's all solid bodies including planets. And they may be captured by the stars to form the weird assortment, over three-and-a-half thousand of them, so far, of exo-planetary systems that have been observed. New stars also may fission to produce hot Jupiters in very close orbits and achieve electrical stability with their changing electrical environment. The movement of the filaments, as I said, is like those in the plasma ball. Heavy elements convect into a cool core. This is interesting because these, those blue filaments you saw before are the coldest part of the cloud and this is where the stars are forming. The traditional view is that the stars had to form by gravitational collapse and not lose any of the heat of the collapse, otherwise they couldn't start their nuclear fires. This doesn't require any of that. It was one of the surprises for theorists. Is that the, the blue filament I mentioned is the coldest part of the cloud and contains eight hundred times as much mass as the Sun. This is not a surprise for plasma cosmologists. So, all stars have a cool planetary core. Stars and many planets are born together along the same electrical umbilical cord. Other planets and moons are born later in electrical fissioning events and capture events. Hydrogen and helium tend to form the outermost atmosphere. This is a diagram showing the actual form of the filaments. You'll notice the pattern there. This is showing an experimental pattern of a discharge on an insulating plate. And this shows a Martian electrical scar. You can see the similarities. As the cosmic lightning bolt fades, stars and planets are captured into planetary systems. So, electric stars, they remain a gaseous electric discharge phenomena like spherical searchlights, following their birth. In fact some of the characteristics of the photospheres are like that of a searchlight. All bright stars catalytically produce heavy elements in the photospheric plasma discharges. Red stars have gigantic anode sheaths. Sorry, got the right picture there. Plasma discharges adjust to their environment by moving electrical barriers called plasma sheaths or misleadingly, magnetospheres, because they trap the magnetic fields inside. If Jupiter's plasma sheath would lit up it would appear the size of the full Moon in the sky, at opposition. And its Galilean moons would be orbiting comfortably inside it. So red dwarfs are not dwarfs and their bloated glowing anode sheaths are the cosmic wombs for life. Because inside that radiant red sphere all satellites receive uniform heat and light over their entire surfaces. It doesn't matter how they're moving or rotating, that will be the case. Of course this poses a problem for the SETI project because radio waves cannot penetrate the glowing plasma sheath. So if these are the wombs of life, we don't have any way of radio communication with them. But of course, gravity can pass through. White dwarfs are not dwarfs at all, they're just stars with no bright photosphere. And a faint white coronal discharge. These are some of the planetary systems that have been discovered. You can see that it's quite a shambles. So as I said before, at the galactic scale electromagnetic forces form these gigantic Birkeland currents and they dominate. At the planetary scale, inside the star's protective plasma sheath, gravity dominates. So you have to choose the region you're talking about when you talk, when you try to apply your model to stars, galaxies and so on. In fact, the inside the star's protective sheath, with gravity dominating and it dominates because it cannot be electrically shielded so the impact from all of the other stars in the universe is acting like a pressure in on the, the planets moving around the Sun. In fact this repulsive force from the rest of the universe can reverse the Earth's motion about the Sun in 6 months. That is 6 sextillion tons by 140,000 miles an hour. So it gives you an idea of the impact. Then the Thunderbolts of the Gods operate to modify masses.. oh, sorry.. In planetary systems the electric force comes into play only when plasma sheaths collide because then the electrical insulation breaks down. And the electric current flows between the two bodies. Then the Thunderbolts of the Gods operate to modify masses and change orbits and to quickly reestablish order. This is one of the problems that Velikovsky faced, how do you explain events, within the memory of mankind, of chaos in the solar system and it looks like clockwork today. This is the answer, you have to apply the electric model of gravity to be able to do this. So Velikovsky was right. Electricity and magnetism are involved in the celestial mechanism. Changing the surface charge on a planet Change modifies the strength of the internal electric dipole which is responsible for the planet's mass and gravity. And the changes to both bodies, which I've shown in previous YouTube talks, tends to move the two bodies apart, which is very convenient.. This overcomes the objections of the Harvard book burners to Velikovsky's Worlds in Collision. However, it doesn't detract from the title to say that Worlds didn't collide. It was an electrical clash of the titans. There's Velikovsky with his great book. So what we have now in science is a mythical journey. It is a rehash of a creation myth. The Earth was born and for four-and-a-half billion has remained roughly where it is now. Long ago the Earth had a few massive impacts to birth the Moon and almost wipe out life on Earth at intervals. Ironically, planetary collisions have been found essential 66 years after Velikovsk's book Worlds in Collision was burned. Thousands of exo-planetary systems don't fit the story. There are stars that shouldn't exist, hot Jupiters that orbit the star in hours or days, backward orbits and polar orbits. Life on earth remains unexplained. The odds against random events producing life are practically infinite. The rest of the story is once-upon-a-time, fragmented, boring and non-predictive. We are an isolated and improbable accident. That's why we have difficulty imagining life elsewhere in the universe. Alan Alda complains, everybody is ignorant about science. Alda was 11 years a host of Scientific American Frontiers on PBS and he helped inspire the creation of the Center for Communicating Science at Stony Brook in 2009. Is it any wonder? When this is the face of science today. There is no real meaning or morality in modern mechanistic science to engage students or the public. Everyone thinks it is all mathematics. It saddens me to see so much talent wasted in the pursuit of myth, hunting for dark matter. Their heads have been filled with it. Our REAL journey. You're looking for the nearest exoplanet -- we're standing on it. Pay attention to the oldest stories of the celestial gods who created the skies and land we see today. Yorro Yorro is a research book about the Kimberley region, Aborigines in western Australia. And they, some of their stories are so close to the reconstruction of the Saturnian polar configuration that it's almost scary. And these are the words from the elders and they were very precise in their words. It says, in the beginning people saw before the Ice Age, that the Moon, Sun and some of the stars had been on Earth. In other words, they were very close. One song told about a flood, long before the last, that was brought on by a star with trails. The symbols that testify to these events are still in the Kimberley. The Wandjina creator-figure, which is the one you can see on the front of the book there, that features are explained. All rings around the head represent clouds and lightning. The big spirit Wandjina have large eyes. This is the eye-god motive that David Talbott has explained at length. They never have a mouth nor ears and the line between the eyes indicates where the power flows down and it's not a nose. And it has, it looks like a hollow tube, which, in the plasma column scenario of the Saturnian story, is accurate. Wallanganda, the Creator of Wandjina, did not create with his hands, only through his voice, with power. It reminds me of, "in the beginning was the Word". Andy Hall has recently explained that the overpressure from supersonic shock-waves, that is from the electrical blast that striked the surface of the body, are powerful enough to form mountains. Rock flows until the overpressure drops whereupon it solidifies instantly but retains an imprint of the shock-wave. Those shock-waves would have produced harmonics and overtones, a global sound like a symphony of giant trumpets. There's many traditions about the creation being associated with sound. This little book I bought in Central Australia on a visit to Uluru, that great red rock which looks just like an asteroid has landed. And it also tells a story by these people in the Kimberleys but is illustrated by children and it's very quaint. Yet the story is by David More Jolly, who's the elder, It tells of two suns in the sky who lived in hollow logs, plasma columns. There is a period of intense heat from them. Then one sun is attacked with a spear, the thunderbolt, and is bitten by a snake, cometary Venus, who lives in the sky. The little sun gets snagged in the fog of a celestial tree which is the Axis Mundi thing. The Tree of Life, the Celestial Tree. So this is an extension of the forensic technique that Velikovsky introduced. He never referred to the Australian Aborigines but some of their memories are, seem to be so accurate that they are a better source than some of the more, so-called, advanced cultural reports. All of these story elements makes sense to mytho-historians and to the leading plasma cosmologist and colleague of Hannes Alfvén -- Tony Peratt. Accept the best evidence regardless of its fit with modern consensus science and man-made theoretical laws. It is better to adopt the forensic science approach to the evidence for past events that cannot be repeated than to rely on theoretical science which is based on sets of beliefs and a geocentric perspective. Use that evidence to develop a more holistic science that brings a phenomenal real journey to light. To be real and useful, science must be holistic. The Electric Universe is a holistic science that applies seamlessly from the galactic to the earthly to the biosphere and on down to subatomic particles. Humanity's dramatic experience of the electrical nature of celestial mechanics would make an awe inspiring and frightening IMAX movie that would make science fiction seem a pale shadow in comparison. But in my opinion, once understood, there will be no irrational urge to revisit doomsday upon each other and the earth under the unrecognized banners of the prehistoric warring planetary gods. Planets bear the scars of their electrical birth and past encounters on their faces. Apollo astronauts commented on the fresh appearance of lunar craters, the event that caused the great gush across the face of Mars appears in stories from ancient cultures. These are just yesterday in geological time. I recommend you to see episode II Symbols of an Alien Sky, The Lightning Scarred Planet Mars. We may understand our history and place in the electric universe for the this time. This is singularly important for our sense of well-being. It gives dramatic new meaning to our lives in a sense of responsibility for our jewel of a planet. Without this sense we probably have no future on Earth. Also in the event, myth becomes science. There was a unique myth-making period and all surviving cultures required their stories to be faithfully transmitted for millennia, such was their importance. We look at these enigmatic rock art figures from the remote Kimberley region in Western Australia and see only their strange, haunting and artistic beauty. And it was rather ironic that just a week or so ago, and David Novak was there to see it too I think, they had the vivid festival in Sydney where they project images onto public buildings and of course the Opera House's the the most public building in Sydney and this was a presentation of Wandjina figures. I mean they are haunting and I think they probably evoke some kind of a subconscious connection but how much more would they mean if people really understood their origin. We need to give more credit to the indigenous people. Now Even Camp said that one of the unique aspects of the Electric Universe theory is that it's good storytelling. It answers all three questions, what if.. What if the sky was different in the past? What if Saturn was worshipped as the Sun? What if there were electrical discharges between planets? What if there were electric discharges between planets? Today, we have meteorites from Mars. What if Lichtenberg figures explain the scars on Mars and Earth? Show students pictures of cratering on different bodies and asks students to explain them from two points of view. The Standard Model needs different explanations for each. The Electric Universe, on the other hand, has a single explanation for them all. Then, there is the story of the dissidents. If only Birkeland hadn't been ignored. Hannes Alfvén had been listened to. Halton Arp's research hadn't been dismissed. A pixar rule for storytelling number 16: what are the stakes? Give us reasons to support the character. What happens if they don't succeed? Stack the odds against them! What of the future if this goes on? We continue wasting money and careers looking for things that don't exist. We cripple students by not training them to think. We may have no future on this planet. As Evan Camp says, "The power of eliciting engagement is to get people to come to their own conclusions." Thinking is going to be the future of education. So, our Electric Universe Future. Mahatma Gandhi said, "There is a force in the universe which, if we permit it, will flow through us and produce miraculous results." The Electric Universe is an inspiring story that motivates students both conceptually and artistically, and that is what's needed for left and right brain hemisphere development. Education, classical science and the arts, left and right hemispheres Many principles of the Electric Universe were foreseen by scholars in the past-- Newton, Faraday, etc. A release from existential fear. Velikovsky's The Bonds of the Past, a documentary. There is a collective inability to face the truth that prehistoric mankind faced doomsday. For millennia, sciences preached stability and order but as amnesiacs we have a compulsion to instinctively repeat the catastrophes of the past destroying each other and the earth from the sky with apocalyptic weapons, like the planetary gods of old. This was one of Velikovsky's greatest fears. But we have, on the other hand, the possibility of an unparalleled renaissance with the Electric Universe, bringing everything together seamlessly. Understanding ourselves and our past, can heal the wounds and provide a more universal sense of connection and purpose. Understand the electric force of nature. Power "like the Sun." And Gravity. Quantum Interactions. All three rely on understanding matter interactions by the instantaneous electric force. Understanding living organisms, the mind-body connection and beyond. Also understanding the dangers of genetically- modified organisms and manufactured food. There's no thought given to the effects, the unintended consequences of fiddling with these things when our basic knowledge is so lacking. And the idea in an Electric Universe is to live in tune with the Earth and each other. Resonant Connection On the most general level, the Electric Universe is a new paradigm of universal resonant connection. The arbitrary inertial frames of reference of physics are not equivalent when everything is connected in real time. How and where you are makes a difference to your energy state. For example, the GPS system is supposed to prove relativity theory. It doesn't. The atoms in orbiting clocks have a different energy from identical clocks on Earth so engineers simply count a different number of ticks to compensate. Time is universal, unchanging and unchangeable. Clocks are not. Think of the relationships between all things connected by the universe electric force and consider that the electric force must act instantly otherwise no information transfer is possible between resonant tune systems. Spacecraft using slow speed of light transmissions, require constant retuning of receivers on Earth to compensate for their motion. Obviously living systems could not function if moving parts of the body lost contact with the brain. Acknowledging this simple fact will explain quantum weirdness and open up science, particularly biology, to amazing possibilities that are presently forbidden. And understanding gravity and magnetism as balancing electric forces will change forever our view of the heavens and the earth under our feet. As the morphic resonance experiments of the biologist Rupert Sheldrake have shown, the things that are learned by one organism are immediately available to others like them, anywhere on earth. The universe learns. Resonance between molecular tuning forks allows instant information transfer, the mind-body connection and beyond. Life is structured water. This was said to me by Gerald Pollack. The experiments, or his experiments, show that structure of electrically polarized water molecules gives rise to water's amazing properties. It allows information to be stored and transferred within a living cell. The memory mechanism of homeopathy. It suggests that the electrically polarizable ether particles may also participate in information storage as well as transmission. The Electric Universe resonant electrical model of matter and the all-pervasive neutrino ether, suggests that resonance and structure within structure can store unlimited information and transfer it instantly. There is more to life than meets the eye. We've always known that instinctively. The Electric Universe suggests that the information needed for life, forget the gene -- that's just the factory floor, is universal. So life can take hold wherever conditions arise that allow it. We see evidence for that in the great changes immediately following catastrophic mass extinctions on earth. We see it in organisms living in anoxic conditions over volcanic vents, on the ocean floor and at great depths in rocks. Just as gravity cannot be shielded, since all matter participates in force transfer, so it is with this universal information bank. There are no islands in space. We are Earthlings in the complete resonant connection sense in a meaningful Electrical Universe. The fact that we exist suggests the purposeful universe. Our lives have purpose. We don't manifest as a blank slate. So, children should be observed and supported in their individual passions, not suppressed and molded to have desires for them. We are born with a purpose but many need help to discover that purpose. In answering the question: Why are we so unhappy, Iain McGilchrist says: "True happiness is based on connections with others and a sense of purpose beyond the immediate." True happiness is one aim of this conference. The new panorama of an amazing shared history and kinship must change the world. In the search for meaning, the Electric Universe paradigm can, as Iain McGilchrist says, change the world. Elegance, harmony and simplicity of concepts are the Electric Universe guiding principles. Thank you.

Carl Sagan and Andrew Ian wrote in the book comet the gravitational tides of the Sun or unequal heating cannot be soul causes of the splitting of comets we still do not know why comets split in a paper published in the 1960s the astronomer dr. Brian G Marsden wrote on the anomaly of Comet fragmentation discussing the Sun grazing comets he noted that two instances the great comet of 1882 and the comet IKEA's Seki in 1965 appeared to split apart at their farthest distance from the Sun while beyond the orbit of Neptune and far above the ecliptic plane moreover the relative velocity of their separation was far greater than could possibly be due to solar heating Marsden wrote although most of the Comets observed to split have done so for no obvious reason one really does require an explanation when the velocity of separation is some 20% of the velocity of the comet itself a collision with some asteroid illogic at 200 au from the Sun and 100 au above the ecliptic plane even though would only have to happen once is scarcely worthy of serious consideration thus Carl Sagan and Andrew Ian wrote in 1985 that the problem of comet fragmentation is quote left unsolved in recent decades it has only become more evident that cometary activity including comet fragmentation cannot be due to solar warming or gravitational forces rather the electric comet theory says that comets are rocky bodies that were electrically machined from planets and moons the most dramatic comet displays will typically involve highly elliptical orbits during its time in the outer reaches of the solar system the comet will acquire a negative charge with respect to the Sun as it approaches the inner limits of its orbit accelerating through the sun's weak electric field it will begin to discharge the plasma surrounding it producing the familiar bright coma and tail comet Jets are electric discharges to the nucleus the Jets electrically machine the comet's surface in a process similar to the industrial process known as spark discharge machining a critical prediction of this theory appears to have recently been fulfilled by the Rosetta mission Rosetta's ion and electron sensor has measured surprisingly high densities of Tehran's close to the comet nucleus the electrical nature of comets explains the remarkable effects we've observed when comets have approached planets let us look back to the summer of 1994 when the comet shoemaker-levy 9 approached the planet Jupiter at the time astronomers predicted that the encounter would be as trivial as pebbles falling into an ocean however the energetic effects of the comet fragments were astronomically greater than anything comet scientists had anticipated as reported by sky and telescope when fragment a hit the giant planet it threw up a fireball so unexpectedly bright that it seemed to knock the world's astronomical community off its feet immediately after the impact of comet fragment a the telescope detected unusual and energetic auroral activity radiation belts were disrupted and were unexpectedly bright x-ray emissions at the time of impact and yet another mystery was never explained satisfactorily early impact events were hidden from the earth behind Jupiter's limb however the Galileo spacecraft was positioned 150 million miles away from Jupiter at an angle that gave it a ringside seat for these events but earth-based observatories saw some of the impacts start at the same time Galileo did reminiscent of the advanced electrical flash prior to the impact of a copper projectile into the comet Tempel 1 mission scientists said at the time in effect we are seeing something we didn't think we had any right to see it seems clear that something was happening high enough to be seen beyond the curve of the planet radio astronomers had expected radio emissions from Jupiter at high frequencies to drop because dust from shoemaker-levy 9 fragments would absorb electrons from the radiation belts for the electrons emit synchrotron radiation instead observers were surprised to find that emissions around 2.3 gigahertz rose by 20 to 30 percent Michael client of JPL said never in 23 years of Jupiter observations have we seen such a rapid and intense increase in radio emission extra electrons were supplied by a source which is a mystery a similar event was seen recently with a comet siding spring fateful encounter with Mars the MAVEN spacecraft measured the effects on the Martian atmosphere of sighting Springs fly by within about 87,000 miles according to a NASA report debris from the comet added a temporary and very strong layer of ions to the ionosphere the electrically charged layer high above Mars it is more clear than ever that comets do not behave like icy bodies moving through an electrically inert vacuum until institutional science seriously considers the electrical theory of comets the list of Comet mysteries will continue to grow for continuous updates on space news from the electric universe stay tuned to Thunderbolts dot info

Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info In early September of 2017, dramatic weather and seismic events reminded human beings around the world of the awesome power of nature. On September 7th, an 8.1 point earthquake struck off of the Pacific coast, the largest quake in Mexico in a century. Just one day previous, hurricane Irma, a tremendously powerful storm, that originated near the Capo Verde islands, reached its peak intensity with winds of 185 miles per hour. The hurricanes Katia and Jose followed on Irma's heels and less than two weeks after the Mexico quake, a second tremor, this one 7.1 magnitude, struck the region. Only two days after the second Mexico quake, additional significant earthquakes occured at the pacific island of Vanuatu and just off the north east coast of Japan, respectively. Are such cliusters of natural disasters on our planet merely a coincidence? The key to answering the question is an understanding of the dynamic electromagnetic relationship between the earth and the sun. Increasingly mainstream scientific research has shown a dramatic connection, completely unexpected in standard reasoning, between intense solar activity and atmospheric and weather events on Earth. For instance, in 2014, we reported on a scientific study which showed intense and sustained increased lightning on Earth, following solar storms. Is it then a coincidence that in early September the sun erupted with its largest solar flare in 12 years. For the past several years, Thunderbolts colleague Ben Davidson, the founder of Suspicious Observers, has produced voluminous research on space weather and its link to numerous geophysical phenomena. More recently, Ben and scientific colleagues have worked to develop models of disaster prediction. And in 2015, Ben and coauthors Kongpop U-Yen and Christopher Holloman coauthored a peer-reviewed scientific paper on the connection between solar activity and very large earthquakes. In the first of this two-part presentation, Ben begins discussing the evolution of its own investigation and the growing body of evidence of the sun's effect on climate, weather and earthquakes. [Ben Davidson] It was really quite the start of September, a bit of a bitter-sweet one which is not something we're not used to when it comes to forecasting natural disasters when every time you have a success, it is also a somber reality of what has just happened. Back in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, a number of patterns between solar and other cosmic phenomena and eathly phenomena, both meteorogical and seismic, began to come together in a way that was not just obviousto a few people but obvious to tens of thousands of people who happened to be watching someone who got lucky enough to pick 3 interesting things they wanted to show every day and that is; what the sun was doing, what the earthquakes were doing and what the weather was doing. And sort of by accident, all of these patterns started to just show up. In 2015, a few papers were published, and we are doing continued research still, but we are finding that things are moving along and progressing in the understanding of how the sun is, for lack of a better phrase, electromagnetically forcing short-term weather events and seismic activity in a number of different ways. It's progressing so fast that really the only way we could think of to share and get this out there for people to understand and improve, is just to continue reporting on the stuff every day and letting people know what the patterns are that we think they see and that we think that we have seen as well.. Back in 2015, we were able to really bring this to the forefront because after the sun had been relatively quiet, for quite a long time and it was to say somewhat lackluster start to the tropical season. We had really an incredble uptake in solar activity in a span of just about a week. It caused level 4, which is the second highest you can have, level 4 out of 5 geomagnetic storms, they actually shut down the airspace over New Zealand at that time and for only the second time in recorded meteorological history, 6 tropical cyclones spun in the Pacific. Really just, you know, to the world it was a great coincidence but when it continued happening, you know throughout the rest of the year into September and then again in November and then in January as well, we began to look back in time and say, hey this actually holds true! And it's not just that the sun is having really grand activity, it's that there is a change in the solar activity and so during solar maximum, which happens every 11 years or so, the sun is producing a lot of sunspots and a lot of solar flares and if you are in the middle of that, maybe a drastic run of solar flares is normal for that month or that year in time. But when you look back to these periods where you have, you know, these unexpected uptakes in solar activity, or you are in a period where you expect to have high activity and you have low activity for a while and then it picks back up. It's that sort of ramping back up of that distribution of energy, not only from the solar flare X-ray emission throughout the solar system but from those, you know, charged particle plasma cloud shockwaves that I mentioned earlier, that travel throughout the solar system that are powerful enough to create those incredible displays, take out satellites, affect telecommunications, internet, things like that, and so you have to really look at the energetic change that is taking place throughout the solar system and that is precisely what we had happen again, just at the beginning of September. It actually began in the middle of August, when after literally weeks, I would say maybe months without too much going on in terms of sunspot production and definitely not much going on in terms of the solar flares and the big blasts that go throughout the solar system. We had a flurry of sunspots being produced and the solar flares began to come back in the middle of August, right around that period. It was not long after that Harvey, sort of, formed and took that run at Houston. And then we had a little break in solar activity and then we had a little break in the tropical systems but then, just as fast as the break came, we had another sunspot that was born out of nowhere, and it was born on the Sun on the Earth-facing disk while a very large and mature sunspot sat very calmly and quietly and silently in the northern hemisphere. This thing was born on the south, and it turned into a monster very very quickly, fired a number of solar flares including the fourteenth largest, officially, that has ever been seen and this is one of the largest upticks that I have ever reported to be sure and the last time we had a solar flare this large was 12 years ago. We had another level 4 geomagnetic storm event, these things are quite rare to be honest, and wouldn't you know it, on the heels of that we have 3 systems spinning in the Atlantic. Now I know that that's not comparable to the 6 systems we had in the Pacific but you have to realize how small the Atlantic is by comparison and in that you cannot have 6 systems lined up at tropical cyclone strength in the Atlantic ocean at one time. And so, here we see something interesting, the sunspots really getting produced back in the middle of August, when they started flaring, those sunspots disappeared out of view, the day that hurricane Harvey shut north and the solar flare making sunspot that was on the southern hemisphere during this triple hurricane, set up what we had in the Atlantic basin, just at the start of September. When it disappeared out of view, hurricane Irma ran north that day at Florida. Now we got very, very lucky because it appears that about 24 hours later, as the sunspot was out of view, it released a solar flare that was so powerful, we were actually able to detect it from Earth even though the sunspot was not visible. It had turned over to the back side, the far-side half of the sun where, you know, Earth can't see from our perspective. And as far as I know, this is the first time actually that one of the shockwave clouds, blasted out via solar flare on the far side of the sun, has hit Earth. It wasn't much, you know, terrible because as I said the sunspot blasted it out on the far side but the shockwave was so broad that it had effects basically all throughout the solar system. [Michael Goodspeed] In the following episode, we will discuss in greater detail how and why it may be possible to predict earthquakes, particularly the largest quakes, major storms and other dramatic environmental effects based on a new understanding of the Sun-Earth electromagnetic connection.

Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info So, continuing our discussion on the so-called crisis in cosmology, let's talk more about this latest announcement from the Keck Observatory which describes the latest verification of the anomalous accelerating expansion rate of the universe. For the first time, scientists have attempted to estimate the expansion rate using a new method involving gravitational lensing. Now, the concepts behind the standard ideas about gravitational lensing is something that's been discussed at some of the annual Thunderbolts conferences. For example, Dr. Edward Dowdye is a laser optics engineer and, in fact, he was a NASA physicist and he's presented his case on the importance of plasma in understanding the phenomena that scientists attribute to so-called lensing in space. So Wal, fundamentally, why don't you explain the Electric Universe interpretation of the effects that astronomers do observe and which they describe as "gravitational lensing?" The concept of gravitational lensing is faulty at the very beginning because it assumes that gravity has an effect on space. It doesn't; it's an electric force, it's a dipolar force just like magnetism, and if that dipole electric force were able to warp space or, with the powerful magnets we have today you should be able to see distinct lensing effects using magnets, we don't. Gravity doesn't affect light directly but it can, by modifying the density of the ether; the ether is all-pervasive, it's the substrate of the universe, it's the medium through which light travels, it's the medium through which the gravitational and magnetic forces and the electric force travel. It behaves like any medium in the presence of the gravitational field because it's a material medium and has to be material, of vanishingly small mass, which indicates there is possibly neutrinos involved--they will respond to gravity just like any other material medium, and in this case like a gas, and form an atmosphere about a celestial object, and that atmosphere can refract light, so that you will get lensing but it's got nothing to do with gravity per se, it's the effect of gravity on the environment of that body. So yes, you can get gravitational lensing, but the concept that they're using is invalid. And principally, because of this idea that redshift indicates that these objects that they're seeing near a low redshifted galaxy, are far away, is incorrect. All it means is that they're younger than the object that's in that center of that view. And what do we find most often  close to galaxies? Quasars, redshifted quasars, and they are, in Halton Arp's research, the offspring of an active galaxy, galaxies beget baby galaxies, and they form initially as a quasar of low mass and high redshift and low brightness, and their brightness, their mass and their redshift, all change, become closer to their parent over time, and as a result, they become companion galaxies of various kinds. So he gives a genealogy, he shows almost biological aspect to galactic formation and so, when we see these objects in distant, or so-called lensed objects, what we must be looking at is an active galaxy surrounded by some of its redshifted offspring. Because they're fired off in episodes, they often have different, slightly different, quantized redshifts. If they've misinterpreted, which they're being done here by these people, they can be interpreted in a way which may appear to give some credence to the distance scales but the distance scales, as Halton Arp has shown, are completely haywire in modern cosmology, right, the redshift--distance relationship is mythical. Arp wrote on the subject of gravitational lensing, he said, "...you must remember that it was invented for extra galactic objects because that was the only escape from observations which required the physical association of objects of much different redshift. The low mass particle masses..., which I've talked about,... give rise to a lower luminosity. That gives a rough, higher redshift--fainter apparent magnitude relation for galaxies of different age at the same distance. And he notes here also and this is something that I picked up. "This should also apply to the supernovae within the galaxies. Of course, this fainter than expected supernova discovery gave rise to the idea that the universe is expanding more rapidly, it's accelerating! But that's sheer nonsense, it means that you don't understand supernova explosions either, which is not a surprise when you think they don't understand gravity. Wal, speaking of Halton Arp and our earlier discussion about the nature of quasars, let's talk now about one of the more remarkable discoveries in the space sciences in recent months. In September of this year, in a paper published in the Astrophysical Journal, a team of scientists reported their observation of "six quiet galaxies shifting into quasars" in a period of time that is literally thousands of times more rapid than standard cosmology can explain. I'll read to you briefly from a Science Alert report, "In a spectacular fashion, six galaxies have just undergone a huge transformation in a matter of mere months. They've gone from relatively peaceful galaxies to active quasars-the brightest of all galaxies, blasting vast amounts of radiation out into the Universe. ...such changing-look transitions are usually observed occurring between different types of Seyfert galaxies... These Seyfert transitions were what the team set out to study." Now, one of the authors of the study states, "Instead, we found a whole new class of active galactic nucleus capable of transforming a wimpy galaxy to a luminous quasar. Theory suggests that a quasar should take thousands of years to turn on, but these observations suggest that it could happen very quickly. It tells us that the theory is all wrong. We thought that Seyfert transformation was the major puzzle. But now we have a bigger issue to solve..." And of course, as we reported previously, this isn't the first time that scientists have observed "impossibly rapid changes in quasars." So Wal, why don't you tell us, generally speaking, why these kinds of incredibly rapid cosmic scale transformations are actually expected in the Electric Universe? I point to the research of plasma cosmologists, which shows that the active galactic nucleus that ejects the quasar, are in fact plasmoids, the most compact form of high-energy storage known. The electrical energy poured into the plasmoid from the spiral arms, forms a tiny doughnut-shaped object. At some point, the energy density closest to the axis of the plasmoid forces the electrons and protons to collide and form neutrons. Having no charge allows the neutrons to escape from the electromagnetic galactic nucleus in axial jets. It seems the neutrons are nature's Houdini's. They only exist as a dance between an electron and a proton for the short time required to escape from the electromagnetic prison of the nucleus of an atom or the nucleus of the galaxy. But in doing so, they give birth to either a new element or a new galaxy, respectively. Nature never does things the hard way. When the neutrons do decay, the freed electrons are held back by the galactic magnetic field more strongly than the heavier protons, which now form a quasar. I proposed that an initially positively charged quasar is therefore followed by a beam of electrons from its parent galaxy, which would explain both the observed quantized redshifts and the increase in mass of the quasar, as a result of increasing charge polarization within the matter in the quasar, as the electrons arrive. Of course, the bursty nature of these outbursts from active galactic nuclei suggests that the electrons may also arrive in bursts, just like the ejections themselves, which would predict and explain seemingly impossibly sudden changes in quasars. Sudden changes on the galactic scale, and even on the stellar scale, are expected in the Electric Universe, simply because we are dealing with a coherent, connected, electrical system operating in real time, in the case of a galaxy--across the entire galaxy. And this is because the electric force is instantaneous and the release of stored electrical energy takes place like a sudden lightning bolt followed by an exponential decay, as that energy dissipates into space. And this is behind all sorts of phenomena that are puzzling researchers at present, where they're getting gamma-ray bursts and fast radio bursts and all sorts of things from seemingly nowhere, and this is another point that Hannes Alfven made; plasma currents that are flowing through space will produce double layers and these double layers can, if the current density gets too high, actually shut the current off, and the result is that the energy is suddenly concentrated at that point, and there's a sudden burst like a lightning bolt and it can happen in apparently empty space, because these double layers are often in dark mode discharge as it's called. In the case of galaxies, the plasmoid itself in the laboratory, it's known that the plasmoid forms and the energy that it concentrates, when it gets to a certain point at very high density, the electrons and the protons which are held in that plasmoid, when they're traveling down this core of the doughnut, is where they're closest together, and that's where the breakdown will first occur. And that breakdown forms a beam of neutrons. In the laboratory, plasmoids are known to be the most copious source of neutrons when they break down. So all of this can be tested in the laboratory, which is one of the big advantages of the Electric Universe cosmology over Standard cosmology. Well indeed, and when it comes to cosmological phenomena, I've always felt that the most significant type of discovery is the evidence for physical connections and interactions of objects over unfathomable distances. I've said before that the model of the Electric Universe might be: "There are no islands in space" and we see this verified more and more frequently. A few months ago, we reported on the discovery of a vast radio-emitting filament which is connecting two galaxy clusters across 10 million light-years and this seems like a dramatic confirmation of a prediction that Anthony Peratt made decades ago, that cosmic scale currents exist in deep space connecting these types of objects. And now, just in the last few weeks, we've seen the report that distant galaxies, which are separated by tens of millions of light years, have been found rotating in synchronicity with one another; a Science Alert report on that discovery states, "The discoveries could force us to rethink our understanding of the Universe." An elite author of a paper on this discovery says, "The observed coherence must have some relationship with large-scale structures, because it is impossible that the galaxies separated by six mega- parsecs directly interact with each other." But I think what the scientists should have said is that the phenomenon is "impossible" under the assumption of an inert and disconnected universe. So Wal, why don't you shed some light on why, like countless other discoveries, this is not impossible, nor surprising in the Electric Universe? The Electric Universe has no problem with the synchronization of galaxies over colossal distances simply because they are all being driven electrically by the same Birkeland current filaments, and the spiral galaxies tend to be strung along them like Catherine wheels on a wire. Both the rotation and the form of a spiral galaxy is explained experimentally and theoretically by plasma cosmologists, and the fact that has been discovered recently, that the rotation of galaxies seems to be somehow strangely similar, is all tied up to the fact that they're all being driven electrically by these circuits, and it's just like electric motors in the home, if they're connected to the same circuit, they will all tend to be synchronized in some fashion, either by the number of cycles per second of the power supply, but in the case of galaxies, all this can be tested and proven in the laboratory. A critical failure of modern cosmology is to assume that gravity is the only force operating on a cosmic scale. Plasma cosmologists, for the last 50 years, have shown that this is incorrect. Electromagnetic forces dominate on the cosmic scale. Supercomputer simulations have shown that introducing gravity into their electromagnetic models has no effect. This should be no surprise given that, compared to the electric force, the force of gravity is effectively zero. This should have been obvious to theorists given that spiral galaxies rotate like the solid disk of a Faraday motor and not a gravitational system where the outer satellites rotate more slowly than the inner. Once again, our Earth-centric view has held back science. Plasma cosmologists showed that spiral galaxies form like Catherine wheels along spiraling intergalactic Birkeland current filaments. It explains both their axial alignments and their rotation. Of course, these recent discoveries should force a rethink of the fundamental understanding of the universe. It should have done so, decades ago, but those doing the research have not been trained to see the alternatives, which have been available since late last century. Cosmologists are taught that yes, there is electricity in space but it doesn't do anything. They are also taught a basic form of plasma physics, which the Nobel prize-winning plasma cosmologist Hannes Alfven showed, is invalid in space, and the tunnel-vision, induced by their training, prevents modern cosmologists from attending plasma cosmology lectures. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info That the planet Earth has been subject to catastrophic events is beyond dispute, but the nature and timing of these events is not. One of the clearest testimonies to ancient upheaval is our planet's craters, which consensus scientific theory proposes are the result of meteoritic impacts. But we have never directly observed a kinetic impact from space producing such a crater. The Electric Universe has proposed for many decades that laboratory experiments with high-energy electrical discharge provide the clearest analog for craters seen on rocky bodies throughout the solar system. In this episode, Thunderbolts Picture of the Day managing editor Stephen Smith discusses some of the clearest evidence for the electrical scarring of our planet, including some of the most famous so-called impact sites on Earth. One of the principal tenets of Electric Universe theory is that sometime in the recent past, there were catastrophic events involving the planets of our solar system, including the Earth. Exactly when those events took place is uncertain, because we're so far removed from them in time. However, forensic evidence is available, including ancient archaeological sites, land-based geological formations, ocean basins, and other structures that often reveal anomalous data. Information from those sources indicates that there were multiple catastrophic occurrences. Indeed, it seems as if pre-catastrophic and post-catastrophic conditions are what 99% of the human race has experienced over its existence. Times of peace and plenty are rare in the historical record. Many articles on The Thunderbolts Project website describe various regions around the world where manifestations of those catastrophic events are visible. The list of articles is extensive, describing places on Earth that are difficult to explain using conventional theories. Places like the Norwegian fjords, the Brandberg Massif in Africa, the Great Trango Tower, the Grand Canyon, Lake Victoria, the Himalayan mountains, along with the principal topic of today's discussion, the Sudbury impact structure and its attendant anomalous elemental deposits. Most, if not all, large craters in North America are thought to have been caused by asteroid impacts. In fact, it was an asteroid that's thought by consensus geologists to be the event that wiped out the dinosaurs, although that idea is no longer as hard and true as it once was, proving the asteroid theory is not easy, because rocks where the evidence is found can't be accurately dated. The fossil record is also indeterminate when it comes to causal issues. Was it a catastrophic event or a gradual decline in species? It appears that some marine species died out millions of years before the so-called impact event. According to an article in the science journal Nature, platinum group element anomalies are found in sedimentary deposits all over North America. No one is sure where the additional heavy elements came from, but there are several ideas proposed. 1) a comet or meteorite storms 2) debris from collisions in space 3) volcanoes 4) mantle plumes The time of the mostly platinum enrichment is thought to be the Younger Dryas period between 12,900 and 11,700 years ago. Some of the elements include platinum, osmium, gold, ruthenium and copper. It's also called the Younger Dryas cooling event when the Northern Hemisphere monsoon declined. How that period, called an ice age, began and ended is a mystery although it's often trucked out as an example of massive and rapid climate change. One of the reasons for the warming at the end of the Younger Dryas is thought to be the impact from a massive comet or a huge number of meteors. There are many large craters in North America and most of them look like they come from a similar time period. The Weaubleau-Osceola structure, the Decaturville and Crooked Creek Missouri formations, the Flynn Creek and the Wells Creek Tennessee craters, might belong to an anomalous chain of craters stretching across the United States, called the 38th parallel anomaly. Most of them exhibit unusual features such as flat floors, steep walls and lightning-like patterns of trenches and gullies that extend from their centers. Geologists speculate that tremendous shock waves from the collisions caused earthquakes and dense pulverized rock fallout all over the world. Modern theories about a post-war nuclear winter are relevant to the dimming of sunlight and significant cooling trends from atmospheric dust. The question no one's asking however is, what if there was no rock? As mentioned, Sudbury Basin in Canada is a large crater, more than 63 kilometers long, 31 kilometers wide, and 15 kilometers deep, the second largest crater on Earth. Ejecta from Sudbury was found more than 800 kilometers away near Lake Superior. The area around Sudbury is shattered into multi-megaton blocks that were pushed away and piled up along the crater rim. Some of the largest fragments were thrown over a hundred kilometers in all directions. Gneiss deposits were fused into a glass-like compound that covered the floor of the crater and splashed up and over the crater rim. The molten glass inundated several hundred square kilometers of the surrounding terrain with a thick layer capping chaotic breccias. Platinum family minerals are found throughout the region including sperrylite, froodite, michenerite and sudburyite. Some records indicate that 1,600 million tons of nickel, copper, platinum and lead, have been extracted from Sudbury over the last hundred years. There are so many anomalous formations in North America that it's impossible to count them all. Even the Great Lakes possess characteristics that could point to an electrical foundation. The gigantic bowl of hardened limestone in which they rest, for instance. In a gradual curve north of the Great Lakes are Lake Winnipeg, Lake of the Woods, Lake Athabasca, Great Slave Lake, Great Bear Lake and many other smaller bodies of water. Near the largest of them are gold mines, led mines, radium and uranium mines, along with mines producing platinum, silver and palladium. Unusual concentrations of heavy metals could mean that transmutation of local elements might have occurred because of the intensity of the electrical discharges. That idea has been suggested in the past as the cause for hematite blueberries on Mars. Electric arcs transmuted silicon into iron. That same phenomenon could have created some of the strange conglomerations of minerals seen on Earth. In an Electric Universe, asteroids are not a primary cause for anomalies. Instead, electric arc discharges are suggested as the sculptor of earth terrain. As I said earlier, where those arcs came from, can't be determined at this late date. Were they from charged celestial bodies encroaching into the electric fields of Earth and other planets like Mars and Venus? Was it a plasma cloud from outside the solar system? Was it a solar flare that charged up Earth's ionosphere? Those questions whose answers can only be guessed at today, await further investigation. The Electric Universe hypothesis offers another perspective on observations. Several factors come into play that are not available to the consensus theories of geophysics, because the lexicon of descriptions available to them doesn't include electric arcs or travelling subterranean electric discharges. There are of course many possible explanations for craters, canyons, escarpments, mountains and ocean basins, but once the electric force is included in the search for those explanations, an entirely new way of seeing the world becomes possible. In this realm, that of deep background in the origination of basic theoretical foundations, those viewpoints must be considered diametrically opposed to the gradualism that dominates science today. Rather than basing opinions on the slow steady familiar processes of erosion, temperature changes, rain, windblown sand, ice and snow, the proponents of Electric Universe theory are attempting to reclassify geophysical processes as rapid, catastrophic and world-changing. In many cases, the almost unimaginable must be acknowledged. Gigantic formations like the Grand Canyon or Manicouagan crater were created in a time period that encompasses the historical memory of humanity. This new paradigm means words like 'crater' for example must be stripped of all previous assumptions that are stimulated by it. One almost immediately thinks volcano or meteor when the word is used. Catastrophism should be part of a new way to see the world and volcanoes or meteor strikes are indeed catastrophic, but geological theory consigns them to the rare or infrequent category. When was the last time a volcano blew out a 100 kilometer-wide crater, for instance? Considering the presumption of an electric discharge, a better description might be circular formation, rather than crater. Lake of the Woods for example, one of the long arc of lakes stretching northwest of the Great Lakes, certainly displays those features that have been described elsewhere as electrical. Concentric rings and radial force patterns are immediately evident, as well as the scalloped edges of the southwestern shoreline. A primordial characteristic of electric arcs is that they spin. They are composed of multiple independent plasma current filaments in a collimated beam. The independent filaments are attracted to one another in a linear relationship but are prevented from coalescing because of electrostatic repulsion, which also causes the filaments to form twisted pairs or Birkeland currents. Electrical engineers use twisted pairs of wires because it's the most efficient means of transferring electrical energy with the least loss. A spinning electric arc will machine down through the strata like an auger of fire. In the case of Lake of the Woods, the three lobed bays that twist in a northerly direction are intriguing, as are the many islands that follow multiple chords like outwardly expanding waves across a wide area. Lake of the Woods is a 110 kilometers long and up to 95 kilometers wide. It has an area of approximately 4,400 square kilometers and more than 14,000 islands. So it's by no means small. Due to its location, it could be considered among one of the lesser cousins to the Great Lakes and could have been formed alongside them in a single cataclysmic event. The Great Lakes, Sudbury, along with but not detailed in this presentation, Manicouagan and Hudson's Bay, reflect just a few of the ways that an Electric Universe paradigm can completely change a worldview. 
In a recent video, I've discussed how stars can become stressed, expelling vast amounts of material outwards. In other scenarios the stars are thought to explode, causing the entire system to malfunction, creating repeating discharges that travel across the plasma which acts like a transmission line. There are a number of different waysthat stars are thought to explode,  or nova. And although mainstream has an idea of how these scenarios can occur, there seem to be many exceptions that break these. So, let's explore some of these strange explosions. Strange Novas. A nova is a sudden explosion of bright light from a two-star system. The main- stream concept is that these are created in a binary system, where one star is a white dwarf which pulls material from a companion star. Over time, the white dwarf draws enough material which heats up and causes an uncontrolled reaction that releases a burst of energy. This in turn shoots matter away at high speed. These events are therefore long-lived and usually fade over a couple of weeks or longer. On the 12th of June 2021, the Nova V 1674 Herculis underwent what appeared like a nova event with a sudden brightening which made it visible to the naked eye. By the next day it had already faded. When astronomers studied the emissions, they discovered that it seemed to be pulsing. Every 501 seconds, there was a sudden change, or pulse in the light and X-rays. Even after the light faded this 501- second wobble was still present. When they went back and studied the emissions just prior to nova, they discovered that this wobble was present even before the outburst and remained through the brightening event and afterwards. Supernovae are more energetic and leave little or nothing behind, unlike a Nova. Ten years ago, supernova SN 2012Z was spotted in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 1309. The event should have been the final swan song of the star. The galaxy has been observed for a long period of time, so it was possible to use this to work out exactly which star went “bang” by looking for the now empty space. They were expecting to see that the star was either completely gone, or maybe that it should still be there, meaning that the star that they observed was not the one that blew up. What they discovered was something that they did not expect to find. The star had survived, but it had somehow become brighter. This was not the first time that they had observed a star surviving a supernova and was another star which would be added to the growing pile of stars that defied the supernova. Even when they die, some seem to defy even this process. In a recent analysis, astronomers used the data from the Hubble telescope to document the demise of a  giant star 35 million light years from Earth. These seem to show something very unexpected: the cool, yellow star had no hydrogen outer layer. In theory, if a star explodes without hydrogen, it should be extremely blue, meaning it is really very  hot. It should not be possible for a star to be this cool without having hydrogen in the outer layer. The scientists examined every single mainstream model, and they all required the star to have hydrogen which they knew from the supernova it didn't have. When they looked back to the images before the supernova, they saw a very normal hydrogen-free star, but the star did not match with the type of supernova they observed. They suggest that maybe the star shed its hydrogen shell years prior to the event, but it  remains a mystery. In theory these large supernova explosions should be final. The energies involved should rip the star apart, but even here, scientists have discovered a rather remarkable star that seems to be able to repeatedly supernova. In 2014, scientists captured a fading supernova near the constellation of  Ursa Major. At first it looked like every other supernova. Over half a billion light years away in a galaxy so far, it's little more than a smudge, a star exploded. Not just once, but over five times over the course of two years. In the process, it ejected a vast amount of material equal to 50 Jupiters and emitted more energy than 10 quintillion (that's 10 to the power of 18) suns. Five months later, when they went back to examine the data, someone spotted something strange. When they looked at a plot of the emissions over the last 137 days, it appeared like the explosion was getting brighter. So they decided to look at the spectrum of light from the star. This seemed to indicate that the nova was only 30 days old, and yet they had concrete proof that it had in fact been going on for months. They continued to study it and followed the supernova as it brightened, then faded, then brightened again. It hit five peaks of brightness before finally dwindling out in the summer of 2016. At 600 days old, it was already the longest-lived supernova ever observed. They now turned to the historical archives and found that the same portion of sky had been observed in 1954 and 1993. In 1993 no supernova was evident, but in the 1954 image there was a noticeable bright spot in the galaxy. As the galaxy is far away, it is not possible to make out individual stars. So,there is a small possibility that the 1954 explosion is caused by another star. No mainstream model of stellar evolution can fully explain these observations. The energy released in the 2014 explosion is greater than their models predict. An analysis of the light coming from the explosion indicated that its chemical composition is different from what astronomers would expect. These findings question how much mainstream astronomers really know about supernovae. Maybe it's time for a new model. Thank you. 
need to know what my topic will be a day you might have guessed it's Astro mathematics and I can tell you that I'm not a proponent of Astro mathematics my purpose today is to reveal to you some of the methods of this very secret craft now the first thing I'd like to tell you is that there are different types of big height black holes and big bangs there are actually four types of black holes that are alleged and there are three types of big bangs that are ledges whenever you hear a proponent of black holes and big bangs talking to you about them do they ever tell you which black hole in which beg bang never they never do so you left guessing provided of course you know that there are four different types of black holes and three different types of big banks to begin with if you don't but whether you're in a real be disadvantaged further now there's a thing here that a couple of things here that I'd like to quote from lineweaver and Davis which was published in Scientific American in 2005 they're tell us here that the space between the galaxies is expanding okay this the Big Bang happened everywhere in the room in which you are reading this article in a spot just to the left of Alpha Centauri everywhere thus we can conceive of the early universe as a pile of overlapping grapefruits that stretches infinitely in all directions correspondingly the idea that the Big Bang was small is misleading the totality of space might be infinite well Weinberg Steven Weinberg is a well-known physicist and he tells us that all spaces in this context may be either infinite universe or a finite universe so they're telling us what Big Bang well they put all together at once so if you're in doubt make altogether the case so if you always guess now they're talking about grapefruit so is it fruit I thought to myself we thought it's they're telling us it's grapefruit and all along we thought it was fruit in general so we must have made a mistake why nominally name this the pH C B this is the principle of hedging cosmological bets now let's have a look here at the defining characteristics of black holes and big bangs I put five up there they've quite generic all types of black holes have mentioned there are four types they all share these characteristics and the three types of BIGBANG's that are alleged have this characteristic let's compare them they're very simple all black hole universes are spatially infinite they're eternal verities they're static or stationary they contain only one mass they are not expanding and they're either asymptotically flat or asymptotically curved that might sound a little hairy theory but it doesn't really matter if you don't know if you know of an asymptote with a hyper for example the hyperbola against the x and y axis that's all it is now when we compare this to all the alleged Big Bang universes we find that the Big Bang universes are either spatially infinite in one case or sorry spatially finite in one case or spatially infant in two different cases well it doesn't match the black hole characteristic then they're of a finite age that means the non static or non station they tell us now that they're about 13.8 billion years it's crept up every now and then from the bits of increments 13.8 billion well the black hole universe is eternal the Big Bang universe is contained radiation and many masses there allegedly expanding and they're not asymptotically anything so how can you have a black hole universe in a Big Bang universe when they're diametrically opposed by very definition you can't but they do they put them all together and they never tell you which ones they're putting together now another point here is the Big Bang universe is from my previous slide you might have seen or characterized by K values I'll call them k curvatures there's three types minus one zero or one well we come to this one again we see no alleged Big Bang knowledge black hole universe has a big bang knowledge black hole universe has a big benkei curvature then or even the same types of universes so but they still put them together so we see that black hole universes and Big Bang universe are mutually exclusive they can't coexist even by the very theory that these people use yet they put them together and construct multiple black holes in a Big Bang universe they never specify which Big Bang universe and they never tell you which black hole they're talking about so you can see that it's quite a nonsensical here's a little example rather of the principle of superposition violations it relates to what I've just been talking about let's say X is a black hole universe it doesn't matter what one any one you like and we have a wise a Big Bang universe then we have X plus y is not a universe in Einstein's theory why because X plus y is a linear combination and generally theory is what we call a nonlinear theory so you cannot make a linear combination of solutions the first and the second thing is we see that x and y pertain to completely different sets of Einstein field equations so they have absolutely nothing to do with one another so how do they get them to match or put them together linearly they can't but they do because they just decided that's what they want to do but that doesn't work it violates the general relativity the fear of generality itself so you can't do that but they do it all the time here's a quote from Martin Rees he's the astronomer royal he tells us that black holes are all over the place and their consequences of Einstein's theory well in what Big Bang universe he doesn't tell us but he does think it's in the Big Bang universe you can see that it doesn't make sense now all Big Bang universes contrary to what you might be led to believe are one massing of vs. because they model the universe as being fully completely filled by a single indivisible homogeneous distribution of matter and so if that's the case how do you account for gravity all experiments show that gravity is an interaction between two or more masses well you can't get that from a model that models a whole universe as a single master can't be divided up in the bits nonetheless they divided up into bits and tell us that the great big bang universe has got lots of black holes some of them are primordial sizes of black holes don't change types they're not types it's like human beings we've got different races but we've got big ones and small ones on a small one but you know so we've got different types different races same with black holes big ones and small ones are not types they just sizes whatever you got here now I can't read without my glasses and I haven't got good ones so what do we got here oh yes well how do they get these black holes and big bangs to go together they apply the principle of superposition we saw earlier that you can't do that because generative is a nonlinear theory you have two different solutions and you add them together you haven't got a solution right you can't do that you have to solve a set of equation specifically now this is not a NASA photograph you can tell it's not a NASA photograph because on the right hand side written in vertical small print it says an artistic impression this is a standard method of presenting photographs or images of black holes and big bangs now we have an astronaut here this is called spaghettification if you don't know about it you get stretched like a piece of spaghetti well the astronaut on the left is a very happy little Vegemite he's standing on the earth you see smiling now this one on the right he's falling into a black hole or maybe a star because black holes and stars distinctly described by the same alleged solutions so he's being stretched why well which way is he falling you can't tell is he falling headfirst or is he falling feet first let's say he's falling headfirst the black hole was star must be above his head so he's falling in he gets stretched like a piece of spaghetti because they tell us that the tidal forces gravitational forces on his head are stronger than those on his feet and so he gets stretched as he falls into this black hole the trouble is in general relativity gravity's another force we see here quote from a paper boy well him to see there was a famous Dutch astronomer and he tells us what we already know anyway that in general relativity gravity is not a force so you don't have a force of gravity so why do they invoke forces of gravity to spaghettify astronauts falling into black holes in other words they're using Newtonian ideas or forces to describe gravitational forces where in generality there are no forces because what's what's gravity it's a curvature of space-time so we would have to say the curve to a space/time on his head he's bigger or stronger than the curvature of space-time on his feet in some hair another he gets a lot more curved stretched at such well apples are fruit aren't they you take you go to the you go to the grocery remember the old days you go the grocery store and you would go to they have a grocer would have a a pen in a spring balance you put your apples in the spring balance and it stretches the spring and you read off the gauge is that's two dollars or whatever it cost for the apothem apples well how do you weigh apples using general relativity you know it's a curvature of space-time the what's in the spring it's a force it's stretching the spring we know that's forces it's very simple physics you cannot why apples with general relativity you can't buy anything with general relativity so if you've got a theory of gravity that can't account for weighing apples at the grocery store what kind of theory of gravity have you got mm-hmm tell me here is a black hole universe this is not this is based on an earth on a NASA photograph I drew it but it's based on a NASA photograph this is the kind of presentations you get so I thought I just put that in as let you know now what do we got here let's say that the top line the horizontal line is flat space-time and the horror in the vertical line goes off to the singularity where it's infinitely curved space-time well as you move away from the center by the radial distance you get closer and closer but you never actually touched the top line horizontal one year close this is called asymptotic flatness or asymptotic curve it as if it's a curved space-time right so this is a part of the definition the black hole it goes off to infinity and encounters no other masses because otherwise you wouldn't have the definition of a black hole so let's compare this now we'll compare this to two black holes well in this diagram I've got the two black holes here next to one another and a little insert there with lots of black holes we see here that in between these two black holes are they asymptotically flat no what about the left black hole and the right black hole will the left black hole encounters it's not as importantly flat between them and it encounters in curvature where the other black hole is well similarly the right black hole it encounters non it's not a knot no Kurt no no asymptotic flatness in the middle or curvature in the middle and it encounters a infinite curvature at the other black hole but by the definition of black holes they must be asymptotically flat or asymptotically curved that's not possible can't be because let's have a look at what this fellow Daniel Stone he's a lead author on the wise survey for NASA they reckon they've got black holes cornered he tells us that they found 2.5 million black holes with a wide survey well that means each one of these black holes that he talks about encounters two million four hundred and ninety nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine infinite curvatures all around it that's a long way from being asymptotically anything so that violates the very definition of a black hole you can't have black holes all over the place black holes are one mass universes that doesn't describe anything here's a real gem I really like this one this is about escape velocities this is what here we find in the dictionary of geophysics and astrophysics a black hole is a region of space-time from which the escape velocity exceeds the velocity of light similarly we find in the import by Hawking in his book the theory of everything he tells us that you can't escape from the event horizon white hovers forever on the edge of the black hole it doesn't even get out and there here's my favorite one Professor Joseph Lee and Hawthorne at the University of Sydney at the Institute for astronomy he was on television at this on the ABC one not long ago he tells us that the escape velocities of black holes is the speed of light therefore light can't escape think about that light the speed of light is the light travels at the speed of light the escape velocity is the speed of light wouldn't life at escape he tells us no it doesn't escape this is on national television now I put a little annotation here because it seems to me that astrophysics has stumbled upon a solution to a long-standing out along outstanding anthropological problem failure when typological problem on the left its Homo erectus on the right its cro-magnon man the paleoanthropologist tell us that hi my reckless didn't have the brain capacity to make such contributions and cro-magnon men they tell us had the read the grain capacity to spot such contradictions but somewhere in between there's a brain capacity that can make contradictions and never realize it that's the missing link you all you you know so I reckon so so Charles Dawson and his co-accused they didn't have to go out and get themselves an ape-man the bull and fall down the tooth and die there and rub them in the closet Piltdown they get their missing link all I had to do is interview a few astrophysicists and astronomers at the time they would have found them there okay now here we got some magical material sources this is Einstein's field equations I've included the cosmological constant that's a second term there on the left these are really ugly customers so we're going to turn it into words but thing on the left with the G that's one Stein's tensor the thing with a lambda that's the cosmological constant the thing on the right hand side is the energy momentum tensor well it's turned that back into some meaningful words' space-time curvature equals a constant times the material source is why because space-time curvature is the gravity gravitational field that it's induced by the presence of the material sources this is what Einsteins field equations do they couple the gravitational forces or the gravitational field because there are no forces to its sources okay so the space-time curvature is induced by the presence of material sources let's take these two examples on the Left we've got case one let's make the material sources disappear like Einstein does he says Teague was nought and we make the letter lambda equals another cosmological constant naught as well his field equations reduced to this thing it's called the Ricci tensor well it's nothing other than a statement that says energy momentum tensor equals the Lord example is the starch chilled solution it's a solution for that that's supposedly a black hole solution or a star solution on the right hand side we've got energy momentum tensor equals zero but the cosmological constant doesn't equal zero so we've got the Ricci tensor equals a cosmological constant term and his momentum tensor still equals naught because T is not this is do sitters empty universe it's well known why is it empty because it doesn't contain anything let's have a look at this on the left hand side material sources are naught but there's a material source on the right hand side energy momentum source in mentem tensor is zero there's no material sources but isn't empty universe so by the very very same constraint you have matter present and absent how can that be it's nonsense it's impossible of course unless you're an escrow Mathemagician you can do it now the principle of equivalence Einstein here I just taken a little bit from it the point of it is if you read this thing you see that his principle of equivalence is defined in terms of the AR priori presence of multiple masses and photons well we've just seen that black hole universes are one mess universes and we've seen that Big Bang universe is one messy reduces but in fact black hole universes are empty universes because we saw in the previous slide that there's a contradiction between these two things managing momentum tensor is zero and you have matter both present and absent that's impossible so you cannot have multiple masses in either of these two models Einstein's principle equivalence is couched in terms of the presence of multiple masses and photons so black hole universe and Big Bang universe even violate the principle of equivalence that Einstein said why should I didn't even realize himself that he was violating his own principles when he wrote these things down oh these are really nice we put some grandpoo bars of gravitation called maizena Thorne and wheeler they wrote a book is the size of a telephone book and they tell us in that that let's read it one crucial assumption that's at the heart or the basis at the standard big hot Big Bang model the universe began in a state of rapid expansion from a nearly homogeneous isotropic condition of infinite or near infinite density and pressure well I asked the question how close to the infinite must you get to be near infinite is it infinite minus one maybe it's infinite minus opinion you can never know well he's not the only one worried Kraus got on TV on us in Australia you actually get on television in Australia Larry and he tells us this that he can get an almost an infinite number of what universes well they are how close does Larry have to get to an infinite to infinity to have almost an infinite number again is it infinity minus one you know this seems to be a code of practice with Astro mathematics that you're not allowed to use common parlance so I've got to refrain from the vernacular so I'll translate it into what and that's a scholarly language have you ever heard a bigger crock right austere Kasturi in your life those of you who know Latin will know what I mean those who don't just look it up it's on you can google it okay here's another thing they do black holes have singularities Penrose and Hawking tell us that they found these singularities in all black hole solutions well there are two types of singularities there it's either a point or the circumference of a circle I don't mean a circle I mean the circumference of a circle right and they're supposed to be infinitely dense will you tell me how a point or a circumference of a circle can have mass well it doesn't have volume so they divide the mass which they pulled onto the circumference or the point and they divide it by zero and they tell you that the answer is infinity is that real first infinity is not a number in the second thing is you can't by divide by zero as you know from primary school that's not allowed it's undefined but they do and they say it's infinity and then they assign physical properties to it they call them singularities or event horizons but it's nonsense yeah well this is just the follow up in the previous slide these guys Carol and Asli theis that it's not a mathematical artifact you can divide by node it's not a mathematical artifact the other guys tell us it's not a limiting function and not a limiting fiction so it's not like a limit in elementary calculus you take the limit now they're dividing by nought and it's true you can divide by Norden get infinity 1 1 is what school I went to I'm only glad I didn't go there okay the infinite hotness of nothing here's walking telling us that the universe began and it's had a zero size but it was infinitely high well what's temperature it's all these particles jiggling around isn't it don't you have to have space to have particles and don't they need space to jiggle around but Hawking tells us it was zero sighs but he's got an infinite temperature you've got no jiggling so he can't have a temperature and how fast would they be jiggling to be infinitely hot the mind boggles you know now Larry Krauss on television he's he's got a lot of gems this guy he gets in television and he tells us that he's got no there's no space there's no time there's no particles and they're ready he says this is a good approximation or nothing in other words nothing's a good approximation to nothing you know I can ask you is zero a good approximation to zero so nothing is not nothing I was another one from Larry he tells us that he would argue that nothing is a physical quantity it's the absence of something can you believe it I thought to myself does that include the absence of neurons here we come again he's hilarious he's a big timer the second coming of Kraus I couldn't resist it the universe came again from nothing there's no radiation no space no time no nothing etcetera etcetera that's the reason why it's hard he got chopped off there you can read the transcripts someone chopped him off they must have a cigarette but what does hawking tell us energy cannot be created out of nothing they just told us the universe came out of nothing but walking tells us no you can't Energy's not created you can't create energy out of nothing what's there dark energy isn't it energy didn't they create that out of nothing yeah but you can't do that talk about contradictions here's numerical methods well they think you can now solve for multiple black holes while numerical methods because I know that they can't get an analytic solution for two or more masses with Einstein's equations so what do they do they pretend they've got two or more black holes and then they applied the numerical methods to them they haven't given us a numerical salute or a set of equations to solve to define the two black holes or more black holes they just say oh we've got these black holes let's make numerical methods to make a merge so it's numerical methods on nonsense what do you get from that more nonsense ah this is Lucy she's my favorite blonde we talk physics when we go walking in the park she's three years old she's a semi and she's beautiful I love her very much this is the Australian grass tree it's very interesting you see this tree it's very ancient and fascinating it has a base like a trunk that bright black trunk there grows tall and you see the grass is called a grass tree because these grass comes out of the head and it has a spear growing up through the center and another top of the spear is a kind of a spear head and it's a really ancient thing really fascinating unfortunately don't have time to discuss it so we'll have to move on now let's if you take a glass of water and put inside a microwave oven and turn it on tell us something does the water reflect or absorb the microwaves if you're an astronaut the magician you don't know the answer but if you've ever used the microwave oven you know that the water absorbs the microwaves doesn't it does it reflect them would you what if you put a block of ice in there and do the same thing what if you put your head in there and you turned it on would you do it I wouldn't do it why because you absorbed microwaves and your heads full of water so water absorbs microwaves what are we know from physics physics tells us that anything that's a good absorber is also good emitter right so if water absorbs microwaves in emits microwaves that's very important we know that from a microwave oven hmm now here's water some water molecules water molecules are very interesting the water molecule itself can be considered as a monomer then if you have two of them join up together with a hydrogen bond you have a dimer and then many of them join up by hydrogen bonds each water molecule can form four hydrogen bonds right and this core it forms a kind of fleeting polymer structure and these hydrogen bonds are the other responsible actually for the emissions of microwaves from water so this is a very important thing to remember about water why what is the mechanism you need an oscillator of some kind to generate emissions in water it's this now absolute and differential instruments these wmf was what we call differential instrument and Coby furious was an absolutely instrument in a kind of way what the Furious satellite did it compared the sky signal to an onboard calibrator so it's still kind of a differential instrument but it's called an absolute instrument whereas W map for instance had to say two horns the signals come in and if they're the same you cancel the signals by comparing them together if they're the same signal that cancels everything out right anything that's not the same in that in the two horns is left behind as difference data so you have some remnants if they're exactly the same they will disappear when you subtract in signal now with the Furious instrument you have a calibrator set at a temperature that you can modify they take the sky signal and then they modify the temperature to match what they think is a sky signal and then if they get what's called a null a difference between the two is zero then this hour the sky signal is exactly what our collaborator is because now we get a zero white can separate different in the two well with W map they remove what's called the monopole seed with the mean temperature of the so-called Cosmic Microwave Background and they're left with little bits that aren't the same in the two horns so that's called the anti so trapeze right so this is the difference between the two the Planck satellite however was a bit different it's capable of an absolute the detection and it's also capable of a differential measurement right so the question is what did these satellites measure well the first thing is when you take a real microwave image let's think of what it's composed of think of transparencies piled upon one another right the top one we've got here the Galactic foreground that's noise you got to get rid of that it's a lot of noise coming from the galaxy it's a meeting in microwave how do you get rid of that data processing then after that we've got a monopole signal this is around about three Kelvin the foreground is about millikelvin then we've got a dipole signal it's due to the motion of the satellite against the Galactic group or the local group it's in nearly Kelvin as well and behind all of these we have what are called multi polls higher orders it's because it's made into an infinite series mathematically it's an infinite series in spherical harmonics okay so we've got to get rid of the Galactic foreground the dipole signal and what's left our mean temperature well then we want to get rid of that and we can get the dipoles so sorry I'm the multipoles now balloons and Rockets went up into the atmosphere so they measured stuff in the atmosphere well when we've talked about water in the microwave what about the earth is not covered in water the Earth's about 70 percent coated in water covered in water water emits microwaves these microwaves are going up into the atmosphere they're getting scattered around Coby didn't have a shield for microwaves only RF and thermal so what is it's 900 kilometers it's getting microwaves from Earth because they're bouncing over the shield of deflecting over the shield all of these balloons and satellites which rather balloons and rockets up into the atmosphere the Earth's atmosphere is full of microwaves from water reservoirs the atmosphere is full of water too so we have a look now where these satellites are located here is Kobe furious very close to the earth 900k is up right and this is not the scale of course so it's getting microwaves from the War of the earth it's going up into the Furious horn by diffraction right they think it's cosmic but it's not it's getting it from the earth right because watery mids and they couldn't protect it from this here is an inner fury Graham from the Kobe theorists team see the top trace this is where they say they get a null between the sky and a temperature about what seven point two point seven three five two point seven five nine is it yeah I think so and then you look at the second trace this is a sky it's a near Nile at two point seven some other one and between the two calibrates that they had on board well this is very deceptive you see the top trace in the bottom trace they're on the wrong they're on a different scale the Kobe Furious team published this if you read that you think oh they must go to a null they didn't they didn't get a null in a way because the top and bottom traces three two fight they had their amplitude suppressed by a factor of three to five compared the middle one so if you amplify these two traces of top and bottom they didn't get to know anywhere but they claimed they did not even at that temperature they claimed it was a two point seven to five that it doesn't even appear in their data so that's a pretty shifty looking graph here's another one notice that this is a blackbody curve it differs from the perfect one by nothing it's the the error bars are 400 times smaller than the width of the width of the curve and what do you find here let's count the divisions from the from zero one two three four is something wrong three this graph has been shifted to the left there's a division missing where does it start they haven't told us where it starts that's very convenient now we might analyze that and try to figure out where it's make some sense of it but they presented this as a data that's the data for their blackbody curve so the separative graph it seemed properly labeled why did they do that well they didn't get a graph that didn't get an inferior gram that got him a temperature with a null and I present this is a perfect null doesn't add up here is a monopole signal it fills the sky that's the one that's the so-called mean temperature of the CMB it fills everything right that's the one that they say is the temperature of the universe here is the DMR or the differential microwave radiometers from Kobe notice that there's a big strip in the middle red that's the Galactic foreground why is it present because they couldn't zero the foreground so they present here an anti Sacopee map with the foreground the foreground is anisotropic the monopoles disappeared because the two horns cancelled and remove the monopole because it's in the same the same in each horn but here we've got the bits that differ including the glycan ik foreground well it appears because I couldn't get rid of it they're trying to look through the galaxy to find these little bits that are 1 million times smaller than the mean temperature of the so-called CMB well if you can't get rid of it with data processing you use scissors see they cut it out I didn't do this this comes from George Smoot he did it with scissors can you believe it well here's a really interesting thing I'd like to read it to you so I'll come over here so I can read it properly this is from some smut and his colleagues we were confident that the quadrupole was a real cosmic symbol by late January and early February the results were beginning to gel but they still did not quite make sense I tried all kinds of different approaches plotting beta in every format I could think of including upside down up down backwards just to try a new perspective and hoping for a breakthrough and I thought why not throw out the quadrupole the thing I'd been searching for all those years and see if Nature had put anything else there why by puzzled did I have to remove the quadrupole to see the wrinkles well quadrupole is one of those multipoles I talked about before he thinks they're real right well professor Robert has got a really really neat answer to this the answer to this question is one of data processing when smart and his colleagues impose the systematic removal of signal they produce the systematic remnant in essence the act of removing the quadrupole created the multipoles and the Associated systematic ni site repeat once a quadrupole has removed the multipoles appeared as extremely consistent variations on the maps parent and isotropy must not be generated by processing so in other words George Smoot and his colleagues couldn't tell the difference between data and data induce spots before their eyes they think that's data here is where l2 is see the earth l2 is 1.5 million kilometers away from Earth that's where W map was and where the Planck satellite was there's no monopole signal out there W map couldn't detect it because it was a differential instrument Planck has never reported the finding of a monopole why because there is no monopole the monopole signal with a mean temperature is from Earth from the water in the atmosphere and that's what Kobe detected it didn't have a shield remember the microwaves diffracted over here is some comparative maps well look at this on the left Piper corner that's the K band this is these frequencies in which W map sampled look at that how red is that it was full of so much noise it was useless the one next to it's not much better so what did they do decide to do well they combined all of these maps and then they played around with it and they waited the V band why because it looks the best we don't like that one up in the left-hand corner we'd better not use it so they gave it really low waiting and they did this to get themselves a map of the universe that looks like this magically all that noise from the flight before ground is gone yeah but remember it's 1,000 times weaker than the Galactic foreground well we know from laboratory experience if you're trying to extract the signal that's 1,000 times weaker than the noise you can only do it if you have one of two things satisfied you either they have up your knowledge of the nature of the source or the ability to manipulate the source if you can't do that you can't extract that signal that noise is too overpowering so how did they do it data processing on nonsense this is the Planck receiver low-frequency instrument they compared the sky to another onboard calibrator right just like ferris did right but it's a more sensitive instrument goes in they compare the thing in that box right now let's have a look at there see this this is their calibrator or their load notice on the bottom how they connected it they connect the dead load their so-called black body by bolting it to the high frequency shield the high frequency shield was maintained at 4 Kelvin right this is supposed to be a black body comparator in other words this should be a meeting around about 4 K into the horn as an emitter but it's got one those those connectors there are stainless steel washers you got conduction so they're conducting heat out of this into the shield they're not this doesn't have to meet a single photon in other words they're black bodies on board don't even work so Planck this is a serious design flaw Planck cartridges anything without the 4 K loads there's no monopole adèle - they can't they can't find anything how do they do it well it's just the data procedural issue the main you know none of its real so my final fliers is believe it or not it is now being alleged that alignments between the dipole and the multi poles of the fictitious CMB or generated by data processing form an axis of evil seriously and this axis of evil right tells us that we are at the center of the universe we're going back to medieval times with epicycles and the earth is at the center of the universe can you believe this that's what now the CMB is being useful right now I had a lot of jokes about this but the truth of the matter is it's serious but it's so ridiculous that you can't help but laugh at the physics is now become intellectually decrepit so I will conclude there by telling you why what the parallax effect on short here really is well according to the grand poobahs again it's a Baldy pipe why because black holes they don't have any hair that's the reason why I gave that title thank you very much 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info August 26, 2017 will mark the 5-year anniversary of the inaugural episode of the science video series Space News from the Electric Universe. The Thunderbolts project created this series as an opportunity for its chief principals and many contributors to offer analysis and explanation of space science discoveries in the world today. For many years previous members of the electric universe community have become increasingly aware of the remarkable predictive successes of electric universe theory versus those of the standard cosmology. But it's also apparent that a disturbing disconnect exists between science discovery and the direction of the theoretical sciences. Many of the most significant space discoveries, completely unexpected in standard reasoning, seem to rarely, if ever, force any meaningful reassessment of foundational theory. Other discoveries seem to have been forgotten entirely disappearing down a memory hole and never mentioned in science literature again. Therefore, we shall now begin a comprehensive summary of the amazing content we have covered in the last 5 years and, as you will see, at every scale throughout the universe. The ability of the Electric Universe theory to both predict and explain discovery has never been more evident. In recent years there have been unprecedented opportunities to learn about the nature and origins of one of the most mysterious objects in space, the comet. The Electric Universe has always offered an interpretation of comets that radically differs from standard theory. Comets are not dirty snowballs, the primordial icy leftovers from the solar system's formation four-and-a-half billion years ago. Comets, as well as asteroids and meteoroids, were born far more recently formed by electrical discharges from the surfaces of planets and moons. Because comets are not icy bodies they do not slowly sublimate due to solar heating. Comet activity, including the production of comet jets and the cometary coma, is electrical activity. The detection of signatures of water molecules in cometary coma is due to electrochemical reactions at the comet, as we'll explain further, later in this episode. In fact the findings of increasingly ambitious comet missions have overwhelmingly confirmed the predictions of the electrical model. Combined, the list of surprises amount to the clear falsification of standard comet theory. One of the many game-changing surprises came as far back as 1996 when the Ulysses spacecraft encountered the ion tail of Hyakutake. At the time the spacecraft was more than 360 million miles from the comet or roughly four times the distance of the Earth from the Sun. The belief in electrically neutral objects in space has prevented mainstream scientists from confronting the obvious conclusion of this discovery. In order to remain intact over such a stupendous distance rather than dispersing like a gas in a vacuum, the comet tail must carry an electrical current to confine the material and prevent its dispersal. Electric currents in space, traveling through the conductive medium of plasma, take the form of twisted filaments, known as Birkeland currents, which look a bit like braided copper wire. In fact, in decades subsequent to Ulysses' counter with Hyakutake the Birkeland currents and comet tails have been imaged in ever finer detail clearly confirming their electrical nature. The emission of x-rays from Hyakutake also shocked comet investigators. As dr. Michael J Mumma wrote about the discovery, "Astronomers...decided to look at Hyakutake and they were shocked by what they saw. ROSAT images revealed a crescent-shaped region of x-ray emission around the comet 1,000 times more intense than anyone had predicted... We had no clear expectation that comets would shine in X-rays." Comet scientists responded with the ad-hoc notion that the Sun was entirely responsible for the x-rays, suggesting that the solar wind scavenges electrons from a cometary atmosphere resulting in a recombination sufficient to generate the observed x-rays. The surprises in comet science continued and intensified. In 2001, the NASA spacecraft Deep Space 1 captured the finest image to that time of any comet nucleus. What scientists saw bore no resemblance to the dirty snowball of Standard Theory. The leader of the mission's imaging team said at the time, "It's mind-boggling and stupendous. These pictures have told us that comet nuclei are far more complex than we had ever imagined. They have rugged terrain, smooth rolling plains, deep fractures and very, very dark material." Scientists were also stunned when they found that the flow of ions around the comet's nucleus was "not centered on the comet's nucleus as scientists expected before the Borelli flyby." But none of these findings forced any real reassessment about the nature of comets prior to NASA's Stardust mission in 2004. In fact a microchip, riding on the Stardust spacecraft, was inscribed with the following pronouncement from Fred Whipple, the father of the dirty snowball comets model, "Today we know that comets are black and cold, consisting of ices and dust that coalesced from an interstellar cloud as it collapsed to form the solar system." So it's no wonder that scientists who subscribe to this concept were completely baffled by the Stardust finding at comet Wild2. The surprises began with the Comet's visual appearance which was desiccated, complex and rough, rather than icy and smooth. A major shock was the presence of so-called impact craters on the comet nucleus. As reported by New Scientist in 2004, "That is completely unexpected because comets are believed to be loose aggregations of dust and ice that would shatter on impact... if the pits are craters, the surface of the comet nucleus must be much stronger than experts thought." NASA's Ray Newburn said of the discovery, "I don't think any of us ever really considered the possibility of impact craters... It may be a well- cemented rubble pile, but it's definitely not a loose powdery surface." When scientists on Earth tested the Wild2 dust samples, what they found was so unexpected they initially thought that the early sample may have been contaminated by the spacecraft. Rather than the expected ancient interstellar grain, the Wild2 dust grains were much larger than expected and contained minerals such as anorthite and diopside which required temperatures of thousands of degrees. NASA curator Michael Zolensky said of the discovery, "That's a big surprise. People thought comets would just be cold stuff that formed out...where things are very cold... It was kind of a shock to not just find one but several of these, which implies they are pretty common in the comet. Unfortunately, neither these nor the many previous astonishing comet discoveries seemed to force any reevaluation of comet theory prior to the Deep Impact mission to comet Tempel 1 in 2005. Scientists still assumed that comets were dirty snowballs that accreted four and a half billion years ago. But the chief principals of the Thunderbolts project felt confident that the NASA mission would only provide support for the electric comet model. Prior to the July 4 2005 impact date for the Tempel 1 probe, Wallace Thornhill and David Talbott issued a series of predictions for the event which were published on the Thunderbolts.info website. Because of the comet's low eccentricity orbit, they wrote that electrical interactions with the approaching probe, "May be slight, but they should be measurable if NASA will look for them... The most obvious would be a flash shortly before impact." And they predicted that temperatures associated with the event would be, "much higher than expected from impact heating." They also predicted, "More energy will be released than expected because of the electrical contributions of the comet." And they predicted that the impact crater, left by the NASA probe, would be smaller than expected because the comet is rock, more similar to an asteroid than a loose conglomeration of ice and dust. These predictions, as well as several others on the comet's composition and surface terrain, received stunning confirmation. Moments before the 800-pound copper projectile struck the comet nucleus, NASA scientists were amazed by the bright electrical flash shortly followed by an explosion much larger than they anticipated when the impactor contacted the surface. As NASA investigator Peter Schultz said at the time, "What you see is something really surprising. First, there is a small flash, then there's a delay, then there's a big flash and the whole thing breaks loose." Nor did the projectile leave nearly the dramatic impact crater scientists had predicted. Just one piece of evidence that the comet nucleus was much harder than NASA had expected. As reported by Universe Today, "Swift scientists have seen a quick and dramatic rise in ultra violet light, evidence that the Deep Impact probe struck a hard surface, as opposed to a softer, snowy surface." In 2011, when the Tempel 1 nucleus was reimaged, scientists had to explain why the crater left by the projectile was much smaller than predicted. The Deep Impact team then made the extraordinary claim that ejecta exploding off of the comet somehow fell back down and refilled the crater in the near zero-gravity environment of the comet. As reported by space.com at the time, "Tempel 1's man-made crater partially healed itself as the ejecta settled and refilled part of the depression." Like every other comet nucleus image to date Tempel 1 appeared desiccated and rocky nor did the projectile produce the expected release of theoretical subsurface water on the comet. As noted by astronomer Charles Qi in 2005, "The material that came out was a surprise to scientists: a cloud of fine powdery material emerged, not the water, ice and dirt that were expected." Nor did close-up images of the nucleus reveal the theoretical vents from which comet jets are supposed to emanate. As reported in the journal Icarus in 2007 by P C Thomas et all, "It has proven difficult to identify specific landforms that can be identified as the 'vents' discussed for many decades in classical comet literature, as it is difficult to locate them on Borrelly and Wild2." Nevertheless, when we fast-forward to 2014, scientists with the European Space Agency's Rosetta mission to comet 67P appeared to offer no meaningful revisions of comet theory, even in the face of all previous surprises. The mission to land a probe on a comet nucleus was based on the notion of comets as icy snowy accretions, left over from the solar system's formation. But the major surprises for investigators began long before the Rosetta spacecraft reached the comet. One early puzzling detail was the comet's double-lobed shape, a mystery also found on several other imaged nuclei. Eventually, Rosetta scientists settled on the hypothesis that the comet's strange form resulted from two comets improbably colliding in a vast region of space and somehow sticking together rather than disintegrating. But as we noted in many Space News episodes, the double lobe form is important from an electrical perspective. As electrical engineers have always known, peanut-shaped spherules are common products of electrical discharges as seen in this example by physicist CJ Ransom, compared side-by-side with comet 67p. As the probe drew closer, the comet's complex desiccated rubble-strewn terrain which was, in the words of one Rosetta investigator, "dry like hell", drew increasing expressions of amazement from scientists around the world. The amazement was understandable, given the complete refutation of the standard predictions for the comet's form. Consider this side-by-side comparison of images revealing the failure of comet theory over the years. On the left is an artist's rendition of the expected appearance of comet Halley before the mission to Halley in 1986. We see a smooth snowy surface, exactly what one expects if comets are icy accretions whose dramatic displays result from sublimation of ices. In the middle we see a slightly modified artistic rendition, forged leading up to the Rosetta mission, a surface that is still covered with snow and ice but modified to reflect the completely unexpected images of dry, rocky and complex comet nuclei. On the right we see the actual nucleus of Comet 67p as imaged by the Rosetta mission. It wasn't just the drynesss of 67P's terrain that startled mission scientists. Closer and closer images revealed greater mysteries as the topography of the nucleus revealed numerous planetary features, an explicit prediction of the Electric Universe; including mesas, rubble and large boulders, cliffs, sharp edges, wind streaked rocks and incredibly, even sand dunes. There was also stratification of material and evidence for complex geological layering. If comets were electrically excavated from planets and moons, as proposed by the chief principals of the Thunderbolts project, all of the observed features are to be expected. Consider again this side-by-side comparison of a region of the 67p nucleus and the Sawtooth Mountains on earth. The electric comet model also predicts that comet activity is generally driven by the comet experiencing voltage spikes when it moves from the relatively negatively charged outer regions of the solar system towards the Sun's more positively charged domain. This perspective predicts and explains many of the Rosetta findings including the "surprising discovery of fast-moving electrons and electric fields very close to the comet nucleus" as well as the discovery of negatively charged fluffy dust grains lofted from the nucleus. Electrical discharge activity on the comet also explains the formation of sand dunes and other unexpectedly dynamic changes on the comet's surface. As we explained in several Space News episodes, the initial observation of sand dunes was met with complete disbelief by scientists around the world. As blogger Emily Lakdawalla wrote, Other features are odd because they look familiar and yet have no right being on a comet. I've called them 'rhythmic ridges' ...but to pretty much everyone who looks at them, they look like sand dunes. Which are just plain impossible on a body that has neither atmosphere nor much of any gravity." In multiple Space News episodes, we presented experimental footage, as shown here by researcher Billy Yelverton, showing that sand dunes are easily created by electric fields which produce ionic winds and organize dust material. In fact, the scientific mainstream has finally begun recognizing the electrical cause of dust raising events on comets and other solar system bodies. In a 2016 NASA funded study the researchers suggest an electrostatic mechanism for dust transport on many bodies including the Moon, asteroids, and comets. A Phys.org report on the study stated that, "Electrostatic processes may be responsible for the Rosetta detection of fluffy dust particles released from the surface of comet 67P." But when considering the nature and origins of comets, one pathway that comet investigators must be willing to explore is the explanation of comet water production by electrochemical means. In recent years, Dr. Franklin Anariba, a specialist in electrochemistry at Singapore University of Technology and Design, has been presenting his thesis at annual Thunderbolts conferences. In a five-part Space News presentation in 2015, Dr. Anariba proposed that a process of electron stripping releases O₂, OH and other chemical species into the cometary coma. The discovery of an electron density in the vicinity of the 67P nucleus is important. It can mean that the chemical O₂ can absorb a negative charge through charge exchange which is then followed by a process called protonation via solar wind at the comet. Water formation can then be explained via a series of pathways as Dr. Anariba has outlined. This explanation, never pursued by comet investigators in the scientific mainstream, could eliminate the need for any imaginary reservoir of subsurface comet water ice and it explains many comet mysteries, including the amazing desiccation of comet nuclei and the overabundance of so-called water production found in many cometary comas. It was a puzzle to 67P investigators why the comet was already producing an abundance of water and surprisingly rich molecules, even while hundreds of millions of kilometers from the Sun. But recent scientific papers may be moving the investigations in the right direction. A major shock for scientists on Earth was the detection of abundant molecular oxygen and so-called outgassing from the 67P nucleus. If comets are really leftovers from the solar system's formation, scientists had long excluded any possibility of molecular oxygen being trapped in the so called primordial bodies. As reported in India's national magazine Frontline, "The detection of O₂ was unexpected... all the primordial oxygen molecules, which would have been there in a comet's evolution around 4.6 billion years ago, should have disappeared by now... the Rosetta's discovery of O₂ in 67P/C-G is an astrophysical enigma." In a paper published in the journal Nature Communications, scientists Yao and Giapis essentially proposed that water molecules coming off the comet become electrically charged. Then the solar wind accelerates the charged molecules back to the comet's surface. There they pick up an oxygen atom from the surface from materials such as sand, forming the detected O₂. As investigator Giapis stated, "We had no idea when we built our laboratory setups that they would end up applying to the astrophysics of comets. This original chemistry mechanism is based on the seldom-considered class of Eley-Rideal reactions, which occur when fast-moving molecules, water in this case, collide with surfaces and extract atoms residing there, forming new molecules. All necessary conditions for such reactions exist on comet 67P." However, even with the dirty snowball theory now, in the words of Nicholas Thomas "blown out of the water", scientists continue to assume that comets are primordial icy bodies that formed over four-and-a-half billion years ago. Following this brief summary of comet missions, in our next episode we will explore many landmark comet discoveries all of which seem to affirm the electrical nature and origins of comets.

Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info. In a recent Space News episode, we began the first of a series of reports that challenge the very underpinnings of consensus scientific theory on the nature of stars, including our own Sun. Ever finer technological data continues to provide increasing opportunities to test the respective predictions of the Electric Universe theory versus those of the Institutional Science. As Wal Thornhill explains in the first of this two-part episode, new discoveries all point toward the perhaps inevitable confirmation of the Electric Star theory. Scientists don't understand stars. Not a single feature of the Sun is predictable, based on the standard model of the Sun. We can't see inside the Sun except for a peep through the holes punched in the photosphere we call sunspots and there we don't see energy trying to escape from inside the Sun. It's cooler down there. That's why the sun-spots appear dark. But as usual, a model once adopted as a standard becomes a belief. Stars are believed to be isolated thermonuclear campfires in the sky that eventually burn out. All data must be fitted somehow to the model or discarded as an error. The operative word is "somehow." No alternative model is possible. That is how we, fallible mortals, apply the scientific method. Many who are familiar with the Electric Universe have said to me they can't watch astronomy programs because the blatant misinformation makes them angry. The programs begin with a litany of "facts", most of which are baseless. For example, a popular online lecture in physics enthuses, and I quote, "A star is born when nuclear fusion ignites and produces heat. The star is formed first when matter falls in gravitationally, matter attracts each other, and falls in and heats up to tens of millions of degrees ― then nuclear fusion produces energy and the star is born. Our sun was born about 5 billion years ago." So goes the myth! There is not a single fact in any of this. It ignores the recent evidence of stars being born in molecular clouds along glowing current filaments. It doesn't match the story! The discovery shows dust and gas is efficiently scavenged over many light-years towards the current filament. Unlike weak gravitational collapse which is limited in range and directed radially inwards, towards a center of mass. Any rotation of the cloud inhibits gravitational collapse, giving time for the heat, generated by matter spiraling inwards, to be radiated away. Nuclear fusion in stellar cores, composed somehow of the lightest element hydrogen, is the improbable claimed result. The fusion model of stellar energy was grasped at, more than a century ago, simply because it seemed like the only option for an isolated star producing prodigious energy for unimaginable time spans. Yet, as our project manager and chief engineer of the SAFIRE experiment, which is designed to test an electrical model of stars, pointed out, "The steady shining of countless stars in the night sky requires they be lit by a simple controlled process." The hydrogen bomb model applied to stars is not simple, stable or testable. If it were the answer, a night sky should resemble a fireworks show. Meanwhile, our experimental attempts to force nature to conform to our beliefs have led nowhere in the quest for fusion power ― like the Sun.― Clearly, scientists don't understand stars; their birth, how they shine and their supposed death. Recent reports highlight this obvious fact. Phys.org's reported on September 12 last year and I quote, "Stars form within the dense regions of diffuse molecular clouds, but the physical processes that determine the locations, rate, and efficiency of star formation are poorly understood. Recent thinking envisions an approximate two-step process: first, a network of dense filaments form, due to large scale turbulence, and then fragmentation into cores occurs as gravity starts to dominate. In the dense gas, the structure formation is affected by motions induced primarily by three processes: supersonic turbulence, self-gravity, and magnetic fields." The words "Poorly understood" are code for, "We have no idea." There is no known way that supersonic turbulence and magical magnetic fields can produce the many light-years long, constant-width, glowing filaments and their structured magnetic fields. Astrophysicists are ignorant of Hannes Alfven's prediction, made decades ago, that stars would be formed precisely that way, by powerful scavenging of matter along magnetically pinched galactic current filaments inside molecular clouds. The reason given by one astrophysicist; "We know there's electricity in space but it doesn't do anything." Such is the dysfunction of narrow specialism in science. So a star is not formed when matter falls in gravitationally and matter doesn't fall in and heat up to tens of millions of degrees. The electrical accretion process stratifies elements radially, according to their ionization potential. It produces cool cores of heavy elements, like beads on a string. But nuclear fusion in a cool, heavy element core is impossible. So it makes far more sense that stars are a cosmic electrical phenomenon involving their photospheres. Fusion occurs on the Sun, not in it! All stars produce the heavy elements seen in their spectra by warm plasma fusion and neutron capture in their photo- spheres. In contrast of the brute force approach of particle physicists requiring incredible pressure and millions of degrees. Earlier in May last year, there appeared a groundbreaking paper in the journal Astronomy And Astrophysics, which showed a slingshot effect in a star-birthing filament of the Orion Nebula. These glowing filaments snake about inside the nebula like the radiant filaments in novelty plasma balls. The stars are formed while moving with the filament but as the star gets more massive it is slung out, ready formed and switched on as the glowing filament accelerates away. This may help explain the size limit of stars. Stars are the electromagnetic offspring of electric galaxies. So nearby stars have rotation axes that line up closely with each other because they are all spun up along the same, rotating, electrical umbilical cord, known as a Birkeland Current. Do we have evidence for the alignment of spinning stars born in the same event? Yes we do, and as usual it has mystified researchers. On March 14th this year, John Ross in the Australian national newspaper reported, "Australian astronomers studying stars' internal upheavals have opened a new fault line in theories about the universe's formation. Researchers monitoring 'starquakes' ― the stellar equivalent of earthquakes ― have found a startling symmetry in dozens of swollen stars known as red giants. The findings open a new mystery around the formation of clusters of stars from swirling clouds of molecules and gas. Co-author Dennis Stello said these gas clouds rotated on their own internal axes. Astronomers had assumed the initial spin orientation would become scrambled by the colossal turbulence generated when they coalesced into families of stars." "The results were unexpected," said Dr. Stello. "We found that the spins of most of the stars were aligned with each other. Previously it had been assumed that massive turbulence would have scrambled the rotational energy of the clouds where the stars were born, and prevented this alignment." This statement shows characteristic blindness toward earlier evidence that also doesn't fit the accepted story of star birth. So the published paper doesn't refer to the filamentary star-birth paper, where the answer to the mystery clearly lies. Specialists tend to ignore other specialists, even in their own field, when findings are off the edges of their belief map. Such is the dysfunctional state of modern science.

You've just entered the theater of an alien sky. If the words and images seem strange to you there's a reason for this. Our world was once a vastly different place, to experience this won't hurt you, and there is nothing to fear. The Separation of Heaven and Earth A mythic archetype is a broadly distributed pattern of ancient storytelling and magical re-enactment. In the past century cross-cultural studies have identified hundreds of archetypes, and our own study has added many themes to the list. Of all the named archetypes, one of the most recognizable is the towering God holding aloft the great sphere of Heaven. Greek poets and philosophers named this Heaven bearing giant Atlas but almost all of the early cultures seem to have remembered a similar mythic personality. And how curious that this archetypal quasi-divine power was said to have separated Heaven and Earth, dividing a world above from a world below. What natural phenomenon could have provoked this remarkable theme -- the separation of above and below? Our claim in these Discourses is that extraordinary natural events occurring just prior to the emergence of the great civilizations sparked an outpouring of creative activity and commemorative rites, all encoding a universal human experience. Hundreds of cross-cultural themes or archetypes traced to the beginnings of human history and to the early experience of what we've called the polar configuration. In earlier Discourses, we introduced the role of the world mountain, a visible pillar rising along Earth's rotational axis. In response to this awe-inspiring presence, the early cultures consecrated sacred hills and holy mountains as special symbols of a formerly witnessed cosmic column. And they invested massive labors in monumental construction, all commemorating the celestial home and resting place of an ancestral God. In fact, the theme of the world mountain converges globally with another theme, the cosmic giant bearing aloft the sphere of Heaven. By following this theme back to its first expressions, we uncover the original meaning of the phrase above and below, a radical meaning that is essential to the story of the world mountain or cosmic pillar. Egyptian texts and art depict the Heaven-supporting God Shu as a pillar-like form with upraised arms. The priests declared that these arms created the separation of above and below. We explain this relationship by the role of the illuminated crescent. In visual terms the crescent suggested two extensions of the pillar, and it divided the vast sphere of the primeval unity, Atum, into upper and lower regions. With this connection in mind, we can avoid the fatal mistake in common treatments of the Atlas theme -- the assumption that Atlas bore the Earth on his shoulders. That idea is directly contradicted by the Greek chroniclers themselves, who consistently recognized the celestial nature of the burden Atlas carried. "...And he, no other, holds the tall pillars that keep the sky and Earth apart." - Homer "Atlas through hard constraint upholds the wide Heaven with unwearying head and arms." - Hesiod "Does not even now great Atlas struggle to bear up the weight of Heaven?" - Pindar Many additional citations could be given to make this point, but in these Discourses, we're not just calling for a correction of one popular interpretation. Those who followed earlier episodes will not be surprised by our identification of the upraised arms of the Egyptian Shu as a crescent-form appearing as extensions of a single pillar reaching upward along the polar axis of the Earth. As detailed in previous episodes, the twin arms of Shu trace to the role of a visible crescent upon the giant sphere of Saturn in the ancient sky close to Earth. The language takes its meaning from the early phase of the polar configuration as it emerged from the undifferentiated ambient glow of an earlier time. In this earlier phase, the dusty plasma medium through which the gathered planets moved, diffused and softened our Sun's natural illumination of these bodies. The arrival of this crescent was a widely celebrated event. It meant the beginning of a daily cycle which the mythmakers themselves designated as the coming of the first day and night. Our identification of the polar column with the activity of the planet Mars constitutes a prediction as to the prime player in the so-called separation of Heaven and Earth. Classical authors recognized in the Egyptian Shu their own archetypal warrior; the Greeks named the God either as Heracles, a name they gave to the planet Mars, or as the warrior Aries - the most common name for Mars. The Romans followed suit, naming their own far-famed warrior as Mars and identifying their semi-divine ancestor Hercules as that very planet. When viewed as a mythic image of the crescent and polar column, the explanation leaps out from the historical material. The crescent arms of the Heaven- supporting divinity being the upright crescent form of the configuration, visually extending the mythic function of the pillar itself and most dramatically so in its symmetrical midnight position. That was the most celebrated moment in the ancient day. This archaic day began at sunset when the sky darkened and the planetary configuration continue to grow brighter, reaching its peak brightness at midnight. Thus, it is that from earliest times in ancient Egypt, we see the arms of Shu raising up the primeval sun-God Atum from the darkness of the abyss. So when Atum declares, "I do not fall on account of Shu", it is the pillar and twin arms of Shu that give concrete meaning to the language; the cosmic perch and resting place of the primeval sun-God Atum as noted in our previous episode is the pillar of the sky, its function emphasized by the twin arms of Shu. The two extensions of the cosmic pillar, or in the two peaks of the world mountain, mean precisely the same thing. As presented in Egyptian sources, the creation story focuses on the separation or holding apart of two regions typically mistranslated as Heaven and Earth. Egyptian priests knew Atum as the primeval unity meaning the one -- the all. In the creation events through the activity of Shu, this unity gave way to profound differentiation into a duality. What was then seen from Earth as the extended upright arms of Shu produced the visual appearance of a division -- a formerly unified whole divided into regions above and below. Thus, our explanation of the pillar- God's two most vital functions; as the stable support of Atum and as the ancient power that created the so-called separation of Heaven and Earth. Egypt: The Ka-arms of Shu separated above and below We identify both functions with the visual contribution of the planet Mars to the emergence and evolution of the polar configuration. Specifically, the World Pillar or World Mountain. Egypt: "I am raised aloft on my perch above yonder places of the Abyss." Egypt: "I do not fall on account of Shu." Of course, distance from these events over time allowed the concepts to drift away from things originally seen. And yet many centuries later, we still see the God Shu standing upright as the pillar-God filling the space between the arching form of the Goddess Nut above, and the recumbent form of the male power Geb below. When presented in this way as opposites, the Egyptians named the domain marked out by the crescent above as Pet -- equated with the Goddess Nut in the emerging duality; and the region marked out by the crescent below as Ta -- equated with the God Geb. But in the absence of anything presently observed in the sky, the translators render the upper region of the sphere as Heaven and the lower region as Earth, introducing contradictions that could only confuse these Egyptian concepts. For any reliable interpretation, the reference must be considered in their archetypal original and testable contexts. For us the objective contexts mean concrete forms in the sky and concretely experienced natural events reconstructed from the deepest cross-cultural agreement. In fact, as we intend to show in the episodes to follow, every archetype relating to the so-called separation of Heaven and Earth will fall into place as predictable themes within the context of this reconstruction. As you follow these Discourses, you can assess this testability for yourself as we continue surveying the entire panorama of ancient myths, symbols and sacred practices. The most critical themes are firstly, an original undifferentiated condition or absence of form; and secondly, an emerging geometry of creation with specific regions above and below; and thirdly, a central role of the archetypal warrior hero as the cosmic pillar personified, filling the role of the Demiurge -- a primeval power executing a divine or intelligent plan. Thus, the role of the cosmic Warrior was paramount. The separation of above and below was, in fact, the Warrior-God's first achievement, even before he had earned his title as Warrior-God. 
on the 4th of July the world's TV screens were filled with high-fiving astronomers celebrating the deep impact missions direct hit on comet Tempel 1 it was an extraordinary achievement and fully merited the celebrations a few weeks later though when the cameras had gone the astronomers were left scratching their heads in confusion the Deep Impact team had hoped that when the impact of spacecraft hit temple 1 it would kick up a relatively small cloud of dust expose an area of pristine icy material underneath and release a cloud of dust and ice this is exactly what didn't happen the electric universe model of comets on the other hand successfully predicted the results of the Deep Impact mission years before including the initial flash before an unexpectedly energetic outburst that prevented the mission from achieving its main goal of imaging the crater now we have the Rosetta mission to comet 67p churyumov-gerasimenko and the ESA scientists are once more left scratching their heads in confusion the comet was much rougher and more oddly shaped and anticipated and when the feel a lander bounced off the surface it was admitted by team members that we failed to explain the rebounds and the higher strength material was a surprise to us the firm belief that comets are primordial and the source of the water on earth requires that our eyes are deceiving us as one of the fill a team said it's rocky like but not rock such as the Selective blindness induced by prior beliefs there is an opportunity for the Rosetta mission to fulfill a far greater purpose than merely establish a myth of planet formation because if comet 67p is a rock it is telling us two fundamentally important things first it tells us that our belief that comets formed the planets is wrong and that the reverse is true the planets formed the Comets because rocks and clay also found by the Stardust mission in Comet dust require planetary processes in their formation and second the low density of the comet measured by its gravity tells us that we don't understand gravity or the structure of comets or possibly both the electric universe model has comets born of by electrical discharge which overwhelms gravity by many orders of magnitude and in a simple garage experiment it was found that the discharge melted hematite powder used to mimic the red dust found on Mars and formed spheres like those found in abundance in the Martian soil significantly some spheres were found to be Hollow and some joined in pairs to form a dumbbell shape with a narrow neck so Comet 67p may be hollow to some degree which isn't possible according to the standard model but perhaps of most significance is the implication for basic physics and our understanding of nature and the universe because nowhere will you see it acknowledged by physicists that they don't understand why matter has mass in fact the confusion extends to textbooks and encyclopedias where the words mass and matter are used interchangeably Wikipedia is explicit and I quote mass describes the amount of matter in an object end of quote but one of the key messages from the equation everyone knows but no one understands e equals MC squared is that mass is a property of matter and that therefore it is an energetic variable I should mention that no physicist can define energy in terms of the nature of matter you will read of its classifications conversion from one form to another and it's conservation but it's physical nature in matter is a mystery our fundamental ignorance is complete and exposed in this simple equation so the mass of the comet cannot tell us how much matter it contains if it looks like rocket is safest to assume that it is rock we have had plenty of forewarning after visiting a large number of comets and asteroids and finding it difficult to distinguish between them by their appearances yet we believe asteroids are rocky and comets are not it's become a modern myth this is shocking news we can't therefore say what stars and planets are made from modern cosmology is revealed as another mythology dealt to us by a new age of astronomer priests rosetta is sending scientists a stark message when astrophysicists use mass in their equations they don't know what they're talking about that's why we have the Big Bang black holes dark matter dark energy and weird neutron stars and looking for the origin of particle mass by our hypothetical Higgs boson is futile and a colossal waste of resources both particle physics and cosmology are a theory Laden computer-generated Fantasyland each discipline has led the other on in their wild speculations we have wasted a century on both of them so it remains to be seen if Homo sapiens ignoramus can decode what comet 67p this modern rosetta stone in space has to tell us you 
You've just entered the theater of an alien sky. If the words and images seem strange to you there's a reason for this. Our world was once a vastly different place. To experience this won't hurt you and there is nothing to fear. The mythic archetype of a great ancestral warrior or hero is surely the most popular mythic theme of all time. And yet, thousands of years after the first expressions of the archetype, can anyone rightfully claim to have penetrated the mystery? Even today, despite countless volumes written on the subject, a convincing answer seems entirely out of reach. What human experience could have inspired a worldwide image of a superhero rescuing the world, from chaos monsters? That's just one of the globally repeated mysteries. Why the birth of this great ancestor from the womb of a revered mother goddess? Why the exposure or abandonment of the hero at birth? Or the murder or displacement of his father? Why was the god himself so frequently identified as an unerring arrow, sword, spear or hammer, a weapon that turns out to be a cosmic thunderbolt. Yes! A thunderbolt, but with no similarity to lightning in our sky today. Absolutely nothing makes sense under any familiar references. And yet the themes are so fully connected that one archetypal attribute leads seamlessly to another, then another. There must be an explanation, and yet common beliefs will not permit an explanation. That's the logical contradiction arising from today's accepted stories of human history and planetary history. The problem lies in an unsupported theoretical assumption. The assumption is: As today, so before. Well, that's a trap; It holds our attention on today's uneventful solar system, even as the human record speaks with a thousand voices for a violent and catastrophic planetary history. In popular accounts, the prominent heroes are quasi-divine, big and strong men who rescue humanity from chaos monsters. One astronomical tradition after another names this warrior figure as the planet Mars. The farther back we go the more the divine or celestial character of the hero stands out. Such Egyptian warrior figures as Shu, or Horus, or Amon were originally  celestial figures beyond a shadow of a doubt, but later localized through regional storytelling. The same can be said of the ancient Sumerian and Akkadian counterparts, Damuzi or Tammuz, the Mars gods Ningirsu or Nergal, and even Gilgamesh. Eventually, localized cult practices transformed such figures into legendary ancestors of those recounting the stories. Our answer to the dilemma lies in a testable reconstruction of things never imagined in our time. The reconstruction leads us back to a gathering of planets close to Earth, all the events occurring prior to the present organization of the solar system. Planets have not always moved on their present courses. Our subject is the ancient polar configuration, where the warrior-hero finds a full and complete explanation in the activity of the dark, reddish, innermost sphere. The planet Mars was the centerpiece of the cosmic thunderbolt. The testability of this reconstruction lies in the contribution a visible forms and explicit sequences of events; all testifying to the global substructure of human memory. What will happen to our understanding of human history if it can be seen beyond any reasonable doubt that the warrior-hero archetype requires celestial events having no parallel in natural experience today? What does it mean when the warrior-king on Earth symbolically dons, as his crown, the revered glory of heaven. That even meant the king's conjunction with, and marriage to the archetypal star goddess, identifiable as the planet Venus. Many parallel symbols are equally important. Just one example is the identification of the exploding radiance, the essential quality of the star goddess, as the warrior-king's shield, mythically his gift from the goddess. That identification magically confirms the local king as an incarnation, or avatar of a celestial prototype, the warrior king as mythic protector and owner of the terrifying glory. That's what the word hero literally means. Name any broadly repeated theme attached to the hero archetype, observe it's place in the reconstruction, and you'll find additional themes that are just as explicit. No room for ambiguity or for simply making up explanations. Ask the question. Does any popular explanation actually work? In the context of our reconstruction, the required patterns must show up. Globally. If the events occurred. We'll follow that logic to further conclusions in our next segment. 
You've just entered the theater of an alien sky. If the words and images seem strange to you, there's a reason for this. Our world was once a vastly different place. To experience this won't hurt you, and there is nothing to fear. The Labyrinth and the Gordian Knot In our previous Discourse, we introduced the story of the labyrinth, a story with many links to the wide-ranging archetypes we've previously explored; mother goddess, warrior hero, and chaos monster, all with a displaced sovereign power looming as a shadow in the background. A fascinating counterpart to the labyrinth is a fabled Gordian knot. That tradition was localized in the ancient Phrygian capital of Gordium, in modern-day Turkey. There it was said that a far-famed knot had once yoked a notorious wagon owned by Gordias, the mythic father of King Midas. As the story goes, the complex knot was impossible to untie. But in 333 BC, when the warrior king Alexander the Great led his army into Gordium, he encountered the old Wagon said to be held in place quoting here 'by several knots all so tightly entangled that it was impossible to see how they were fastened.' Hanging over this incident was an ancient oracle declaring that the man who could untie the complex knot was destined to rule all of Asia. But frustrated in his attempts, Alexander announced it makes no difference how they are loosed. He then stood back and sliced the knot in half with a single stroke of his sword. As an echo of this story, the phrase 'cutting the Gordian knot' entered the popular lexicon as a shorthand solution to a complex problem. Historians also cite an alternative version of the story in which Alexander simply removed a linchpin to loosen the knot. Tellingly, in this interpretation the event was said to have been accompanied by thunder and lightning. Having pleased the gods, Alexander went on to conquer Egypt and much of Asia. It should go without saying that in the absence of a concrete referent, such storytelling will appear to have no believable interpretation. But if we tentatively grant the presence of a natural provocation in the ancient sky, the story elements will be expected, even when a self-serving local variant fails to convince us. Fortress of Intestines According to the Babylonians, amongst the oldest storytellers in the world, a great giant named Humbaba was the guardian of a towering edifice called the Fortress of Intestines. Well, the idea that a great fortress would be composed of intestines couldn't be more ridiculous. But only ridiculous, until one grants a concrete visual form in the heavens to prompt the mythical language. In fact, more than one author has proposed the mythical fortress of Humbaba was a prototype of the labyrinth theme. But it seems that other crucial associations are too easily overlooked. A swastika at the center of the labyrinth for example, occurs not just in Cretan, in Attic, and in Roman art, but even in the Americas amongst the Hopi Indians. Well, that's not a small matter. In fact, it's precisely this whirling aspect of the equal length cross that substantiates the electric discharge activity from which the labyrinthal form arose. One scholar who did not overlook the connection of the swastika to the labyrinth was the distinguished authority A. B. Cook, author of the massive three volume scholarly work 'Zeus'. From his extensive study of the labyrinth theme, Cook concluded, "it seemed certain that both Attic and Cretan art presupposed the swastika as the earliest ascertainable form of the labyrinth." Cook's observation is critical though he clearly did not know that the identical linkage appears even in North America. Such connections invariably bring us back to the archetypal substructure of mythological expression. Our own research suggests that the global reach of the labyrinth theme could never be explained without simultaneously illuminating the cross or swastika placed strategically at its center in opposite regions of the world. One theme leads inexorably to another. Labyrinth, intestines, goddess, warrior, and central swastika. As a matter of fact, the swastika is broadly connected to the whirling dance of the archetypal goddess and prototypical warrior hero, when the world slipped into chaos. How this broader archetypal context arose historically is a mystery the experts haven't even begun to explore. It's known that one of the more common dance patterns in ancient times was not just a whirling performance, but more specifically, a dance along a path marked out by a labyrinth. That's why in classical times the word labyrinth often meant dance. A. B. Cook for example relates the labyrinth simultaneously to a symbolic imitation of the Sun's movements and the patterns of imitative spiraling dance. If that conclusion is correct, it's no surprise that archaic labyrinth and dance patterns echoed into more modern times as the Troy dance and similar children's games. Not to be overlooked is the fact that the dance of the hero Theseus was also in conjunction with the goddess Ariadne. And that is why, as noted by Cook, the labyrinth and dance was indeed archetypal. In fact, said to be the first occasion on which men and women danced together. Here, as it is so often the case, we see the tell-tale signature of the celebrated first form to which all imitative or sacred practices in the ancient world direct our attention. Over the years, in exploring ancient Egyptian symbols, we found innumerable counterparts to the global archetypes and the dancing warrior is no exception. One of the key Egyptian images is that of the red Ab-Heart of Ra called the Heart of Carnelian. Egyptian texts identified the Ab-Heart and such warrior heroes as Shu, or Anhur, or Horus. All identified as the planet Mars in our reconstruction. Egyptian symbolism presents this innermost masculine heart as the Ab and Hati, the heart of the warrior within the enclosing feminine turquoise Hati heart meaning the eye, heart, and soul, of the primeval Sun God Ra. In other words, there is no surprise in the hieroglyphic image showing the Ab-Heart as a male figure in a dancing posture virtually identical to that of the Hindu Shiva who similarly stands in conjunction with the Hindu mother goddess. But few, indeed, have noticed that the swastika itself symbolized the whirling, dancing, masculine, reddish part of the ancient Sun God whom the world's first astronomers of ancient Mesopotamia named as the planet Saturn. And until the underlying equations are recognized, such obvious clues as the swastika, the very swastika displayed as the heart of the Greek Apollo, will mean virtually nothing to us. Of course, none of the connected themes has anything to do with the movement of the Sun in today's sky. In fact, the relationship of the swastika to the warrior hero will virtually always go unnoticed by the specialists. And the closer we look, the more extraordinary the confirmed traditions become. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info The current standard cosmological model tells us that roughly 96% of the universe is composed of strange invisible dark stuff. About 73% of the total mass and energy in the universe is said to be composed of so-called dark energy. The concept of dark energy was invented in the 1990's when scientists studying type 1a supernovae discovered that the supernovae appeared to be accelerating faster, the farther away they were from the observer. Today, cosmologists say that the mysterious force of dark energy is responsible for accelerating the expansion of the universe since the hypothetical Big Bang explosion, although the admit they have no understanding of what dark energy is, nor how it really works. But a new scientific study has only made dark energy more mysterious. Scientists that attempt to measure the so called cosmic expansion rate have discovered that the universe again appears to be expanding much too quickly, even taking into account the invention of dark energy's influence. The study leader states in a recent Scientific American article. The bottom line is that the universe looks like it's expanding about 8% faster than you would have expected based on how it looked in its youth and how we expect it to evolve. We have to take this pretty darn seriously. Charles Bennett of Johns Hopkins University also stated; "Basically is there something going on in cosmology that we don't understand, or is there something going on with the data? One of those is a lot more exciting, but I think the other may be more likely. The Scientific American article offers the following analysis; "One of the most exciting possibilities is that dark energy is even stranger than the leading theory suggests". However, as Wal Thornhill explains, the standard cosmology's increasingly strange interpretations become unnecessary in an Electric Universe. It's no surprise that Big Bang theorists are having difficulties with each new discovery about the universe. The most recent problem was highlighted in Nature on April 11th; "The most precise measurement ever made of the current rate of expansion of the universe has produced a value that appears incompatible with measurements of radiation left over from the big bang. If the findings are confirmed by independent techniques, the laws of cosmology might have to be rewritten". The rate of expansion of the universe is supposed to be due to the competing action of dark matter with dark energy. Dark matter's gravity tends to slow cosmic expansion while dark energy pushes out what makes it accelerate. It was thought that dark energy strength has been constant. Now it has been found, the rate of expansion is 8% faster than that predicted based on the cosmic microwave background radiation diagram. But it is not the man-made laws of cosmology that need to be rewritten, it is the entire set of concepts that underpin Big Bang cosmology. It's no use making up laws about things that don't exist, like dark matter and dark energy. It is simply assumed because of the belief in the Big Bang that the cosmic microwave radiation is from the background, rather than the foreground. However, the evidence of asymmetry in that radiation suggests it is locally produced. More to the point, Plasma Cosmology and the Electric Universe requires and simply explains the cosmic radiation as being due to microwave radiation from the filamentary gallactic electric currents flowing in the neighborhood of the Sun. Indeed some of the expected structures, a Galaxy wide sample of dense filamentary structures correlated with spiral arms and star formation, have been recently mapped. See here an example of a network of galactic filaments. Note the roughly orthogonal branching of tributaries which is characteristic of an electrical discharge and then compare it with the experimental discharge filaments shown here. In October 2011 I wrote, "A Nobel Prize for the Dark Side", about the prize in physics being awarded to 3 astrophysicists for the 'accelerating universe'. Dark energy is supposed to make up 73% of the universe. The evidence interpreted in this weird way comes from comparing the redshift distances of galaxies with the brightness of the supernovae type 1a, used as a standard candle. It was found that the supernovae in highly redshifted galaxies are fainter than expected, indicating that they are further away than previously estimated. This in turn implied a startling accelerating expansion of the universe, according to the Big Bang model. It's like throwing a ball into the air and having it accelerate upwards! So, a mysterious dark energy was invented which fills the vacuum and works against gravity. The popular science fiction author Douglas Adams' infinite improbability generator type of argument, was called upon to produce this vacuum energy. The language defining vacuum energy is revealing. "Vacuum energy is an underlying background energy that exists in space even when the space is devoid of matter, that is, free space. The concept of vacuum energy has been deduced from the concept of virtual particles, which is itself derived from the energy-time uncertainty principle". You may notice the absurdity of the concept given that the vacuum contains no matter, background or otherwise. Yet it is supposed to contain energy. This is impossible! Incredibly, energy has no definition in physics. Merely different examples. Douglas Adams was parodying Heisenberg's uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is merely a probabilistic description of what happens at the scale of subatomic particles with no real physical understanding of cause and effect. Heisenberg was uncertain because he didn't know, in a physical sense, what he was talking about. He was being truthful though when he wrote; "We still lack some essential feature in our image of the structure of matter". The concept of virtual particles winking in and out of existence defies the first principle of physics. 'Thou shalt not magically materialize nor dematerialize matter.' Calling matter virtual merely underscores its non-reality. Indeed, the discovery of the acceleration of the expanding universe is an interpretation based on total ignorance of the real nature of stars and the standard candle, the supernova type 1a. A supernova type 1a is supposed to be due to a hypothetical series of incredible events resulting in an exploding white dwarf star. But in an Electric Universe a supernova is simply an electrical explosion of a star that draws its energy from a galactic circuit. The remarkable brilliance of a supernova, which can exceed that of its host galaxy for days or weeks, is explained by kind of power transmission line failure that can also be seen occasionally on Earth. If such a circuit is suddenly opened, the electromagnetic energy stored in the circuit is focused at the point where the circuit is broken, producing catastrophic arcing. Stars too, can suddenly have the current, focused on them, switched off by a plasma instability, causing it to be magnetically pinched off. The result is what's known as an exploding double layer which results in ejection of matter from the body of the star. This turning inside out of a supernova has been observed, to the puzzlement of theorists. The standard candle of the supernova and it's light curve are then simply due to the circuit parameters of galactic transmission lines which power all stars. What of the discovery of fainter and more shortly lived supernovae in high redshift galaxies? The astronomer Halton Arp showed from numerous observations that faint, highly redshifted objects like quasars, are intrinsically faint because of their youth and not their distance. There was no big bang! He proved that quasars are born episodically from the nucleus of active galaxies. Their light is initially faint and highly redshifted as they move rapidly along the spin axis away from their parent. As they mature, they grow brighter and their redshift decreases while they slow down, as the matter within them increases in mass. Finally, the quasars evolve into companion galaxies. The decreasing quasar redshift occurs in discrete steps which points to a process whereby protons and electrons go through a number of small quantized, that is resonant, increases in mass as the electrical polarization within the quasar increases. The charge required comes via an electrical umbilical cord in the form of the observed parent galaxy's axial jet. Based on Arp's discovery and the electrical model of galaxies and stars, both stars and supernovae type 1a are naturally dimmer. And the supernovae more short-lived in high redshift galaxies than in low redshift galaxies because of the lower galactic energy density. The Big Bang laws of cosmology need to be discarded, not re-written. They don't work! All is darkness in the Big Bang universe, with its black holes, dark matter and dark energy. The Electric Universe throws a new light on the subject because its laws of cosmology are simply those of electromagnetism with, for the very first time, definitions of mass and energy in terms of the electrical structure of matter. Of course, I don't expect a Nobel Prize for the sensible explanation, otherwise I could meet the fate of the hapless student who created the Infinite Improbability Generator, in Douglas Adams' wonderful Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. "When just after he was awarded the Galactic Institute's Prize for Extreme Cleverness he got lynched by a rampaging mob of respectable physicists who had finally realized that the one thing they really couldn't stand was a smart-ass".

Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info The following presentation is an adaptation of the Mel Acheson's TPOD 'Tool Time'. The link to the article may be found in the description box of this video. Have you ever seen a carpenter try to cut a 2x4 with a hammer? Probably not. Carpenters usually carry a saw as well as a hammer in their tool boxes, and they know to use the proper tool for the task at hand. If they didn't have a saw they could likely flail away with the hammer and eventually produce a splintered length of wood that more or less fit their need. But it wouldn't be pretty. Astrophysicists have only one tool in their kit -- the hammer of gravitational theory. When called upon to build an explanation for the phenomena of a universe filled with plasma, they can't cut it. They're forced to flail. An oscillation in a plasma discharge that produces a thousand pulses of electromagnetic radiation per second -- a pulsar -- will be splintered into ad-hoc kindling by the hammer of gravity. Several stars' worth of matter must be pounded into a tiny volume and spun around at a thousand r.p.s. Then a hotspot must be tacked on to produce the pulses of radiation. The self-constraining filaments of plasma spiraling out from the poles of active galaxies -- galactic jets -- require even more gravitational hammering. An astronomical quantity of matter must be pounded into such a tiny volume that it loses most of its recognizable properties and becomes a black hole. The black hole then pulls in all the surrounding matter and squeezes it. Next, gravity has to poke tiny holes in the squeezed matter to squirt it back out. Finally, emergency aid for magnetic forces has to be called in to keep the streams of hot gas from evaporating into the empty space around them. The spiraling filaments of a plasma 'rope' can pinch down into a small 'hot spot'. If the current density is high enough, the pinch and the tubular or conical volume around it can glow revealing the filamentary structure in visible light. To explain these planetary nebulae with gravity, a catastrophic imbalance between radiation and gravitational pressures must be generated in the core of a star. The resulting explosion blows off a spherical shell of hot gas. That shell must then be molded into the observed bipolar shapes (the tubes and the cones) by way of asymmetric interactions with previous gaseous emissions and interstellar gas. Sometimes a little help from currentless magnetic fields is thrown in. As far as is known, with the possible exception of bar magnets, an electric current is the only way to produce a magnetic field. But "electric current" is an alias for a plasma. These examples of gravitational flailing illustrate a fundamental incommensurability in viewpoint. A carpenter chooses a saw or a hammer according to whether he's working with wood or with steel. Identifying the material at hand is one of those cognitive activities that's so basic it's taken for granted. It's often unconscious. It surprises us when it's forced into our awareness by being mistaken, when what we assumed was a nail turns out to be a splinter of wood. This vacuum of sensory deprivation tends to suck in material from the nearest source of cognitive substance which is preconceived ideas. To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail. And to a physicist with a theory of gravity, everything looks like mass. When the mass he imputes to the source of the thin stream of photons doesn't nail down the explanation he needs, he imagines more mass, invisible mass, mass compressed into black holes and expanded into dark halos, until his universe is 90% imaginary. A physicist with a theory of plasma is much better off. At least she can perform laboratory experiments on her alternatives to black holes and dark matter. She has more sources of information about her material than the thin stream of photons from the sky. She can test the ideas she imagines with the sparks she can manipulate. She can hammer on the wood; she can saw on the nail; she can see that doesn't work and go back to try the reverse. She can be scientific, can use concepts as tools and can avoid transubstantiating them into pseudo- religious icons. 
You've just entered the theater of an alien sky. If the words and images seem strange to you, there's a reason for this. Our world was once a vastly different place. To experience this won't hurt you, and there is nothing to fear. Archetype & Symbol Is a unified approach possible? In these Discourses, our goal has been to identify the cross-cultural patterns of world mythology and religious symbolism, the Archetypes. With these deepest patterns as a starting point, our goal has been to show how they arose under the influence of extraordinary natural events. Extraordinary events in the ancient sky, events not occurring today can only mean that a fundamental assumption guiding the theoretical sciences is mistaken. You can call this 'the uniformity principle.' Simply put, it declares that the present is the key to the past, as today so before. So astronomers typically draw on computer simulations to represent the dynamic motions of planets and moons in ancient times. All they need to do is run their simulations in reverse. Of course, if the underlined conditions in the solar system have changed, then it should go without saying that the present could not be the key to the past, in which case computer simulations of ancient conditions are simply instruments of self-deception. Based on systematic research over more than 40 years, we've challenged every idea derived from modern assumptions. It was explicit ancient evidence that led us to describe a gathering of planets close to Earth in ancient times. Our line of reasoning began with a prehistoric mother goddess, then led us upward to the first mythical images inspired by a planetary gathering we've called the  polar configuration. From that starting point, we could follow the configuration's dynamic evolution over time, observing its direct impact on commemorative practices and ancient storytelling on every habitable continent. By immersing ourselves in the ancient evidence, we exposed the substructure of myth-making globally, when unstable planets extremely close to Earth were seen as divine rulers of the sky. The ancient sky worshipers are in fact the most compelling witnesses to events that inspired every mythic archetype we've now documented, a unified and testable  reconstruction. From this radical vantage point, we've asked entirely new questions. Why did every culture on Earth celebrate the towering god at the center and summit of the sky, a power said to have presided over a lost Golden Age? What are the first creation stories telling us? What's meant by the repeated insistence that the creator himself brought forth a shining home of the gods in primeval times? Or the seemingly ludicrous location of that dwelling at the celestial Pole? Or the god's subsequent fall from his primordial position? In these stories we also meet a larger caste of ancestral gods and goddesses, a divine mother, a central star of light and life magically radiating her divine essence to the theater of the gods, or the subsequent attack of a chaos monster or Medusa figure seeking to destroy the created world, or the paradoxical identity of this very monster as the terrible aspect of the original love goddess, or a warrior hero magically born to rescue the world from unpredictable chaos powers, or a cosmic mountain rising from the abyss to support the divine habitation above, or the Great Wheel turning in the sky, the most revered symbol of the sovereign god, the goddess and the Warrior in their primeval conjunction. Though the stories have come down to us in diverse forms, the transformative realization is the discovery that different words and different mythic interpretations point to the same archetypal substructure of world mythology and symbolism. In the end, we've learned, it's this underlying unity that opens the door to a mind-altering shift in perception, the realization that our cosmic environment has radically changed. What has come down to us as elusive fragments can then be seen as echoes of an alien sky, still haunting us from the past. The surprising truth today is that a massive library of known archetypes can now be named, though not a single archetype has ever been explained in conventional terms, not a single one. Yes, we've all seen various claims to have explained one archetype or another, but then, when we investigate, we discover that no proposed explanation has actually met the acid test. No one has identified a natural condition under which the archetype would be explicitly expected. In contrast to this state of things, we've named many dozens of widely distributed archetypes, all inseparately connected to each other and all suggesting a concrete but extraordinary cause in natural experience, which means that the events from which the ancient myths arose are not occurring today. In this new paradigm, no archetype lies outside a plausible explanation and every archetype leads to a larger, inseparably connected, complex of themes. The universal myth of an original paradise or golden age leads invariably to memories of a founding  King, the first in the line of Kings presiding over the golden age, but then we meet the outrageous identity of that luminary as an ancient Sun god seen in the sky before the present Sun and then, even more outrageous is the explicit identity of that primeval sun as the now remote planet Saturn. And still more outrageous is the location of the improbable power at the celestial Pole, a location never visited by any planet in our sky today. Hence the logical question, how could a concrete, highly coherent, set of ideas arise to find direct and obvious observation at every turn? Of course, the reasonable answer is that the coherence is due to a human experience as yet unrecognized, not imagination, conjuring worlds never experienced. In all of this, we see that it's the traditions closest to the original human experience that leads us to the most extraordinary story elements. Here we confront the descent of the world into chaos and darkness, the attack of a fiery serpent or dragon, the heaven-altering wars of the gods, and most significantly, the Earth-shaking power of the cosmic thunderbolt--weapon simply out of this world with no similarity to lightning in today's sky but perfectly matching the complex morphology of high-energy electric discharge in the plasma laboratory. Suddenly, a revolutionary scientific interpretation enters the picture, shifting the attention to new fields of evidence--all confirming the same underlying story,  and of course the end of the story is just as  extraordinary as the rest, the renewal of celestial order within a radically transformed world. But just consider the big picture implications. From beginning to end, the ancient narrative affirms that today's sky bears no connection to the primeval sky under which the myth-making phase of  human history arose. And what distinguishes that environment, above all else, is the pervasive impact of an extraordinary planetary system, highly electrified, as we shall next demonstrate, and provoking all of humanity to entirely new forms of cultural expression. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info Our planet's atmosphere is home to extraordinary electrical activity. It's been known for decades that electric currents from the Sun induce our planet's aurorae, a radical hypothesis originally proposed over a century ago by Kristian Birkeland, which ultimately proved correct. And the profound influence of these electric currents, called Birkeland currents,  has become increasingly undeniable to mainstream science. However, the Electric Universe has always proposed that Birkeland currents from the Sun have a far greater effect on our planet's atmosphere, including its jet stream and wind patterns, than the scientific mainstream has ever considered. As we've noted, retired professor of electrical engineering Dr. Donald Scott developed a mathematical model of the structure of a Birkeland current, which can be identified visually as counterrotating cylinders. We have suggested that the counterrotation clearly seen at the poles of Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and in the earthly aurorae are the consistent indicators of the Birkeland current's influence. Today, Dr. Scott invites the Electric Universe community to explore the ways one might actually be able to track the presence of Birkeland currents in Earth's atmosphere. It's been long suggested, as many of the folks who looked at Space News are aware, that back in the early part of the 1900’s Kristian Birkeland suggested that electric current coming from the Sun down into the poles of the Earth was the cause of the Earth's Auroras. And he got a lot of flak from the astronomical community for saying that. But after World War II when we sent rockets up into the upper atmosphere, we found that exactly that was occurring and so we now know that he was correct in saying what he said. Well anyway, in 2015 I presented a, what I call a Bessel function model of the form and structure of what those Birkeland currents might look like. In other words, were they like a stream of water from a garden hose or what was it? Well, actually the structure of the Birkeland current is quite complicated, quite complex, but generally, one of the most obvious properties of it is, it contains concentric counter-rotating regions. And so if you think of a pipe within a pipe within a pipe and all these pipes are going in the opposite direction from the ones just inward or outside them, you get a general idea and if something like that, with that property, hits the atmosphere then generally if it causes the aurora, which we now know it does, the aurora should have some sort of a counterrotating property to it. Not necessarily visible all the time, but you should be able to see, oh look, there's counterrotation. That's right, that is the way that those things are formed. And of course, there's, we've also seen supporting evidence for that by some of the NASA videos of the North Pole of Saturn, the North Pole of Jupiter, and there is accumulating evidence that this is indeed what is happening. Well, the reason I'm kind of interested in talking to you this morning is that there is a website which, I think, is an excellent website. If you go on there, you'll see this round circle, which is of course the Earth. So if you look down in the lower left-hand corner of that screen, you'll see the word Earth. Just click on that, it'll bring up a menu of things, the first thing on the top is the Date and what I've selected is the wind at 10 hectopascals. A hectopascal is a fancy name for millibar, so 10 millibars is very, very low pressure. So if you look down in that menu, you will see Scale and Source ― sources like US National Weather Service, Control, you see, Mode... Now when it comes to Mode, make sure you click on Air. Air should be in a gold color. You can look at the ocean, you can look at chemistry, particles in space, but air is what you want to look at. And the Height, next line down. Way over on the right, you have the opportunity to click on 10 hPa, 10 millibars, which is way up, it's around, estimates vary, but I would say it's somewhere between 30 and 50 kilometers up, so it's really really outer edges of the atmosphere. And the overlay that you want is Wind and the projection that you want is O. If you do that and then you want to get rid of that menu, you just click on Earth, on the word Earth again, and it'll go down. If you click on the globe, you'll see, when you push on the globe, on a point on the globe, you will see a little green circle and wherever you click, you can move that it looks like you move the world up, you will see that it rotates the globe and you can get a look at the southern hemisphere. And if you look at that southern hemisphere, that's my ta-ta come-to-Jesus moment, that is obviously counterrotation of those wind flows, here is a tremendously strong clockwise circulation of wind (around the), centered on the continent of Antarctica. And then as you go a little bit farther north, there's another sort of a vacant spot which is the center of a very tiny, very weak vestigial counterclockwise flow, the flow around the South Pole is clockwise, we would normally call that a west to east flow. And then as you go still farther north, still south of the equator, you see a very, very strong, east to west, you can see the equator that runs right through Ecuador and across the Pacific there. So there is no doubt that in the upper atmosphere of Earth, there is counterrotation of the air in our upper atmosphere. So anyway, if we go down deeper into the atmosphere, all of a sudden the wind flow becomes distorted and it's this sort of a sinusoidal, sinuous kind of a flow. It's not a circular flow anymore, you can see that's a chaos; wind flow is circular, sinuous, all sorts of stuff. And you say well, why is that? Well, I submit that's because the wind distribution, where the wind flows, are being disturbed by all sorts of things, the farther down you get, the closer to the surface you get, the more important land masses and storms, regions of high and low humidity, high and low pressure, all sorts of variants occur to disrupt that beautiful circular pattern. So let's, in effect if you go all the way down to the surface, that's SFC, the one just to the left of a thousand, and go back and look at the Earth, you see that this yeah, that's kind of what it looks like, there's a storm, sort of off that peninsula that sticks out of Antarctica. It's a very interesting and, I think, very educational kind of website. But anyway, back to my main point and that is looking at the wind at ten millibars, way, way up there in the upper atmosphere, you can then go to the North Pole, whoa! The North Pole is very different. You look there and you realize that there are two circular flows, one centered pretty much on the north end of Greenland, it's not a circular, it's a more of an elliptic or hotdog shaped center to that, that circular pattern. And then over there centered right about on the Bering Sea between the Aleutian Islands and the Kamchatka peninsula, there's another one another center, if you will, that's, that secondary one is weaker, you can see that the red colors, the purple, shows the strength of the flow. There's a, in vector calculus there is an operator called the curl operator. If you look at your right hand and curl your fingers and then like make-believe you're picking up a screwdriver with your fingers curled around the handle and your thumb pointed down the blade of the screwdriver. If you set your hand on that North Pole region with your fingers going in the direction of the purple flow, you can see your thumb is pointing up, outward, and if that Birkeland current is doing that, that says the current there is flowing out of the Earth, and then you look at the other one just to the left, the one that's over the Bering Sea, you have to push your, put your thumb in a downward direction to have your fingers go in the direction of that flow. So that says there's a current going in, a less strong one, it's a sort of a vestigial current but it's very strange that there’s two - well one Birkeland current that's split, one going in one direction and one going in the other direction, and again if you go back and rotate the globe and look down at the South Pole, then there is that major one, not quite as strong as the one at the North Pole but the one circulating around Antarctica in a clockwise direction, that would say that the current is going in, and that little vestigial one, that looks like a current would be coming out of the globe because the circulation is counterclockwise. I submit that these patterns are indicative and I should say, additional substantially supportive evidence that my idea of what the Birkeland current structure looks like, is indeed happening here on Earth, and the last Space News we did was about this magnetic pole wandering around. Yes well, these Birkeland currents can also wander around, I don't mean that one's going to wander up into the equatorial regions or anything like that, but you can see from day to day that the size of these, the strength of these flows vary and the location of their centers of these circular flows vary and just as an electric arc would, from a welding machine, it'll be at least if a welder knows what he's doing, it'll wander all over the piece. So I leave you with that thought and I think, I submit that this is more additional evidence that the Electric Universe has opened the door, I think to finding the answer to this big question as how does the Sun affect weather on the Earth and the answer is, via the Birkeland current. 
[Music] As many of you viewers of these Thunderbolt videos are aware, in 2015 I was able to complete the derivation of a mathematical/physical model of a so-called force-free current, also sometimes called a field-aligned current. What motivated this project was my earlier interest in determining the exact shape of those electric plasma currents that flow from the Sun, the awesome distance of some 93 million miles to supply power, to light up Earth's auroras. Christian Birkeland predicted the existence of these flows way back in 1908. Only when satellites detected the magnetic signatures of electric currents in the auroras in 1973, was Birkeland's hypothesis irrefutably validated, though for another couple of decades, many astronomers resisted the implications of his discovery and some still do. They don't like the idea of electricity up there. The flows he discovered are now called Birkeland Currents in his honor. My  model is described by a set of five equations that can be used to produce three-dimensional images of both the internal, and the external, appearance and the workings of a typical Birkeland Current. It's based on answering a very simple question, “If we have a moving plasma cloud consisting of positive and negative ions, protons, electrons, and other particles such as neutral atoms in otherwise completely empty space, and we leave it absolutely alone - we don't touch it, what shape, what structure, if any, will this stream attempt to take on? What forces will these moving charges impose on each other, and how will they respond? What will the result be?” The derivation is a fairly complex one that involves some fancy vector calculus, but the structural shape that results is elegantly simple, and testable. It turns out that the flow is essentially a cylindrical tube that contains plasma moving in co-axial, spiral, that is helical paths. As we get farther away from the central axis of the flow, the pitch angles of those spiral pathways gradually increase. This produces an intertwined internal structure that has several self-maintaining properties. Nothing leaks out of the resulting flow, for one. And this immediately explains why BC’s can maintain their integrity over distances of millions of miles, and now we think perhaps even millions of light  years. One of the unique properties of any Birkeland Current can be seen by viewing a cross-section of the structure of the model. This clearly shows counter-rotation. There are clockwise flows at certain radial distances out from the center axis, and counterclockwise rotation at other distances. We have known for many years that Birkeland Currents power the auroral displays we see in the night sky, but were counter-rotating plasmas observed? It was quickly discovered that, yes counter- rotation is often seen in Earth's auroras. And it's also seen in NASA videos of the poles of several of the planets, especially Saturn and Jupiter. This is evidence that what we're saying is correct, that counter-rotation does exist in these Birkeland Currents. It seems that the coaxial counter-rotation property is a unique property of Birkeland Currents. No other natural process that we are aware of produces it. So, in my mind the race was on to find more examples. If you see coaxial counter-rotation anywhere, keep your eyes open for the Birkeland Current that causes it. Birkeland Currents can carry electrical charges in both directions, much like a coaxial cable carries normal electrical currents, here on Earth. When we  power up a light bulb, it takes two wires, one to carry charge from the voltage source to the light, and another wire to carry those charges back to the ground terminal of the source, to complete the circuit as it's called. When charges are delivered to Earth by a Birkeland Current, they work their way down to the surface from the top of the atmosphere. Quite often that journey results in the beautiful auroral lights. But sometimes also they create other visible discharges in the Earth's high altitude plasma, such as the so-called elves, sprites, and gnomes seen  by the pilots of high-flying aircraft. Thinking about the now accepted fact that Birkeland Currents power the auroras and recognizing that those auroras  often exhibit coaxial counter-rotation, I wondered if the wind patterns high above Earth's poles also behaved in a similar way. There's an internet website called earth.nullschool.net that shows wind and water patterns in Earth's oceans and atmosphere. If you go to that site, you can click on the  word “Earth” to bring up the menu and select “HD” - high def, and then pick “Mode” equals “Air”, “Animate” equals “Wind”, “Height” equals “10” hPa (hectopascals). This  is at an altitude of approximately 35 kilometers; that's the highest level that the earth.null school gives us. Set “Overlay” to “Wind” and “Projection” to “O” and in the image click and drag the Earth's Northern hemisphere down to show the North Pole. Then go over to the control line of the menu and change the date, I think it's the second symbol, to Year 2022, Month of January – 01, and date – 08. If you click on any wind flow, you will see its direction and velocity in the  upper left. To close the menu click on the word “Earth” and you can see the whole Earth. Hannes Alfven said that moving plasma, when it contacts neutral gas, can drag the gas along with it. With that in mind and using the right-hand rule, point your right thumb in the direction of the axial current, and then your curved fingers will show the direction of the magnetic field and the moving plasma. Doing this, we see that the Birkeland Current's central axial current is moving positive charges up and out of the North Pole. If you turn the Earth over by dragging the Pole with your mouse, you can see a similar, but much weaker current emerging from the South Polar region. The  Earth in its orbit is closest to the Sun in January. At that time its North Pole is pointing away from the Sun. The Electric Universe model presumes the Sun is charged to a higher voltage than its surroundings and therefore, there will be an electric field radiating outward from it. With those facts in mind, we expected that in January, there might be a strong inward current from the higher voltage neighbor- hood of the Sun entering the Earth's South Pole, and outward at the North Pole flowing away from the Sun. Similarly, it was thought that in June there might be a slightly weaker current going into the North Pole and out the South Pole. Weaker because we're farther away from the Sun. Nothing even remotely akin to that was observed; that was  not seen at all. Well what was observed: monthly examinations were made by sampling the earth.nullschool.net website video images over a five-year time span, June of 2014 through June of 2019, and the important observed results were actually two. The first was during the northern hemisphere summer; that's called aphelion. Earth is as far from the Sun as it gets. Current enters  into both the North and South poles. Th The second thing that we observed was that during the Northern hemisphere winter, that's called perihelion, Earth is closest to the Sun, current is directed out of both the North and South poles. What should we make  of this? How do we interpret it? What's going on? From December through February, the Northern hemisphere winter, perihelion, Earth is nearest the Sun and according to Electric Universe theory, it should be picking up positive charge in this higher voltage region. But we see from our observations that the Birkeland Current is directed out of both hemispheres during this time. Earth  is therefore losing positive charge via the Birkeland Current during this period. Just the opposite of what we might think. Six months later, a similar surprise  awaited us. Earth in its elliptical orbit is farthest from the Sun then, at its aphelion,  around the 4th of July and thus at its greatest orbital distance. The Sun's  electric field is producing a lower voltage neighborhood there. Therefore Earth ought to be dumping positive charge out into that lower voltage neighborhood. But if we look at the nullschool.net site, it's clear that the Birkeland Current is dumping positive charge into Earth. Now, this unexpected behavior of the Sun- Earth BC was observed at every single one of the observed aphelion-perihelion times during the five years we observed the site. What could the explanation be for what we  observed? After considering this apparent contradiction we came, after much thought, to the following conclusion. There is no contradiction. There are two different processes going on. One, Earth when it's closest to the Sun in January, is indeed collecting charge, just as the EU theory says it should. And it does this from all possible directions through the extremely large surface area of Earth's toroidal, that is to say doughnut-shaped plasmasphere that completely surrounds the Earth. The charges come from positive-charged interplanetary plasma through which the Earth is moving. And two, but during this same time we've observed that the Birkeland Current stream that directly connects the Sun to Earth's poles, is removing positive charges from Earth. The Birkeland Current is acting like a pipeline that carries charge directly out of two comparatively small cusps in Earth's magnetosphere near its poles, back towards the outer coronal region of the Sun. So, both these processes are going on simultaneously. Therefore, this newly discovered Birkeland Current mechanism apparently works to stabilize Earth's net charge over the course of the year. It's a natural compensating negative feedback mechanism which tends to neutralize, or at least minimize, any seasonal variation in Earth's net charge. The Birkeland Current supplies positive charge when Earth is losing it from its surrounding plasma, because it's passing through the low voltage region, and then the Birkeland Current removes the excess charge Earth is taking on while it's passing through the Sun's high voltage region and is collecting charge. This  counter-flow of charge, provided by the Birkeland Current that directly connects the Sun to Earth, effectively counteracts any fluctuation in Earth's charge that might otherwise perturb its orbital stability. The Birkeland Current also provides a return path for all of the electric charge delivered here by Coronal Mass Ejections and the solar wind. It doesn't pile up on Earth. Where does  it go? It goes back to the Birkeland Current. There are many instances of such automatic negative stabilizing feedback mechanisms in astrophysics. An  obvious one is the ability of a Birkeland Current to self-repair itself from any damage done by a perturbation in one or more of its current density components.  Anyway, there are a variety of things that one can see by manipulating the menu choices of this excellent website. One of the most informative is to get an image on a date when the 10 hectopascal flow is quite regular, circular or at least smooth. We can suggest one out of the bunch might be December 17 2014. That's  2014-12-17. Then select a series of lower altitudes. Higher hectopascal pressure levels mean you're going down, and the pressure in the atmosphere is getting larger. So, go down to 70, 250 and go all the way down to the surface. Anyway, notice that the farther down, the closer to the surface we get, the more chaotic, less smooth and regular, and slower, the patterns become. It makes sense because if you place the mouse pointer over a wider, closely spaced faster wind flow, you can  left- click and measure its velocity. Generally the higher our altitude, the  faster and more regular the wind flows are. This demonstrates that the Birkeland Current which is quite well-formed as it comes through space, drives the flow at its highest 10 hectopascal level, way up at the top. This flow frictionally drives the air at the next lower level and so on. The lowest levels experience frictional contact with the geographical surface features and this breaks up the smooth, almost circular global flows, and reduces their velocities compared to what we see at the higher levels. What this makes clear is that Earth's polar wind patterns are driven from outside electrically, and not by any surface or internal Earth-bound processes or dynamos - the favorite word of astronomers when they don't know what's going on. The  main outside source of these polar winds is quite obviously the varying strength and polarity, that is to say direction, of the Birkeland Current system of electrically charged particles that it delivers here both to and from the Sun. In other words, we now have undeniable scientific evidence of cause and effect. Solar Birkeland Currents cause patterns in the polar winds which affect the weather on the planet. Yet another verification of the  Electric Universe model of cosmology. [Music] 
[Music] An open question in biology is, how do the shapes of creatures come about? How does, for example, a certain frog species obtain its particular shape and not some other? How do its legs and toes and claws always get their particular shape and not some other? The same question for all the internal bits: the spine, the liver, the brain. How do each of these always come to the same shape and interconnect in the same way, particular for this species and no other. Most  textbooks still repeat the 70-year old idea that the DNA alone, somehow determines everything, though there is surprisingly little evidence for this. I would like to highlight some of the evidence for the role of electricity in how plant and animal shapes come to be, and also say a few words about the role of electric fields in how inorganic objects obtain their shapes. I was motivated to give this talk after reading about the work of the Michael Levin lab at Tufts University in Boston. For more than a decade, the lab of Dr. Levin has been overturning some long-held beliefs about how biological shapes arise. Back in the late 1950’s, when DNA was being discovered and its role was starting to be understood, Watson and Crick championed the idea that the DNA determines everything about the  organism. They called this the ‘Central Dogma’ of biology. For the past 70 years, most textbooks and funding have unquestioningly followed this Dogma. It is a form of predeterminism all over again, since it assumes that the information flows only one way from the DNA out and nothing an organism could do would ever change that. Crick was very vocal that finally, he a mere man, had once and for all eliminated the need for a god, or any intelligence in the universe, since  everything about us flows from our DNA. Bombastic cheekiness aside, we can  still run experiments to test the idea. Over the past 70 years, many  thousands of experiments have been run to elucidate the role of DNA  in developmental biology. But try as we might, we could never show that genes actually create any forms. What exactly in the DNA determines that an arm be shaped just so, and not otherwise? How is the inside of the mouth formed just right, to meld with the nose above and the throat below? Search the literature and you will find that the best we can do is to show that disabling certain sections of DNA, will cause some body part to form incorrectly. But this does not mean that the DNA is causing the form of that body part. I was always  surprised at such sloppy thinking. That would be like me showing that I can prevent you from driving to the store if I give you a flat tire. Correct, you cannot drive to the store if you have a flat tire, but the tire was never the  cause of you going to the store. Just because mucking with some DNA causes an arm to form incorrectly, does not mean that the genes cause the shape of  the arm. Using a cooking metaphor, which is surprisingly accurate, ingredients  do not by themselves cause anything. You need a recipe that tells you what to do with the ingredients. And what is the meal? How many people are you cooking for? What is the order of the evening? All that makes a real difference. Our  genes do not necessarily tell our bodies what to make, or when to make it. These decisions are made mostly outside the genes. Everyone should know that we do not really understand DNA. Every decade, the advanced text- books need to be rewritten because we find out that the system is way more complicated than we previously thought. What we call genes are really a very small part of the total  DNA. Genes are that small part of the code that contain the blueprint for building  proteins. We still do not know what most of the DNA does. The collection  of all the genes in your DNA is much like a giant ingredient list. If you had a cookbook of all the recipes you could ever make and you made an index of all the ingredients needed for all those recipes, that is what the genes are. All the blueprints for how to make each of the ingredients you might ever need. But again, genes constitute only a very small part of the DNA. The work in Dr. Levin 's lab is impressive by any measure. These are virtuoso level skills. They alter the DNA of individual cells to change the number of ion pumps the cell makes for itself. This makes these particular cells more or less electrically polarized relative to what  they would have been in the wild-type. At certain times in the development of the embryo, if enough cells in one place can be tricked into creating just the right electrical alterations, then body parts will grow in that location. An eye will grow inside of a stomach, a toe might grow on an elbow. The 70-year old Central Dogma of biology states that DNA, isolated inside the nucleus, causes all shapes and forms to appear. What does Levin's result show? That an electric field external to the nucleus,  caused the shapes and forms to appear when and where they did. It does not  mean that the fields create the form itself, but it does mean that the field can cause the shape to appear. What does this mean for the Central Dogma? Things get really tricky, because Dr. Levin, in altering the genes in the cells, which cause more ion channels to form on the cell wall, which causes a different electrical potential of the cell relative to its surroundings. So you could argue that the DNA is controlling everything. But the  argument has become muddied. Why does the entire eye form in  the electrified location and not just pieces of an eye? And how is it that we instinctually know that the eye should not be in the stomach? In Levin 's cancer research, they show that changing wild-type electrical fields can start and stop cancer cell growth. Highly malleable cells, such as stem cells and cancer cells, have less-defined electrical potentials relative to their surroundings. Whereas healthy, mature cells have higher electrical potentials. One of  the hallmarks of cancer cells is that they have lost their relationship with the larger body. They are an out-of-control growth of cells that are part of nothing. They have no function beyond their self-interests. Here Levin 's results come very close to actually disproving Crick's Central Dogma with regard to the form and function, since electric fields, external to the nucleus, can destroy all form and function. On a more personal note, the Levin lab results are terrifying to me, because here we are again, bumbling into areas we do not understand with tools too powerful for us to wield with wisdom. Has this new technology allowed us to add beauty to the world? Not so far. To date we are only making grotesque monsters with legs growing out of their heads. The poor creatures live, somehow and it turns my stomach to imagine that. I'm afraid we are right back where we were with the DNA story. We knew that mucking with the DNA will cause monsters. And now we know that mucking with the electric fields will cause monsters. It  does not prove the DNA is causing the proper shape, nor does it necessarily prove that the electrical field is causing the proper shape. Dr. Levin 's lab is justifying all this with the promise of new medical treatments, if we can just make it through a few more decades of producing monsters. I  am also surprised that Dr. Levin does not seem to reference Dr. Robert Becker, who already showed most of these principles 40 years ago. You can see a good summary of Becker's work in his book, The Body Electric. Dr. Becker, a  practicing physician, discovered that controlling electric fields could heal burn victims and could let salamander tails grow back properly. Why not give credit where credit  is due? I fear it is because it became known that Robert Becker had a spiritual side. He  maintained that humans were more than just sacks of chemicals. I fear that since Dr. Becker did not believe in pure materialist reductionism, many journals will not allow reference to his work. Let us look at two more sets of experiments from Dr. Levin 's lab. Then we can step back and ask, why does it all matter? These experiments involve planarian flat worms. In the wild, if the tail of the worm gets chopped off, then a new tail will  grow. If the head of the worm gets chopped off, a new head will grow, brain and all. Pretty amazing. The wild-type worm has an electrical gradient along its body, more positive towards the head. The researchers cut off the tail. Then artificially gave that end a positive charge. This caused a new head to grow off the back end. We now have a new shape: a two-headed worm. This new two-headed worm then propagates. It reproduces asexually, as all planarians do. Is this a new species? I think so. Yet the DNA has not changed. You can see that the connection between the DNA of the animal and the shape of the animal is becoming less clear. How could the DNA remember that this new worm species has two heads? So, all future  progeny must also have two heads. Returning to the cooking metaphor. It looks like the genes are available to get the raw ingredients produced, but the recipe and the plans for the full meal are being handled at quite another level, quite outside the world of genes. In a different experiment, they went  to the wild-type, cut off its head, then while the new head was forming, they modified the electrical potential of some cells and ended up producing the head and brain types of another species of planaria. Let that sink in. The DNA  is still that of the original species, but the form, the shape, of the new worm head, is that of a related species of worm. We have created a new species, but we have not altered the DNA. In my opinion, any notion of DNA determining the shapes of creatures is on pretty shaky ground. Why  does any of this matter? It matters because the story of DNA that we grew up with and still teach to our children, is not only wrong. It is actually harmful to our spirit because it gives us a false understanding of ourselves and of our relationship to the universe. We were told that a simple molecule with sequences of four molecular letters determines everything about us. We were assured that not only our shape, but our entire being is supposedly a simple unfolding of some molecular computer program into which we have no input. I find all  aspects of this dogma incorrect and harmful. As a scientist, I am trying to reconstruct a cosmology that is more accurate and more meaningful. In the second half we will look at the question of whether matter is even capable of organizing itself. And if not, then where could all these shapes be coming from? [Music] 
my title is visual intuition and the ancient sky by subtitle complexity theory and plasma cosmology I'm going to beg the graces of those who know more about complexity theory and cellular automata than I do and they will help us through this the most difficult part of my presentation this is the defining image the squatter man will you've seen it before we'll see him again these are more familiar images to you already the squatter man in petroglyphs this is Kai anta a defining image that will come up later all around the world and more in Arizona so you see how global and this is hard to see but it's in our the state we're in if anyone knows who drew this I'd be deeply appreciative I came across it through parot images on Google which led me to ancient destructions calm we see here marvelously we see here Stone Age man and woman gazing at squatter man configuration in the sky after having made a petroglyph about it likewise what is above it in the polar configuration after having made another petroglyph of it so I'm going to tantalize you with something very strange this will be the subject of my exposition of the walk of work of stephen wolfram author of a new kind of science 2000 and it's very strange isn't it I will go over it later but I just want you to look at this image particularly at this just hold that image my thesis complexity theory is a powerful natural a light of plasma cosmology both tell us that in reconstructing the sequence of events in the ancient sky we have to imagine watching images unfold in a sequence a story the events and images are often too complex to be predictable both tell us that visual intuition will be an indispensible guide and even in many cases a form of proof will see if I make this thesis clear to you or not Galileo looking rather feisty don't you think now now laches soon gave us the popular version of Galileo's famous statement the book of nature is written in mathematics since that simplification which we are more familiar with than the original is not really the whole of what Galileo was said in one splendid long sentence of Italian prose I'll read you a translation of that sentence nature does not appear in it but philosophy and the universe do philosophy is written in that great book which ever is before our eyes I mean the universe but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols in which it is written the book is written in mathematical language and the symbols are triangles circles and other geometrical figures without whose help it is impossible to comprehend a single word of it without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth 16:23 sagittal array the essayer no my theme will be partly the mathematics bashing which we've already seen however I want to come back to Galileo in the end and show him to be a good guy - all right but for the moment let us note that for him mathematics meant a geometry indeed classical Euclidean geometry and he is certainly emphatic without knowing that geometry you can't read a single word in the book of nature that does seem to be excessive still we'll come back to him as a good guy now here is Stephen Wolfram and here is the first statement about how mathematics can be superseded complemented augmented replaced various possibilities by other procedures which require more visual intuition this and many subsequent quotes are taken from an excellent thing online quick takes on some ideas and discoveries in a new kind of science written by Wolfram his book on 846 pages with 300 pages of fine print footnotes is perhaps complex but he knows the relation of simplicity to complexity and on his various website pages he'll give you the whole book in one single page summary and he'll give you quick takes here's a quick take he will make the very quick take and then explain it mathematical equations do not capture many of nature's most essential mechanisms for more than three centuries we're talking Galileo - now mathematical equations and methods such as calculus have been taken as the foundation for the exact sciences there have been many profound successes but a great many important and obvious phenomena in nature remain unexplained especially ones where more complex forms or behavior are observed now two other familiar faces more familiar than Wolfram's perhaps uh Talbot and Thornhill weighing in on mathematics astrophysicists are not trained in electrodynamics or plasma discharge phenomena such things would render their gravitational models obsolete they continue to rely on gas and magnetized fluid physics that is mathematically well-mannered uncritical application of mathematical models will lead to whimsical and unstable descriptions of nature so Wolfram's exposition of his use of cellular automata and his claim that through them we can also study similar phenomena in nature is what I will now explore in the most technical part of my presentation so here is a cellular automaton and here is the progression of it and I'm going to explain both images carefully but first the quote cellular automata are examples of simple programs that work by having the color of each cell in successive rows be determined by the same simple rule so let's see the example here is the second cell in a checkerboard like this in which the top line is as it were the initial state and each line lower down is a subsequent state of evolution of the cellular automaton the evolution is contingent on the rules for each of these eight boxes let's look at this one if the cell the central cell is white and flanked by both White's left and right then in the next stage it will be white if white but flanked by white on the left and black on the right again black and so forth with each of these evolutions now Wolfram took 255 cellular automata of this kind all of them have rules exactly as simple as each other and they lead to very different kinds of developments as you go from stage to stage from horizontal level to horizontal level down the checkerboard with the rules above a simple pattern is produced here is the simple pattern evolving by these rules based on chapter 2 the crucial experiment and a new kind of science these images of cellular automata illustrates some of the core discoveries of nks and I add the two images above or rule 90 in Wolfram set of 255 rules I hope you fasten to your seat belt because if this page is unclear you will only get more complex alright but we perhaps will have time for questions rule 90 produces an intricate yet ultimately regular pattern look at this isn't that lovely it's a pattern it's in fact fractal to the beauty of fractals that's rule 90 a different rule just as simple producing a different pattern which is getting on the left striated into bands and on the right complex the wielder Wolfram as discovered and argues in a new kind of science that certain simple rules can produce patterns and behavior of immense complexity above his rule 30 it soon becomes complex above and at a hundred steps it appears very complex indeed below can you see how striated bands are here but this is other random isn't it well it only gets worse if if for you randomness is bad at a thousand steps rule 30 pardon pike typo appears to have patterns in the bands on the left and to be random to the right of those bands if one started with only one step 1000 here one could not reconstruct the simple rule that generated it one would not guess that the rule was simple and to look ahead to the grand thesis suppose that this whole evolution is like some phenomenon in nature which you observe part of so say you observe only this part like there that's all you can see would you ever be able to reconstruct the simple rule that generated it would you be able to guess that the rules that generated it were simple rule 10 is in a different category of rules from those generating either Panem's or randomness there's rule 110 as it evolves a complex pattern emerges on the right and it continues to morph into similar patterns at different shapes none quite the same as the pattern preceding it a mysterious statement we sent about to illustrate here is it's Elementary rule 110 here is the opening sequence of steps so far it's just not so clear what's going to happen is it but this is the image I began with and asked you to hold that image rule 10 at 250 steps I would gladly have given you it at a thousand steps but it seemed a bit too much memory so we have the patterning of striations we have here something that seems to be monochrome one of the possibilities he sort of cellular automata when he was a boy wonder in his 20s into four categories when they turn random sorry when they turn monochrome when they turn patterned when they turn random and when they turn what he calls complex this evolution is visibly something that in which each phase of it resembles earlier phases but is not the same it's what I call the Canadian phenomenon you look similar but somehow different so can you see that we are are I've sees this as a pattern where I cease this is a pattern this pattern resembles that but is neither the same scale nor precisely the same shape so we could watch this unfold a long time perhaps forever and would still not be able to predict the patterns in advance that is the essential point of his take on the word complexity now we've gotten through the worst and most technical part what I shall now do is juxtaposed statements from a new kind of science taking Stephen Wolfram as a case among many fine laborers in complexity theory I don't want to make him the sole star that's been a problem with his reception with you and I'm not interested in that problem but many complexity theory people would make similar statements likewise I'm going to take Talbot and Thornhill and representative of many fine workers and quite distinctive in their own contribution and I'm gonna juxtapose statements on a few topics mathematics complexity and time so you can see the how they might be powerful natural allies with their similar views on these topics and others views on mathematics for the new kind of science thinking in terms of programs rather than equations opens up a new kind of science mathematical equations correspond to particular kinds of rules computer programs can embody far more general rules the electric universe uncritical application of mathematical models will lead to whimsical and unstable descriptions of nature a quote you heard from me before all right views on complexity new kind of science even extremely simple programs can produce behavior of immense complexity that's what we saw in rule 110 everyday experience tends to make one think that it is difficult to get complex behavior and that to do so requires complicated underlying rules the discovery now that simple programs can produce immense complexity forces a major shift in scientific intuition I love his choice of that words by the way it's from the Latin to a or which means to look at intuition is just looking deeply at alright electric universe although plasma behavior follows simple or electric magnetic laws the resulting complexity continues to astonish the specialists who study it plasma can self-organize into cells of differing electrical characteristics I included that last sentence because self-organizing is another term in complexity theory which came naturally to the the pen of the authors of electric universe it's part of the language we now speak really views on time through the third of the three topics I mention a new kind of science time may have a fundamentally different nature from space the standard mathematical formulation of relativity theory suggests that despite our everyday impression time should be viewed as a fourth dimension much like space a new kind of science suggests however the time as we perceive it may instead emerge from an underlying process that makes it quite different from space electric universe Einstein redefined Newtonian gravity by placing it in a metaphysical framework he combined the three measurable physical dimensions of space with the matter of mathematical dimension that cannot be measured by a ruler time the claimed success of Einsteins thought experiments encouraged mathematicians to follow his lead and they have dominated physics and cosmology ever since this skeptical attitude towards what Einstein did will I take it warm the heart of all who attend Natural Philosophy Alliance meetings we're going to really relax because I'm going to tell you stories all right to prepare the ground here's the last sentence of a new kind of science and a quote from a poet placed by the authors of the electric universe at the top of the second page of that book last sentence of a new kind of science all the wonders of the universe can in effect be captured by simple rules but there can be no way to know all the consequences of these rules except in effect just to watch and see how they unfold to a or to watch and see quote on second page of the electric universe a quote I deeply love the universe is made of stories not of atoms Muriel Rukeyser by the way I have another quote and I think it's quite head who was cited earlier the event is the unit of things real if that's not by apply head please correct me but it's a philosopher saying what a poet says here now I'm gonna tell you an unpredictable story one of the great serendipitous moments in the history of science I like to think perhaps Christmas tree Christmas tree meets Talbots chain of arrows chain of arrows all right this is the story some of you may have heard it in a simplified version I am privileged to have received it from the horse's mouth they've taught in an email of this week earlier and I asked him to tell me the story of parrot at a meeting where he said what are those and Petra M Talbot said petroglyphs and did this the first version I heard of it was per at thought well these are my plasma shapes what are they doing out there in petroglyphs but here's dave's telling of the story we'd invited Tony to our conference in September 2000 at a gathering of speakers the next day after the conference Tony was inspired to go to the whiteboard and to draw some plasma images let's go back there's the whiteboard there are the plasma images then he drew out the chain of arrows which he called the Christmas tree upper left form and the attached I said Tony you've just drawn the chain of arrows an image I directed walls attention to only a few days before the conference Tony asked how the form evolved I told him it began with twin filaments up the polar axis dividing into a stack of embedded cones that emergently emerged eventually as a stack of Tauruses called the ladder of heaven and backbone of the sky Tony said that's how the Perret instability evolved the name given to the configuration by his coworkers when he returned home he asked me for the rock art images and the first image I sent him was the Chi Yenta petroglyph because I had no doubt he would recognize it that was the squatter man from chi ant Arizona really just across the border in northern Arizona from northern New Mexico the moment Tony saw it his life was changed he had no doubt whatsoever that it was an intense plasma instability and he immediately identified the parts for me Dave attached this picture to you can call these Christmas trees arrows or cones they are either going up to or coming down from a red disc that would be Mars then his attention immediately shifted to cataloging rock art images and on numerous occasions afterwards Tony confirmed to me that he had absolutely confirmed the formations I'd reconstructed saying that he could also demonstrate conclusively in due course that they involved planets as the anodes and cathodes in the discharge configuration that's the end of the story as Dave tobot emailed it to me in titling it the story in a nutshell so now the story takes on a dramatic global life / @ assembles a team to look at rock art all around the world and to put a GPS on each to see where it's pointing well all that team is modernist anthony von der Sluis AKA wrens there he is with the great pyramids is backdrop there he is in Mongolia so what does the team come up with well I'm going to give you three examples of rock art juxtaposed to photographs by Tony I think we're doing well on time because I'm coming to an end which will be familiar to many of you and this is just to confirm that this global wandering team did indeed find rock art images corresponding to what you'll see as photographs 3-dimensional of Tony's figures generated in a lab and then a schematic drawing of them and there again we saw this at the beginning this is the Cayenne pipette rogue laughs which they first sent to Tony so that would be the squatter man I'm going to show you two more and Tony and his written work says he has a total of 84 some plasma shapes in rock art so a second would be first the schematic diagram of a stacked torus and second that image four miles west of here in petroglyph national monument Rinconada support your local petroglyph so one two three four five six stacks one two three four five six sometimes they're five sometimes they're 4 6 is very common and we needn't go into the details of the schematic diagram you've seen it before you'll probably see it again finally

the hand of fire that is the hand of fire the problem now for us is the Tonys story is about things that appeared in the sky that are not there now the story is not finished until we can say how they disappeared how they as we might say disintegrated how amping up the language it collapsed catastrophic way that is the story rensef said himself to tell and he does so purely through the language of myths around the world in the fourth of the four volumes of its recently published magnum opus traditional cosmology the global mythology of creation and destruction volume 4 is entitled sorry pardon the typo disintegration and its subsections are disruption disconnection dispersion inversion departure periodization and eschaton the last thing so you can read that volume right now so we return to Galileo this is my last slide and here Galileo is Galileo is showing the Doge of Venice his telescope too bad the dogs they didn't use his power to keep Galileo out of the hands of the forces of the Pope and ultimately of life-long house arrest I'm going to summarize with two more quotes from a new kind of science simple computer experiments reveal a vast world of new phenomena in their times wolfram goes on telescopes revealed vast worlds that had never been seen before through the ideas of a new kind of science computer experiments now also reveal a vast new world in many ways more diverse and surprising even in the world seen in astronomy and you know this from Thunderbolt of the gods the new data Galileo great lots of time the new data Galileo collected in his first few weeks of telescopic observation overthrew the Ptolemaic view of the universe have you accepted for more than a thousand years so I'm going to conclude with an anecdote from two weeks ago three weeks ago at Bard College where I teach and we're I'm delighted to say all of the 500 freshmen in our Freshman Seminar are required to read not otto Plato and Shakespeare Dante and Virgil but Galileo as the last reading and if suddenly occurred to me in class as a way of its saying that what Galileo saw and did with what he saw can be compared to something happening in the world today and I chose tony peratt as an example Galileo I told them made his telescope looked through it saw the imperfect surface of the it's valets as know this is ruggedness and was compelled to tell the world of what he saw and in so doing to overthrow the Assumption by which the Western world had lived for almost two thousand years given it by Aristotle consolidated by Ptolemy namely that the moon and everything above it the planets and the stars fear are perfect they can have no irregularities either of motion or of surface that worldview had to be overthrown Galileo had to tell people that any of them the doji of Venice or you can look through that telescope and see the imperfections of the surface of the Moon likewise Stephen Wolfram felt he needed to tell the world after looking at rule 110 that simple that highly complex behavior so complex that it's continued evolution cannot be predicted it just has to be watched unfolding can be generated on a computer and cellular automata and you can see by the mode of its generation that that complexity came from very simple rules against all our intuition finally Tony Moran saw in his lab the shapes that kept morphing from one to another as he added more current then he saw those rock art forms as Walt had seen from Dave six years earlier and was compelled to tell the world all three of them that the sky that ancient man saw the ancient sky was not the same as we see today that is overthrowing a still dominant assumption and the seers of those plasma shapes and petroglyphs have felt compelled to tell the world it was not so the ancient sky was different thank you 
The James Webb Space Telescope has been sending images to Earth since July 2022 and has already delivered a startling finding: seeing galaxies orders of magnitude brighter in the early Universe than astronomers had anticipated. The Webb telescope was designed to see deeper into the infrared spectrum of light than the Hubble Space Telescope. Infrared light does not get as scattered by dust and filament clouds as does the visible light spectrum. Consequently, photographs of deep space, using the infrared spectrum, reveal many more stars hiding in the haze of outer space. Additionally, there is a redshift factor. The older the galaxy, the faster it is moving away from us, making the Doppler effect on the light waves coming from deep space, stronger the faster the receding velocity is. The Doppler effect is familiar to us in the change of pitch of a train's horn as it passes by. As the train moves away from us, the sound waves are stretched out, making the horn's tone lower. In the case of light, the Doppler effect lowers the received light frequency towards the red end of the visible spectrum, and if pronounced enough, into the invisible infrared part of the  spectrum. In order to photograph galaxies that are so old that the redshift has moved to visible light wave spectral lines into the infrared range, the telescope’s mirror and imaging chips are engineered to be sensitive to red light and rays that our eyes  can't see. In the standard model of cosmology, evolutionary cosmologists say the first stars formed 400 million years after the so-called Big Bang and the first galaxies then formed a few hundred million years later. High redshift values are a measure of the age of a galaxy, and the degree of shift that the Webb telescope is showing, implies that the galaxies existed 180 million years or less after the Big Bang, a clear violation of the theory. A galaxy of 180 million years old is considered young in a universe that is believed to be over 13 billion years old. Following Webb's findings that surprisingly mature galaxies are located  in a very young part of the universe, theorists and observers have been scrambling to explain them. Reaching back to a comparatively young 180 million years after the theoretical Big Bang, the telescope found some galaxies with large fully formed disk-like structures that were not expected to exist so early in cosmic history. Stacy McGaugh, cosmologist Case Western Reserve University, was quoted in the September 14, 2022 Scientific American saying, “We should see lots of these little protogalactic fragments that have not yet merged to make a big galaxy. Instead, we're seeing a few things that are already big galaxies.” Early proto-galaxies are expected to be small, dim, and thinly populated fuzzy blobs of stars, but what is seen are fully formed and evolved galaxies, well defined with spiral arms, and many times the size and energy of our Milky Way galaxy. The Einsteinian gravity-fed Standard Model of the Universe's evolution is falling under the wheels of increasing observational resolution factors, greater levels of detail from which to extract predictive patterns. This is science in action, doing what it is supposed to do, make new discoveries, not validate old ideas. This is the Platonic underpinning of scientific method, the replacement of old hypotheses by new and better ones. When science refuses to be updated, it ceases to be science and begins to resemble an authoritarian cult, a collection of fetishes. Mainstream astronomers, instead of being excited about new discovery, act like they were caught flat-footed and not at all happy about a 10 billion dollar investment that appears to have paid off. When Michael Boylan Kolchin, theoretical astrophysicists, University of Texas Austin said in Science Journal, 12 August 2022, ”No one was expecting anything like this.” One can only ask, why the heck not. The entire point of science is to toss obsolete ideas into the dustbin of history. This is precisely what scientists should be prepared to expect. It is unsure whether current galaxy formation models need a revision, or abandonment. One can only marvel at the kluging of band-aid concepts to paper over observations that were unexpected. The invocation of dark matter and dark energy in the face of the failure of Einsteinian empty space to account for the high rotational speeds of galaxies, seems more like a parlor conjurer’s ’rabbit in a hat-trick’ than a science eager for a better understanding, even if it dynamites cherished canards like the Big Bang Theory and black holes. Models hold that gas clouds should be far slower to coalesce into stars and galaxies than is suggested by the Webb’s galaxy-rich images of the early universe, less than 500 million years after the Big Bang. In questioning the validity of Big Bang, Paul J. Steinhardt, Professor of physics, Director of the Princeton Center for theoretical science in Scientific American, September 28, 2017, calls for reconsideration of the cosmic inflation theory, or Big Bang as it has come to be known. He states, “The cosmology community has not taken a cold, honest look at the Big Bang inflationary theory or paid significant attention to critics who question whether inflation happened.” But even before the experts could start incorporating the Webb telescope data into their interpretive frameworks when the first Webb telescope pictures were only days old, astronomers from the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, announced that they had found a galaxy with the incredible value of 17z. That value would indicate that this galaxy had a redshift of 17, which would mean this galaxy existed only 220 million years after the Big Bang. The galaxy CEERS-1749, but popularly called Schrodinger's Galaxy, shows in addition to its unusual age, a huge mass which means that there are a lot of stars in the galaxy. So, the oldest galaxy in the universe is anything but a small cluster of stars that might have formed shortly after the Big Bang. With 5 billion solar masses, Schrodinger's Galaxy is about five times more massive than our Milky Way. Schrodinger's also exhibits an enormous luminosity. The galaxy’s brightness is much too high for one that existed only 220 million years after the Big Bang. Tomamaso Treu, Professor of physics, UC Santa Barbara, echoes the consensus of consternation when he said in the October 2022 Astrophysical Journal Letters, ”Somehow, the universe has managed to form galaxies faster and earlier than we thought.” The Webb telescope images from NASA also unexpectedly reveal for the first time barred spiral galaxies located at a time when the universe was a mere 25 percent of its present age. Barred spiral galaxies, similar to our Milky Way, are considered to be a mature, not a young galaxy type, in fact to have evolved from normal spiral galaxies, making them an  older and more evolved galaxy type. Garth Illingworth, Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics, UC Santa Cruz, in the 9 August 2022 issue of Science Journal, exclaimed, ”This is way outside the box of what models were predicting.” One can only hope that the new box Illingsworth and his colleagues are busily constructing, will be one capable of expansion. It will be interesting to see how the ’engine of orthodoxy’ integrates this new data which is very recent, and not fully metabolized by the ‘ivory tower’. Whatever the outcome, it is certain that the cosmological discourse will gravitate away from Einstein's ‘space-is- empty’ gravity model. Since that hypothesis has been defended for decades as unquestionable truth by the vast majority of cosmological theorists, the new data is causing these theorists to panic. Based on the published literature right now, the Big Bang makes 15 wrong predictions, and only one right one, the abundance of deuterium, an isotope of  hydrogen. In the 27 July, 2022 Nature Journal, Alison Kirkpatrick, Assistant Professor, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Kansas, Lawrence, appears to be not having much luck wrapping her head around the new Webb data. Quote, “Right now I find myself lying awake at three in the morning and wondering if everything I've done is wrong....” Dr. Sabine Hossenfelder, Research Fellow, Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies, has been wondering the same thing. Even before the Webb data entered the fray in this panel discussion from 2021 sponsored by The Institute of Art and Ideas.  “...and that's exactly what I mean when I say we have a problem with theory development. Because you have all these theorists, they literally guess their models and it just leads nowhere. And I really think that theoretical physicists have to have a hard look at their methods of theory development, and throughout what didn't work. We talk about the scientific method as if it was a fixed thing. But it's a living and evolving thing and what counts as good science at one point in history, might no longer count as good science a hundred years later.” Dr. Hossenfelder is an example of a scientist doing what they should all be doing: protecting the scientific method and its process of hypothesis formation. Will this predictive failure of the accepted cosmology reinvigorate discussion towards alternative cosmologies? What I mean specifically are the steady state theories of William Duncan MacMillan, Hermann Bondi, Thomas Gold and Fred Hoyle. And of course, the Electric Universe model of Wal Thornhill, Don Scott, Dave Talbot, Ev Cochrane, Dwardu Cardona, Michael Armstrong and Mel Atchison, to name a few. Perhaps a cosmology of the future is already here, although not yet acknowledged in the mainstream. The field is entirely wide open for those curious enough to invest the energy to think. The EU model of cosmology represents a change in the categories of astrophysics, and most important the methodology of thought, which must drill these new ideas into the lockstep mind of conventional science.

I want to thank the organizers of this conference for inviting me. It's a little bit unusual, I think, to have an eye surgeon speaking to physicists but nevertheless I'm honored that you would allow me to come and share some thoughts with you about the role of voltage in the body. Now, I always start my lectures by announcing that I'm not speaking with my Texas MD license. The Medical Board in the state of Texas does not allow its physicians to talk about anything that's not standard of care medicine and of course standard of care medicine is pharmaceutical medicine, surgery, and physical therapy and obviously what I'm talking about today involves other thngs. So I'm speaking today with my Arizona homeopathic and integrative medicine license. I want to acknowledge certain people that have contributed greatly to much of the information I'm going to share today. This is the Tennant Institute staff and we have dr. Marr and dr. Hyde in the audience with us and if there are those of you who become intrigued by some of the things we're talking about, they'll be happy to help demonstrate to you how all of this works. In addition, I want to acknowledge Eileen McKusick whom you heard speak this morning and her major contributions to this area as well, so thank you Eileen. So what are emotions? Well, people talk about having them but most people don't have a real, good definition of what they really are and how they work. In addition, as in the over 50 years I've been in medicine, people have talked, sort of in passing, about the mind-body connection but I found it was difficult to get anybody explain to me what that meant. How does that really work? Well, they say well, you know, if you have emotions it makes you get sick okay? How's that work? And I found it difficult to find any solution or answer to that question. So the reality is that none of us can get through life without having emotional events. We have losses; loved ones die or disappoint us, our dreams go unfulfilled, we go bankrupt, we have car wrecks, we suffer injuries, all sorts of things happen and then of course we now have this big epidemic in our country of soldiers returning from war and committing suicide. So this business about post-traumatic stress syndrome is of course, become a major issue for us and nobody really knows very well how to handle it and here's a list of all of the various things that can happen with that but we find that more and more people that aren't soldiers are having post-traumatic stress syndrome as well. So we need to get a handle on how to deal with that. Now, when this Time magazine cover came out, we were only losing one soldier a day, now it's up to 20 a day so 20 of our veterans a day are committing suicide. So we obviously need to figure out a way to deal with that. Now, the reality is that deployment and suicide are not necessarily related, in the studies that have been done. But the important point, I think, of the military suicides is that pharmaceuticals are not very effective. Most people know that and the studies have been done to show that there's really not a pharmaceutical that does very much in helping deal with suicides and the emotions that go with it. And then I'm just passing through to the studies that have been published about that. Now in my observation, if you have treatment failures it usually means you're using a wrong paradigm and so I'm going to suggest to you a different paradigm as we go through the day. But I'd first like to tell you how I ended up sitting in this chair. I'm trained as an ophthalmologist and an ophthalmic plastic surgeon and I did the majority of the research for the laser that's used in lasik surgery by the company called Visx and I had a lot of fun doing that research but unfortunately we didn't know at the time that the laser wouldn't kill viruses so as I would be treating eyes and particularly I treated this one fellow from India that had scars on his corneas and I used the laser to remove those scars but he had leukemia. Well, we didn't know that the laser wouldn't kill viruses and so the viruses came up, off his eye through my mask into my nose and into my brain and I developed encephalitis. And so I, the result of that was that I could see a patient and know what was wrong with them but I couldn't remember how to write a prescription. And I'd, in addition to that, I developed spastic movements so I'd be sitting there and do something like that which doesn't work really well if you're operating inside somebody's eyeball. And so, for all of those reasons I had to quit working at the end of November 1995. So I spent about 16 hours a day in bed sleeping and I had two or three hours a day in which I could think clearly enough to understand a newspaper and there like a light switch would go off and I couldn't understand it anymore. So during that 2 or 3 hours a day I could think, I had to figure out how to get myself well because the best doctors I could find at NIH in Boston and New York and wherever just said well you got three viruses in your brain, we don't know what to do about it, go home and don't call us, we'll call you. So during that two or three hours a day that I could think, I began to try to figure out how to get myself well and I began to think about the fact that all the cells in the body work very much the same even though they look different but that if I could figure out how to make one cell work, I could make them all work. And so I went out and bought 10 or 15 books on cellular biology and started to reading them which I hadn't done for about 30 years. And one of the things that resonated to me with those various books was that each one talked about the fact that cells are designed to run at a pH of 7.35 to 7.45. And so I didn't really know too much about pH, I remembered there was something about, have to do with acid-base balance but I didn't really know a great deal more about it. So as I began to look at pH, I began to realize that pH describes voltage in a liquid. So if you think about the wires that are bringing the voltage into these lights and to your computers etc, that's conductive electricity of course with electrons flowing through a copper wire. But if you talk about a solution, a solution has the opportunity to be either an electron donor or an electron stealer. So in order to figure out which it is, use a sophisticated voltmeter, or so to speak, called pH meter. And when you measure a liquid with a pH meter, it will give you either the pH or you can flip a switch and it will give, read it out in millivolts. So the reality then is, voltage in a liquid we call pH and by convention, if you find that the solution is an electron stealer, you put a plus sign in front of the voltage and if it's an electron donor, you put a minus sign in front of it and then you convert the voltage that you measure with a logarithmic scale going from 0 to 14 and call that pH. So plus 400 millivolts of electrons stealer is the same as a pH of zero whereas minus 400 millivolts of electron donor is the same thing as a pH of 14. And if it's neutral, if it's neither electron down or electron stealer, then that's a pH of seven. So when we say that cells must run at a pH of 7.35 to 7.45, we are saying, cells must run between minus twenty and minus 25 millivolts. Well, that was a wowser for me, guess what- -cells need energy to work, that makes sense. Now by the way, people sometimes get confused with these numbers because if you take a cell in a petri dish and you put an electrode inside the cell and one outside the cell and you measure across the cell membrane, you'll get about -90 mV but hopefully not very many of you have your cells in Petri dishes. But in the environment of this body, they're designed to run at minus 25 minus 20 to minus 25 millivolts. So one of the things that you will find is the characteristic of essentially all chronic disease is that you have low voltage going to that organ. So we are constantly wearing ourselves out and needing to make new cells. So what I'm seeing here is, one slide behind that one apparently. OK, so we are constantly wearing ourselves out and having to make new cells so the macula in your eye today is only 48 hours old, in other words, you get new cells in the macula every 48 hours. The lining of your gut is three weeks old, the skin you're sitting in today is six weeks old, your liver is eight weeks old, and your nervous system is eight months old. So we are constantly wearing ourselves out and having to make new cells. So it turns out then, the chronic disease only occurs when you lose the ability to make new cells that work. Let me say that one more time, chronic disease only occurs when you lose the ability to make new cells that work. Well, if that's the case then, we need to ask the question, what does it take to make a new cell that works? Well, as I mentioned, it takes minus 25 millivolts for a cell to run but to make a new one, takes double that, it takes minus 50 millivolts. And then, in addition to having the voltage to make new cells, we have to have all of the nutrients to make a new cell. So if your house gets blown down with a tornado and you have to build a new one, guess what? You have to have everything you need to 'bake' it. You can't build a new house with door knobs and bathroom tiles, you have to have shingles and rafters and doors and windows, it's that you have to have everything it takes and this is a big mistake people make when they're trying to get well as they try one substance at a time saying that well, I want to see what works. Well it's not going to work because you have to have everything, all at one time, to build a new cell. So we have to have minus 50 millivolts of energy, we have to have everything it takes to make a cell and then we have to deal with any of the toxins that are hanging around that damage cells as fast as we make them. And the most common toxins we have to deal with are heavy metals like mercury, toxins coming out of our teeth and GMO foods with the pesticide called RoundUp or glyphosate. Now, the body actually has four different battery packs because the human body is a portable electronic device like all electronic devices it has to have a battery pack or multiple battery packs. And so, the reality is that we have these four different packs. Now the largest one of all is our muscles. Now our muscles are piezoelectric and for those of you who aren't physicists that word, funny word piezoelectricity means that if you stress a substance and it emits electrons, that's called piezoelectricity. So when I move my muscles, I'm generating electrons which is by the way why exercise is so important because exercise is the way the human body is designed to recharge your own personal battery pack. But the reality is also that our muscles are rechargeable batteries and so we have then these large muscles which are our main batteries and then these muscles battery packs are all hooked to our cell membranes. Now, cell membranes are capacitors so what is a capacitor, well, capacitor is a small battery and the way our cell membranes are designed is with a couple of opposing layers of funny fats called phospholipids and these fats have a ball and then two legs. Well, the balls are electron conductors and the legs are insulators so when you put them like this, you have two conductors separated by insulator which by definition is a capacitor which means it stores electrons. And then inside the cell, we have mitochondria and inside the mitochondria we have another rechargeable battery system. When that battery system is charged up, we call it ATP and then as it gives away its electrons and discharges, we call it ADP. Well, because we have a rechargeable battery system inside our mitochondria, guess what else we need in there, a battery charger and the battery charger inside the cell is called the citric acid cycle or the Krebs cycle. So the Krebs cycle runs on primarily fatty acids and so as you put fatty acids through the Krebs cycle, it creates electrons and for every unit of fatty acids that you put through the Krebs cycle, if oxygen is present, you get enough electrons to charge up 38 of these ATP batteries. Now in addition we have the DNA. Now DNA inside of ourselves, we generally tend to look at it from the side and we see, looks like we took a couple of steps, stepladders and twisted them but if you look at it from the top, it looks like this. And every circle of DNA is golden mean and what that means is that it's 1.618 times, the diameter is 1.618 times the the height and so forth. And any place in the universe where there is something that's golden mean or in the shape of platonic solid, it will cause implosion of scalar energy. So because our DNA is golden mean then scalar implodes into it and gives it its charge so it has the energy to do its job. So then we have, our muscles then are stacked one on top of each other in a very specific order like stacking batteries in a flashlight. And so, surrounding these, the stack of muscle batteries, we have a substance called fascia which is very much like a stacking and of course, fascia is that shiny stuff you see when you carve the Christmas turkey. Now the interesting thing about fascia is that fascia is a semiconductor. So what in the world is a semiconductor? Semiconductor is a collection of molecules arranged in such a way that electrons move through it at the speed of light but only in one direction. So we have then this continuous stack of fasciae going from our toes up to our brain, from our fingers up to our brain and surrounded by this stacking which serves basically as the wiring system for the body. So we have then the stack of muscle batteries surrounded by the fascia, so that every organ in the body has its own battery pack. Because every organ in the body has its own battery pack, then we have the ability to isolate, measure that voltage and figure out why that organ is malfunctioning. Now, a stack of muscle batteries it's what's been called an acupuncture meridian. So an acupuncture meridian is simply a stack of muscle batteries. Now, so this is an example of an acupuncture meridian called the spleen meridian and the spleen meridian... (oops, go back the other way, there you go). So the Spleen Meridian starts down in the big toe, goes up the inside of the leg and then it goes, there's a special branch, as you can see, goes over to the female genitalia, then it goes around the back where it gets the adrenal glands, the spleen and the pancreas, then it goes on, up into the neck and makes a loop and hooks into what's called the stomach circuit, and then the stomach circuit gets the macula of the eye so by the way if anybody has macular degeneration, it's because you have low voltage in your stomach circuit. It powers the frontal lobes which is the thinking part of your brain, then it gets the thyroid, the breast, the stomach, the male genitalia and then back down to the big toe so it makes a loop. So we have six of these loops of muscle batteries that provide the 25 millivolts you need for the organs to work and the 50 millivolts to repair them. So chronic disease occurs when one of these muscle battery packs won't hold a charge. So then that leads us to the question well, why won't that battery pack hold a charge? Well, there is a checklist that you can go through to try to figure out why it won't hold, why it won't hold a charge but basically you have to look at thyroid hormone because that the thyroid hormone T3 controls the voltage of every cell membrane in the body and T2 controls the voltage in the mitochondria so you have to be sure that the thyroid hormone level is correct. Then, if you were to put a scar across one of these circuits, so if you put a scar across one of these muscle battery packs here, it's going to short it out and it'll drain off some of the voltage. So scars are, can be a significant problem but the only scars that really take you completely down are those on the main line on your main cable. A scar across your knee or something will generally just lower it a few millivolts but enough to cause some problems. In addition, emotions are stored in the body as magnetic fields so if you have a magnetic field that's stuck in one of these muscle battery packs here, it's going to block the voltage so it won't go through. And then finally, dental infections are a significant problem because each of these circuits go through very specific teeth. So here you see that we have this main cable that goes up the back and down the front, and then from that main cable you get the voltage coming from our arms and our legs and they come up to these lateral terminals and then from those lateral terminals they go to this central one and then it starts looping around the body and as it loops around the back, it has the option then of going out and attaching to the ganglia that are up and down the spinal cord which we call the autonomic ganglia and then from the autonomic ganglia it goes to every organ in the body. So that's the human body's wiring system and battery pack system and so, whenever you have chronic disease you will have failure of one of these electronic systems. So you simply have to start out whenever you have some sort of illness asking the question, so what's the battery pack to that illness? So if you have heart disease you would say what's the battery pack for the heart? Well it's obviously the heart muscle battery pack. There are others that are not as as obvious, for example there's the example I gave you, a spleen stomach. The spleen stomach circuit is the power supply for the entire endocrine system, the entire reproductive system in both males and females, the macula of the eye, and the thinking part of the brain. And of course, when that system goes out which is that one of the more common ones to go out, then you start having failure of those organ systems. So how do we know if the voltage is low in a circuit? Well, we have the ability to measure it with certain acupuncture points, using what amounts to a specially-designed ohmmeter. Now, as we began to then identify the Power Packs that is not working correctly, we have two things in front of us, one is to figure out why that battery pack won't hold a charge and then the second is to try to recharge the battery pack while we're figuring out how to fix the reason that we got into trouble in the first place. So we have developed this device called a bio transducer that puts out both electromagnetic and scalar energy and if you simply aim it at the failing organ you can begin to recharge the cells in that organ itself and then you want to come behind it and you want to charge the muscle battery packs and these diagrams that we have here, where you see the red and the black dots, show you where to put the polarity because every battery pack, like every other battery you're aware of, has its as terminals and polarity so you take patches and you stick the patches on to where the other terminals of the battery pack that doesn't have enough charge, hook it on to the bio modulator which is a little portable device that looks a bit like a computer mouse and it puts out waveforms that are designed to implode energy and transfer energy to the cells and recharge your muscle battery packs. So you're recharging the organ and the muscle battery packs while you're working on figuring out well why won't that battery pack hold a charge in the first place. Now, one of the interesting things is that our bodies are wired up like many circuit boards. As you know, many electronic circuit boards use Tesla resonating circuits. A Tesla resonant circuit is a combination of a capacitor and a coil wired in parallel. And when you do that, it has the ability to communicate with other systems that are a combination of Tesla resonating circuits. So in the body, the lung is always wired to the large intestine, the heart is always wired to the small intestine, the spleen and pancreas are always wired to the stomach, the kidney is always wired to the bladder and the liver is always wired at the gallbladder. Each of these are screeds in a Tesla resonating circuit and because they are Tesla circuits, they are able to communicate with each other. So one part of our body knows what's going on in the other part of the body because we're wired up with Tesla resonating circuits. Now, all of these various circuits in the body go through very specific teeth and so the teeth act like circuit breakers. So if you begin to have an infection in one of your teeth, it will at first begin to reduce the voltage that's in that circuit and later actually switch it off. So the circuit we've been talking about, the spleen stomach circuit is the one that you see in yellow here, it's the upper molars and lower premolars. And so if you have an infection in an upper molar, then it's going to begin to affect your spleen stomach circuit which means it's going to affect as I mentioned your entire reproductive system, your entire endocrine system, the thinking part of your brain, and the macula of your eye. So most people with macular degeneration have an infection in an upper molar. On the same side is their macular degeneration. Now, one of the issues then is how do teeth enter into this whole system? Well, it turns out that the teeth appear to function similar to the way that a lymph node does in the lymphatic system. If you have infection in your lymphatic system and it goes up the lymphatics, it gets caught and trapped in a lymph node. Well, emotions are trapped in the body as magnetic fields and those magnetic fields tend to end being trapped in teeth as well. And so, what you'll find is that the majority of chronic illnesses actually begins with an emotional event. Let me say it one more time, the majority of chronic diseases actually begins as an emotional event and that emotion is a magnetic field that starts blocking the circuit by getting caught in one of the teeth and as it does so it begins to lower the voltage in the tooth. Now, Dr. Steinman showed that every tooth has within it a pump that pumps fluid from inside the tooth to inside the mouth and that's what keeps you from getting cavities. Your kids will be happy to know that it's not snicker bars that are causing their cavities, it's the failure of this pump. So when their pump begins to fail, then infection comes from the mouth into the tooth and begins to cause decay. So, the emotion begins to lower the voltage enough in the tooth that the pump begins to fail and then you begin to get a cavity and then you begin to get a crown and then you can begin to eventually keep going until you get a root canal and then that leads eventually to having a malignancy. So again, most of the chronic diseases occurs, begins as emotions. Now obviously there's some circumstances where that's not the case. If you were living in Tokyo when Fukushima blew up and you were radiated, obviously that's not necessarily emotional event in the sense that you may not have known you just got radiated, but it's going to make you sick. But generally speaking, (most of the emotions) most of the chronic disease we have we can trace back to the emotion that has blocked a particular muscle battery pack by blocking the tooth that's involved with it. Now, when you look at this particular slide you might ask the question, didn't anybody ever teach you not to put so many numbers on one slide? Well, I did it on purpose because I wanted you to get the gestalt of it. So what you will see is that the relationship, you'll see that here, that a pH of seven point three five is the same as minus twenty millivolts; seven point four four is the same as minus twenty five. So that's where our organ, our cells normally run but as voltage begins to drop then things begin to get worse and worse for us until we finally get down to plus 30 millivolts. All cancers occur at plus 30 millivolts so what you see is that normal tissue is running at electron donor which is minus 25 millivolts and as you go past zero you have flipped the polarity, that is that every battery as you know has a plus on one end, a minus on the other and as you drain a battery all the way to zero, it flips its polarity upside down. And so, when the polarity reverses is when, and it gets all the way down to plus 30 millivolts, it's when malignancies occur. Now we don't have time to really go into that in much detail today but the amount of oxygen that will dissolve in water is dictated by the voltage of the water so as the water inside of ourselves has lower and lower voltage then the oxygen in the cell comes out of the cell and disappears and when you finally flip the polarity, there is so little oxygen capability in the cell that the stem cells recognize that signal that hey, we just ran out of oxygen here, please help! And so stem cells go over and invade the local blood supply and create a massive blood vessels that we call a cancer which is indistinguishable from a placenta in a pregnant female. So basically all solid tumors are placentas, that is the body's way of responding to lack of voltage and oxygen. So if we begin then to think about the the way that this works, think about my thumb. My thumb is a perfectly good thumb by the way. It's running at what voltage? -25 millivolts. Now I hit it with a hammer and I destroy some cells in my thumb. What's going to happen is that the thumb's immediately going to go to minus 50 millivolts and minus 50 millivolts causes the arterioles to dilate and the reason that happens of course is we need the raw materials dumped at the curb there so to speak so that we can rebuild the cells we destroyed with a hammer. Well when those capillaries dilate, we get all the signs we normally call inflammation, we have redness, we have swelling, we have heat, we have a pulsing pain, and it makes you say bad words. So my thumb gets busy and it makes new cells, it replaces those that I smashed with a hammer, goes back to minus 25 millivolts and I'm a happy camper. But on the other hand if, when I smash my thumb, if the power supply going to the thumb is inadequate to provide the -50 millivolts I need to make new cells, then my thumb won't heal and I'm stuck in chronic disease, you see that? So I can take all the pills I want, I can do all the surgery I want on the thumb, but it'll never get well until I do what--insert enough electrons to get me up to minus 50 millivolts. And so if you understand what I just told you about the thumb, you understand basically my whole lecture so I can go home now. Oh no, wait a minute, it's still a little bit more but the point is that chronic disease occurs when you don't have enough voltage to make new cells and so as voltage begins to drop, then oxygen begins to drop and when oxygen drops there are several bad things that begin to happen. The one of the things that, as I mentioned earlier, is that you began to have less ATP which is the voltage inside the cell that cell needs to do its business. Now I also mentioned to you that as, because of the Krebs cycle being able to make, to recharge 38 of these ATP batteries for every unit of fatty acid you put through the krebs cycle, that's only true if oxygen is available. If oxygen is unavailable, then for every unit of fatty acid you put through the battery charger, you only get enough electrons to charge up two batteries. So it's a bit like having a car that goes from 38 miles to gallon to 2 miles the gallon. Your cells become very inefficient. Now in addition to having inefficiency of the intracellular voltage, we have problems with bugs. Now the body contains perhaps trillion bugs of various kinds and the majority of them are suppressed by oxygen but as oxygen levels begin to drop because voltage drops, then these bugs wake up and the first thing the bugs want to do is have lunch and they want to have you for lunch. Now bugs don't have teeth so that they can take a bite out of you so instead they put out digestive enzymes to dissolve your cells so they can get the nutrients. So think about having a sore throat. The strep bacteria on your tonsils having a picnic and they're having a good old time, but you have the world's worst sore throat, you have a headache, you have a fever, you have been vomiting, you have diarrhea, your joints hurt, you have a miserable day and it's because the bugs are having their way by putting out these digestive enzymes to get their nutrients out of the cells. Now one of the things is that as voltage and oxygen drop more and more, these microorganisms lose their cell membranes so they become what have been called cell wall deficient organisms or stealth patogens. One of the problems with that is, first of all you can't culture them. Secondly, you don't see them with a standard microscope, you need one of these fancy microscopes called phase contrast or dark field microscope. And these bugs then put out various toxins and begin to damage the local tissue and often what we call an autoimmune disease is simply these bugs having their way with your local tissue. So as they put out their toxins, you get the signs of inflammation and swelling and so forth but if you try to culture anything or look at a biopsy of that area, you don't see anything because normal hospitals and physicians' offices don't use one of these microscopes so where you can actually see them. In these images that you see on the screen, you see these various cell wall deficient bugs inside red blood cells consuming them, in the lower right you see where I took red blood cells, put it under a coverslip on a microscope slide and let it sit there for a few hours and as it consumed all of the oxygen, you see the Lyme spirochetes coming crawling out of the red cells. So everybody in this room has Lyme disease, it's just whether or not your immune system has the ability to deal with it, whether you have symptoms from it. So then as the voltage gets down toward plus 30 millivolts, then the cell wall deficient fungus shows up and you began to have these kinds of cells, this is a blood from a fellow who had leukemia and you can see the fungal forms in his blood that the fungus is always associated with these kinds of things. So I'm going to skip past, this is just a better microscopic view and I want to go to talk to you a minute more about teeth because that's terribly important in the understanding how to get people well. Now, if you look at the lower left image, you see a car battery that has corrosion around it which means that the alternator in that car is going to have trouble keeping that battery charged up. Well, the tooth just above it is attached to a muscle battery but it also has corrosion and thus it also has trouble keeping that battery charged up and then as corrosion in either your car battery or your tooth gets worse over time, then it gets harder and harder and harder and harder to keep your battery packs charged up and eventually in the car battery the corrosion will come outside the battery itself and start corroding through your battery cable which now means you have a total short-circuit and your car won't start. Well, this process occurs in the body when the infection in the tooth moves out into the bone so when you have infection in a bone around a tooth it actually works just like a circuit breaker and shake takes down that circuit and then the two circumstances in which that occurs is either a root canal tooth, which is of course a dead tooth, most of you may know the way you do a root canals, you drill a little hole in the top of the tooth and you put an auger down and then you rip out the artery and rip out the nerve and kill the tooth and then you fill it with putty. You know, the problem is that now the tooth is dead and all dead tissue gets infected. The dentists are the only physicians that believe you can get away with leaving dead tissue in the body. No other doctor believes that. So, one root canal tooth shuts down sixty-three percent of your immune system. So and then what makes it worse is that it then gets out into the bone and when it gets into the bone it shuts off that circuit and so now the voltage drops significantly in that circuit and that's why you find in the, we looked at all the cancer patients we've seen in our clinic and ninety five percent of them are associated with a root canal or an infected bone where a tooth had been pulled, ninety five percent! So a leading contributor to cancer is having an infection in the bone around one of the teeth. Now, in addition to root canals, there's a problem when teeth get pulled because teeth are held into the bone by a ligament called a periodontal ligament. What dentists are trained to do is wiggle the tooth, make it loose, take it out, put a stitch, and quit leaving the ligament behind. When you do that, it's very hard for the bone to heal because of the ligaments in the way. And even if the dentist happens to be one who takes the to scrape out that ligament, because the mouth is such a dirty place, often times people get infection in the bone during the first few days of healing once the tooths been pulled. So once you, and that's called a cavitation by the way, so whether you have infection from a root canal or from a cavitation, it tends to shut down the circuit and one of the problems is that infection in the bone then tends to move over and take out the next circuit. So a huge problem is that our kids are in high school and they go to the dentist and they say oh, you got to get your wisdom teeth out. It's that old thing of whether if you go to Midas you get a muffler. So a study came out last year showing that 65 percent of root canal extractions were unnecessary. Well, nevertheless they get their wisdom teeth pulled and now they start getting infection in that area and the wisdom teeth circuit is heart-small intestine but listen, it's the autonomic nervous system. Autonomic nervous system is the body's on-off switches. So all of a sudden, within days after getting their wisdom teeth extracted, the kids have lost their on/off switch which means they, their bodies doesn't allow to control itself. Then, over time, it begins to move next door and takes out the spleen-stomach circuit. Now remember that the spleen circuit is the power supply to the adrenal glands so now, soon, they've lost their control panel, their on/off system and then they lose their adrenals so they can't deal with stress and so they began to become what many people say oh, he's just a teenager. Well no, he's not just a teenager, he's lost his  ability, the whole but way the body deals with stress. And so many of our kids hide themselves within electronics because within the electronics they have an on/off switch, in their body they don't so they can't deal with the real world anymore and so they hide within their cell phone and their game boys or whatever you call them. Nevertheless, this is a huge problem. Now when you lose, I only got five minutes left, so when you lose your ability to make adrenalin, you go down the following slippery slope, you have trouble going to sleep, you have trouble dealing with stress, you have trouble with your memory and then you can't multitask. So you're sitting, reading a book or watching TV and somebody says hey, do you want mustard or mayonnaise? You become very annoyed because they have interrupted you but you don't have the mental horsepower to stay attached to whatever you're doing so you detach, you pick mustard, you go back to your book and now you can't remember your place and you're even more annoyed. And then it gets to where you don't like any stimulus so you don't like loud noises, loud music, rowdy crowds can't be around people who are arguing and eventually it gets to where you don't even want to be touched you just want to sit in the corner and have people leave you the heck alone. And then your sexual equipment quits working and then you can't go to sleep before 11:00 and when you wake up you're still tired, all of that's due to the lack - loss of the spleen power supplying the adrenals. Well, what I've just described of course is very destructive. If you can't deal with the life or the world, you can't be a good spouse and particularly if your sexual equipment doesn't work anymore then that's a big problem in a marriage. You can't be a good parent because kids make noise and want something from you and you have nothing to give, you can't be a good worker, you can't be a good friend you can't be good at much of anything so your life's in the toilet simply because you've lost the spleen circuit that goes to the adrenal glands and that's a huge problem in our society. Well now, Eileen McKusick spoke earlier about mapping the field of emotions and this is the traditional Chinese one so that the various circuits have these various sorts of emotions get stuck in these various particular places or in the teeth that are associated with these, Dr. Banis published these and of course Eileen has published hers which is this group of where things get stuck. And as far as the erasing emotions are concerned, because emotions are magnetic field, you can erase them with a stronger magnetic field. One of the laws of physics is, if you take any magnet and you put a stronger magnet over it, then the weaker magnet assumes the characteristics of the stronger one and so when you have these emotions that are stuck, you can begin to erase them in a variety of different ways. Now there are various groups over the years that have looked at this subject and tried to figure out how to do it, EFT, Psych-K, Emotion Codes, Psychosomatic Energetics, etc, etc, but certainly we have developed one where you can, if you can think about emotion while holding onto these hand grips with your bio modulator you could erase the emotion but when we did that we were doing one emotion at the time and of course, Eileen talked to you this morning about using her tuning fork to do it which is very effective. What I have recently found is that, if you treat the wisdom teeth, which treats your autonomic nervous system, then you can begin to knock out, you can not only change the polarity in all of your various circuits at one time but also knock out many of emotions automatically. Now a pendulum is actually a, like a single string on a guitar and the weight on the pendulum makes the string taut so when you move, when it's moved it's actually resonating with whatever frequency the string is. So what you do is you hold this pendulum over the small intestine, heart-small intestine autonomic system and you take the bio transducer and simply put it over the wisdom teeth and you watch the pendulum and it'll always be spinning backwards if the voltage is low, counter- clockwise, and you keep holding it there and pretty soon it'll slow down and then it'll start spinning clockwise, and then you do the same on the other side again holding the pendulum over the heart-small intestine circuit, put the bio transducer over the autonomic system at where you can access it at the tooth, watch it spin backwards and in the correct way and now when you go back and check all of the circuits you've corrected the polarity in every circuit and many of the emotions that you had found out in the bio field are already gone as well. So, unfortunately I don't have the time to talk to you about how we're wired up with polarity and how our bodies are golden mean and how implosion occurs. If you're interested in those subjects, then we have some videos that will help you in that area, plus we will be giving some demonstration if there are any of you in the audience who happen to have any emotion, anybody here? We'll be doing some demonstrations in the breakout room. So what I've hoped to accomplish in these few minutes I had to talk with you is to help you understand that the body is an electronic device which has a multiple battery packs and the chronic disease occurs when those battery packs won't hold a charge and that getting well involves you identifying which battery packs are failing, you identifying the reason that they're failing you and fixing that so that it's basically, what we're doing is like you coming home from work and opening the fridge and it's hot in there and the lamp in the living room won't turn on, the TV in the bedroom won't turn on, and you go out in the garage and flip the circuit breaker--now everything works. Well that's the way we do medicine now. As we figure out which circuit breaker is out, go fix it, turn you back on and let your body heal itself which it does very well if it has the voltage, the nutrients and deal with the toxins. Thank you for allowing me to be here! 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info Recent scientific reports highlight increased scientific interest in a long enduring mystery on the Moon. For well over half a century, scientists on Earth have puzzled over the cause of occasional mysterious flashes of light seen on the lunar surface, or what is called Transient Lunar Phenomena. Reports on the nature of these light episodes range from a temporary increase in the brightness of a surface, to an apparent reddening of a surface with no accompanying brightness, to other odd color changes such as blue, green or violet, and even an unaccounted darkening of the lunar surface. In fact, reports of these mysterious light events on the Moon date back at least over 1,000 years. But for several decades, many astronomers were highly skeptical of the phenomena's existence. That is largely because the Moon has long been believed to be long geologically dead and no dramatic activity should be seen today. But in recent years, statistical analyses have indicated that the phenomena overwhelmingly seem to be genuine. Yet, there remains no consensus scientific theory on the underlying mechanism. To date, most astronomers have believed the phenomena either involves meteoritic explosions or outgassing. However, some mainstream astronomers have also entertained that the phenomenon is electrical in nature. As stated in a recent Phys.org report, "Such flashes could also occur when electrically charged particles of the solar wind react with moon dust." Recently, a team of scientists from the JMU University in Bavaria, Germany, began operating a privately built lunar telescope to try to gain a better understanding of Transient Lunar Phenomena. The images the team obtains will be compared with those of the European Space Agency and may provide insights into the cause of the mysterious lights and flashes. From the Electric Universe perspective, Transient Lunar Phenomena may be important both in terms of the Moon and our solar system's current electrical environment, but also the stupendous electrical events that may have shaped the Moon's surface. Today, planetary scientists do acknowledge that dramatic electrostatic events occur on the Moon, even as the result of the Moon's interaction with our own planet. As noted by NASA scientist Tim Stubbs, "Earth's magnetotail extends well beyond the orbit of the moon and, once a month, the moon orbits through it. This can have consequences ranging from lunar 'dust storms' to electrostatic discharges." In recent years, scientists have also entertained that subsurface electrical sparking in permanently shadowed regions may cause the breakdown of lunar soil. Nevertheless, the outgassing hypothesis remains the preferred explanation among astronomers for Transient Lunar Phenomena. But there are several important clues that point to the phenomena's electrical nature. If the light episodes are indeed a form of electrical arcing, then we expect to see them most commonly in high points of terrain, which electric arcs are always drawn to. In fact, many transient lunar phenomena are associated with the edges of so called lunar maria which planetary scientists believe are the sites of ancient volcanism. But an analog to the lunar phenomena may be the bright plume seen flaring on comet nuclei, which comet scientists also routinely interpret as "outgassing". Consider this close-up image of the comet 67P, taken on July 3rd, 2016. The plume appeared suddenly when the comet was over 500 million km from the Sun, a distance at which the sublimation of water ice is not expected at all. The lead author of a paper on the phenomenon stated, "We saw a bright plume of dust blowing away from the surface like a fountain... It lasted for roughly an hour, producing around 18 kg of dust every second." The team admitted they had no idea what could have powered the plume. The ESA website stated, "Initially, scientists thought that the plume might have been surface ice evaporating in the sunlight. However, Rosetta's measurements showed there had to be something more energetic going on to fling that amount of dust into space." The Electric Universe has always proposed that comet activity is fundamentally electrical discharge activity caused as the comet moves through plasma regions of varying electrical potential. Again, it is not a coincidence that the plumes seen in this image appear to be focused at the edge of a pit or crater which we do expect if it's a form of electrical arcing. Another aspect of Transient Lunar Phenomena is the extraordinary events that shaped the surface of the Moon itself. For many decades, the Electric Universe has proposed that the massive cratering on the Moon was caused not by meteoritic impacts over eons of time but by high-energy electrical discharge in an epoch of planetary instability in the inner solar system. In fact, as far back as the mid 1960s, the amateur astronomer Brian J. Ford performed plasma discharge experiments which reproduced the rate of highly circular crater formation seen on the Moon. In the 1970s, the engineer Ralph Juergens performed a rigorous analysis which showed that the lunar rills, which consistently show no internal debris from collapsed lava tubes, which are improbably wide at up to 7 km, and which routinely become narrower at their so-called outflow ends, are not collapsed lava tubes as standard theory has proposed for decades, but they are the features of electrical discharge. The notion of the Moon as an electrically scarred body was the basis for an outrageous prediction offered by one of the great heretics of the 20th century, Dr. Immanuel Velikovsky. Well before the Apollo space missions, Velikovsky predicted the discovery of remanent magnetization of moon rocks, a required lingering effect of tremendous "lightning bolts" from space. To the astonishment of planetary scientists, the prediction was confirmed. As stated in the 1971 paper, 'Determining the origins of lunar remanent crustal magnetism,' "The discovery of lunar magnetic fields of crustal origin was a major scientific surprise of the Apollo program." The electrical origins of lunar geology enables us to make predictions for the ongoing study of lunar transient phenomena. Since the Moon has no atmosphere, we expect electrical discharges to be diffuse with the glow seen over large areas. However, bright flashes will typically occur at high points due to a sudden concentration of electrical discharge, which we see on earth in the form of St. Elmo's fire. The pinched up rims of craters, the craters' central peaks, and any high points of terrain, will be the consistent locations of bright transient flashes. The scarring events that formed these features appear to make them ideal lightning rods for much smaller scale electrical activity today. Like every other body in the solar system, the Moon is subject to the electrical input of the Sun. In fact, in recent years astronomical papers have proposed that the interactions of protons from the solar wind with silicas in the lunar soil may be the source of the surprising abundance of lunar water, and electrostatic dust levitation on the Moon as well as many other airless bodies in space is now routinely acknowledged in astronomical literature. So it is with great confidence, we predict that future scientific investigations into transient lunar phenomena will point not toward outgassing nor any other conventional geological process, but rather, they will continue to affirm the electrical nature of the phenomena which predominate the solar system and the universe as a whole. 
[Music] [Music] today uh my the title of my program Mars the great desert is somewhat ambiguous I'm going to pretty much follow on with wall and discuss what exactly happened to Mars and what the evidence is that it was an electrical event so we can start by saying that Mars is about six thousand seven hundred and ninety three kilometers in diameter which is about half that of Earth today it's average temperature is 63 minus 63 Celsius compared to earth a thirteen Celsius and the atmospheric density on Mars is equivalent to standing on top of a mountain six times taller than Mount Everest or 1-800 that of Earth at sea level now in August 12 2005 NASA launched the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter on a two-year mission to map the Martian surface and since then it's been refunded every year after several months of flight it entered orbit on Mars on March 10 2006 now there are several instruments on board the satellite but the one I'm going to be discussing today in particular is the high resolution imaging science experiment camera otherwise known as high rise high rises a half metre telescope in other words doesn't meet a mirror but a half metre in diameter and it's capable of resolving objects as small as 30 centimeters from 300 kilometres up in orbit it's from that camera that most of these images are taken this initial image of course is not taken from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter this is an image from the Mars Express which is a mission that was launched a few years prior by the European Space Agency now Martian air iographer as well mentioned tells a story of incredibly violent events it appears from the minute many images sent to earth from high rise that it once experienced powerful plasma discharges on a massive Gail and Wahl Illustrated that by showing the barred spiral galaxy shape on Valles Marineris as terrain mapping instruments indicate that's the Mars orbital laser altimeter or otherwise known as mola the northern latitudes of Mars are six kilometers below the mean elevation of the planet so a great deal of material was removed from the northern hemisphere of Mars and then subsequently redeposited in the southern hemisphere burned and blasted craters piles of scorched dust covering almost an entire hemisphere and great trenches that went across its scarred face lead to the conclusion that lightning thousands or millions of times more powerful than we know today devastated Mars Mars our modern science has retained the longed-for hope desire long hoped for desire that Mars could be the cradle of different life forms and involving in a different ecology it's often speculated as well mentioned that the planet must have gone through a stage where there were oceans of liquid water there's a lot of disagreement in the scientific community about such weather such volumes of water could have ever existed on Mars surprisingly in conventional science there's disagreement in the March 5th 2000 edition of 2007 edition of Scientific American it was reported that most of what has been interpreted as water based erosion on Mars could have come from quote dry avalanches of dirt the authors expressed serious doubts about whether observations have demonstrated any effects caused by liquid water Allan Tremaine is one of the major geologists from Houston's lunar and planetary instrum Institute and he wrote the idea of it being liquid water was a very reasonable hypothesis to start with but from my standpoint liquid will acquit water hasn't been proven at all now the large-scale structure of Mars with its continent-wide Canyon gigantic volcanoes and monstrous fish this is the tractus container region on Mars I know you probably can't see the scale bar down at the bottom but this area is approximately 10,000 square kilometers so that is a very large structure right there now when an electric current passes over a solid body it can erode material from it or deposit material on its surface where an arc makes contact the pits are craters left by electric arcs are usually elongated circles because the arcs strike at right right angles to the surface while they move and material in the bottom of a crater or a trench such as tractus gatina will probably be electrically heated burned and melted if the surface is positively charged arcs tend to stick in one place resulting in increased melting while the electro dynamic forces lift the surface to form what's called a lightning blister or a Fulgham aiight fog lights appear as domes and pedestal craters on Mars and the largest scale example of a Fulgham aiight is probably the gigantic structure called olympus mons on Mars what's erroneously called the largest volcano in the solar system if the surface is negatively charged electric arcs tend to move rapidly after striking and carving out a crater small craters on the rims of larger ones are signs of this effect sometimes as electric arcs travel they cut chains of craters and tractus Catina as you can plainly see is a long chain of craters of a varying proximity the huge Canyon at the bottom of the screen is you I don't know if you can see it clearly from where you are but it has little points at periodic intervals matched by little points on each side of the on the other side of the canyon rim and that indicates that these are elongated circles budding against each other so actually the tractus Catina region representing ten thousand square kilometres are is composed of chains of craters NASA scientists often refer to what they find on Mars as mysterious or puzzling with long years of research and contemplation ahead of them the reason for the confusion is the problem of reverse application earth should not be used to explain the solar system the read geological patterns found elsewhere deserve alternative viewpoints so you can kill the spot here's a closer view of tractus Catina you can see at the bottom where those points are located there you know right in this area here and they go along the structure and along the rim as well in various places you can see what most of us are referring to as dendritic ridges dendritic ridges because these are electrical formations are most likely fulgurites or scars left by lightning bolts embedded in the walls after the electric arc has removed and material from the bottom and you can see that the bottoms of this trench as well as the bottoms of the craters are scoured clean there is very little of anything in the bottoms and on the sides of the crater walls indeed there are also foger i'ts embedded in them as I said tractus Katinas a huge structure I think the only other one larger would be Valles Marineris and some of its tributaries like Kandor casma well Mars has very unusual features as well and besides tractus Catina and some of them are what planetary scientists refer to as dunes now these dunes are unusual in the fact that they don't move and as we get closer to this structure here you can see that this particular dune is actually stuck to the side of a ridge and I don't know how a loosely conglomerated pile of sand is going to stick to the side of El but that's apparently what has in here obviously the material was melted and blown by anionic wind where it then reconsolidated stuck to the side and all these vast fields of dunes that you see on Mars in many cases have a crust on top of them and here one of the things that I'm going to point out that's important is that that like nilly Patera this area where the opportunity Rover was traveling near Victoria crater traveled through a field of what they're calling dunes for as far as the eye can see as you can tell here these are piles of hematite which in reality is iron oxide so and these white patches that you see in between the hematite and as you can see here these patches of white are in reality what they call a pavement of silicon dioxide so on Mars in vast areas are these piles of hematite on top of silicon dioxide so you have a conductor of iron on top of an insulator which is silicon dioxide that's what they form semi conductors on and as I mentioned this is near Victoria crater many people have probably seen pictures of that now this this is Becker el crater on Mars and this is the floor of Becker el crater one of the interesting things about the craters on Mars is first of all most of them are quite large Becker el crater is a hundred kilometers in diameter and it was supposedly created by the impact of an asteroid but if you look at crater impacts that are caused by asteroids you do not see this chaos on the bottom of the crater you see a relatively humpy looking or a scooped out formation but here you see complex structure and this is another one of those unusual aspects of Mars when I first saw this picture and by the way these are high camera pictures that are over seven is 700 megabytes in size so you're able to zoom in and result and look at images only a couple of meters in diameter so we're gonna go pretty close in this one I hope your eyes can keep up so here as we get closer eyes when I first saw this I thought these dark bands were layers of dust and in fact these are this is called layer ring by the planetary scientists due to wind erosion but as we get closer we see that these so-called layers are in reality pits that have been eaten into the surface and these pits form all the layers these are terrorists layers formed by these burned pits all that dark material is burned and scorched you see here that there are political structures there's little points on a lot of these mesas so-called mesas and these layers go on and on and on and on their so called layers and what this tells me and if you'll also notice that the bottoms of these depressions are clean and if you go even closer I can't go any closer for you because you would virtually have to cross your eyes to see the things as you get closer and closer but this whole region here is composed of fractured polygonal blocks the entire surface is fractured political blocks most of them are square now this is a photo micrograph the scale is 10 micron the scale bar is 10 microns right down there so this is an extremely small region and this is the surface of material that has been sputtered now sputtering is where you have a substance like aluminum and you want to deposit it on a substance that doesn't normally accept aluminum plating like a piece of plastic and you put that in a chamber a vacuum chamber you apply an electric car to the source material that converts it to a plasma and then the plasma deposits on the other charge surface which is the substrate plastic or some other material and as you can see the surface of the sputtered material is looks remarkably like some of the images that Monty showed of his a nodes from the sapphire experiment there are pits and cracks and other formations led that look like ridges and cliffs and craters with arcs runner with cracks running through them now this is an area on Mars called what is this area on Mars go yeah this was an unnamed area this is just a this is this has a number yes peeve underscore 0 to 100 underscores 20 to 50 so they didn't really they don't name this region but as you can see the remarkable similarity here between these two formations one is a hundred square kilometers here and this is 10 microns but the the features are virtually identical you see the branching burned scars the pits the features that look like cliffs and ridges and you know it's virtually indistinguishable if this were presented to you in black and white side by side with a 10 micron scale bar to that other image you would be hard-pressed to determine which was which now one of the reasons I mentioned the vast fields of hematite and the insulating substrate like silicon dioxide is that I'm going to discuss a phenomenon in science called the Rosen's vegan stability now dr. ronald rosen veigue was from MIT and he conducted many experiments in ferro hydrodynamics now the Rosen's vegan stability is this is a quote from his book is a prominent example for a surface driven instant where the deformation of the surface is amplified by an external generalized force in this case electricity the normal magnetic field and finally settles at a spatial pattern so what's happened is because this conductive material is sitting on an on a insulating substrate when exposed to electric currents it acts like a magnetic fluid because it's it's ultrafine dust so it acts like a magnetic fluid and it's influenced by magnetic fields and there's his book Faro hydrodynamics probably looks weird with 3d glasses on here's another example of Ferro hydrodynamic pattern and once again this is a little bit larger it's 10 times larger than the other image this is a hundred microns still smaller than the width of a human hair so you're looking at Rosenzweig instabilities in a fluidized magnetic substance in this case it's iron oxide nanoparticles suspended in a viscous liquid now when the the rose's vegan stability occurs when a perpendicular magnetic field of whatever strength encounters a conductive medium now here corresponding to this this is an area on Mars called Kandor casma cantar chasm is quite large but it's a mere tributary to the Valles Marineris feature and as we get closer you start seeing some very interesting patterns forming here look at there there's roses vegans stabilities in the surface of Mars they're identical to that ferromagnetic fluid that we just saw they line up they travel there they're there everywhere on Mars they're often called spiders in some cases Martian spiders and they are an electromagnetic phenomenon this is due to the fact that the surface of Kandor casma is covered in the ultrafine hematite that makes up the vast fields of dunes that I showed you that opportunity crater or opportunity Rover is rolling through and this is candor casma oh yes candor casma the Valles Marineris tributary now here's another example of the Rosenzweig instability and this is on a ferrofluid now ferrofluid is once again a nano particle magnetic fluid magnetic fluid with iron oxide in a colloidal suspension when a perpendicular magnetic field is applied it forms a lattice and this is the Rosenzweig instability it settles into a common pattern and in this case there hexagons and one of the major things I'm going to discuss is hexagonal formations on Mars due to the Rosen's vegan stability acting on the fluid eyes dust because ultrafine dust if it's conductive it magnetically conductive will act like a fluid and you've probably all seen that by moving a magnet across iron filings they'll follow the magnet and flow just like the liquid so here this is an unnamed crater near ohm Olympus Mons there are so many craters that it's difficult for them to keep up I guess with names start naming them Bill and Jo so wall had or was it dawn had a slide that Mel and CJ ransom had created of an object Mellon's and CJ had created a circular formation blasted into the surface of a substrate with an electric arc now you see here here are circular formations blast it into a substrate with an electric arc and you'll notice the texture oops don't want to get too far ahead you'll notice this texture surrounding the entire region these are all once again blocks fractured blocks and they have an odd radial pattern extending out from the crater itself now look at this the entire crater wall and the fact the regions surrounding it it's as if this crater is is isn't separate from the surface surrounding it there's no real demarcation here it's just you have a flat surface and then suddenly you have a depression than another depression and another depression and in though on the wall are hexagons now in some cases you might see among the hexagons Pentagon's or squares and depending on the strength of the perpendicular magnetic field a lower strength field will create hexagons slightly higher will form Pentagon's and the highest fields will create squares this is a region called SETI Mensa and once again these formations are referred to as dunes by planetary scientists however if you look at them closely these are not dunes this is etched into the solid rock there's no tuning here this is all electrically excavated and it's highly organized as well it doesn't look so organized from this scale although you can start getting hints of it and as we get closer you can see that there are definite lines of demarcation between regions and here at the closest scale indeed what do we see here we see hexagons and if you could look even closer you can see that this whole region is composed of hexagonal patterns they're slightly elongated in some cases in other cases they're a little distorted because another hexagon has been I don't know what the word would be not blasted into it but if evaporating out the material is missing there some of it is gathered into concentrations on the edges of the formations and that's probably some of the hematite dust that was scoured out of the surface and then subsequently pinched together and left behind after the arts passed on but it's really amazing how much of this surface is hexagonal now we come to a crater in shepper le basin a lot of people have probably seen this one NASA advertised it quite heavily as proof of the layering the sedimentary layering on Mars because these concentric rings are supposed to be where a meteor impact blew out material how it did it in concentric rings I'll never know but the other thing that's odd is this is not a depression here in the middle this is a mound and if you look closely you can see that this has a spiral pattern and as dr. Wolfe I believe talked about spirals are very prevalent in nature and electricity creates spirals also once again you see the dunes but look here these are not dunes these are cuts in the surface they're not depression or piles of material these are where material has been definitely excavated away you can also see the rim of the crater I use the word crater advisedly I could say circular formation but that gets a little awkward everyone knows crater and you see here once again that these are this is not a depression in the center these are stacked terraces once again just like we saw in Kandor casma here you see a mound of scorch dust that's been obviously cut away somehow and then the ionic winds blew it off to one or other directions closer still you start saying oh look at this we've got hexagons on these ridges and you've got these little points too just like we're in tractus Catina so this tells me that this is a chain of hexagonal craters in some sort of circular formation how this could be created I have no clue and I don't think anyone really because no one has really experimented with electricity on a planetary scale I mean we don't know how electricity behaves at certain scales sure we can demonstrate effects in the laboratory and I can show you those photomicrographs and compared them to the macro scale but in reality we're only guessing when we talk about electricity at these enormous gales this is the closest image and it's plain that these are hexagonal formations and they circle the whole crater now here's another example of the Rosenzweig instability these are oh I don't know what the scale is on these but they're not very big this is about the size of a petri dish now the the horrors of the perpendicular magnetic field as you can see has done two things depending on the strength of the field it's created depressions on this side and mounds on this side and these mountains have these points in the middle and you'll often see on Mars and even in the desert southwest of the United States you'll see Mesa formations that have 45 degrees shoulders and then straight up will be a needle or a an angled block like in Monument Valley for example and I it's my contention that some of those are probably representative or frozen vegan stabilities because Rosenzweig for a theory says that you need a fluidized ferromagnetic material and indeed the desert Southwest is composed of iron largely it composed of iron oxides hematite and magnetite that's where we mined a lot of iron and we mined a lot of iron in some other areas but I won't get into those at this point now the reason I showed you this one is this is a region called Gore di dorsum and on Mars and once again you can see the political patterns as you get closer and closer this this was tentatively identified by planetary scientists as dried mud like you would see on a plane after a rain and it got saturated the mud would break up and curl up and form unusual formations but as we get closer here you can see that this is no way dried mud these are not cracks these are ridges separating these domains that exist side by side with one another now this was obviously a very strong electromagnetic field because the primary formation here is Square and these knife-edged ridges that outline each square are what are often referred to in modern geology is hot backs their their ridges that run for long distances and have a knife edge which and there are somewhat mysterious to geologists because erosion is supposed to be a blurring process of blurring and a rounding process sharp needle forms gradually erode down into blunt dome forms steep-sided valleys gradually erode down into wide Plains and sharp sharp River courses gradually erode down into lazy meanders but in reality when you look at the particularly the Southwest and some mountain ranges you see that without fail they are sharp and pointed now if erosion of wind and water is supposed to create blurring rounding flattening and these formations have supposedly been exposed to wind and water for 500 million years one would expect that they would no longer have sharp needle shapes however that doesn't seem to bother anyone once again here's another example of the Rosenzweig instability and this has created somewhat of a rosette pattern with ridges converging on a central depression here's another structure on Mars this is let's see this is in Utopia Planitia I believe or this yeah this is utopia planitia and once again you see that there's this rosette pattern embossed in the surface and surrounding it are all of these elongated channels they're supposedly once again caused by drying you know the surface was once wet and it's all dry but as you get closer just to ancillary to the rest of the slide you can see that these are trenches and in many regards they are also a chain of craters if we could get real close to some of these areas for example here you would see that this is a chain of craters and it also has a similar structure to what was a Gore di dorsum these names now we're gonna get closer still here and you can see once again here are the hexagons they're all over this region they're also in the background as well but as I mentioned it's very difficult to get close enough to see some of these structures without having without your highs crossing out of your head and on the bottom here you have ripples this is why I don't know these are also called dunes I guess there's just no other thing to call them and they are actually embossed in the rock you see here also that the region if I were to back up a little bit for a long longer view you see the region is relatively clean there aren't any fields of debris around here there's no blast debris starting with large boulders and the next thing out into smaller and smaller objects this had this once again has obviously been cut into the surface now you see here to some of these channels run right through the structure they're just like this this is almost like an area where the electric arcs that were carving this region suddenly stuck maybe there was an excess positive charge in this region so the arcs stuck briefly and maybe jumped around a few times with the end you can see here that there's almost a logarithmic spiral effect here it may have actually then drilled its way in toward the center before extinguishing I'm actually going a little faster than I thought oh there's the closest imaged yet yeah here are all the hexagons and there are some Pentagon's mixed in here as well but it's just remarkable to me that what is considerably nothing more than solid rock can be so affected by electric fields and then forming political patterns and what must have happened is that the material was somewhat vaporized or converted to a dust like state and then re-solidified after the arc was quenched this is another example of the Rosenzweig instability that people may have seen this is a ferrofluid and you can see that the cells are hexagonal and these points come out of each of them now this is an area called Utopia Planitia these regions this is supposed to be faulting this is all due to faulting and subsidence and what they call mass wasting which is the sliding of material down a slope and this is supposedly what caused all these ridges but if we get closer here you start seeing evidence that maybe mass wasting or faulting is not really responsible for this because you start seeing these areas of scorched dust and if this was faulting you would expect that a fault would occur right along here where the area's upraised but no these ridges run up and down and up and down and off to the side down in here is a huge depression filled with this black dust but the reason i'm Chive chose this image is because we're gonna look more closely at some of these so-called fault ridges I swear sometimes I think NASA doesn't even look at their own pictures because if you look at there you go this is not a fault don't they know geology here here again if I okay here I'm almost done here again we see that you've got some of these notches in the ridges these are not really Nachi but if you get even closer you see oh my goodness these are hexagons hexagons and pieces of hexagons the hundred and twenty degree angles are everywhere because of course that's what a hexagon is composed of is 120 degree angles and in fact on Mars 120 degree angles are everywhere you find them on earth too everywhere you go mountain ranges in particular seem to have ridges that meet at 120 degree angles I happened over here two people talking earlier about Shiprock New Mexico and indeed one of the things that I when I wrote my article about Shiprock there were there is a hundred and twenty degree lava dykes extending out that are knife-edged and stick out of the ground they call them lava dykes shift rock is supposed to be a pluton that was subsequently eroded the sedimentary rock was eroded leaving it exposed to the elements but once again it's all pointy it's not rounded and blurred and they mentioned that there are invisible lava dykes - that form hexagons around Shiprock so as we get even closer you can see that the hexagons become even more prominent you know it's almost like a sawtooth and I think this is as close as we get right here you can see here's a perfect example right here these are everywhere anywhere you see these long extended ridges you're going to find these hexagons notches in the top and this is due to the perpendicular magnetic field accompanying the electric arcs because electric arcs in hinge on the surface at right-angles well we had one more closer still you can it's just further evidence that these are hexagonal formations now here's an example of the hundred and twenty degree angle formation and a magnetic fluid this is what they call a heel a Shaw chamber it's got mag electromagnets surrounding it and this is a ferrofluid being exposed to a 100 kilohertz electric field so as it evolves you can see that definitely we're getting hundred and twenty degrees vertices here and we're starting to form the semblance of a hexagon and this is the effect of vertical of perpendicular magnetic fields on ferromagnetic substances and again here nature prefers spirals this is the Rosenzweig instability another example of the Rosenzweig instability is upcoming and this one will actually illustrate how the perpendicular magnetic field can take a nun consolidated substance like a geomagnetic powder geomagnetic ferromagnetic powder this is 1000 microns now you can see the instabilities beginning to form as the magnetic field strength increases it's actually pulling the magnetic particles into a hexagonal pattern and in many cases on Mars you'll find those sorts of structures and that's all I have [Music] [Applause] [Music] 
SYMBOLS OF AN ALIEN SKY Episode 4 THE ELECTRIC COMET - Best Evidence Presented by THE THUNDERBOLTS PROJECT™ What is a comet? To answer that question we've contrasted the common scientific view with new evidence that challenges that view. The new evidence directs our attention to the Electrical behavior of comets, almost entirely ignored through the course of the space age. Of course, theoretical issues will always arise when facts and interpretations are intermingled. But, when a theoretical interpretation masquerades as fact, that is a violation of the first principle of scientific investigation. For many decades, it's been held that a comet is a leftover from the primordial formative phase of the solar system. That phase is typically counted in billions of years, and more often than not, the comet theory will be stated as fact simply because the idea is popular in the scientific media. And so we read that... "Comets are often referred to as 'dirty snowballs'. They are left over from the formation of stars and planets billions of years ago". This popular message blurred a crucial distinction between what is known - the undisputed facts -  and a theoretical supposition. So, we're told a story ... "Comets are basically dusty snowballs which orbit the Sun. They are made of ices, such as water, carbon dioxide, ammonia and methane, mixed with dust. These materials came from the time when the solar system was formed". In this case, the faith in a theory is ironic, since no fact about comets has even remotely substantiated a comet's origins billions of years ago. And, there are dozens of reasons not to believe that idea. So, it's encouraging to see a sliver of doubt now creeping into official comet science. We see it, for example, in the science magazine Sky and Telescope: formation in the solar system about 4.6 billion years ago". 'Suspected'. That's a refreshing use of language actually describing the present situation. Always remember that today's textbook theory of comets arose prior to the space age. And where interpretations differ, the first reference should be the factual bedrock of comet science, not theoretical suppositions. With this in mind, we offer here a comparative analysis of two models: 1) the standard model; and 2) the electrical model. Both models are sufficiently explicit to invite a wide range of scientific tests where the inherent predictions of the two models can be readily compared to objective findings. Standard Model of Comets The standard model, largely unchanged since the 1950's, sees comets as a window to the formation of the solar system. Here these bodies are composed of the primeval matter from which the Sun and the planets formed, perhaps holding keys to the origins of life. A comet is a dirty chunk of ice, and it's visible displays are due to warming by the Sun, such that vaporized water ice and other volatiles erupt as jets from the surface. As we found in our first electric comet documentary, the standard model did not fare well in the course of the space age. Taken as a whole, the failure is confirmed by the direct testimony of leading comet investigators as they confronted a continuing stream of surprises. Together, these surprises add dramatic support for an alternative perspective - an electric model. Electric Model of Comets The electric model starts with the evident electric field of the Sun, a massive electric potential across the volume of the heliosphere. In this view, comets possess accumulated charge. And they move on distinctly elliptical orbits - that means, they periodically plunge through the Sun's electric field, and as they enter regions of different charge these bodies discharge electrically. To place this summary in it's historical context, the door must stay open to a new (and perhaps unsettling) truth about planetary history. When we observe planetary motions today, we see highly stable and predictable orbits, as if the planets had moved this way for a billion years. But, it has not always been so. Our confidence on this point comes from the consistency of global testimony. It seems that every culture on Earth preserved vivid memories of world altering catastrophe. And the agent most commonly cited is a comet. Irrespective of differences in language, the cultures describe a monstrous form attacking the world. And these descriptions consistently use the local words and symbols for a comet. Well, this is ground we've already covered, but we cannot afford to ignore a consistent and global human pattern, no matter how challenging to conventional opinion today. Converging human testimony from around the world assures us that Solar System's history was punctuated by episodes of instability and interplanetary violence. Comets, asteroids and meteors originated in the electrical excavation of surface material from planets and moons. As we've documented in earlier episodes of this series, the most notable players in these events were our two closest planetary neighbors today: the planet Venus and the planet Mars. For this reason, our reconsideration of comet theory requires that we address the worldwide memories of planetary upheaval. Comets are not what we've been taught. Yet, recent investigations of comets can take us directly to this extraordinary conclusion. Standard Model of Comets One of the most telling milestones in the history of comet science was the Deep Impact Mission to Comet Tempel 1. But, here is a remarkable dilemma. As occurred in all prior visits to comets, no appreciable water ice was seen on the surface of this active comet. From the first disclosures of dry cometary surfaces, theorists speculated that such surfaces simply hid the icy, watery content beneath the surface. Then, in response to solar warming, subsurface pockets of water vapor formed, exploding through the crust to create the observed jets. Of course, the envisioned rupture of the surface would expose the presumed ice below. But, as occurred in all visits to comets, no detection of Tempel 1 subsurface ice was ever reported. Nevertheless, mission scientists tell us that infrared readings did detect substantial water ice in the ejecta cloud. "Though ice was not observed on the surface in the impact region, strong absorptions near 3 µm (micrometer) due to water ice are detected in IR measurements of the ejecta from the impact event." The enigma deserves investigation. What happened at the surface and below the surface at the moment of impact? Most NASA scientists interpreted the fast-moving cloud as vaporized silicates. The cloud was self-luminous at an estimated 1000º to 2000º Kelvin, and the low angle of the impact and blast propelled ejecta downrange. The infrared readings of the ejecta occurred about 3 seconds after impact as the cloud came into the view of the infrared camera. These readings show what NASA scientists describe as a narrow beam of water. This water column was easily distinguished from the rapidly moving dust cloud and was very close to vertical directly over the impact site. That's a bizarre contrast to the trajectory of the dust cloud. "The highly collimated water ice-rich component corresponds to a low-velocity, high-angle (i.e., near vertical), ejecta cloud above the impact." How did a vertical column of water get instantaneously separated from an explosion of dust, heated to over 1,000ºK and propelled downrange. The Electric Comet model offers an answer. The heated silicate cloud would be ionized (a plasma), a conductive pathway for an explosive electric discharge. The evidence indicates the discharge occurred between a negatively charged nucleus and a surrounding region of positive charge. An abundance of hydrogen ions gathered at, or close, to the surface of the nucleus would provide the necessary conditions for two things: first, an instantaneous electrical breakdown, or discharge, on impact; and second, an equally instantaneous electrochemical response to the discharge. Consider what is already known from laboratory experiments. In a condition of electrical breakdown hydrogen ions from the solar wind, combining with the oxygen and silicates can produce an abundance of hydroxyl, and/or water. This very process has been proposed to explain the enigmatic water on the planet Mercury. "...Oxygen-containing surface rocks could release water through sputtering by protons from the solar wind." The Electric Comet models suggest that the detected column of water directly over the impact site occurred along the path of an electric discharge, and that always means roughly perpendicular to the surface. Water created explosively, electrochemically, in the ejecta - even if no water lay beneath the dry surface of comet Tempel 1. This intriguing answer takes us deeper into the infrared readings. The conventional model predicted that comet water ice would contain substantial quantities of dust. This dust content would be expected to show up as refractory particles in the ice of the collimated ejecta plume. But amazingly, the ice particles themselves were free of dust. "These pristine materials consist of very fine grained (~1 ± 1 µm) water ice particles, which are free from refractory impurities." It seems the instruments measured virgin water, water freshly formed, as one would expect from the instantaneous electrochemistry of water production from hydrated silicates. This very point is emphasized in a recent analysis by Dr. Franklin Anariba, a specialist in electrochemistry at the Singapore University of Technology and Design. "Data from the infrared readings of the impact ejecta suggest that the explosive event may have triggered electrochemical production of water along an electric discharge pathway directly over the impact site." Allow this possibility into discussions of comet science, in particular, the unsolved mysteries of missing water and water creation by comets, and the picture changes dramatically. "The question that must be asked is whether the water detected in infrared readings of the Deep Impact ejecta was the byproduct of electrochemical reactions..." "...driven by a potential difference between the comet and the solar flux: vaporized silicates transacting with a concentration of hydrogen ions from the Sun, localized on or around the nucleus." When we follow this possibility, the missing water on the surface of Temple 1 becomes an affirmation of the Electric Comet model.   Thunderbolts.info

During the Middle Ages in Italy, a popular entertainment was from troops of traveling actors presenting what they called commedia dell'arte, the comedy of the artists. They were satirical sketches based on broad character types and they are the predecessors of modern situation comedies. The heroes of these plays were the naive good-hearted lovers, the country bumpkins and the wily street smart trickster servants. The villains of these plays were the greedy Venetian merchants, the bravado-speaking, Spanish captain, and the bombastic "Il Dottore". They were all regional stereotypes and they were making fun of the Venetian merchants or the Spanish soldiers or the university professors. Il Dottore was from Bologna and he received his doctorate there, which the university of Bologna, famously founded in the 11th century, awarded only doctorates to its graduates, and in those plays Il Dottore would sound out long bombastic gobbledygooky explanations of minutiae. And it was a grand form of comedy and again, a predecessor of our modern American suspicions and skepticism about intellectuals who have spent too much time in their ivory towers and lost touch with reality. So today we call such people full of baloney, and that's where that expression comes from. And I think what's a big part, for me, of the excitement of what we're exploring here with our review and with the Electric Universe is, coming out of that realm of baloney, back down to more grounded natural philosophy observation-based, experience-based natural science that has a higher regard for a little bit more of common sense. So we've heard about mythology, it seems absurd. You know, as Dave has suggested, we've seen the efforts, the Il Dottores of the modern era, right, presenting their bombastic arguments to uphold a theory that doesn't seem to be tethered to reality. So, we're going to continue exploring how we tether some of these wild ideas to something tangible and concrete and the best way to get into that is with the man who has spent his time in engineering, electrical engineering, and the study of astrophysics, so we're going to conclude tonight with Don Scott, bring him on the stage. Good evening! As my wife Annis told you, I've been coming to these meetings for many years now and several years ago, we had at one of our meetings a professional astronomer who stood up on his hind legs and said: yes, yes, yes, we know there's electricity in the sky but it doesn't do anything! Well, I'm here tonight to tell you that it does and I would like to explain a few ways that, I think at least, that it does do stuff, do things that are very very important and have been historically important to Earth and to just about every other object in the cosmos. So, if we can begin, this was really the first proof, really, I hate to use that word but substantive indication that electricity does indeed flow in the sky. Kristian Birkeland was a Norwegian scientist-explorer. He went out under the Northern Lights on the northern slopes of Norway and tried to take data that would show that his theory, and his theory was that those Northern Lights, the Aurora Borealis and of course the Aurora Australis as well, are electrical in nature. And he maintained that there were electrical currents, the charged particles coming through the sky and going down into, this picture shows Earth right there, that's the little blue dot of Carl Sagan fame. And you can see there that in the magnetosphere there are these, what I call lily-shaped cusps, and Birkeland claimed that the charges would come across from the Sun and then pair down into the two cusps at the two poles. And well, he was dogged for years by astronomers who said that was insane. One of them famously was asked one time, did Birkeland's ideas or his theories have any effect on your work? And Sidney Chapman said no, of course not. They were all wrong! Well, it turns out that after we were able to send rocket probes up into the ionosphere just after World War II, we found those currents and they're there. Nowadays, astronomers will be willing to call the currents that do come down into those cusps -- Birkeland currents, as they should be, and when I talk about it, I talk about that as a Birkeland current as well. They don't like to do that. They talk about flux ropes and other sort of airy-fairy descriptions, they are beginning to try to not talk about the word Birkeland. The Birkeland currents, and you can see there at the bottom of that lotus funnel, that they are squeezed together. They do come in sheaths, that is to say concentric sheaths of current and current goes both ways on those sheaths. At the very bottom, of course, is the Aurora and the classic astronomy people... I put the word Birkeland current on there, but you notice on the diagram itself, that I got from one of the astronomy sites, doesn't have the word Birkeland at all. If you look carefully, it talks about Peterson currents down there. Just earlier this year, in 2014, there was an announcement that galaxies actually are formed on strings, delicate strings. Well, I maintain that those strings are electrical currents and these electrical currents have been found by radio telescopes, I'm consulting my notes, at 326 megahertz between the Coma Cluster and the Abel 1367 cluster, these long strings of Birkeland currents do indeed exist and they have been calculated, because of the strength of the surrounding magnetic fields, that those currents have a magnitude of somewhere in the order, get ready for this, of 1019 amperes. We're talking big currents and they do indeed exist and they do connect stars within galaxies and they do connect galaxies in intergalactic space. The currents that we see and can take pictures of, sometimes they're quite jagged, sometimes they're quite, quite beautiful. That looks like a ballerina to me but it's maybe because there've been too many glasses of wine, I don't know. But other times they're quite straight, quite regular. There's an example of a very, I think, a very regular current. I wouldn't call it a Birkeland current because many people disagree with me, one of my best friends disagrees with me. I think that a Birkeland current is different from a force-free current. Force-free current in space is a current that is going along undisturbed, but any current anywhere will create a magnetic field. And so, that current in space will create a magnetic field through which it itself has to pass. And if it does that, there's guaranteed, there's going to be a force called a Lorentz Force, which depends on the cross-product between the current density and the direction of the magnetic field. And if there is a force, it's like you know, kids in a school bus, you're trying to get them down to the party or the lake or the convention or whatever you are taking them, and they're fighting and boisterous, and eventually if the bus driver is good enough, you'll get them to shut up and sit down in the back and keep quiet. That's the way I think of one of these Birkeland currents. A force- free Birkeland current is one in which the internal stresses and strains and forces and pushes and pulls have been yielded to. In nature, you know, we always hear this thing about water flows downhill, water will seek, things will go to a lower level if you let them. Well, that's what's happening, in my opinion, in these cosmic currents that are left alone. They reduce themselves to a force-free minimum energy, not zero energy, because obviously there is current in that, this is far from a force-free current by the way, because it's a very powerful Birkeland current really. But eventually, it will settle down to that force-free state. I should say that the force-free current consists of the current density and the magnetic field. The magnetic field and the current are in the same direction. So, if I speak of the current, I'm talking about the magnetic field and vice versa. What's happening here in that you can see that twisted helix. There is a magnetic field component that's axial that goes in the same direction as the current and one that wraps around. And after doing some studying on that, I came up with a model. Unfortunately, the model that I came up with and I was very proud of, I just found out a couple of days ago, was already derived by another gentleman whose name was Stig Lundqvist. Stig Lundqvist, I think, was a friend of Hannes Alfven in Sweden, and he derived this model for the force-free current. He called it a Birkeland current. What you're seeing here, it's not, it's very complicated looking, but the red line, the big one, is the power, the force, the strength of the magnetic field that is in line with the direction of the current. The second curve, and I don't know if you can see it, it sort of peaks out here. It's a greenish one. Forget the third curve, it doesn't mean anything, but that second curve is the strength of the wraparound magnetic field. So, out of all that complex up-and-down, what do I want you to remember? What I'd like you to remember is that where the red curve, that is the strength of the magnetic field along in the direction of the current, it goes through a zero, see it right there, if I can hold my old shaky hand steady, this is zero there of that magnetic field in the direction of the current. At that point, the wraparound field is at, or pretty close to its maximum. The first one isn't quite exactly on, but the rest of them are. When the red curve goes through zero, the green curve is at either a positive or negative maximum. So what does that mean? Well, I got a couple of pictures here that try to show you what it means. The blue field colors, the field-colored arrows are the magnetic field as a function of, if we back off away from from the axis of the current, so the first picture there is what the magnetic field looks like right down on this, on the axis, right on this. It's almost in the center of the Birkeland current. It's straight. There is no wraparound field. Remember in that picture, the red thing is way up, the red curve is way at the top, but the wraparound field hasn't gotten started yet. Well, if you pull it back a little bit away, pull back a little farther, like to step number two there, you can see that the wraparound component has begun to be seen, the straight component is getting weaker, and eventually you get to a point, well, somewhere between shot three and shot four, where the only magnetic field you have is a wraparound. In fact, what happens and I won't bother with a further detail of that, well, unless... That's sort of, I don't know if that gives you a feeling of the wrapping that happens. The, as you're close to the axis, the magnetic field is in the direction of the current and then it begins to twist and it begins to come back this way and eventually will go back that way and in fact it will wrap in all directions around the current, main current stream, much like a Roman fasci. The old Roman fasci, the fascist symbol. You take a bunch of reeds that are in by themselves very breakable, very, very tender, very bendable, and if you push them all together and then wrap them with leather in a spiral, and then, when you get up, wrap them back the other way in leather and then wrap them this way in leather and then wrap them back the other way in leather, eventually if you do this enough times, you get something that's as strong as a steel beam. That, I maintain, it makes sense to me at least, is one of the reasons why we do indeed see these cosmic currents, they're called stellar jets that are in almost an absolute straight line and last collimated, they don't spray out like a garden hose, but they last for well, there's the one out of M86 is five thousand light years long. And it's just a plain stream of electrical current in space. So, that is the picture of, at these very, what should I say, discrete radii. And those numbers there are just arbitrary. But it gives you a feeling for the fact that the first one out, the one that happens at 33, the radius of it is 33, is a clockwise spin. Then you go out to the next one, it's counterclockwise. And you go out to the next one, it's clockwise. Then counterclockwise, then clockwise. So, that wrapping, I won't bore you with the details of it, but it's, what I think, is one of the most important properties of the force-free current. There is no, in these force-free currents, there is no matter concentration, you don't get what you see in the Birkeland current there, those double sheaths as they came down into the North Pole of the Earth. That doesn't happen here and even my critical good friend and I think, we'll say the same thing, there is no matter separation, no matter concentration in a force-free current. But, what can give you matter concentration is the so-called famous magnetic pinch or z-pinch. There is also a different type of the z-pinches, a theta-pinch as well. And what happens, you can see there, the blue is the go-around type of magnetic field, the red is supposedly the current. If the magnetic field gets stronger, it's like tightening your belt. It squeezes. It squeezes it and squeezes it. And eventually, if it squeezes it so far, there is liable to be a reaction. And the, that is a very famous picture, if you've been here before at all. I'm sure you've probably seen me or somebody, Wal or someone put that on there. The image on the left is a real astronomical image. It's the Ant Nebula. It's well known. The middle one, I think you'll recognize, is essentially an indication that what I'm telling you is not fairytales. That this pinch effect really does happen and if you, what was done in the laboratory is to put a tremendously high current pulse down through that conducting aluminum can, and the current going down made a wraparound magnetic field which squeezed the can. And that's exactly, you can do it with a stream of water from the kitchen faucet as well. If you pass a current down through the water, you can actually squeeze the stream. Let me tell you what I see in here and maybe it's like looking at that and seeing that ballerina earlier. I hope it isn't, I think it's real. What I see when I look at this picture of the ant nebula is, I see one of these currents and I see that here at the upper end of it, the current, the plasma is not too visible. It's sort of been getting into the darkish mode where you don't see things. And as you should come closer to the center of it, as you come closer to the site of the the z-pinch, the plasma gets brighter and of course changes shape. And I think that that's exactly what, the mechanism that causes the ant nebula is the one that crushed the Pepsi can. So, it's a z-pinch on a cosmic current that does that. There's another diagram. It, sort of, shows it. The idea here is that, if the z-pinch is a relatively mild pinch, it can produce those magnetic field lines that actually hold and give stability to the current. Stronger z-pinches can initiate a discharge or a short circuit. Here's... Sorry, I'm a professor, I got to put a graph of something like this on the board every time I talk. What this is, is in a plasma. I'll pick a point. Go to that, I don't know whether that exit sign is a plasma or not, but go to the typical, you know, sign. It says, eat at Joe's, you know, go into that neon sign, go into the center of that tube and you're in the middle of a plasma. At every point in the middle of a plasma, there are really two important qualities. One is what's the electric field there. By that I mean, what is the force per unit charge. You've got a positive ion sitting there in the middle of this thing. What is the force on him? Is it a strong force, a high E-field, or is it a low force, a low E-field. That's .., pick a point, anywhere in the diagram. At the end of it, like  the letter “n” there, that says that the force on it, on a point in the plasma at that point is sort of medium. It's not way up here and it's not way down there. The other important quality or quantity associated with any point in a plasma is the current density. That says, in your neighborhood how many amps, how many amperes are going past you, how many amperes are going through every square meter, let's say. Every cross-sectional unit area. If you have a lot of amperes going through a plasma, and the plasma is very big, very wide, then that doesn't mean that the current density is very high, because if the cross-sectional area is big, well, then you can get a lot of amperes through there without squeezing. If the cross sectional area of the current is smaller, then of course the current density is higher. And so, you would take that point at the end and stick it over here, or over here. And there are really three main modes of operation of a plasma, (there is going to be an exam at the end of the week) OK. The dark mode, you can't see it. The ionosphere of the Earth is in dark mode. You know it's there because you can bounce radio signals off it, but it's not visible. Except in the aurora, when it jumps from being in the dark mode to being in the glow mode and it glows and you can actually see it. So the difference between a plasma in the dark mode and a plasma in the glow mode is one simply of current density. So if there's a lot of amps running through this thing, and at the bottom of that funnel you've really compressed that current cross-section of that cosmic current, and so the density, current density goes up. And I maintain that the center of one of these like the Ant Nebula have also gone and popped into the arc mode. And that's that bright star-like arc, maybe it is a star, maybe it is the beginning in the cosmos of a new star. I would like to say one thing. I don't know if there are any of SAFIRE people here or whatever, but I've heard people say, we've looked at this plasma and we don't see any arc in there at all. There's no arc discharges in there. A lot of people confuse the word arc. Arc has two meanings. One is a jagged lightning bolt, lightning bolt discharge. It's an arc discharge, that's true. But not all arcs are lightning bolts. If you look into the arc light of a motion picture projector (in a typical motion picture camera) a motion picture projector in the theater, you've got two electrodes that come together, and an arc is struck. You pull those electrodes apart and what you get is not anything that looks like a lightning bolt, which it looks like a sheet of flame. So arc discharges are arc discharges not because of their shape, the lightning bolt shape. They're arc discharges because of what they emit. And the one big difference between the arc discharge and the glow mode discharge is that the arc discharge, well you know if you've, anyone has done any electric arc welding, the copious amounts of ultraviolet. If you look at an arc welder, an arc welder is a perfect example. If you look at an electric arc welder between the tool and the workpiece, it’s not a lightning bolt. It's like a sheet of flame. The best arc welders look like gas welders. I mean, they look like flame. And so, you can't look at a plasma with the naked eye nor should you, if you think it's in a glow mode. Never look at it with your naked eye, you should use ultraviolet protection. And if you want to know if it's a plasma in ultraviolet, is it in the arc or glow mode, see if it's putting ultraviolet out. Anyway, end of that mini lecture. There's all sorts of things I can tell you about that diagram. Well, one of the interesting ones is number four down here, is there are certain parts of this diagram that have what's called a negative slope. These are positive slopes, they’re rising with increasing current density. But right in here is a negative slope and certainly in the arc mode, in the beginning of the arc mode, there's a negative slope. And that means if you're a particle in a plasma and you're sitting up here like right there over there where that arrow is, what are you sensing? What's at your point? The answer is, it's a reasonably high electric field. You're pretty high up on the axis here, but for the glow mode, you're not in particularly heavy current density. And you say to yourself, gee, I don't like to be pushed around, I don't like to have a force on me. Water flows downhill, right. So the plasma will say, I can reduce the pushing and pulling that I'm suffering by going down the chute, down to here. Well, how do I do that? Well, I move from left to right and go down, I reduce the electric field on me and I increase the current density. Are you going to do that? How is the plasma going to reduce its current density? Excuse me, increase its current density; It goes higher, right? It automatically, I shouldn't say it takes itself onto its own head because it doesn't have a head but it makes filaments. It says, why should I use my whole area here to go down when I can clamp down and make a filament here and a filament here and nothing in the middle? So, if you see a plasma in a place like this, you will expect if it's got a negative slope to it, that it will form filaments. And so, I submit to you that the reason that lightning bolts are jagged, what you call lightning bolts, is because they form filaments and there's a natural tendency to filament here. There's also a natural tendency to filament here at the breakdown between dark mode, where you don't see it, and glow mode. You know what is a perfect example of that? It's the outer regions of our Sun's corona. If you ever looked at a picture of the Sun in a solar eclipse, you see the corona is very bright around the Sun. The farther out you get in the corona, you see these striations, these fingers reach out and that's what's happening there. So, OK, that's a mini lecture on plasma. Why did I put you through that? Well, because I'd like to talk a little bit about what I think, at least, happens in one of these pinches. If you up the current, that's the red arrows, you will up the B-field going around and maybe you'll get a pinch. I'm suggesting as a sort of an ideal model that instead of crumpling it up like the Pepsi can crumpled up, let's say it just sort of crunches down and what you get from this point down to this point is a cone, OK, can you see it getting smaller? And then beyond the pinch point out here, you're getting a widening out cone, OK? So what's happening as the charges come in, as this current comes in here? It may well be in the dark mode if it's a minimum energy current, a force-free current, a field-aligned current, it may be very quiet, quiescent and be in dark mode, you might not see anything. Remember in the Ant Nebula out at the ends? You don't see anything. So, it may well be that that's dark mode plasma and as you get in, what happens at the beginning of the cone as the thing narrows down, as you squeeze that cross-section, you got the same amount of current. I mean, you can't have more current over here than you have over here. It's in a wire, the current's the same no matter where in the wire you measure it. So if you squeeze the wire down, it's same amount of current going through the squeeze point but you have a higher current density. And on that previous slide what happens when you increase the current density you pop the plasma from dark mode into glow mode and maybe into arc mode as you get farther and farther down that cone until finally right in the middle, I'm suggesting you get, if the thing works like a picture I'm going to show you in a minute, that is the arc, that is an arc mode discharge. And what happens is there's an arc mode discharge, more possibly glow mode discharge from both sides of this thing, this is this crimp point. And they look like, I tried to draw them in here in light blue, they look like a pair of umbrellas, umbrella shapes smooshed together. Sort of like you take two torpedo shapes and push them together so they smash in each other's nose. You see, there's one torpedo that goes around this way and the other torpedo or umbrella, more pacifistic than I am, umbrella shaped thing goes around that way. And the intersections of the discharges with the shells of conductive material are always at right angles. Electric fields always impinge on a conductor orthogonally, straight in. They don't come in this way, they come in straight down. And so if you notice I've tried to draw the blue curve orthogonal to the slope of the cone. You see that? So what will happen here is that the discharge, this curved discharge will move out toward the left. Why, because between this point and this point, the voltage is the same as it is between this point and this point and therefore the electric field between here and around this way is higher, is a stronger electric field than it would be if you move the discharge out to, let's say, around there. The discharge would still come in perpendicularly to the surface, OK, and you can say well, gee, why do you beat your gums about this, why is this so important? Well, it's so important because this is what happens in the z- pinch. This is the important mechanism by which we believe, I believe certainly, that stars are formed, and it's that crunch in the middle that... It's not an accretion disk. That across there, it may be a disc that surface looks like a circle, but it isn't an accretion disk. It's a z-pinch disc and it's, that's where the compression comes from. So, if you ask the typical astronomer, you know, what goes on in one of these pinches. They know they exist. You will get that as an answer. Um, I hope you folks in the back can see it. Do you see the labels on there? It says black hole, accretion disk, and magnetic field lines. There's no such thing as a magnetic field line just like there's no such thing as a line of constant altitude in a topographical map. It's a very convenient thing and it brings a lot of information to the people who use it, very useful, but it's not a real thing. You shouldn't reify it into meaning something real and astronomers have done that with magnetic field lines and when you, when they talk about reconnection of these field lines, it's like they really exist, you would grab this one over here and stick it over here and put them together. There's no such thing. It's like worrying about whether Pinocchio is going to have a fight with his brother. They don't exist. So anyway, there is a real one. That, I think, is one of Dave Talbott's favorite words is archetype and that is my archetype. That is the archetype z-pinch and I'll point out some of the things that are obvious and if you listen to me carefully, I haven't put you to sleep yet, you'll realize what I'm saying here. Look down to the way down to the lower left and way up to the upper right disappears. That's right, because the plasma there is in dark mode. But as you approach the pinch, as you start squeezing down on this, you pop that plasma, both ends of it into the glow mode. So the greenish things here, here, you can see. You get less of the black striae through it. The whole plasma goes into glow mode. Here there's like partially some of it's in glow and some is in dark mode. But eventually up in here, it all becomes glow mode. Also you see two sheets, there's one sheath here and an inner sheath. Remember that picture of the Birkeland current, is one sheath within another. That's the same thing that happens here and it happens on both sides. You can also see, I think, I hope, my two umbrella-shaped overlapping, umbrella-shaped what, paraboloids? Call them torpedoes crashing together, whatever. The middle business is sort of interesting too. This through here this thing, this thing, this thing, and this thing are called double layers. Double layers are a plasma phenomenon that happen under very heavy current conditions and in the center, this is typically of this kind of configuration the currents are the heaviest in the center and then in the outer shells, they're less and less and less. So anyway, here's another picture of, this is, if I had more time I would talk to you about the making of concentrated shells of material of what I claim and, my friend I'm sure will disagree with me, but what I claim is that if you squeeze this thing, this force-free, field aligned current, squeeze it down, what are you doing to it? You're increasing the current density. And if you increase the current density, it's the same thing really as not squeezing it but increasing the current. And if you do that, you can show, by Lorentz force rules, that matter will be moved from regions like this into regions like that. The black arrows and along the three o'clock horizontal plane show the directions in which matter will be moved. This matter concentration will not occur in a force- free current. But I suspect and I think it will in, if you squeeze that force- free current into a Birkeland current and we've seen pictures of the Birkeland current, so we know what they look like, you saw that picture of that, that last picture of the object was a Minkowski 2-9, I think, and that's a planetary nebula. The Minkowski is not the Minkowski of Minkowski space, it's another much younger guy who is an astronomer. In any event, that's what you'll get from the typical astronomer, OK. They refuse, absolutely refuse to use any electrical kind of voltage, electric field, current density... Whoo! They talk about bow shocks, ladder rungs, wineglass parabolas, hyperbolic arcs. How the parabolic arc changes into a hyperbolic arc? I don't know but I don't think anybody's measured that closely but... And close, of course, in the middle of the whole thing instead of my arc discharge, they've got a dust disc. They will not give up the accretion disk as a figment of their real imaginations. It's all garbage, none of it exists. It's all electrical and what you see back here may indeed be vortices but they're not hydrodynamic vortices, they're electrical vortices. So that's what you're going to get if you look up z-pinches from an astronomer. Here is just, I think one of the best examples of the fact that this thing really does work. Here is a current and it's suffering obviously multiple z-pinches, and when they discovered one of these, one of these objects, there  were two astronomers. Their names were Herbig and Haro. So, they got credit for this and they called objects and now there's more than one. Herbig-Haro objects. This is Herbig-Haro object number 111 and you can see that there are periodic z- pinches. Tony Peratt calls that 'the sausage instability' because they happen in a periodic way. Any electrical engineers who have studied electrical transmission lines, you know that there's pulses back and forth on the electrical transmission lines. They get out of control, you have northeast blackouts, every once in a while. There, I submit, is a perfect example of that. That thing is like a big transmission line and there are all sorts of pulses and when the pulses come up together, that's where the z-pinch happens and it happens periodically all the way down the jet. Here's a picture of that one and you can see, it actually moves and those, that set of pictures was taken between 1994 and 1998, that's how much it moved in four years. So when Dave Talbott first came up with this idea of a polar configuration, of a bunch of planets in a line, astronomers just about broke up laughing. That was so stupid that they could never imagine anybody would ever, ever think about a stable configuration of objects in a line, like planets on a shish- kebab, OK. There's the shish- kebab. It's real and you can see the one in the front is sort of getting a little bit expanded as it goes along but it does move and there are many more of these, so this is a bunch of, essentially, protostars in a row. All this points out is that this configuration is indeed stable and can exist. You don't need to have stars in circular orbits around the center star, a sun, whatever, in order to exist. This is another one and the number of that is HH34. I guess there's another one, they go on, there's many, many, many, many of these, and they all were looked at various scans set by astronomers when they were first discovered. If you go and ask NASA to describe this HH 111, that's what you're going to get. That is a NASA artist's conception of what Herbig Haro 111, this one right here. They think this is what this looks like, and of course it's got the accretion disk and it's got a dust torus, OK, nothing electrical. Anyway, there's, I can go on forever, now showing you these things that oh, 20 years ago were inconceivable. There are many of them in space now. There's just one constellation and that each one of those is labeled as a Herbig-Haro object. If you use a big scope on it, you'll see them, pin balls in a row. There's the best drawing that I've come upon that shows what happens at a z-pinch, at a normal z- pinch. If I were to draw this, I would draw this purple line continued down around the bottom of the blue and back up there, and that would be one of my umbrella-shaped surfaces. Do you see what I'm saying? This purple would come up over the top and then back down here. That's what I think happens, that's why that blue, central, almost spherical body, how it's formed. It's the overlap between those arcs, those discharges (in the Birkeland pinch), in the Z pinch. This is a picture sent back well, it's combination, I kind of cheated. Half of that picture was sent back by the IBEX mission. The IBEX mission is the Interstellar Boundary Explorer and they maintain pretty much that they have discovered certainly a spherical thing inside which our Sun, the little tiny dot in the middle, is center of, and it is a trail and they've taken pictures of the trail. Now, whether they've turned the camera around and looked for the other tail, which of course is the one down here, I don't know. So this one is, I cheated a little bit, I duplicated the upper half of this picture and turned it upside down and stuck it on the bottom because that's what I think happened. And I think, that will eventually be found, but so far IBEX has found only the top part. Now, Wal Thornhill and I are very good buddies and so I unabashedly stole from him that picture, which he made up and you can see, there's some differences but not a lot. If I were to draw this over again, I would make these, this thing come in more parabolically and out that way and I'd make this one come up around the top and come back down parabolically that way. We don't know where these areas here are but we know they exist. That's what IBEX has found. They found that there are heavy concentrations out in the plane of the solar system where electrons combine here with solar ions to form, what is it, excited, wanted to say right what is it, it's an excited nuclear atom. Neutral, yeah. I said that but where the e is what's bugging me, I think it's excited. Anyway, that's just like what happens in a plasma tube. In a plasma discharge, you've got an anode over here and a cathode over here and you got ions going one way and electrons going the other way. Think about that for a second. You're an ion, OK, and you're in the middle of this plasma discharge. Which way you're going to go? I'm going to head toward the cathode because that's negative and you're a positive. You want to go, negative and positive attract. You don't want to go to the anode, he's positive too, that repels you. So you go screaming down there, you're an ion, toward the cathode. What happens when you get to the cathode? There's a sign that says, no ions beyond this point. Because ions can't go in wires. Ions live and die inside the plasma tube. Electrons go in the wires, so if you have an electron that's going down this way, it'll go into the anode, into the wire and all the way around through the power supply to come back out the cathode again and get into the plasma tube. But the ion has to stop and when it stops it recombines with an electron and becomes neutral. That's what they found. A whole bunch of excited neutral atoms and they bunch up. And one of the investigators for the IBEX mission said, it's kind of like you pour maple syrup on your pancake. When you do that, it all, sort of, the maple syrup sort of piles up a little bit and then eventually oozes down over the size of the stack. And what we're seeing in these areas, and of course this and this are part of a circle. That's just the thing in cross-section, right. So what we're seeing here is a pileup of the maple syrup, but it works exactly like a plasma discharge tube. And anyway, Wal has also included here, these pictures are the pictures of the z-pinch and remember, David talked about the necklace with the points around here. This is an example of the filamentation process going on that the plasma is forming filaments. Individual filaments, not just a sheet of plasma. And so, this is what we think is going on or at least did go on when the Sun and the solar system, the original solar system which did not include Saturn, Earth, Mars, Venus, it included maybe Uranus and Neptune and maybe Jupiter but nobody knows really. But this is what forms a star. This is the process by which that star can form and it isn’t going to happen with accretion discs. This is what you used to hear from astronomers. They have since realized there is no such thing as a bow shock out there. What we just saw on the previous slide is pretty much, they don't admit it's electrical of course, but they admit the geometry is pretty much the same. The IBEX mission discovered, that's the IBEX ring. That's that ring of ENAs that are out there, that are piling up. It's an excited neutral atom surrounding the heliosphere, and as I said, this is very similar to what you see in a discharge tube. Exciting, that's moving, hot. Lots of motion to it. It's been banged around. It's not just placid. The standard description omits any discussion of a z-pinch. That's not far off. You see what happens, see how it comes down and what happens in the middle. They're getting the picture little by little, but of course it's not electrical. This suggests that our Sun's heliosphere may be formed by a similar z-pinch, that's what I just said, and there is, I took the liberty to draw in what I think those parabolic arcs should be, those two kissing Zeppelins or intersecting umbrellas... Just think of scaling this whole thing up. That's maybe the way our star, our Sun was made, maybe the way all suns are made. But could it be that, if you step it up, that's also the way those galaxies were made? And it could well be. I said, those galaxies were connected by strings, well... This is a picture of, you folks see this, the ghostly bubbles. The Electric Universe doesn't use words like mysterious, dark, ghostly. That's for NASA. These are the ghostly gamma rays and they were discovered by the Fermi gamma ray telescope and they exist there. I think may be too, I went through that thing too fast. I'm sort of proud of my superposition of the ghostly bubbles on top of that. It makes sense, it makes a great deal of sense. Just to finish up, there's the ghostly gamma rays on their own. That's an, we can't see our galaxy obviously, so that's an artist... You can't get outside of it to see what it looks like but that's probably pretty much what it looks like. Here's another thing that they are good at. What's the center of the Milky Way. Again, I'm not asking you guys to really believe this but I'm suggesting it maybe, could that be a z-pinch? On the upper-left, do you see the umbrella shape going out? I don't see anything on the lower right but if you listen to NASA or any of the astronomical organizations, they will tell you that at the center of our universe is a black hole. Well, I'm sorry guys, it does not look like a black hole to me. Besides, you can't see black holes, so how do they know? Anyway, this may be what is at the center. Is it suggestive of a pinch? I think it is, but anyway, it's not a black hole because you can't see black holes. This is a picture, I think, Dave used this as advertisement for this conference. This is a real image, taken in the direction of what we think is the center of the Milky Way galaxy. And NASA says that there is a great deal of evidence that just to the right of the the center of this, there's a supermassive black hole at the galactic center of the Milky Way, otherwise it couldn't have formed. You take your choice, I guess. But anyway, there's more to come in the next discussion. Thanks a lot! 
[Music] In the beginning, a long time ago and far, far away, there was nothing, which manifested a singularity, which exploded, and over millions and billions of years produced not only our vast material universe, but also life in the entire spectrum  of the non-material or spiritual realm. So goes the Big Bang theory, encapsulated in one  long sentence. Let me reply with first of all, there is no such thing as nothing. Never was and never could be, because you cannot get something from nothing. Nothing nothings as Heidegger said about nothingness not being able to do anything. Nothingness is just and only a conceptual marker, like zero used only for contrast and mental reference. To posit otherwise is reification; making something unreal into something real. A violation of rationality logic and reason, a breach of intellectual responsibility. Secondly, since we are all familiar with the concept of nothing, the average person should be able to realize that you cannot start creation with it. But a material singularity is an unknown, a more effective, yet an even worse reification and is nothing short of cosmological chicanery. This would seem to be why some cosmologist speculators are replacing nothing with inflation and quantum fluctuations. Is it not germane and crucial to understand why these dystopian concepts were ever devised  and gained traction in the scientific community? But more on that later.  So, what is a singularity? Is it not just a fabulous invention that can do whatever the theorist needs it to do? In the early days of modern science development, the new more rigorous approach needed to throw off the oppressive trammels of reality-defying religious dogma and sacred writings. And  rightfully so, to uncouple from all mythology. Of late, the marvelous James Webb Space Telescope is making waves in the astronomical and cosmological world of scientism. Some even characterize the effect as inspiring panic. ”Right now, I find myself lying awake at three in the morning” says Allison Kirkpatrick, an astronomer at the University of Kansas, ”...and  wondering if everything I've done is wrong.” Well, that's the call from this corner Professor Kirkpatrick. It's about time and it makes no difference if establishment cosmology pressures you enough to recant. The new exquisite graphic vistas are providing clear and extensive viewing of a vast volume of space, and bringing back images that are nothing like you would expect from a violent explosion and its implied expansion. Most people, including many astronomers and cosmologists, realize these images are not like more nebulous hypotheses. They should be increasingly unwilling to conclude that what they are seeing is a manifestation from their own ‘lying eyes’. Such good old clarity and vision may sometimes cut through unworthy hypotheses and false theory, especially when many of the theorists already have an uneasy feeling about the foundational assumptions underpinning the Big Bang. From my learning and perspective the premier astronomer to this point in time was Halton Arp who earned his PhD from  Caltech. For 29 years he did his stellar work at Palomar Observatory where he and his associated astronomers Geoffrey and Margaret Burbidge, and others, cataloged enough examples of highly redshifted quasars that were clearly in front of lower redshifted galaxies in the background. Of course, this is an unequivocal violation of expanding universe  theory. Being a respected and highly qualified astronomer in the 1970s, he went to the astronomical community, expecting them to see and address the Arp group's findings. They didn't want to hear it for reasons that should be obvious. Too drastic violation of established theory, too much controversy, too much damage to their standing and careers. Being patient, gracious and experienced, aware of the sordid history of scientific pioneers being treated as pariahs, like Galileo and Semmelweis, Arp felt this time it would be different. If he was patient and careful enough  to compile the group's findings in a composite and convincing way. Thus he authored and published the book ‘Quasars Redshifts and Controversies’ 1987, portraying and explaining why they  should listen. No deal. Still no response, except a growing distancing and alienation. Welcome  to the cruel dystopian world, Dr. Arp. After about ten patient years he got exercised and authored another book with a double entendre title, ’Seeing Red’, June 1997. ’Seeing Red’ was an obvious reflection of not only redshift, but of how he felt. When I met Arp at a June 1999 Symposium organized by the University of Milano, Bergamo  in Lombardy, Italy, we were fellow lecturers. I had my copy of ‘Quasar's, Redshifts and Controversies’ with me, in anticipation of getting it autographed. When we talked and he realized I was representing a group of admirers and supporters of his findings, he not only signed my copy, but gave me an autographed copy of ‘Seeing Red’. The Arp group developed a sterling case for a paradigm much superior to the Big Bang. They showed that certain unusual pregnant galaxies with Active Galactic Nuclei - some of which are called Seyfert Galaxies - evidently charge up and give birth to, expel from their cores, twin quasars in opposite directions. These expulsions are usually perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy These expelled highly redshift quasars slow in velocity over time, while losing redshift in quantized steps. They ultimately differentiate into new galaxies. Thus we have the growing Universe increasing in size, instead of a violently exploding or expanding one. This  of course is a much more orderly process, which is what is reflected and portrayed by the James Webb Telescope visuals. What these images show is an extensive array of stars and galaxies that are all connected by a three-dimensional web  of shining helical filaments. In the Electric Universe paradigm these are  the intergalactic and/or interstellar Birkeland currents that deliver power to these astral constructions. This was the vision and understanding of Nobel prize winning Hannes Alfven and his protege Anthony Peratt which they called the Plasma Universe. I should also mention that the Big Bang gravity-only-dominated theory, along with galactic revolution rotation problems, laid the foundation for the fantasy creations of dark matter and dark energy. Big Bang dark matter was always a huge enigma and dark energy was even more egregious. These both now have to be rejected  as well. But there are so many options for colorful, or should I say colorless, replacements. If dark ambrosia doesn't completely satisfy this penchant for ‘scientismic’ mysticism, I see all kinds of other options. We could have dark entropy, anti-momentum, dark volume, anti-charge, dark movement, anti-shape, dark time, anti-size, or some other esoteric combination that will quote ‘save the appearances’. I suspect there are six, six, six possibilities. You get the idea. When defenders of establishment cosmology have been braced by the accepted fact of plasma in space, the reply has been generally along the lines of “Yes, but it doesn't do anything.” Those of us who understand the validity of the Electric Universe paradigm and theory, are impatient to see all of these intellectually ungainly abstractions swept off the scientific cosmological table. There are many, including myself, who have never been able to fathom the universe with life and all that goes with being human, springing up spontaneously or developing from mere, non-living, non-intelligent matter. The universe is obviously infused with design and we are spiritual vessels with personality, intelligence, intellect, emotions, purpose, principles, values, and will. This would seem to demand an intelligent creator or designer with purpose as well. Given the deplorable human condition of struggling and suffering, culminating in death, it is an entirely different issue whether that agency is worthy to be worshiped, rather than feared, and thus called God, a term that is a contraction of ‘good’. Our world has around 4,000 different identifiable organized religions, in which I include the most dominant of them all now. Scientism. Scientism is the making of a dogmatic religion out of the pursuit of science or knowledge which, as we all know, has a sordid history of always resisting significant new truths that challenges the existing paradigm. The multiplicity of concepts of God in these various religions, many of which are ugly and alien to humane beings, have always violated our sensibility and idealism. Yet, many cling to these prevailing bad or anti-God paradigms like lichens cling to rock, as if their lives depend on it, which they clearly do not, given that we all age, decay and die, regardless of which of these religions we profess. Maybe this lack of intellectual responsibility and integrity is the problem. I am unaware of anyone in western science or religion who doesn't understand and accept that the very foundation of the physical universe is binary electric charge. This is manifested in negative electrons, positive protons, with neutrons that decay into these charged particles. The material universe is electric. Maybe someday soon more people can become reasonable, intellectually honest and responsible. And open-mindedly consider a much more elegant and beautiful vision, one that in both realms is based on the evidence of historical demonstration. A vision that we can one hundred percent go all-in for. [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info Today, we continue our exploration of the recent update shared by the team behind the groundbreaking scientific experiment, the SAFIRE project. As described in our recent interviews with physicist Wal Thornhill, the SAFIRE project is an independent audit of the Electric Sun model first proposed by engineer Ralph Juergens in the 1970s. As Thornhill noted, Thunderbolts colleague Dr. Donald Scott also extended Juergens' Electric Sun model through his recognition of what is called the PNP transistor action of anode tufts or photospheric granulations on the Sun, which were successfully reproduced in SAFIRE's phase one -- proof of concept. In this episode, Dr. Scott shares his thoughts on SAFIRE's most exciting results to date, including the evidence, that is produced, of low-energy nuclear transmutations. For over a hundred years now, since Eddington first dictated that he knew the answer how did the Sun make all its power and all that energy, where does it come from, it came from the fusion of hydrogen into helium. And they, everybody immediately sucked that up, because Einstein was in his glory at that time, the atomic nuclear chemistry was in the news and so yeah, that's and we got it, that's the way it is, stars make their energy from hydrogen to helium fusion. And then, some hundred years went by and nobody had questioned that until finally, I guess you know, we also realized that there has been 200 years of people looking at the Sun through spectroscopes. And we've managed to discover about 68 of the known chemicals, that is to say elements, on the Sun, in the Sun's atmosphere, they're there, they're in the Sun, where did they come from, if the Sun gets its energy from this hydrogen helium fusion? OK, I see where the hydrogen and helium came from, but where did the calcium and the manganese and the titanium and all the rest of it come from? And the standard answer is oh, it was made by explosions in novae stars, way up somewhere in our galaxy or even in other galaxies, and then those explosions blew it all over the place like, it's like fairy dust, fairy dust spreading through the cosmos and then it, that settled on our star. But that has nothing to do with our star, stars are only hydrogen and helium. What Monty did was not to falsify, I mean, I say Monty but of course, it's everybody on the team. But to simply give a real, we have done it here in our lab, not explanation but example that yes, you can form these other elements in a very, well, let's say non- hydrogen bomb kind of way, that is to say, you do it in the laboratory in a, yes, it requires something, this magnificent SAFIRE, but the only reason we need SAFIRE is because we can't duplicate the Sun in our own laboratories here on Earth, we'd burn the place up. So what we're trying to do is to model the Sun, we're trying to come up with example here in our lab of how the Sun works, and he's done a very good job and he's produced exactly what we see in the Sun. It is obvious now that those other elements are indeed made right in our Sun and very probably in all other stars, at least most other stars, and it is done not in the core of the Sun but on the surface. If you look at Monty's film, those other elements appear on the surface of the anode and it's done electrically through electric plasma, and I just think it's almost obvious that we don't need any more fairy tales about explosions of novae in Alpha Centauri. I did predict that, back in my, when I first wrote my book in 2006, I said that, "Whatever nuclear fusion is taking place on the Sun is likely occurring in the double- layer above the photosphere, not deep within the Sun's core. And the products of this fusion process are the metals that give rise to the absorption lines in the Sun's spectrum." And I think, Monty's work has certainly shown that that is very likely the answer, that's what's happening. The point is that it really isn't that important. It's not our purpose to disprove or falsify their answers, but SAFIRE has offered a very good reason why there are the other types of elements and even some molecules formed that are not from these novae explosions gazillion light-years away. Couple of observations I made when I looked at that film. You will notice there that Monty was very excited by, and I can see why, I am excited by it too -- he found in the very powerful scanning electron microscope photos, a sphere, and he found that at the highest  magnification he was able to get to, when they were looking and they found all these other calcium, sodium and all the rest of it in there, that had not started there but was formed there. Right down in the middle of this was a little sphere, and I'm not sure if they figured out what that sphere was yet, but the first thing that occurred to me was uh-huh, a sphere! Well, have we in the Electric Universe ever come upon anything like that? Well, what about C.J. Ransom and Wal's blueberries that they formed in C.J.'s lab? And we saw those, they're called "the Martian blueberries" for the reason that they were first discovered on the surface of the planet Mars, and as Monty pointed out, nobody knew or could figure out why these things were in such nice little spheres? So there they are, they found, it could be, at least I think they should further investigate is that, the genesis of these Martian blueberries in a process very much like this. The other thing that I did notice is, if you look very carefully at the image that Monty presents there, in that video, at those little spherules, you will see that the equator, if you will, is slightly raised and it looked like the last Space News with, who was it, Wal talking about Bennu and the other one and yeah, they have this strange shape, and there is this raised equator. Well, if you look very carefully at that little sphere that Monty found with his scanning microscope, that too has a raised equator, and so we're seeing when things begin to jibe like that, that begins to make you think gee, maybe we should see and think about why they're the same, what's going on there. That's all I really have to say about the video except to say that I think it's magnificent, I think the future does maybe hold jobs for the SAFIRE-like reactor, for the remediation of nuclear radiation from decaying atomic fuel, you know. As said, you don't have to bury it in there in Nevada someplace but can we make it, can we decontaminate the fuel by somehow treating it? It's all in the future and it's all possible and it's all wonderful. But the point is, I think, what we really should celebrate and be happy about is, that SAFIRE has definitely shown that we don't need these explosions on these far, far distant stars to explain how the fairy dust got spread through the cosmos. It's formed right there on the surface of our Sun. 
of course since I've been involved with the electric universe for eight more than eight years now which seems astonishing to me I've seen a lot of things change I've seen a lot of people come and a lot of people go and a lot of people stick around I've seen ideas develop I've seen old ideas grow into something that was never expected I've seen new ideas appear that seemed to challenge other well-established thinking in the electric universe community and people are not afraid to express that it all probably started when I was seven when my father explained to me what a Lightyear was and that whole idea that you could calculate distance based on time as a matter of fact the calculation of the distance in a Lightyear in miles was something I used to perform over and over again I would get the the length of the light year 5 trillion 865 billion 656 million miles one of the first ideas about numbers that ever came to me all those years ago so that sparked my interest in almost all fields of science not just mathematics but mostly what we would call the Natural Sciences I was really into hands-on experience and what I could actually conceived through my senses so I was given microscopes for my birthday and telescopes and other devices that I could use to explore the natural world and I'm grateful even to this day that my parents at least my father especially was able to recognize that interest in me and nurture it so eventually that led me to the discovery of Immanuel Velikovsky worlds in collision was given to me by a botany professor that I knew at the University of California Riverside I used to help him with his experiments he was doing an investigation into a viral cancer of the tobacco plant and doing sections and this and that me other so he could look at them through an electron microscope it was interesting being in the lab with him and seeing an electron microscope and and actually being able to experience what scientific research was all about when I was a teenager immanuel velikovsky worlds in collision then of course Earth an upheaval and the idea that even the very stones themselves cry out that you can look at various formations and features around the world and see that something happened to earth that is not the long slow gradualism the conventional geology teaches earth is the scene of tremendous devastation it's been carved up like a pumpkin we've got 30,000 foot mountain ranges if you consider Mon Aloha for example that's a 35,000 foot mountain in the Pacific Ocean twenty-nine thousand foot Mount Everest and then you have the the Challenger Deep at 35,000 feet below the surface of the ocean these are amazing structures that conventional geology can't adequately explain things that i would call fatal flaws and the theory that I've detailed in several pictures of the day as far as I'm concerned Immanuel Velikovsky 'he's research founded of course on people who came before him like Ignatius Donnelly and his concept of the great comet appearing in the sky and virtually devastating earth those two ideas I considered to be breakthrough concepts in my thinking that something other than conventional cosmogony was at work in the solar system and that I have not been exposed to or had not been exposed to up until that point so once that happened once that door opened of course that gave me insight into an I early new dimension of thinking about things like the electric son when I read Ralph Jergens article on the electric son in Velikovsky reconsidered published by ponse I was amazed that thermo nuclear theory was um was so inadequate when it came to the Sun the corona you know people just gloss over the problem of the corona they had being two million degrees hotter than the photosphere or the surface of the Sun nothing even still has been suggested as an adequate explanation over time once the internet came into things you know back in 1992 when I first got online before there were such things as search engines I started looking for information about Immanuel Velikovsky because I knew that a lot of this stuff had not been published in print and there must be an archive of it somewhere I thought that with this new emerging technology of the internet that somebody would put a database up someplace with velikovsky data it was until a few years later that I discovered the velikovsky archive and indeed wal Thornhill had a cd-rom available I don't know if people remember CD ROMs but he had a cd-rom available called the electric universe so I immediately purchased that in 1998 and began long correspondence with wall at that point then as I had begun writing to Dave Talbot as well as wal thornhill and in fact the three of us had correspondence about crater chains on the moon and other formations that were very anomalous as far as the solar system was concerned in fact I think at around that time in the late 90s the mid to late 90s all of us were starting to get involved in ideas about the anomalies in the solar system and velikovsky and what we're actually seeing as new spacecraft were being launched farther and farther into space and being with greater and greater resolution suddenly confirmation seemed to be everywhere you 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info Today, we continue our examination of arguably the most perplexing meteorite ever discovered on planet Earth. As science headlines have announced in recent weeks, the so-called Hypatia stone, a tiny rock fragment found in a Libyan desert glass field is "rattling" the solar system's status quo, challenging astronomers' fundamental ideas about our solar system's formation and history. In 2015, a number of research teams reported that the material could not be identified based on any known type of meteorite or comet. As reported by phys.org in January of 2018, new scientific research by a team at the University of Johannesburg has "...provided unsettling answers that spiral away from conventional views of the material our solar system was formed from." The matrix of minerals composing the Hypatia stone resembles no known meteorite or comet fragment and consists of strange and never-before-seen combinations of minerals. The dust material found in the fragments confounds the very core of the solar nebula hypothesis. As described by phys.org, "Generally, science says that our solar system's planets ultimately formed from a huge, ancient cloud of interstellar dust (the solar nebula) in space. The first part of that process would be much like dust bunnies coagulating in an unswept room. Science also holds that the solar nebula was homogeneous, that is, the same kind of dust everywhere. But Hypatia's chemistry tugs at this view." Scientists analyzing the fragments suggest they may be pieces of a deep space cometary intruder which impacted Earth around 29 million years ago. But it's essential to remember what we've actually observed when comets have encountered planets in modern times. On two occasions in recent decades, when astronomers have been able to anticipate close encounters between comets and planets, the electromagnetic effects have been exponentially greater than scientists had anticipated. When Shoemaker-Levy 9 reached Jupiter in 1994, the electromagnetic explosion and unprecedented brightening of the gas giant's radiation belts "knocked" the astronomical world off its feet. More recently, when comet Siding Spring approached Mars, NASA's MAVEN team was amazed when the comet "blew off" part of Mars's upper atmosphere and the electrical nature of these kinds of events is finally becoming a part of mainstream science literature. In 2017, a scientific study published in the Geophysical Research Letters proposed that the mysterious radiophonic sounds produced by some meteors may ultimately be caused by giant electric fields driving electric currents. In this episode, our guest, archaeologist Peter Mungo Jupp continues his case that the Hypatia stone's bizarre composition may have resulted from the transmutation of elements by high-energy electrical discharge. Although reference is made to the Hypatia stone's, positioning in the green glass fields of Libya, it's mainly assumed that this part of a disintegrating comet allied with the formation of the pebble. Why is not the green glass or a silicon unique as well? Further, the vast stretches of sand that make up the underlying component of both of these geological curios, are themselves relatively historic as judged by the Egyptian sources and petroglyphs strongly related to modern man. Now also, we've got to take into account the existence nearby of Oasis crater and Kibera crater. They may be well involved in producing these tektite-like formations. These could well be plasma discharge craters with electrical machining able to produce effects over a wide area. The newly discovered role of electrical discharge in producing not only shocked quartz, but in all probability shock diamonds, is not taken into account. A new study from the University of Pennsylvania reinforces this alternate, but I suspect, prime method of shocked rock creation. And I quote, "To bolster the notion that rocks were beat up in an extra-terrestrial impact, geologists search for a distinctive signature: that is microscopic bands in the mineral quartz, created when powerful pressure waves ripple through the rock. This study suggests that a different sort of shock can create the same banding patterns: that is a lightning bolt." The result of the study could cast further doubt on claims of asteroid impacts that relied on observations of shocked quartz." Now let's pause for a moment. This could even more apply to Anthony Peratt's historic plasma discharge events which are theorized to be millions of times more powerful than ordinary lightning. Mythology often talks of the cosmic thunderbolt. Could the Oasis crater be the result of such a strike? Does mythology provide us with examples from this area? In Greek mythology, such as Ovid's Metamorphoses, Phaethon set out but was entirely unable to control the Sun chariot's horses. They wandered too close to the Earth and began to scorch it. To prevent further damage, Zeus, or as we name, Jupiter, hurled a cosmic thunderbolt at Phaethon who fell to the earth at the mouth of the river Eridanus in the Red Sea. Such an archetypal scenario may often reveal historical clues to a geological disaster. Moreover, the role of electrical discharge in creating new elements and compounds, as per Matsumoto's studies of cold electrofusion, does not rate a mention. A cosmic electro-discharge or magnetic reversal, with its massive attendant current flow, has shattering power, particularly in the case of a major z-pinch effect occurring above or below the Earth. This could be a decisive factor in explaining the curious, so-called, cosmic mixture of compounds and elements found in the Hypatia stone. Finally, the noting of the rarer C-13 isotope of carbon as distinct from carbon-12, which is mainly found in crustal carbon deposits, assumes a cosmic origin for the carbon components of the pebble. However, deep earth layers of methane, kerogens, petroleum and concretized crack filling, as mentioned by Thomas Gold, are well sourced with much higher levels of C-13. So this may well be a simpler explanation for the source of this phenomenon. And I just note in passing the possibility of scenarios of cosmic naphtha or petroleum pervading the atmosphere mentioned in ancient historical sources such as the Talmud. It's also a clear possibility if we can rely on historical fact. Just remember, so often in science we reject the clear witnesses to events in ancient history not seen today. Can you imagine, an atmospheric invasion of volatile hydrocarbons well may be a source of diamonds when a plasma discharge enters it. So let's discuss some of the counters to the extra-terrestrial theory. The Hypatia stone differs from the normal chondritic meteorites due to dominance of carbon as distinct from silicon. It also contains compounds not normally found in Earth's source rocks. But could it, nevertheless, be an ejection from a faraway impact source similar to silicon based tektites? Tektites too are claimed to be produced by impacts that created tiny classically shaped rocks. These then travel long distances to be found in a few strewn fields around the world. But, remember, they're essentially made of material from the impact source. Could not the extraordinary conditions needed for tektite production be of a similar methodology? Remember, there are several different types of tektites, even if they are essentially silicon based. This presumption of a cosmic source for tektites, however, rests purely on the pebbles' relative uniqueness. However, I would advocate that a massive plasma discharge, rather than a conventional meteor impact, presents a more likely scenario for the eccentric creation of the Hypatia stone's rare combination of compounds. 
[Music] so we're talk a bit about the Earth's electrical environment in the history of scientific ideas there is a pattern of how new ideas emerge when we know very little about something we tend to think it is very simple in the 1800s biologists knew very little about the cells that make up our bodies and reading some of their papers about cells is very interesting one of the top naturalist of the time Haeckel claimed with great confidence that cells are uninteresting cells are just bags of undifferentiated plasma they are not worth anyone's attention and then slowly over years we discovered what was in cells and we learned that each cell of our body is very complex in fact a single cell in your body is just as complex as your entire body that's a truth that's very difficult for our logical minds to comprehend but it is true nonetheless and we are in a similar situation with regard to the electrical environments of planets and Suns not too long ago the average scientist would tell you there was not much between the earth and the Sun I recall as a boy being told about the vast vacuums of empty space and it never sat well with me that there should be nothing between the Earth and the Sun our five senses lead us to believe that a thing is simply what it looks like a colony looks like this to our eyes if our eyes could see x-rays the flower would look more like this here's what the Sun looks like in visible light now something very strange happens when you look at the Sun only through a single wavelength of red light this beautiful shaggy landscape of tendrils and clouds is slightly above the image we were looking at just before there's an outer skin of the Sun that we do not see with our eyes and if structure follows function which is basically a natural law then we're left wondering what function is played by this very particularly structured part of our Sun now our are there other skins other layers beyond this we see the next layer to the Sun when we look only at the more energetic wavelengths the hot wavelengths this is what the hot Sun looks like very different and all this extra activities taking place farther out from those first two images the Sun appears to get hotter and more energetic as we move away from the surface studying the Sun at different wavelengths of light is one of the most powerful tools we have for understanding the physics of the Sun I will get back to the Sun at the end of the talk for now let us turn our attention to the electrical environment of the earth I will show you some pictures based upon my attempts to understand the data but you must keep in mind that no one has a nice tidy picture that sums all of this up so it is fine if after this talk you are left with questions this talk is an investigation of the idea that the solar system is a giant electrical transformer electrical transformers on earth change the quality of electricity simple transformers raise and lower voltage very complicated transformers turn Envisat invisible radio signals back into music for our ears to hear and this talk proposes that energies coming from the Sun are absorbed and changed by the earth and the other planets there were a couple of surprises this year from two saddle lights that are orbiting the Earth and measuring the electrical properties around us the surprises came in what are called the Van Allen belts these are very high energy structures that surround the earth this is a picture looking down on the North Pole of the earth now around the earth is a ring or a doughnut you could imagine a very high-energy positive particles ions and protons and then there's a gap and then there's a larger ring of high-energy electrons now the recently these two satellites that are put into orbit go through these belts to measure the electrical properties now one point of contention about these structures and space is whether or not they are electrically neutral does this inner ring really have more positive charges in it a lot of people say no that structures in space cannot have an excess of charge for myself looking at the data returned from these satellites I think we see clear evidence of charge separation inside of these belts and I've come to realize that overall charge neutrality is not really the point a battery that you hold in your hand has no overall charge on it but that's not the point the point is we've separated the charges in the battery so it can do work our nervous systems maintain a small charge separation with respect to the rest of our bodies that carefully managed charge separation allows you to have thoughts and feelings and move around all day so whether or not these Van Allen belts are overall charge neutral is not really so important what is important is all the phenomena that result from charge separation now the jet propulsion laboratory is making all the data from these satellites available on their web sites someone here to do a one-year research project simply on the data coming back from these satellites so getting back to the discoveries the first two stars discovery was that the Van Allen belts can additional shells that appear and disappear this picture of two rings is what we thought completely described the Van Allen belts around the earth then during the first few months of collecting data a burst of energy came from the Sun and the belts very quickly turned into that an additional shell had appeared then a few days went by and they returned to that this was a beautiful surprise completely unexpected what does it mean not sure do we see behavior like this anywhere else in the world we see something like this in the electron orbits in atoms and molecules this is a picture of an atom a positive charge in the center and then clouds fast moving negative charges around the center if you add energy to an atom then a second discrete shell will appear around the atom this is the basis of the whole world of quantum mechanics the world of the very small changes in jumps in steps and now we have seen the exact same thing happens in a much larger realm around us the Van Allen belts they were too then some energy comes from the Sun and they are three and it's soon after that they're back to two again nature it seems is quantized both at the level of changes around atoms and changes around planets the second discovery was the detection of double layers inside these large belts the material up in the Van Allen belts is an electrical plasma it's not a gas like we breathe it's much finer and more rarefied like a fire and then the plasma electrical charges are free to move around the charges and plasmas are very sensitive slight changes in electric fields can cause huge changes in how the plasma is arranged and one common structure in plasma is walls double layers in which charges build up say positive charges on one side of the wall and then a gap and the negative charges on the other side of the wall I look at this sometimes as a way for plasma to store energy if the plasma is in an energetic environment it will form and destroy these double layers to store and release energy these double layers can also travel in packs they can be lined up one after another and be moving through space the satellites saw something like this so here's the earth the magnetic field lines of the earth going from north to south this is the region of the outer Van Allen belt and they saw the satellite saw in a few seconds thousands thousands of little double layers go zooming past it at a very high speed each one of the little layers being about 30 volts but there are thousands of them so when you add all that up it's about a million volt difference from one end to the other and this giant traveling million vote waterfall seems to be accelerating electrons up to nearly the speed of light so a picture in your mind coming from the Sun large quantities of charged matter but which are very low energies a small number of these charges enter the Earth's environment and are stepped up to extremely high voltages now this is exactly what an electrical transformer does it takes high current and low voltage and changes that to low current at high voltage outside this building there's an electrical transformer that takes the thirty thousand volts from the long-distance power lines and steps that down to the hundred and ten volts we need for our wall sockets humanity's entire electrical infrastructure is built upon this one idea of electrical transformers every city on earth is packed with thousands of a electrical transformers it makes one wonder to ponder that all of us are sitting on a giant cosmological electrical transformer we'll look at one more part of the Earth's electrical environment so picture is the Sun picture the earth orbiting around the Sun all the while the Sun is pushing out the solar wind streams and streams of charged particles going past the earth the earth has its own magnetic north and south poles and in addition to simply orbiting around the Sun the earth is also spinning this is the shadow side of the earth and when we are in there we call it night and then as our little portion of the earth spins into the light of the Sun we call that dawn sunrise now when you put all of this together you get millions of amperes of current that are constantly streaming down into the dawn side interacting with the earth in ways that we do not understand and then exiting back out on the sunset side in a very simple way new energy comes streaming down to all of us at the start of every day and then at the other end when the day is over all the results from the day are pulled back out and sent back to the solar system each day the activity from plants and animals all the killings and the birthings and the growths and the decays all that is somehow taken back up from the earth each day all human activity all that you have sought for and found achieved and failed at the end of the day it is pulled off and sent back to whence it came to fulfill uses that we cannot comprehend fascinating that the same flow has been seen around IO which is a moon of Jupiter IO also has million ampere currents that come streaming it's side of the of its side that is turning to face Jupiter and similarly currents being drawn off on the side of Io that's turning away from Jupiter this makes me think this phenomena might be an electrical feature of all planets and moons whenever a smaller body orbits a larger body we might see this sort of exchange this also will be a good topic for someone here to take on either from an experimental or a theoretical side now if you're like me right about now your head is really starting to hurt how do we put this all together we have an earth that looks like an atom with a positive Center and discrete shells of electrons surrounding it inside these shells are megavolt cascades of electrical double layers zooming between north and south pole accelerating electrons to nearly the speed of light we have mega ampere current streaming down on the dawn side and back out at dusk we're not in Kansas anymore with the earth surrounded by empty space we can no longer think the earth in the electrical environment is simple just the opposite we must admit that it is more complicated than we can think about so how do we think better about this when we see a part separated from the hole we often see only a collection of facts and if we continue to look at the parts without understanding the hole we usually come to wrong conclusions the world of genetics has recently had to admit that it had formed wrong conclusions we used to think that DNA would explain everything but it cannot because DNA is part of a larger whole and there are other parts in us that are deciding how and when to use the information in the DNA it takes a lot of effort to place things correctly together into a whole here's a drawing of the electrical potential between the earth and the Sun the Sun is at a higher electrical potential than the earth how do we know this well some people put up a satellite with a 70 meter boom arm to measure the electrical properties on either side of that 70 meter distance and when the boom arm was aligned one arm pointing towards the Sun and the other pointing towards the earth then they measured similar to those Van Allen belts a steady stream of double layers coming from the Sun going past the earth and each one of those layers was oriented in the same direction always going lower potential away from the Sun an image would be like a stream meandering down a hillside with all those little waves on the surface as you fall down from rock to rock each little fallen height represents a little bit of available energy between the Earth and the Sun there are a series of little discrete voltage drops and if you assume that the steps we see here that earth continued all the way back to the Sun then you get about 600 volts difference between the earth and the Sun and nature has yet again chosen to effect energy differences an energy transfer through a series of small steps there are it seems very few Niagara Falls in nature where the energy transition takes place in one giant step nature appears to prefer many small steps let us look at this again the earth is orbiting around the Sun downhill some seven of several hundred volts from the Sun it's orbiting a sixty thousand miles an hour through the solar wind the earth has concentric shells red and indicating elect negative blue positive charged particles from the Sun and the Earth's ionosphere combined inside of these shells these particles are accelerated to nearly the speed of light by million volt double layers flying back and forth between the Earth's North and South Poles some of that transformed energy comes zooming back down to earth in the North and the South Poles some of that energy continues back to the solar wind and then to connect to other planets to Mars or to Jupiter or maybe head out past the bounds of the solar system pondering this picture it is about the most complicated electrical transformer one could imagine recall us at the beginning of the talk that each cell in your body is just as complicated as your entire body well it's starting to look like our solar system may be that complicated we have focused on just the earth in this talk remember there are other planets each with unique electrical environments and therefore different transforming capabilities and let's not even talk about comets the solar system is a vast transforming apparatus if we did not know that previously it was only because we assumed the solar system must be simple and an uninteresting place mostly empty space now we are starting to know more and this little scratch of the surface absolutely pushes our powers of comprehension the Sun and the planets have electrical properties no scientists would disagree with that the real fights begin when you start discussing the importance of those electrical properties as one astrophysicist explained and asked exasperation okay there are electrical currents near the Sun but they're not doing anything now you may recall the Sun has dark spots on it sunspots about a hundred billion amperes of current are coming out of sunspots a single sunspot that much current would power every home in the United States now we live in a very economical universe and that hundred billion amps is not being wasted it is doing something the earth also has electrical properties no one would argue with that again the arguments come about how important it all is and perhaps the arguments are really about two things one set of fights is about whether or not there's any purpose to it all another set of fights is about whether or not we humans are the most important thing in the picture purpose is a very practical word we do not need to get into religious fights about it purpose is related to function inside your stomach there are cells whose function it is to manufacture and excrete acids for the practical purpose of digesting your food inside each plant there are many chlorophyll molecules whose function it is to begin the multi-step process of locking energy of sunlight into organic matter of fruits and vegetables in part for the practical purpose of keeping animals like you and me alive these are functions and purposes that are visible to our eyes so why looking at connections between the Earth and the Sun do we have such a difficult time seeing practical purposeful function so this leads to the second problem our tendency is to think that we are the most important thing in the universe if I'm the most important thing then how could there be a purpose that is bigger than me it is similar to the difficulty of accepting that the earth is not the center of the universe we are ok thinking that everything revolves around us but we get upset if someone tells us that we are orbiting around something so if someone suggests that between the Sun and the earth there are large scale processes of transformation in which we humans appear to play only a very small part well that is insulting to our exalted opinion of ourselves studying these larger connections studying how the earth digests and transforms solar energies might be insulting to me because these are functions that I serve those functions do not serve me but if we can overcome our self-importance we are poised now to understand the Earth's electrical environment in a way that will relate the part to the whole and seeing the part in relation to the whole is one definition of the word meaning so we are exploring a world of new meaning and that is very exciting thank you [Applause] [Music] [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info On this series, a clear picture of cosmic scale phenomena has emerged. Networks of filaments pervade space and are closely linked to the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies. The Electric Universe and Plasma Cosmology have always predicted that these filaments are in fact electrical Birkeland currents which light the stars and connect celestial bodies across vast cosmic distances. Recently, two separate teams of scientists, both of whom were attempting to resolve the so-called missing baryon problem, have published papers identifying vast intergalactic plasma filaments. In this episode, our guest Eugene Bagashov analyzes the significance of these independent findings. Eugene Bagashov: I would like to talk about two recently published papers discussing the large scale properties of cosmic plasma. What is interesting in this case is that both teams worked independently but ended up using the same methods and instruments. Somewhat encouraging is the fact that their conclusions are also very similar meaning that at least the technique is reproducible and, as far as the assumptions are correct, there have been no mistakes made in the process. Now that I've mentioned it, I personally have serious doubts about the assumptions themselves, so let us take a closer look at the picture presented by this research and see if we could make some alternative conclusions. The research addresses one of the key problems of observations of cosmic processes, the so-called missing baryon problem. It has been known for some time that if one considers the Big Bang cosmology, with its model for primordial nucleosynthesis, and at the same time look at the properties of the so-called Cosmic Microwave Background, one would get a figure for the matter content in the observable universe that is at least 30% too high with respect to the observations that is, if we directly sum up all the known mass content. I should note that this is not to be confused with dark matter problem that we've discussed in detail in some of the previous episodes. Dark matter was invented to solve the smaller scale problems with incorrect description of galactic rotation curves which roughly corresponds to spatial scales of 100,000 light years or so whereas in the case of missing baryons we're talking about intergalactic scales that are hundreds to thousands of times bigger. So in these two papers the researchers have tried to implement a new method of detection that potentially could solve the missing baryon problem capturing the yet unobserved fraction of matter and thus reconciling the observations with Big Bang hypothesis and hypothetical Cosmic Microwave Background. It is supposed in their work that one might observe the missing matter by looking for its emissions in consequence of the so-called Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. The effect is quite simple. Plainly put, when a low-energy photon encounters a high-energy charged particles, such as electron, it might interact with it and become more energetic. It is the so-called Inverse Compton scattering. So it is supposed that photons of the hypothesized Cosmic Microwave Background could also be scattered in such a way by the hot intergalactic plasma, thus increasing in energy and we might detect this more energetic signal on top of the supposed background radiation. Both research teams have devoted their efforts to looking for the electromagnetic signal of such sort. They've been looking at the data from Planck satellite in the frequency range from 30 to 857 gigahertz, that is microwave to far infrared range, for which the Planck research team have released the Compton scattering maps. They've compared these maps with the data from Sloan Digital Sky Survey to identify the actual sources of the signals received by Planck. The main attention was focused on the regions in-between galaxies where the contamination of the signal by the known sources, such as stars, is supposed to be minimal. The total sample used in the research included over a million of pairs of galaxies with average separation of about 30 million light-years. So what they found was a quite noticeable signal coming from the regions in-between galaxies. The authors conclude that these galaxies must be connected by the plasma filaments that are supposedly providing additional energy to the Cosmic Microwave Background photons, so in these areas we see a stronger signal from it. So the minimalistic conclusion that one might make from this research is that it confirms the existence of intergalactic plasma filaments which is of course no surprise from the Electric Universe perspective. The authors claim that the supposed density of those filaments is enough to solve the missing baryon problem in the standard cosmological scenario. Be that as it may, as I've noted before, for our purposes it might be productive to analyze the assumptions that have been made and see if their revision might provide additional insights. In order to do that, I would like to remember Pierre Marie Robitaille's work on Cosmic Microwave Background. In short, his independent research shows that the signal that is considered to be a Cosmic Microwave Background, might actually be generated by the Earth's oceans. These oceanic emissions are then scattered by the Earth's atmosphere and are thus apparently coming from all directions. The microwave background was also observed from low Earth orbit by COBE mission but, as Robitaille has shown, the signals received in this case resemble the ones that will be coming from Earth and undergoing diffraction on the edges of the horn-antennas. One has to remember that even at about 900 kilometers altitude, where the COBE satellite was positioned, the Earth still blocks more than the quarter of the whole celestial sphere. Planck satellite was positioned much farther than that, about 1.5 million kilometres from Earth, at the Lagrange L2 point. An independent analysis shows that it should detect virtually no microwaves from Earth, so there should be no Cosmic Microwave Background detected by Planck in Robitaille's theory. Contrary to that, the research team working on the Planck mission have claimed to have detected the microwave background signal. But Robitaille's analysis of the Planck's instrument layout seemed to indicate that its readings have been misinterpreted because of the flaws in the design of the reference loads onboard the satellite. These loads were supposed to be giving off thermal radiation at about 4 Kelvin temperature but because of the almost perfect heat conduction, allowed by the design of the instrument, the favorable way of transmitting heat and achieving thermal equilibrium was through conduction, not radiation, making the laws of thermal radiation inapplicable in this case. So according to Robitaille, Planck satellite reference loads were giving off near-zero thermal radiative signal and as the instrument was matching this near-zero signal to the signal received by the antenna pointed into space, which also yielded near-zero reading, the detector showed a good match and a strong output signal. I should note that there was another mission that supposedly observed Cosmic Microwave Background far from Earth. It was a Soviet experiment RELIKT-1 on board of the Prognoz 9 spacecraft. It had an apogee of about 700,000 kilometers from where it made observations of the background radiation as well as some other measurements. It would be interesting to hear Dr. Robitaille's comment on that. Anyway, if Robitaille's theory is correct, then of course Big Bang Theory loses one of its main arguments. Well, Big Bang contradicts all the known physics laws, namely the conservation laws and the causality, so it's not that big of a loss. But let us look at the findings outlined before, to see what the complete absence or at least the significant weakness of the Microwave Background would mean. First of all, the Compton scattering maps, used in aforementioned research, come from the combination of data from both the high frequency and low frequency instruments of the Planck satellite, and it was the low frequency instrument that supposedly detected the background signal in the first place. Now, let us imagine that we subtract this low frequency background signal from the map since, according to Robitaille's theory, it is false. This would leave us a lower near-zero background but the higher frequency part characteristic of the detected filaments would remain in place and become even stronger in comparison to the now lower baseline signal. It's as if one would look at Hawaiian mountain Mauna Kea after lowering the water line to the ocean floor level. The mountain would actually stand higher than the Mount Everest. Though if it is partly hidden by the so-to-speak background of the surrounding water, it would appear to be much less prominent as it does now. So if Robitaille is correct, their observations seem to show that the detected filaments are actually brighter than what would be expected otherwise. Now the question arises about the nature of the observed emissions. They might indeed be caused by the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect but now the initial low-energy photons would not come from a hypothetical remnant of the Big Bang but rather be produced by real objects such as dust, stars, galaxies and other plasma structures emitting electromagnetic waves over the whole spectral range. These emissions might not bear the thermal spectrum that is expected for the Cosmic Microwave Background in the Big Bang scenario. Moreover, if these background emissions would, on average, yield a lower photonic flux in the given range, then the model used by the authors would underestimate the density of the filaments and their temperature. There are other possibilities, of course. The registered photons might not result from some scattering process but actually be emitted by these plasma filaments themselves. In fact, in this case they could be subject to Regular, not Inverse, Compton effect and initially have a higher energy than that detected by Planck. They might give off some portion of their energy to the charged particles in the filaments and the colder surrounding plasma. This, of course, also leads to the conclusion that the detected filaments could be more dense and more energetic than what follows from the Big Bang interpretation. Then there is also a scenario in which these photons might be the result of the intergalactic currents that shape the filaments in the first place. The energy range of photons, that Planck was able to detect, corresponds to one milli-electron volts or so. So any of those photons could be emitted by an electron that was accelerated by one milli-volt of potential difference and here we assume that it has lost all of its energy to the outcoming photon. But in reality, this emission might represent only a tiny fraction of the electron energy. We don't really know any of that, and depending on the actual nature of the processes that lead to this emission, it might have very different directional distribution. The filaments described in the mentioned research are observed in the direction perpendicular to the line of sight. Maybe when observed head-on, looking into the filament like into a barrel of a gun, one would get completely different readings etc. Now the energy gained from the electric potential would also depend on the length of the acceleration path. So if one underestimates the filament density and thus overestimates the acceleration length, one would come with a smaller overall potential difference measure than otherwise. So, to conclude my notes on this subject, I would like to repeat two key points; Firstly, under any possible scenario, this research acknowledges the existence of intergalactic plasma filaments that make up a significant portion of the matter in the universe. And secondly, depending on the used assumptions, one might get dramatically different picture of the parameters of those filaments and draw different conclusions about the processes that take place in these regions. Outside the Big Bang framework, the filaments might demonstrate higher temperatures, higher plasma densities and significant electric current and potential values.

Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info The French author Marcel Proust once stated, "The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes but in having new eyes." In 2017, the journey of space discovery demands new eyes and indeed an entirely new way of perceiving our universe. In our own celestial neighborhood in our solar system no type of object consistently provokes greater surprise and perplexity than the comet. As we've reported in recent episodes, no reasonable debate can remain that the more than half century old dirty snowball hypothesis of comets is falsified. Every comet mission to date has refuted the consensus belief that comets are fluffy aggregates of ice and dust that condensed or accreted billions of years ago out in the "Siberia" of the solar system. Comet nuclei are not icy or snowy. They are desiccated, rocky bodies that appear virtually indistinguishable from asteroids. Comet activity, including powerful jets and the production of the cometary tail and coma, cannot be the result of sublimating volatiles and outgassing, a fact that only grows more evident with each new discovery. A new image released in the last week by the European Space Agency's Rosetta team underscores the desperate need for new theoretical pathways in comet science. Here we see one of the clearest, perhaps undeniable, images to date of an electrical discharge on a comet nucleus. The image was taken on July 3rd, 2016, by the Rosetta spacecraft at comet 67P. At the time, the comet was at a distance of about 500 million kilometers from the Sun, a distance at which astronomers do not expect sublimation of invisible hypothetical water ice. The lead author of a new scientific paper on the observation states, "We saw a bright plume of dust, blowing away from the surface like a fountain... It lasted for roughly an hour, producing around 18 kg of dust every second." The team admits they have no idea what mechanism could have actually powered the so-called plume. The ESA's website states, "Initially, scientists thought that the plume might have been surface ice evaporating in the sunlight. However, Rosetta's measurements showed there had to be something more energetic going on to fling that amount of dust into space." The lead author states, "Energy must have been released from beneath the surface to power it. There are evidently processes in comets that we do not yet fully understand." The understatement of this comment cannot be overemphasized. As we see in this side-by-side image comparison, the structure of the so-called plume has its ideal analog in the form of an electrical discharge in the laboratory. The electrical nature of this type of cometary phenomena has been self-evident since long before the Rosetta mission. In 2004, when the Stardust spacecraft arrived at the comet Wild 2, scientists were astonished by the comet's explosive jets some of which emanated from the dark unheated side of the asteroid-like nucleus. Principal investigator Donald Brownlee said in 2004, "We thought comet Wild 2 would be like a dirty, black, fluffy snowball. Instead, it was mind-boggling to see the diverse landscape in the first pictures from Stardust, including spires, pits and craters, which must be supported by a cohesive surface." Nothing in the behavior of the comet's jets fit investigators' expectations. Stardust investigator Dr. Benton Clark stated, "Another big surprise was the abundance and behavior of jets of particles shooting up from the comet's surface. We expected a couple of jets, but saw more than two dozen in the brief flyby." A June 17, 2004, NASA report described the conundrum, "The team predicted the jets would shoot up for a short distance, and then be dispersed into a halo around Wild 2. Instead, some super-speedy jets remained intact, like blasts of water from a powerful garden hose." Of course, a garden hose is a completely inappropriate analogy for such explosive jets in the "vacuum of space". As we've discussed in many recent episodes, astronomers have sometimes used the same terminology in their attempts to explain light-years long stellar and galactic jets. The question is, what mechanism confines the jets and prevents their dispersal? On 67P, the merging filaments within the collimated jets reveal a vital clue, as seen in the side-by-side comparison with a plasma discharge in the laboratory. Radio astronomers have now measured the electric currents in galactic jets which produce tremendous velocities and confine the jetted material up to many hundreds of thousands of light-years. If comet jets and plumes are also electrical discharge phenomena, as the Electric Universe model has always predicted, the mystery of the velocity and confinement of the jets is resolved. Another problem for comet scientists is that the hypothetical apertures, required for the collimation of material that is supposedly outgassed from a comet or the "nozzle" from which a hypothetical garden hose would release its stream, have not been seen on comet nuclei. This problem is acknowledged in the paper "Cometary Jet Collimation Without Physical Confinement" published in the 2012 fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union. It states, "Contemporary models postulate that these jets collimate when the expanding gases and dust pass through a physical aperture or nozzle. However, recent high-resolution spacecraft observations fail to detect such apertures on cometary surfaces. Recent high-resolution images of comet nuclei reveal that the gas and dust expelled by the comet is organized into narrow plumes or jets..." "Furthermore, these models do not explain why cometary jets appear to be directed normal to the local gravitational potential. This is especially puzzling because the jet velocity, typically 300 m/sec far from the comet, greatly exceeds the escape velocity of only about 1 m/sec." As we've also recently reported, it could not be more clear that dramatic comet activity has nothing to do with sublimating ices. Scientists using NASA's Hubble Telescope have detected unprecedented activity from the comet C/2017 K2 at a billion and a half miles from the Sun or 16 astronomical units (AU). Comet water-ice ceases to sublimate beyond just a few AU. The scientists can only propose that the comet must have been recently "gravitationally kicked out of the Oort cloud" and is therefore covered with pristine hyper-volatiles, surface ices of methane, carbon monoxide and/or nitrogen that might sublimate at such a distance. Such attempts to cling to discredited theory grow more disturbing with each new discovery. The electric theory of comets has successfully predicted the extraordinary geology of comet nuclei and the completely unexpected findings of comet activity at great varieties of distances from the Sun. The bright, so-called, plume on 67P can be seen as an electrical discharge resulting from an explosive redistribution of charge on the comet nucleus. Neither an imaginary reservoir of subsurface ice nor theoretical nozzles from which outgassing supposedly sprays like a garden hose will ever account for this type of remarkable cometary phenomena. The Rosetta mission and other spectacular voyages in space discovery represent remarkable technical achievements and yet, tragically, they are also enormous missed opportunities. Before seeking out new landscapes to explore comet scientist must see with new eyes which might perceive a self-evident truth, comets and the universe in which they exist are electric.

Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info New observations are again challenging astronomers' ideas about the so-called volcanoes on Jupiter's moon Io. For nearly 40 years astronomers have told us that Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system. In 1979 NASA's Voyager spacecraft offered scientists on Earth their first glimpse of mysterious structures jetting hundreds of kilometers above the moon's surface. A phenomenon astronomers interpreted as volcanic plumes. But that same year the world-renowned astrophysicist Thomas Gold proposed that the locations of the so-called volcanoes were instead the sites of powerful electrical discharges. Eight years later in 1987, plasma scientist Anthony Peratt and co-author Alex Dessler published the paper, "Filamentation of Volcanic Plumes on the Jovian Satellite Io". Peratt and Dessler argue that the filamentation and cross-sectional shape of the plumes are "consistent with theories developed from laboratory observation". Nevertheless, despite the contributions of Gold, Peratt and Dessler, planetary scientists have held to the theory that Io's mysterious plumes are the product of volcanism which is caused by Jupiter gravitationally squeezing the moon. But the problems with this theory have only continue to grow with better images and data from the Jovian system. NASA scientists have acknowledged their struggle to explain the plume structure as volcanic in nature. Concerning the so-called volcano Tvashtar, they state that "the knots and filaments that allow us to track the plume's motions are still mysterious." In recent years, the tidal heating model applied to Io's "volcanoes" has been directly falsified by additional discoveries. In 2013, a geologic survey found that the locations of the plumes were incompatible with the predictions of the tidal heating model. And now, scientists observing the so-called plume of the volcano Loki have encountered a new mystery. A New Scientist's report on the observation states, "over decades of study, observers have noticed a pattern. About every 540 days, a wave of brightness starts at one end of the lake of lava and pivots anti-clockwise like a windshield wiper. That front of warmer lava moves about one kilometer per day until the whole lake glows hot. Then the surface of Loki cools until the process starts again. But in 2002, right when we thought we had Loki pegged, those phases stopped. Then in 2009, according to recent work by Katherine de Kleer at the University of California Berkeley, they started again but are now moving clockwise. Appropriate behavior for a feature named after the Norse trickster god. However, anomalous movements of Io's so-called volcanic plumes is not a new problem for astronomers. When the Galileo probe arrived in the Jovian system in 1996, it revealed that the plume of the so-called volcano Prometheus had moved more than 80 kilometers since it was first imaged by the Voyager probe. This fulfilled one of several predictions that physicist and Electric Universe proponent Wal Thornhill had made prior to the Galileo mission. Thornhill also predicted that the so-called vents of the volcanic plumes would be much hotter than lava and that the plumes are in fact the jets of moving cathode arcs eroding the periphery of the dark areas that planetary geologists have been calling lava lakes. According to Thornhill, these so-called lava lakes are the solid dark surface of Io beneath the "snow that has been deposited by continuous discharge activity". Therefore the "lava lakes" would not reveal the expected heat of a recent lava flow. "snow that has been deposited by continuous discharge activity". Therefore the "lava lakes" would not reveal the expected heat of a recent lava flow. Each of these predictions received stunning confirmation. Io's volcanic hot spots were not only hotter than any lava on earth. They were too hot to be measured by Galileo's instruments. Also as predicted by Thornhill, the discharging is found to be focused on the edges of the so-called lava lakes though the rest of these dark fields are comparatively cool. In fact, the expected volcanic vents could not be found. Inspiring further astonishment among mission scientists, the "volcanic plumes" emit ultraviolet light. Something inconceivable under normal conditions of volcanic venting. But ultraviolet light is of course characteristic of an electric arc. Space scientists have come to depend on Io's volcanoes to account for the extraordinary electrical activity witnessed in Jupiter's atmosphere. Many claim that charged particles from Io's volcanoes are responsible for the Jovian Aurorans which are 1,000 times more intense than anything seen on Earth. In this scenario, the profuse electrical activity at Jupiter's poles, approximately 10 million Volts, is generated mechanically by the planet's spin. Ions from the "volcanoes" on Io are thought to travel to the planet's poles, then interact with the magnetic spin generated electricity, creating an extraordinary charge exchange, producing the auroras. The following NASA statement which quotes investigator Randy Gladstone reads, "the polar electric fields grab any charged particles they can find and slam them into the atmosphere. Particles for slamming can come from the sun but Jupiter has another more abundant source nearby: the volcanic moon Io which spews oxygen and sulfur ions into Jupiter's spinning magnetic field. Somehow these ions make their way to Jupiter's poles where electric fields send them hurtling toward the planet below. Upon entering the atmosphere, their electrons are first stripped away by molecules they run into but as they slow down they start grabbing electrons back. The charge exchange reaction produces intense X-ray auroras." This rationale arises from the assumption that Jupiter itself has no net charge. But since it is behaving like a charged body the scientists looked to localized mechanically induced charge separation as if an island in space, for some internal process, can acquire and dissipate electric charge. From the Electric Universe perspective, what is actually occurring is an electrical connection between the Sun, Jupiter and its moons. In recent years, discoveries have only supported this view. When scientists discovered the most prominent auroral trail or footprint of Io in the Jovian atmosphere, they assumed it must be an effect of charge separation generated by Io's volcanoes. However, this theory was undermined in 2005 when Hubble images of the Jovian aurora revealed a similar electrical footprint imprinted by the moon Europa with its own swirling plasma tail. A research team wrote of this discovery, "Europa is not thought to be volcanic, so what could produce the electrical current that zips along and eventually gives rise to Europa's auroral footprint? NASA investigators also found that the electrical exchange does not stop with Europa and also includes the moon Ganymede. As reported on this series, in recent years space scientists have slowly edged closer to recognizing significant electrical discharge activity on planets and moons. It's now known that once a month when the Earth's magnetotail passes over the Moon, the result is electrostatic dust storms and electrical discharges. And in the past year, scientists reported that a coronal mass ejection struck the planet Mars immediately before mysterious plumes were seen jetting hundreds of kilometers into the planet's upper atmosphere. A complete surprise to planetary scientists. The purely gravitational processes that astronomers still prefer have failed to explain Io's so called volcanoes. But today, the basis is clear for scientists to consider an alternative explanation in our electric universe.

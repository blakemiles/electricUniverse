Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info The groundbreaking field of Electric Universe geology is vibrant with new possibilities. Standard geology proposes that the primary forces that have shaped planetary surfaces are periodic impacts: volcanism and wind and water erosion over eons of time. But on every rocky body in the solar system, from our planet, all the way to the Kuiper belt, the objects we see show features that routinely defy this reasoning. The theoretical alternatives Electric Universe geology offers, recognizes processes well-known to electrical engineers and plasma physicists. In our solar system, we do observe these type of electrical phenomena on a different scale. In previous presentations, Thunderblog contributor, Andrew Hall has proposed that the extraordinary winds of the gas giant Jupiter, provide analogues for the high-energy events that may have shaped the Earth. Today, Andrew continues his remarkable presentation in the latest installment of his series, The Eye of the Storm. In previous articles, we established a link between the winds on Jupiter and landforms on Earth. In primordial times, Earth 's weather was like Jupiter's, with raging plasma, whirlwinds and segregated electric jet streams that attained supersonic speeds. Close examination of mountains and other landforms shows clear evidence of windblown deposition that layered the land. Supersonic shockwaves that shape mountain flanks, massive lightning discharges that welded rock, and plasma vortices that blow- torched the land. Jupiter's winds are the result of capacitance between double layers in the atmosphere and the plasma sheath at the planet's surface. We don't know what the surface of Jupiter is, but it doesn't matter - it still forms a plasma sheath, a double layer at the interface between crust and atmosphere. Electric circuits form the winds by capacitance, inductance and magnetic fields. Surface and atmosphere are coupled by capacitance and ongoing release of energy from Jupiter's interior is what stirs the winds. On Earth, dust particles, aerosols and the water cycle - evaporation, condensation, ice and rain - are the charge carriers, or the ”wires” of the circuit. On Jupiter, it also includes ammonia and other species. Regardless of the difference in chemistry between Earth and Jupiter, charge diffusion in Nature follows patterns. A lightning bolt on Jupiter is like a lightning bolt on Earth. It is a discharge between plasma layers that takes a fractal path as ionized filaments react in feedback with the magnetic field that current produces. Fractal forms are generated by this feedback loop in any process of charge diffusion. They're not restricted to the Lichtenberg pattern of a lightning bolt, but are evident in the helical path of field-aligned Birkeland currents, the geometry of electromagnetic fields, and the drift currents reacting to far-field potentials. So, it should be no surprise at all to find the same fractal patterns in Jupiter's winds as we find on Earth 's landscape, if indeed the landscape was formed by similar winds. One spade-shaped feature is almost ubiquitous in Jupiter's turbulence. I call it the boot print. On Jupiter, the boot print is the downdrafting eye of a cyclone being pinched in the turbulent flow of competing winds. Like a hurricane, it is fed by billowing thunderstorms surrounding a whirlpool, which together forms a piece of a circuit - a ring current between the atmosphere and ground. The shape of the cloud tops is carried to the surface and reflected there, because the structure is a fractal, rotating filament of current reaching the surface. When Earth's weather raged like Jupiter's, Earth was in its formative age. The continents were being built, as layer upon layer of dust accumulated on a foundation of volcanic flows. Turbulent cyclones in the Earth’s atmosphere produced boot prints, identical in form to the boot prints on Jupiter. Boot prints on Earth are literally, the footprints of storms. Boot prints on Earth are clear evidence of electric formation, because they display exactly what is expected in fine detail. The boot print is the consequence of a down-bursting wind - a hot ionized supersonic dust-laden wind, aimed at the ground like a blowtorch. The mountain rim is the pattern of a standing shockwave. The repeating triangular layers on the inner flanks are impressed there by harmonic shock reflections which channeled the wind at the boundary layer and trapped dust in the low-pressure zone in the triangular wave forms. Shock waves produce triangular patterns of expansion and compression when a supersonic wind is deflected, like when it hits solid land. Just ahead of where a shock wave reflects, a low-pressure region forms, called the ”Separation Bubble”. The separation bubble is in the shape of a tetrahedron, with the triangular face perpendicular to the wind at the same angle as the shock wave reflection, called the Mach angle. As dust-laden ionized winds pass through the separation bubble, this low-pressure region collects dust like a vacuum cleaner and piles it in triangular layers. Therefore, the rims or mountains surrounding a boot print crater, display these triangular layers. If a downburst wind strikes at an angle, rotates or its mass flow is biased to one side, it will affect the shape of the crater it forms. Boot prints are often accompanied by a feature called a Prandtl-Meyer expansion fan. It's a series of standing shockwaves that form linear rays of compression and rarefaction, where the wind strikes and reflects off an object. This pattern implies the boot print is the result of an obliquely striking wind that rotated. If you've ever watched tornadoes, you probably noticed they're rarely perfectly vertical. They contact the ground at an angle and the rotating wind is lifted to one side and grinds against the ground on the opposite side. That is precisely what has happened here to produce a boot print crater with an expansion fan. This single example is proof of my theory. Anyone with a supersonic wind tunnel can produce a Prandtl-Meyer expansion fan, tetrahedron- shaped separation bubbles, and triangular harmonic reflections. It's been done countless times. But show a way to produce all these together in a large-scale coherent form by tectonic uplift, seismic vibration, slip faulting, erosion or any other conventional geophysical means: can't be done. It is uniquely the result of supersonic shock. Nature provides rational, obvious proof, without need for computers or numeric models. The pattern is not vague, like Jesus on piece of toast. It is confirmed in every detail. The correlation is not only visual similarity, but also causation - vertical high-speed winds, electrically charged and shaped by electromagnetic fields. Proof of the winds of Jupiter are in NASA's data; proof of the ground effects on Earth or under our feet, and in decades of applied science and supersonic shock wave behavior. Proper interpretation of data and some wind tunnel testing would put the issue to bed. But maybe I can do that with this next example. California's most prominent feature is the San Joaquin Valley and its ring of mountains, including the imposing Sierra Nevada mountain arc and coastal ranges. Inside this bathtub, the floor of the valley is a long, flat plain, which at one time was an ancient sea bed. It was created by a storm like this on Jupiter. So let's look at some amazing details. In this image, I indicate four specific areas we'll discuss. Area 1 - the Mojave Desert. This almost perfectly triangular plane of high desert is demarcated by the straight line of the Tehachapi mountains to the north, and the straight line of the San Gabriel Mountains to the south, which also, by the way, aligns with the San Andreas Fault. It correlates to the region of low-level winds, tinted blue, at the cusp of the oval storm rotation on Jupiter. These winds are sinking winds, that is they are pressing against the ground in a venturi-effect as they speed around the cusp of the storm. The yellow-brown ring of this storm is a rising wind, forming what is essentially a continuous ring of thunderstorms. The sharp triangular demarcation between desert and mountain is the shear zone where shock waves form between the low- level horizontal winds and the rising winds of the rotating storm. As these winds rounded the corner into the Venturi, they accelerated, gouging the deep Owens, Saline, Amargosa and Death Valleys. Separating these valleys rise 11,000 foot ridgelines of the Panamint, Darwin and Amargosa ranges. They formed as sastrugi, parallel to the jet streams and low-pressure interference zones between the laminar jet streams. Lightning in this region was imposing. A plasma intensifies in a shear zone, meaning it generates ion content due to the shearing and extreme temperature and pressure differentials. Shearing supersonic winds bounce shockwaves between them, generating high-current density in jet-streams that extend for thousands of miles. Lightning discharge from these plasma streams focused on the piling mountains below with the capacity of a thousand mile-long thunderstorm, being continually fed new energy. The current dumped in the strike zone didn't simply flash a second here and there, but arced continuously, diffusing through the land, welding granite from dust and sand. That is why the Sierras in this portion of the range have the most impressive granite structures - Yosemite, Mt Whitney; its neighboring peaks and the Domes. The granite of the Sierras lies atop sediment, which implies the storm(s), either by wind or tsunami brought layers of dust long before lightning even began to strike. Area 2 – Coalinga. Coaling Station A was its original name. Coalinga, as it's called today, is an oil patch town. The foothills that surround it are oil fields - anticlines of shallow sandstone, saturated in heavy oil. Similar anticlines flank the western side of the San Joaquin Valley, from Coalinga to the end of the bathtub at Bakersfield. These anticlines compose some of the largest oil fields in North America. What created them was like this turbulent region in Jupiter's clouds. The colorized image from NASA shows a crab- claw cloud structure, with high-level clouds in yellow, and low-level clouds in blue and black. There are several tornado rotations along the boundaries of opposing flows. There are also deep, dark linear filaments. Now correlate the dark filaments with the deep-cut, linear valleys near Coalinga. The dark filaments are ground-level jet streams, which are what formed these valleys by preventing dust from depositing. Follow the filament in Jupiter's cloud and it ends in a tornado. Follow the valleys near Coalinga and they end in hills with spiral features. In other words, the filaments are jet streams hugging the ground, cutting beneath the storm clouds to feed a giant tornado. Fascinating, isn't it? Blue lines in the wind pattern image represent ground level winds, combining across the San Joaquin Valley, and rising into thunderstorms. Yellow represents the higher-level mesocyclone winds which rained dust and rock. The blue winds approach the thunderstorm orthogonally, then rise in the updraft of the storm. Dark blue lines are the tornadoes and ground-hugging jet streams. A drive through the region shows the mountains are windblown dunes that rise abruptly from the flat valley floor and display exactly the wind pattern as I describe. It seems chaotic - winds crisscrossing in every direction, but it's not. The overall wind structure is called a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. It's a fractal pattern that happens all the time if there's wind shear. Area 3 is the San Joaquin Valley. Look inside the yellow ring of thunderstorms and see that there are dozens of small vortices. These are tornadoes, or perhaps water spouts, because the San Joaquin Valley was likely a sea at the time. Among all the tiny whirlwinds is one giant tornado, almost at the center of the storm. This feature correlates well with a circular region in the Sierra Foothills at the north end of the San Joaquin Valley. If you've ever driven from Sacramento to Lake Tahoe on State Highway 50, past the town of Folsom, where I once lived, you have climbed the Sierra foothills that constitute this feature. A distinct swirl is evident in the hills just above, or to the east of Folsom Lake. The swirl is fed by ground-level winds entering the vortex from the left, or the south, whereas the top level winds in Jupiter's clouds flow in from below, or the west on the Earth image. This indicates differences in flow patterns between double layers due to the rotational symmetry of fractals. Fractal rotational symmetry is when a fractal shape repeats, but rotated by 90 or 180 degrees. This indicates the wind clocks around 90 degrees in different layers of the storm. The same thing occurs in hurricanes and mesocyclones on Earth, even today. Area 4 - San Francisco Bay. Here, you are literally seeing the drain in the bathtub. Follow the dark filaments in Jupiter's clouds and they converge in a vortex. Compare the dark filaments on Jupiter to the long linear valleys leading to San Francisco Bay and you see the same pattern. The dark filaments are ground-level jet streams that scoured the land, while the light-colored cloud tops are thunderstorm anvils, raining charged dust to form the mountains. Look close at Jupiter's clouds near the center of rotation and there is a dark X-shaped feature. Then compare the Sacramento Delta and you'll see the Delta is the top of the X. Again, it's because the dark filaments are ground-scouring winds, which in this case scour the land to a depth below current sea level. I hope these images provide unambiguous evidence of how the Earth was formed. Any one or two matching features between the clouds of Jupiter and Earth's landscape could be coincidence, but overlay Jupiter's oval storm on California and all seven features depicted here match in both shape and position. And the wind patterns not only look like, but explain the land features. At least they do, if you apply electric circuitry and ignore consensus science. There is a host of interesting things to learn by understanding California's true formation. For instance, a whirlwind-formed hill in Kern County is full of ancient shark's teeth fossils. These sharks date to the middle Miocene, roughly fifteen million years ago, by consensus chronology. Now, I don't trust consensus chronology, but it does place a bookmark in the fossil and geologic record. Oil sands in San Joaquin date from the Miocene and earlier, except for one shallow Pliocene sediment. The Miocene epoch that formed Shark Hill, was likely the last time such a mountain building storm raged over California. But the stratigraphy and the fossil record suggest there were many similar fractal storms in earlier epochs. Thank you! [Music]

Welcome to Space News from The Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info Standard geology tells us that the Earth and the life that inhabits it has changed incrementally over eons of time, for many millions of years. The process is thought to have shaped our planet's landscape, our wind and water erosion, volcanism, earthquakes and random bombardments from space. Of course, a guide that scientists use to determine when a life form existed and how it evolved is the fossil record. Conventional theory tells us that the process of fossilization takes no fewer than 10,000 years. But countless archaeological findings suggest a "radical alternative", that the remains of some animals and other organisms were fossilized not over eons of time but instantaneously. In part 1 of this two-part presentation, Australian archaeologist Peter Mungo Jupp will present his case for the instant petrification of organisms on Earth by powerful electrical discharges. Electric fossilization. Now, living plants and animals are petrified into solid rock in a violent paroxism of nature. Their ends... what, agonizing or instantaneous as witnessed by their contorted forms. Now let's look at some examples. Now, we go to Lesbos and there's huge trees turned to solid stone while they still point to the heavens. Giant squid-like shell ammonites glare up at us through translucent limestone rock where they lie entombed on a beach along the Jurassic coast in England, another example. And then we go to Hot Springs, South Dakota, there's gigantic mammoths converted to limestone in a huge bolus of flora and fauna. And perhaps the strangest of all, petrified crabs centered in spherical basalt bowl jars. Washington state. Now what do these petrified fossils have in common? Their end was dramatic and instantaneous. But the unanswered question, what pungent force of nature changed their chemical composition in their death throws? Now, conventional geology has time as its slowly moving tool that bleached their bodies and replaced the carbon with silicon and calcium. But the rapid decay of biological matter makes a nonsense of this theory, what then is the answer? Let's go outside the scientific square to start with. Let's track back to those who observed something deeply dramatic that may hold the key to this fossil forming event. Native American mythology is being held up as a witness to catastrophic mass destruction in modern times by the foundational paleontologist Georges Cuvier, writing some 200 years ago. He recorded much of their mythology around the destruction of the megafauna and used it as evidence of the many mass extinctions that have occurred on Earth. Importantly, American writer Adrienne Mayor recognized the similarity in this destructive mythological war of the thundergods against the sea monsters. She advocates for the use of the celestial thunderbolt as the weapon of choice in this megafaunal destruction. Now, I'm going to read an example from the Lakota Nation and, as cited by . . . , just bear with me as I read it. This is a quote from their mythology: "Their Creator sang the song of destruction, and sent down fierce thunderbirds to wage a great battle against the other humans and giant animals. Finally, at the height of the battle, the thunderbirds suddenly threw down their most powerful thunderbolts all at once. The fiery blasts shook the entire world, toppling mountain ranges and setting forests and prairies ablaze. The flames let up in the sky in all directions. The world's lakes boiled, and the giant animals and evil people burned up where they stood. The Earth split open, sending great torrents across the entire world. The survivors found the bleached bones of the giant animals buried in mud and rock all over the world." Now backing up these you've got Hesiod and the ancient Greek writing about the Gorgons and they are specifically responsible for petrification. OK now, so where do we go from here? If we're to believe these bizarre tales we've recognized in many myths as the cosmic thunderbolt, backed up by plasma physicist Anthony Peratt who's an advocate of giant plasma discharges that shaped history and as is Rens van der Sluijs and his study in mythhology for instance in his thunderbolts of Zeus, hitting down upon the earth, and changing it, but can these thunderbolts or plasma discharges produce petrification, turning living tissues to rock? Now I just want to pause a second. We've got a... Notice the difference between fossilization and petrification! Fossilization is the preservation of tissue, such occurs in fossils buried in coal like in Antarctica, Alaska and Siberia, oil, such is La Brea Tar Pits outside Los Angeles, peat, for instance mammoths buried in Snowmass, Colorado; whereas petrification is a subset, where the original carbon rich material is either replaced or transmuted to different compounds such as silicon or calcium. In other words, rock. Now while fossilization generally is undoubtedly the result of cataclysmic events, the burial of fauna and flora in Alaska mud, petrification would seem to magnify the catastrophic event to actually transmute elements and compounds. I suspect this is the result of powerful electromagnetic forces that happen to centralize in a chosen area. Not necessarily continent wide as the catastrophism tells. But I'm going into detail of this in another episode. But what evidence do we have that electrical phenomena can cause elements to transmute to another form e.g. water to calcium? What tool of nature fossilized these once watery marine ammonites? We have a powerful clue. Now, this is a formational study, done by Eric Milton. He described examinations of petrified tree trunk, essentially water and carbon, in Alberta, Canada. And I'll quote him, "The piece (this is the wood) was pure clear silica inside, it was coated with a rougher opaque crust of partially fused sand. The tree, whose stump was petrified, was alive five years ago! After the tree was cut down to accomodate the right of way for a new power transmission line, an accidental break allowed the live high-voltage wire to contact several tree stumps still in the ground. The power was cut off within hours of the break. All of the tree roots which contacted the broken wire were fossilized." All these extremes of electricity can metamorphize matter quickly. As much as we stretch our credibility to explain fossilization and petrification of watery living animals, there is a bigger question: What about the medium these very animals are preserved in? Let's examine a couple of these cases. Now, I went to Hotsprings in South Dakota, talked to Dr. Larry Agenbroad. He explained to me, the mammoths themselves are barely distinguishable from the medium they're immersed in. All calcium carbonate. And this is huge bolus, which is amazing to see, not just mammoths but short-faced bear, camels, all sorts of things in this huge bolus about 100 feet across, and about 90 feet deep. This is a huge bolus and this is all calcium, and fascinatingly although Larry himself believes the mammoths fell into the water and gradually were petrified. In actual fact, when you examine the digging, says, thousands of little subsets going right through the area, these are layers and you wonder what caused these layers, is this perhaps an electrical efffect and I suspect it probably is. So that's one. Was the water there possibly turned to calcium carbonate? You know, I've started with the example of H₂0 which is 2 protons of hydrogen and 8 protons of oxygen making 10 in all. Whereas calcium carbonate is 50 or 5 times that number. Could some agency change so all you need is additional neutrons. And as we know from Russian studies, whenever there's a major lightning strike, neutrons are in abundance everywhere for some strange reason we don't know why.

[Music] Some of the largest stars in the Universe are also some of the strangest. Conventional science would have us believe that these stars are near the end of their life. And yet they show some features that we also find in young stars. They claim that these stars will expel vast amounts of material which will eventually form a planetary nebula. And now they have discovered a star which is not only ejecting material in this manner, but also an expanding ring system and also ejecting large blobs of plasma. In the Electric Universe, these stars are deprived of electrons, which forces the outer plasma sheath to expand. A  planetary nebula is not the remnants of a dying star, but instead are the structures that the star is connected to, which are being lit up in glow mode due to a pinching vent which is taking place around the star itself. We know that what is termed as a young star can eject vast amounts of material from the jets. But this process also seems to happen with the larger, in quotes, ‘dying stars’. At the same time, we also see the formation of a ring system around new stars, which is often interpreted as an accretion disk from which planets may form. The same may also  appear to happen with these supposed older stars, but now they call it a dust torus. In  the Electric Universe, stars undergo a process whereby they become electrically  stressed. There is an imbalance between the incoming charges and those flowing away. In order to deal with this, some of its charge material can be ejected. This  can happen as a CME or in extreme cases, large planet-sized chunks of plasma can be ejected. In the most extreme case, the star itself will split into two equal, and sometimes unequal, parts. There is much observational evidence to show that those latter cases occur right after a sudden flaring or brightening event. V-Hydrae is what is called a carbon star. These are luminous red giant stars. These stars contain atmospheres where there is more carbon than oxygen. The two elements combine in the upper layers of the star, forming carbon monoxide. This leaves the carbon atoms free to form other carbon compounds, giving the star a sooty atmosphere and a strikingly ruby red appearance. This characteristic is not limited to massive stars, as dwarf stars are also known to be carbon stars. When astronomers developed the spectral classification of carbon stars, they had considerable difficulty when trying to correlate the spectra to the stars’ effective temperatures. The trouble was that the atmospheric carbon was hiding the absorption lines normally used as temperature indicators for the  stars. Back in 1981, astronomers detected very fast outflows from this star. Recently they have detected not just the jet-like flow, but that this flow consisted of compact plasma blobs ejected at high speeds, but also a slowly expanding set of six rings. The fact that they observe the star ejecting huge blobs of plasma on a very regular basis, is not easily explained in the mainstream model, and would require a companion star which passed through the outer envelope of the star, pulling away material from the star and ejecting it outwards. The star is around 2,000 light years away from us. Not only is it a carbon star, but it is a semi-regular variable star. It pulsates with a period of 530 days and its brightness varies by about one to two magnitudes. On top of this, it also has another dimming cycle which occurs every 6,160 days and causes its brightness to drop below magnitude 12. This periodicity might suggest that there is a cyclic resonant circuit effect, complete with overtones. Through visible observations, they were able to determine that it might have a companion, but due to the large separation between the components, the physical connection of this pair is still considered provisional, until sufficient radial velocity and proper motion data are available. This companion is also not responsible for the ejection of the plasma blobs. It is too far away for that to be the case. Recent data has suggested that the star might have yet another companion, much closer in. Direct observational evidence is hard to come by in these types of stars. They are large, very luminous stars which are surrounded by a dusty envelope. This makes it very difficult to detect nearby stellar companions. Some binaries have been inferred by radial velocity measurements. This method looks for a wobble in the motion of stars around a common center of mass. This causes the star to sometimes move a little towards us, and sometimes away from us, thereby altering its radial velocity. The problem with these larger stars is that they are believed to have strong variability intrinsic to their pulsating atmosphere. Instead, they turn to a technique called deep ultraviolet observations. Carbon stars are thought to be cool objects. The companions are likely a more normal star and therefore hotter. In their analysis they determined that V-Hydrae had the highest far ultraviolet flux. This they took as evidence of a companion and they then linked this with the eruptions they saw to determine it had a periodicity of eight and a half years. This is around half of the 6,160 day dimming cycle. So, more likely the ejection mechanism is connected to the changes in the current from the cyclic resonance circuit effect. What if the UV excess was in fact evidence of something else going on in the star  itself? That this process is what is causing the ejection of material and will eventually lead to the transformation of the entire surroundings? In the case of a super red giant, we  have a star which is electron deficient; it expands its outer envelope to increase the surface area for electron capture. The UV excess we see may be associated with the fact that the plasma sheath has expanded far enough, causing an increase in the electric field and hence giving the electrons a longer period of acceleration whereby they collide with other neutral atoms, ionizing them, creating an avalanche process through more and more collisions. These types of stars struggle to  deal with sudden electrical stressing and the simplest way for them to  deal with this is to discharge matter. Going back to our example of a young star with its outflows and the ring system. Rather than considering them as young stars, maybe a better classification is a star undergoing extreme electrical stress. The same mechanism is  what is causing all of these observations of V-Hydrae. The way these stars manage sudden changes in electrical input, is to discharge charged matter. This initially starts in the equatorial region forming a torus, or series of rings. As the toroidal magnetization builds, it may reach a critical point after which an instability occurs. This switches its behavior to force it to start ejecting material out of the polar regions instead. These are the jets and the ejected material we see from these types of stars, and are also the same mechanism that drives the ejection from active galaxies. If we examine the rings, you might notice something rather interesting. The rings are not equally spaced, but it would appear that the rings further out, are much further apart than those close by. If these rings were simply ejected material from the star, this material should slow down as it moves away from the star, and we would expect to see the rings get closer together as they move further away. The only reason that they will be getting further apart, is if they are being accelerated away from the star. This would make sense if the star had a radial electric field, driving away the plasma. A similar thing is also observed with the blobs of plasma ejected by the star. They initially appeared to move at a steady speed, then suddenly underwent an  acceleration. This star may well hold the clues to understanding the process that occurs when a star undergoes a sudden change in its incoming current, while at the same time being starved of a ready supply of electrons. The formation of both rings and jets is an indication of a star that is undergoing a significant change to its electrical load. [Music] 
[Music] It is well known that Ptolemy, in his  attempt to establish Greek astronomy on a sound scientific foundation, drew  upon ancient observations made by Babylonian sky watchers in order to develop his models for predicting the motions of the Sun, Moon and planets. What was true in Ptolemy’s time remains true today. In order to fine-tune their theories on such fundamental matters as the length of the day, or changes in the Earth's rate of rotation, astronomers analyzed ancient observations of the moon made by ancient Babylonian, Chinese and Arabic astronomers. In a recent book on the role of ancient observations in modern astronomy, John Steele underscored the point. Quote, ”Astronomy always has been and still is a science that relies on the use of past observations. Unlike most sciences, astronomy can never be truly experimental: astronomers can only observe the astronomical phenomena that present themselves... Perhaps uniquely in the sciences, astronomers therefore, are forced to rely upon empirical data collected by their predecessors.” End of quote. Yet, while modern astronomers regularly employ ancient astronomical observations recorded in Babylonian diary texts and Chinese annals to test their measurements and  formulate their theories, they typically pay little heed to the innumerable ancient artworks depicting the respective celestial bodies. This decision represents a significant oversight. Consider the example provided by the so-called ‘Lamat’ sign, one of the most familiar glyphs in the Mayan codices long believed to denote the planet Venus. In the Dresden codices elsewhere, the Lamat glyph is often coupled with the prefix ‘chak’, signifying red or great, and given  the fact various Maya cultures denoted the Morningstar by the name red, or great, star, the phrase ‘chak ek’ is typically translated as Great Star Venus. The Lamat sign is archaic in nature, early exemplars appearing already in pre-classic times circa 1,000 to 400 BCE. Martha Macri emphasized the remarkable continuity of these images and their attendant symbolism over the millennia. Quote, “The Venus star logograph is depicted on portable objects from the Preclassic, Classic and Postclassic periods into the 16th century. This continuity of an image that is graphically complex and semantically consistent is evidence not of the borrowing of a word or concept, but of the transmission of a specific image over an extensive geographic and temporal range.” End of quote. A number of recent studies have questioned the glyphs direct link to Venus with various scholars arguing that Lamat sign serves as a generic term for star, rather than signifying any particular planetary body. That said, the general consensus among Mayanists appears to be that the Lamat sign ’Red ek’ is a logogram denoting quote, ‘star’, ‘planet’ ’Venus’. End of quote. How then are we to understand the great star of Mayan cosmology? The first point to be made is that the Great Red Star was almost certainly not the planet Venus. Rather, it was the planet Mars, or Mars and Venus in conjunction. This identification is explicit among the Skidi Pawnee, renowned for their astronomy-based religious beliefs, who described the mythical Morning Star as a powerful warrior and red in color. According to the Skidi creation myth, a grand conjunction between Mars and Venus marked the origin of all living beings. Quote, ”The  second god placed in the heavens was Evening star, known to the white people as Venus...She was a beautiful woman. By speaking and waving her hands she could perform wonders. Through this star and Morning Star all things were created.” Analogous reports will be found among other Amerindian tribes, although it must be admitted that the evidence is often disjointed in nature and open to alternative interpretations. Among the Puget Indians of the northwest coast, the Morning Star is not only described as red, it is carefully distinguished from the Evening star which is described as white. So too,  the Osage remember the Morning Star as a red god; quote, “Great Star or Red Star, a male being, is the Morning Star. " The very same idea is common to the Delaware Indians. Quote, ”The Delaware call Morning Star the  Great Star or Red Star.” End of quote. The recurring emphasis among Amerindian cultures upon the red color of the Great Star must command our attention. As  the most prominent red star in the sky, it stands to reason that ancient sky watchers would have described Mars as red or ruddy in color. Venus on the other hand, typically presents a whitish color and is rarely, if ever, denoted by a name signifying red. Equally telling is the fact that in all of the tribes referenced above, the mythical Morning Star is always described as a male warrior, exactly as in Mesoamerican lore. Here too it is difficult, if not impossible, to find an ethnographic report describing the planet Venus as a masculine warrior anywhere in the continent apart from disputed examples from Mesoamerica. Given the antiquity of these Amerindian mythological traditions, not to mention the likely common ancestry and historical relation between the vast majority of the indigenous tribes on the North American continent, it stands to reason that the traditions attached to the Morningstar and Mesoamerican narratives and codices belong to the same general belief system. In short, whether it is the red color ascribed to the Great Star, or its masculine nature or intimate connection to war, the preponderance of evidence favors an identification with the planet Mars, the Red Planet par excellence. To return to the unique constellation depicted in the Lamat glyph, if  Mayanists are in agreement, the Lamat glyph has something to do with stars and/ or Venus, exactly what the image represents remains a matter of much conjecture. If the four-rayed star represents a star or Venus, what are we to make of the four circular dots? Susan Milbrath, an anthropologist specializing in ancient Mesoamerican astronomy, suggested that the glyph has reference to the four phases of Venus's appearance and disappearance. Quote, “The fact that there are four circles in a cross-shaped frame, naturally suggests the four phases of Venus associated with four different directions.” End of quote. Although a great deal of ink has been employed in discussing the possible astronomical significance of the Lamat's role in Mesoamerican symbolism, precious little thought has been devoted to the natural historical roots of the glyph  itself. Most scholars, with Milbrath, have concluded that the glyph is abstract in nature and encodes some arcane astronomical knowledge about Venus. The possibility that the Lamat glyph faithfully depicted an actual star constellation of prehistoric sky has never been entertained, to the best of my  knowledge. Yet, there is much reason to believe that this is exactly what the icon represents, namely an accurate depiction of the Great Star during a prehistoric period. The fact that analogous pictographs we found around the globe, offers compelling evidence in support of this proposition. A NUZ cylinder seal, purportedly dating to the mid-second millennium BCE, depicts a star surrounded by four dots. The  resemblance between the Mesopotamian and Mesoamerican glyphs is undeniable. Not only is there a central four-rayed star, but four circles or orbs are set  in the corners, exactly as in the Lamat sign. Not unlike the longevity of  the Lamat glyph in Mesoamerican iconography, the quadripartite star symbol persisted for millennia in Mesopotamia. The symbolic importance of the stellar image is indicated by the fact that Assyrian kings had it depicted on their royal  garments. Other Mesopotamian cylinder seals substitute a flower-like form or cruciform structure for the central star. One early cylinder seal represents a four- petaled flower star with four circles or dots at its corners. In another cylinder seal, a cruciform structure is represented together with circular dots. While the most common form of the Lamat in Mesoamerica shows a central four-rayed star, other early examples of the glyph show a flower-like object or cross instead. As we will discover, these variant forms, all  familiar symbols of stars among Ameindian cultures, offer a valuable clue as to the celestial origins of the Lamat glyph. What are we to make of this iconographic  evidence? If nothing else, the presence of analogous stellar images on opposite sides of the Atlantic in very early times, suggest the probability that such artworks encode some readily observable astronomical reality, be it a prominent star or constellation. Yet the fact remains that it is impossible to point to an object in the present sky that depicts a four-rayed star surrounded by four dots. Hence the mystery presented by these widespread anomalous stellar images. I discussed the Lamat glyph and the many faces of Venus and other works noting its possible relationship to the planet Venus. At the time I was operating under the assumption that the image depicted a conjunction of Mars and Venus in which the red planet appeared in front of the larger orb, but I had no idea how to explain the four smaller dots surrounding the central star. Upon discussing the matter with Anthony  Peratt in 2002, he pointed out that the dots are indicative of intense synchrotron radiation produced by four parallel Birkeland currents resulting from a high-current Z-pinch event. According to Peratt, quote “...the only known mechanism that produces synchrotron radiation are electrons spiraling about a magnetic field at nearly the speed of light.” Indeed, in high-energy/density plasma experiments conducted at the Los Alamos Labs in the 1990s, Peratt himself had generated very similar images. In the image on the left one finds a close analog to the classic Lamat sign depicted in the first figure here, in which a central star is surrounded by four small circles. In the figure on the right, the central star takes on a rosette-shaped image, not unlike that depicted in other figures here. I returned to the Lamat symbolism in the Great Star published in 2002 and once again reached out to Dr. Peratt for instruction in clarifying the various structures in question. In 2009 he wrote me as follows, quote, “Of course this symbol is found all over the place...It is indeed Venus and Mars in front but the quincunx is yet in front of Mars. See my Physica Scripta article that purposely does not show everything yet. Too early and I’ll have to find an  alias to publish under.” End of quote. Alas, in the intervening years, Tony has yet to elaborate on his groundbreaking experimental findings. Findings which help elucidate the testimony provided by the ancient pictographs and glyphs associated with the celestial bodies. Yet one thing is certain, in the case of the Lamat sign, a pictograph is indeed worth a thousand words. In summary, the Lamat sign will never be explained by reference to the present sky or  to the familiar periodicities of the planet Venus. Indeed it is our position that the stellar image in question represents a veritable smoking gun pointing to an extraordinary planetary conjunction in relatively recent prehistory, likely during the neolithic period. If so, and if in fact the Lamat sign depicts a grand conjunction between Mars and Venus during the brief period  when the two planets were lined along a shared polar axis, it follows that high-energy discharge events characterize this conjunction, and it must have been a memorable and likely very dangerous period in Earth history.

Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info The term "crisis in cosmology" has been used so routinely over the last couple of decades, I have to wonder if its significance is beginning to dull in the public consciousness. When science journalists use the term, they're generally describing the countless scientific discoveries that contradict or undermine  Big Bang cosmology. Of course, for decades now, numerous scientific studies have shown an apparent discordancy between the so-called expansion rate in the "early universe" after the hypothetical Big Bang, and the expansion rate in the "later universe." Well, just in the last couple of weeks, the Keck Observatory issued a press release reporting the most reliable verification to date that the discordancy is real, and the rate of acceleration of the universe's expansion is too great for standard cosmology to explain. But of course, the crisis in cosmology goes much deeper than problems with the expanding universe. It seems that just about every week we hear about the existence of objects, from stars to galaxies to quasars to super clusters, as well as a host of celestial phenomena that "can't exist in the Big Bang universe." And even more fundamentally, they shouldn't exist in a universe where gravity, and gravity alone, dominates. If you've followed this series, you've seen reports on these discoveries ad nauseam, and we'll be exploring several of these specific discoveries as we continue in this new discussion. So today, we're going to be discussing all of this and more with the chief science advisor to The Thunderbolts Project, Wal Thornhill. I can tell you at the outset that this is going to be at least a two part or even a three part presentation, because for several months now, there have been too many blockbuster discoveries, for us to adequately cover,  which are incredibly important for the Electric Universe and Plasma Cosmology. But before we begin addressing these items one by one, I'd like us to begin with a discussion on the very foundations of Big Bang cosmology, to clarify some essential distinctions between scientific fact and scientific theory, what is known versus what is believed. For instance, New Scientist recently published the collection "seventeen more things you need to understand" in which it outlines what it describes as "six principles of physics" and again, the reader might assume that each of these principles is an established fact or a "law of physics." Wal, you introduced me to this New Scientist piece, so why don't you begin by explaining what you think it reveals about the current state of cosmology and the culture of science. Yeah, that New Scientist special starts off with the first chapters on mathematics, instead of physics. You would think that if you're talking about cosmology, the first thing you need to talk about is the model, the cosmological model, the physical model, before you start talking about the mathematics that you're going to apply. They got sort of backwards, you know, the cart before the horse. And then, the very second one talks about the Big Bang. The very nature of the Big Bang should sound alarm bells because, what we observe in the universe is pretty much a balance. The solar system works like clockwork, there's no gravitational explanation for the beauty of spiral galaxies and yet they seem to be a standard form of galaxies... So just the very nature of the observations suggests that using an explosion, something equivalent to an explosion, a Big Bang in the beginning, is something desperately wrong, and as one philosopher wrote and I read just recently, he said that only an idiot would design a universe with an unbalanced force, and gravity is an unbalanced force, it's only ever attractive, it's never repulsive according to our experience on Earth, but then we extrapolate our experience on Earth out into the deep space,  and it doesn't work. It only works within  the solar system. But even then, when you go back to Newton, Newton also considered that gravity was a balanced force, he looked at it as a repulsive force as well. And it does work, but nobody could figure out just how that might be physically. And so, that's been  ignored ever since. It wasn't until Halton Arp came along and showed that his balanced universe absolutely needed a balanced force, gravity must be a repulsive force on  the cosmic scale. And that was one of the key issues that the Electric Universe had to deal with, because how can we explain gravity as a balanced force, and as soon as you do that, all of the requirements for a big bang go away, you don't need anything to separate matter in the beginning, because the result of that separation is either that all falls back together again, or it all continues to expand forever. It's almost impossible to have it just expand to a certain point and then sit there. So this was, you know, a major problem with the Big Bang Theory right from the very beginning. The other thing is that, all of the lack of real physics in describing of how the Big Bang originated. For instance, if you look at Wiki, that infamous source of information, it was created from a singularity which was described as a very hot, small and dense, super force. In other words, the mix of four fundamental forces with no stars, atoms, form or structure. This is physically meaningless. Singularity is, by the very definition, involve the concept of infinity, which  isn't a number. So you can't add, subtract, multiply, or divide by infinity and come up with a number other than zero, and that only as an approximation in the case of division. Singularities in a model are clear evidence that the model has failed. So right at the very fundamental level we're not doing physics, and then again we look at Wiki's explanation: to be hot requires energetic particles, that's how we measure heat, it's a measure of the kinetic energy of particles. That means that the singularity had to have the matter there already in this infinitely small point in space, right? This schoolboy howler results from energy being undefined in modern physics. There is no such thing as pure energy, it's always in relation to matter. It's a gaping hole dug by Einstein and his relativity theory, where any arbitrarily moving observer can be considered at rest at the center of the universe, in other words you've all got your own, you're all at the center of your own universe and that's obvious nonsense, because movement of any of these observers is a form of energy. So Einstein removed the absolute reference frame of the fixed stars, that is the rest of the universe, which was required by all the great physicists of the preceding centuries, including Newton. And then they talk about this singularity being small, but that's meaningless, compared to what? It's a concept you can get by dividing any number by infinity. Then it goes on, it assumes there are four fundamental forces. Well, this is a product of not understanding the physics in the first place. The Electric Universe, on the other hand, needs only one, the electric force, and then magnetism and gravity and the nuclear forces are all described in terms of the response of orbiting matter to an external electric force, or in the case of an atom, the internal electric force if the nucleus is offset from the center. And then, the last thing that it talks about is this force being dense. Now, any force requires the presence of matter before the Big Bang, so once again, we've got matter having to be there before the Big Bang, and how can a force be dense? Matter can be dense, a force only has meaning in the presence of matter, which again isn't there before creation. If it were, the singularity would be a black hole, one of those imaginary black holes from which matter can't escape, so that it could never bang. And if you look at the Electric Universe over the past decade or so, and Steve Crothers' analysis of the mathematics, the mathematics doesn't work either. It uses a pseudo tensor which in Steve's words is just a meaningless jumble of symbols, it has no  physical significance. The Big Bang is sheer nonsense, it has nothing to do with real science. What started the worship of an expanding universe? In 1929, Edwin Hubble discovered that for fairly local galaxies in his field of view, the fainter they are, the higher their redshift--assumed to be due to the Doppler effect, in other words, the change in frequency of a signal, as it recedes from you, drops in frequency, and that's a redshift in light. Anyway, Hubble himself remained unconvinced that the Doppler effect correctly explained his observations. He felt that the science underpinning this physical model was lacking, there's something else involved. It was left up to Halton Arp, who worked at one point with Hubble, to discover intrinsic redshift which means that the objects themselves have a different energy, a lower energy which means that both the particles within each atom, the protons and the electrons, have a different mass, slightly lower, and that difference in mass means that the frequency of light that they emit will be shifted towards the red end of the spectrum. It's as simple as that. We just assume, we make measurements of the mass of the proton, the mass of the electron in laboratories on Earth and then put it in a physics standards manual and everyone assumes it's the same throughout the universe. It's merely an assumption, and in the case of the redshift, the very fact that Halton Arp was able to find that it was quantized, in other words this is a subatomic effect, this is a quantum effect, and we observe it in galactic scale objects; means that the whole underpinning of particle physics, as well, is based on nonsensical ideas. This idea that the quantum theory only applies to the atomic and subatomic scale is incorrect, so trying to find the answers to everything through particle physics and cosmology fails on that very foundation. The New Scientist article which is supposed to be giving us answers to the 17 big questions, when it comes to cosmology, it talks about the principles of physics. Now, one of the principles of physics that is crucial is, that you cannot create or annihilate matter because that constitutes a miracle. We have no idea how matter is constructed or how you would go about constructing it, what the constituent parts are, and what happens if you have discombobulate, you know, a proton or electron, what would these particles be and where would they go, how would we detect them? None of this is answered. When we come to what the New Scientist puts forward as the six principles of physics, none of them have anything to do with this basic problem. The first one says, "the speed of light is a constant." Who says so? When we measure the speed of light, it's always in a medium and to say, as Einstein did, that there is no ether in the vacuum of space, is sheer nonsense. You cannot transmit an electromagnetic signal through nothing, it has to be a polarizable medium, and we measure the polarizable medium and give it capacity, you know, dielectric properties which is what's needed. So there is an ether, the speed of light we know, depends on the density of the ether that it's traveling through, what its speed would be. The speed of light is not a constant, and this was made crystal clear when Rupert Sheldrake spoke to us at one of our conferences, a few years ago, and he pointed out that it's acknowledged that when they measured the speed of light, it varied. So what's been done, they now define the meter, the measurement of distance, in terms of the speed of light and made it a constant, they've fixed it. This is unscientific and, in fact, can lead to serious problems. The second item is the equivalence principle, the equivalence between the sensation of gravity and the sensation of being accelerated in a lift. They are not equivalent. Gravity is, despite the formula which talks about a center of gravity, is an effective force between all matter in the universe. So in the case of the Earth, that's distributed throughout the volume of the Earth. So the force on a person accelerating away from the Earth will change, it will be different to what you would experience in an elevator, they are not equivalent. The cosmological principle is just another assumption based on observation and it may or may not be true. When you look at Halton Arp's different perspective on the universe, we are only a small part of the universe that is of unknown age and unknown extent, so all we can say is that in our local visible universe, part of the universe, the cosmological principle appears to hold, but there is a lot of structure, the structure is unexpected that is, the filamentary structure of the universe is not expected in the gravitational model, unless you add dark matter and all sorts of other magical fairy dust. But in the electrical model that is absolutely necessary because of the formation of stars and galaxies along cosmological Birkeland current filaments. So the filamentary nature is actually prima facie evidence that the Electrical Universe  model is correct. Quantization is the next one, number four, and of course, quantum theory, as Richard Feynman famously said, nobody understands it, and that is correct. Nobody understands it because there is no physical model underpinning it. The Electric Universe deals with that in terms of resonant behavior of structured subatomic particles. The Electric Universe merely repeats the pattern of the atom, because they're closest together in scale, as an orbital system, and repeats that for the electron and the proton and says that they're orbital systems as well, and therefore they will exchange energy in discrete resonant ways. You can only exchange energy between stable orbits. The other thing is that the foundational work for these stable orbits comes from Wilhelm Weber, 150 years ago, so the foundations of the Electric Universe are that old. It's just that no one was paying attention at the time, "his work was in German;" although Faraday and Maxwell knew about it, they preferred their field theories to ones which involved real particles and an instantaneous electric force. But of course, this is a real physical model, this is one that relies on physics. Quantum theory of Niels Bohr is a statistical theory, in other words, anything is possible. "Lies, damned lies, and statistics," you can dream of anything you like, and this is where the uncertainty principle comes from; because it's a statistical model, you can be uncertain about where a particle is and what it's doing. In the electrical model, there are real particles in real space in real time, the whole thing remains coherent, simply because we're dealing with real time. None of this relativity nonsense of malleable clocks and distances. The wave-particle duality comes about also from this problem of not understanding matter interactions at this structured subatomic level, because there is no such thing as a photon, you cannot have a particle with no mass which is what the photon is defined as being, traveling at the speed of light. Now, light is a wave phenomenon, but the particles involved in that wave are communicating with one another instantaneously, so all of these strange so-called nonlocality and spooky quantum effects are just the order of the day in the electrical model of Wilhelm Weber and particle interactions. He also showed that there are stable orbits in those electrodynamic interactions. It has nothing to do with electrostatics, it's electrodynamic. Not one of these six items is a fundamental principle of physics. So you start from that basis, you've got nowhere to go really, they're just stories that have been made up to try and make it appear as though we have a cosmology at present. Modern cosmology is not science, it's merely a story and it gets more and more complicated as time goes on. Stay tuned for part 2 
You've just entered the theater of an alien sky. If the words and images seem strange to you, there's a reason for this. Our world was once a vastly different place. To experience this won't hurt you and there is nothing to fear. The Great Comet Venus The planet Venus. A closest planetary neighbor and the brightest star in the sky. Poets the world over have long considered Venus as a celestial symbol of charm and enchantment. The morning star transitioning to evening star, then back to morningstar. But more ancient traditions about the planet run much deeper with enigmas at every turn. Tales of wonder and terror attached to Venus seem entirely out of place in our tranquil heavens. Within the common theoretical frameworks today, there's just no room for the extraordinary sky-altering events once remembered around the world. That today's quiet planet could have formally appeared as a great monster, a serpent or dragon attacking the Earth, may indeed seem too much to believe. And yet anomalies abound at every turn, inexplicably Venus is the only planet revered globally as a celestial symbol of the mother goddess, both the love goddess, a goddess of unrivaled radiance and an angry goddess linked to earth-shaking and even world-ending catastrophe. This global contradiction must have an explanation even if that explanation has been entirely missed in contemporary studies. Today Venus moves on an orbit 67 million miles from the Sun, compared to Earth's distance from the Sun, of 96 million miles. But many clues suggest a historic connection of Venus to the Earth and these clues include the geometries of their motions today, both the rotation of Venus and its revolution around the Sun exhibit a synchronous connection to Earth's motions. 5 Venus' years equal 8 Earth years. While the usual planetary rotation is from west to east, Venus rotates in reverse, though remarkably slowly in contrast to the solar system norm. A Venus day of full rotation is longer than its year, the time it takes to complete a revolution around the Sun. But a Venus' year almost exactly matches the timing of its closest approach to the Earth and at its closest approach Venus always shows virtually the same hemisphere to Earth. Synchronous or locked-in relationships of this sort, when they occur elsewhere in the solar system, are seen as evidence of a dynamic connection, either currently or in the past. Of course, astronomers have long believed that Venus evolved peacefully within its own enclave in the solar system, for countless millions of years. Given its proximity to Earth, astronomers assumed the planet to be rather similar to our own, calling it Earth's sister planet and speculating freely on the possibilities of life on Venus. But such speculations ended in the 1960s when probes of the planet stunned astronomers. The first continuous close-up look at Venus' surface came with the Magellan probe. But Magellan moved into orbit around the planet on August tenth, 1990. Its radar images revealed features as small as 100 meters across. Almost nothing in the earlier picture of Venus could withstand the impact of the discoveries that followed. The surface of Venus has been radically and catastrophically transformed by events yet to be comprehended. The probes revealed the superheated cauldron with surface temperatures averaging more than 460ºC or 900ºF. And describing a new profile of Venus, astronomers summoned images of a doomsday world. Massive clouds of sulfuric acid and carbon dioxide 20,000 meters high, create an atmospheric pressure at the surface some 90 times that of the Earth. What has occurred in the evolutionary history of Venus to create a world never imagined prior to the Space Age? In this Discourse and others to follow we'll explore the astonishing accord between space-age surprises and the ancient descriptions of Venus. The greatest surprise for science will lie in the global evidence that Venus formerly roamed the sky as a comet. In the language of ancient myths and symbols, the mother of all comets. And this is where we find one of the greatest challenges to today's theoretical assumptions about planetary history. Though Immanuel Velikovsky was not the first to notice the cometary images attached to Venus, it was his book "Worlds in Collision" published in 1950, that brought the issue to public attention with much greater force than any evidential fragments that preceded his best-selling book. Velikovsky noted many tales of disaster and upheaval in which the agent of destruction not only possessed comet-like attributes but was named as the planet Venus. And so the anomalous comet-like features of Venus in world mythology became key pieces of a historical argument. He noted for example, that in Mexican records Venus was the smoking star, the very phrase natives employed for a comet. He found in both the Americas and the Near East a recurring association of Venus with celestial hair and with a celestial beard. Two of the most common hieroglyphs for the comet in the ancient world. Another popular glyph for the comet was the serpent or dragon. A form taken by the planet Venus in virtually every land. And the same planet among the Egyptians, the Babylonians and other races was called the Flame or Torch of heaven, a widespread symbol of a comet amongst ancient peoples. According to Velikovsky, the history of the comet Venus inspired one of the most powerful themes of ancient myth and ritual, a collective memory of catastrophe, global upheaval, earth-shaking battles in the sky, decimation of nations on earth, an extended period of darkness and the end of one world age and the birth of another. Having devoted decades to following the global evidence, I can confirm beyond any reasonable doubt that chroniclers the world over did indeed describe Venus as a comet. Not the planet that we observe on a predictable path today. From Egypt and Mesopotamia to northern Europe and Africa, from the Mediterranean to the South Pacific, from China to the Americas, the sky worshippers remembered the comet Venus with awe and terror. For those who've been following these Discourses we'll connect the global story of the comet Venus to our reconstruction of the polar configuration. The universal fears of comets trace to the symbolic mother of all comets without which the global accord could never have arisen in the first place. Why did the appearance of a comet signify the death of a great king? Why, more specifically, was it claimed to be the soul of a deceased King rising in the sky? Our goal will be to show that the myth of the Great Comet is the story of the radiant star that animated the polar configuration. As the central eye, heart and soul of the primeval Sun. The subsequent fate of that star is indeed the story of the Great Comet. Always look for the underlying form! 
[Music] We concluded the previous episode  with an overview of the vast evidence, accumulated by Halton Arp and others, and indicated by the initial images of the James Webb Space Telescope, that cosmological redshift is intrinsic, which thus falsifies the foundational axiom of Big Bang cosmology. I turn now to deal with the Webb first deep field, unveiled during a White House event on the 11th of July 2022. NASA's associated news release states, “Thousands of galaxies - including the faintest objects ever observed in the infrared - have appeared in Webb's View for the first time. This slice of the vast universe is approximately the size of a grain of sand held at arm's length by someone  on the ground. This deep field, taken by Webb's near infrared camera (NIRCam), is  a composite made from images at different wavelengths, totaling 12.5 hours - achieving depths at infrared wavelengths beyond the Hubble Space Telescope deepest fields, which took weeks.” In order to make sense of this image, we must take account of several matters. First, we know from the study of galaxies in our local universe that they come in a range of shapes, sizes, luminosities  and colors. At similar distances, some galaxies are smaller and some are larger. Some galaxies, especially dusty galaxies, appear redder, while others appear bluer. For a given size, some are more luminous and others less luminous. Astrophysicists expect variability among distant galaxies at every point in the Hubble flow. Secondly, the Webb first deep field is centered on a massive galaxy cluster surrounded by stretched-out, curved objects. In the Standard Model, these curved objects are distant galaxies that are gravitationally lensed, making them appear larger and brighter than they would be in the absence of that lensing. Of course, in the Electric Universe that effect is due to refraction through the neutrino-sea ether that is denser around that massive galaxy cluster than elsewhere. Thirdly, humans cannot see the wavelengths of infrared light that were used to construct the image. Instead, colors in the visible range that we can see, were assigned to the different filters and then combined to produce the composite image. The specified filters are circled in the assigned colors in the NASA graphic that you see on the screen. You can see that there is broad coverage in the range from 0.6 to 5 microns. Visible light extends down to about 0.7 microns.  As you would expect, NASA's image processing team assigned blue to the shortest or bluest wavelengths, green for still longer wavelengths, orange for even longer wavelengths, and finally red for the longest wavelengths in the image. Fourthly, for some of the small faint galaxies in the Webb first deep field image, or in the deep images released by the CEERS project, we do not necessarily know whether that small size in the image is due to the galaxy being physically smaller and closer, or larger and further away. Now, assigning a value to the distance of the galaxy or quasar, can be confusing. In the Standard Model, space has been continually expanding since the Big Bang, and the brief period of exponential expansion, referred to as inflation. That means that the distance traveled by light emitted from an object, increases due to the expansion of space, while the  light is traveling on its path to the observer. Moreover, the space already traversed by that light continues to expand, while the light continues to the observer. So, a galaxy that is one billion light years distant from Earth at the time its light is emitted, will be further away  by the time that light arrives at the telescope. The lookback time, or distance at the time the light was emitted, plus that additional distance arising from the expansion of space during the light’s travel time, is referred to as the quote ’co-moving radial distance’ - the dotted line, marked ‘distance now’ on the graph, and can give a distance in light years that exceeds the age of the universe -  the horizontal blue line on the graph. The time that has elapsed since the light was emitted, is referred to as the lookback time, or light travel time, and is the value that is most commonly used to describe the distance of high- redshift objects. That is what is shown on the y-axis of the graph. Notice the declining slope of the ‘distance then’ line in this graph beyond a redshift of about three. In everyday life, we're used to the intuitive idea that the apparent size of objects - what astronomers refer to as their angular diameter – decreases, as  the distance to those objects increases. An object looks smaller as the distance to that object increases. In Standard Model cosmology, that relationship only holds until redshift reaches about Z=2. It's uncontroversial that in the expanding universe of the Big Bang, there's an optical effect that beyond a redshift of about Z=2 causes the apparent size of galaxies to increase with increasing redshift and distance. This effect is totally counter-intuitive, but is an inevitable consequence of Big Bang Theory. This effect occurs because in an expanding universe, the light we see from high-redshift galaxies, was emitted many billions of years ago, when the universe was much smaller and the emitting galaxy was much closer. In the time that the light has taken to travel the distance to our telescope, the space through which the light has traveled had continued to expand, reddening that light and reducing the amount that arrives per unit time. This leads to the counter-intuitive result that beyond a redshift of about Z=2, galaxies of the same size will appear larger, redder, and fainter as their redshift increases. Moreover, as several Japanese scientists have shown, some red spiral galaxies with a redshift in the range of Z=1 to 3 can imitate galaxies with a much higher redshift. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it is essential to recognize that the Webb first deep field is not claiming to depict redshift. Redshift values for objects across the image are not yet publicly available. Nevertheless, given the way that colors are assigned in the image, averaged over the whole image, the colors in the image are a reasonable proxy for redshift. So, if the Big Bang Theory is correct then, averaged over the whole of the  Webb deep-field images, and putting aside obviously lensed objects, the faintest objects should be the reddest objects in the image. Further, the faintest and reddest galaxies should appear larger than less faint and less red galaxies. But this is not what the Webb's first deep field and the CEERS images show. Instead, it is plain on even a casual analysis of those images that, averaged over the whole image, the faintest objects are the smallest objects and that a large proportion of the faintest objects are rendered in blue. We're going to look at a portion of the image indicated by the white rectangle. The arrows point to examples of faint objects that have been rendered in blue. As we zoom and pan across the image, note that a clear majority of the faintest objects, all of them galaxies, are rendered  in blue. This is prima facie, a stunning contradiction of the Big Bang's foundational  premise. In the Electric Universe, space is not expanding. The universe is of unknown  age and unknown extent, possibly infinite. Following the observations and insights of Halton Arp, one way new galaxies are formed, is by ejection from active galactic nuclei [AGN], commencing life as very highly redshifted quasars that progress through quantized decreases in redshift, such that high redshift is an indication of the youthfulness of a galaxy. In the Electric Universe, we expect  to see galaxies that get smaller and fainter - some bluer, some redder - to the limits of the telescope's observational power. That is exactly what Webb's first deep field shows. I predict that deeper Webb images will further confirm that fact. In particular, I predict that when very deep Webb images are obtained with  many days or weeks of observation, the detection of additional faint galaxies will simply show more of the same. And it only gets worse for the Standard Model  theorists. According to Big Bang Theory, the earliest galaxies are the least evolved galaxies. They have not had time to evolve and grow by accreting further gas and dust from the intergalactic medium or through collisions, mergers, or  the cannibalizing of smaller galaxies. Overall, and putting aside the so-called ’lensed’ objects for a moment, the reddest objects visible in the image should generally exhibit the least amount of smoothness and symmetric structure. Once  again, that is not what we see in this image. Instead, overall we repeatedly see smoothness and symmetric structure in the reddest objects, including especially the curved, so-called ‘lensed’, galaxies. The arrows in the image on the screen point to a selection of the reddest objects in this portion of the image that bear out that  contention. This fact is evident across the whole image. As for the red so-called ‘distant lensed galaxies’ of the Einstein Cross type, Halton Arp explains in an article on his official website titled, “Origins of Quasars and Galaxy Clusters”, that  two higher-redshift galaxies are found almost perfectly aligned across a lower- redshift galaxy on either side of it. He wrote, “This of course is the quintessential pattern of AGN’s ejected from a larger galaxy (often interpreted as gravitational lensing).” We see the red so-called ‘lensed objects’ with so much visible structure in them, because they are recently born and close to their low redshift parent. The universe that the Galileo of Palomar observed has biological overtones. We see families of galaxies and clusters in a small part of a universe of unknown size. Arp concluded that to prevent collapse in a non-expanding universe, gravity must be a repulsive force between celestial  bodies. Collisions are in fact avoided. I have explained elsewhere the electrical nature of repulsive gravity between celestial bodies. The infinities, beloved of mathematicians, disappear when the distance between the centers-of-mass of two bodies on a collision course, approaches zero. Nature must be explained by physics. Mathematics might describes the result. There are no collapsed-matter objects in the universe. No white dwarfs. No neutron stars, and definitely, no black holes. The  phenomena can only be understood in a balanced Electric Universe. It is impossible to overstate the significance of these facts. Facts that are plain for  anyone to see on the face of the image. In short, this one image, Webb's first deep field, falsifies the Big Bang. And given that the Webb Space Telescope has a vastly improved spectroscopic performance, we can expect the spectra of high-redshift objects will not match those expected from the story of heavy element production by successive generations of stars since a Big Bang. So-called ‘lensed galaxies’ - that is galaxies that do not appear as a result of refraction through a denser neutrino sea - are newborn high-redshift quasars. They are the infants of nearby galaxies. Their faintness would not allow us  to see them, much less their internal structure at cosmological distances. Being nearby, they will show anomalous super-luminal motion when viewed conventionally, billions of light years away. [Music] 
It's always a pleasure to be here and to see so many new faces and I wouldn't say old faces but longtime friends. Well, let's see. Last year I described for you a model, mathematical model of the Birkeland current, the cross-section of the Birkeland current and what it looks like, how it counter-rotates inside and how it manages to go from the Sun to the Earth, to Saturn and create the auroras on those planets.. And I thought maybe this year we take a look at the other end, not the Aurora but the Sun end and talk a little bit about the solar wind because Birkeland, when he came up with the idea of what the auroras were caused by, said they were corpuscles, electrical corpuscles that were coming from the Sun to the Earth. Of course he was laughed at severely for that but we now know that that is true. And astronomers, instead of calling it the Birkeland wind or giving him credit for it, they just call it the solar wind. So it's a bunch of, essentially, protons and electrons that come off the Sun in steady-state. Now I'm not talking about, of course, CMEs, coronal mass ejections or flares or any of the transient phenomena that happened but the steady-state DC as Ben would say, currents that are coming from the Sun as a normal thing. One might ask why the solar wind is important and I think that Ben has done a very good job of talking about why it's important that we know what's coming off of the Sun. It's obviously a stream of charged particles that speeds up to about a million miles an hour. That's moving. And before it streams past the Earth. And disturbances in the solar wind pump energy into the Earth's radiation belts and polar regions. Space weather clearly, as Ben points out, can change the orbit of satellites, shorten mission lifetimes, create all sorts of havoc. The solar wind distorts the Earth's magnetic field and this causes current surges in transmission lines and pretty much we know this. So I'm not going to mention those things again. What I'm going to talk about, I think, I hope, for the first time, is some of the lesser known properties of the solar wind and most importantly how well those properties, those very subtle properties of the solar wind fit in exactly with Ralph Juergens' electric sun model. And so as I've said so many times before you can't prove anything in science, you can disprove but you can't prove it. But you can always add supporting evidence. You can build that wall like the DA tries to build a wall of evidence that is insurmountable by the defense and this is, "no he really killed him". This is what we're trying to do here and that is to build that wall of evidence that says, "you betcha!". The Sun is electric. We don't know whether it's powered completely by electricity, we think it might be but we don't know. But one thing we know for certain and that is that the effects, the major phenomenon that we see on the surface of the sun, those phenomena are electric and i'd like to show you in some detail what, why I say that and what's going on. So there are actually two different types of solar winds. Perhaps some of you know that. And I'd like to explain the reasons why these properties are quite different from each other. The standard mainstream finds these observations to be quote "enigmatic" as always. They're not enigmatic, they're very simple. Elegantly simple. I'd like to explain how the different points of origin on the surface of the sun explain those differences between those two different types of solar wind that we see. One of the things that, by the way I should say that one of the things i want to show you is a short video clip that Monty Childs was kind enough to lend to me from the SAFIRE project. That shows that the things that I'm talking about here, as far as Juergens model is concerned, are being repeated here on earth in Monty's lab. So the Juergens' sun model was proposed in the early 70's and today I'm trying to propose a slight extension to that. And this, these proposals that I'm trying to make are based on Juergens', Ralph Juergens' work and also on something that I came up with and presented 3, 4 years ago called, I call it the transistor model of the sun because the sun.. we'll talk about in a minute. But sun surface works very analogously to the way a PNP transistor works. And we'll see that in.. briefly at least. Anyway, again to state the obvious, we all probably know that the major three layers on the Sun that are are important, and as you, if you come toward the Sun in the order in which you see them, would be the corona, the chromosphere and the photosphere. Now the corona is perhaps the most beautiful thing in the sky. It is this colorful, it's.. those are of course the same colors that we see in the Aurora. And why, because it's the same thing. It is plasma in the glow mode. And it is the same sort of stuff, helium, hydrogen.. mostly hydrogen, excited electrically. Again, everything I say please ask yourself while I'm saying it, how does the.. how does the standard model explain this? The standard model has no explanation for why a corona exists in the first place! If.. if the Sun is just a nuclear furnace like a wood stove.. My wood stove doesn't glow like that! And so clearly, everything that we observe around the surface of the sun, including the corona, is electrical in nature. Hm.. one other comment and that is that you can't see anything in the night sky that isn't plasma. "Oh yeah, I can see the Moon!" But of course the moon is reflected sunlight and sunlight is plasma. The Sun, well all of light that we see if you look at Jupiter through a telescope or Saturn or any other planet, you're seeing reflected plasma light and the, we'll talk about the photosphere and where that light comes from in a minute. But the corona is pretty big thing, it extends out about 3 solar radii. If you look at half the width of that disk and then the 123, it takes you out about the corner of that picture. And you can see, that's about the extent of the corona. So it's large. The Sun is what, 865 thousand kilometers across, something like that? The chromosphere, the second layer going in, contains these spicules. Spicules.. we've all heard, you know, the pines of Rome.. Spicules are the fountains of the Sun. Not the fountains of Rome. But anyway, they have certain characteristics. The spicules are really towering fountains of electrons that come up out of the Sun and then back into the Sun again immediately if our assumption is correct. Juergens' assumption that the Sun has a positive charge. Those electrons once spewed are very quickly brought back into the Sun again. That's what the spicules are. The photosphere is where the action is and that's what we're going to be talking about mostly. The, the photosphere consists of these things that the astronomers called photospheric granules. More proper name for them is anode tufts. The anode tufts consist of plasma in the arc mode and I've heard all sorts, even my, one of my good friends thinks the Sun is liquid hydrogen or something.. It better be pretty hot liquid because plasma in the arc mode puts out a horrific amount of power. And as a matter of fact, but I should say this, those those granules come and go with time, they grow, they get bright and they shrink and they go away. The power put out by the Sun is really fantastic. That is to say, the the radiation from the sun, every square inch of the sun's surface on average puts out 42,000 wats. If you can think of what about a square mile.. That's.. it's not, it's not boiling anything, it's arc mode plasma. The temperature of those granular granules or tufts is about 6000 Kelvin, which is pretty.. you wouldn't want to spend your summer vacation there but it's in relation to the.. to the temperature of the lower corona, which is 2 million Kelvin, it's not, it's a medium temperature. Anyway, the, there's a picture of the granules. That's a movie. If you look at it very carefully you can see it moving. It's a real time motion picture of the granules. If you keep your eye on one, especially near the.. I think that white stuff in the center is a bunch of spicules coming up through.. I don't know, but I think that's what it is. And you see the they're, they're all over the place let's see. There's some down here, there's some over here, up here and of course a bunch of them here.. If you keep your eyes on the granules themselves, you see them shrinking away to nothing and the question is, why do they do that? Well, there's a typical sunspot and you might say, well what's a sunspot? Sunspots are where the photospheric tufts are not. It's a region where the photospheric tufts don't exist. And so there's been a good deal of work done on the laboratory on anode tufts and we'll talk some about that. The main, well, focus, I would say, of Juergens' sun model is an anode tuft. How does the anode tuft work? That's one of the things I'd like to spend some time on this morning. There is of course the penumbra, that's that orange ring that you can see. The dark inner area is called the umbra and the temperatures in the umbra have been measured, well, just something in worth of 3000 Kelvin. So the umbra obviously is much cooler than the normal spots, I'm sory, the normal tufts which are the the yellow region around the outside there. Anyway, I said that Monty had sent me some interesting pictures from from SAFIRE. There is one. Now the, the purple wine glass in the back is not real. Monty has not been drinking, that's just an aberration of the photograph. This was taken inside a bell jar. And he has managed, he and his team have managed to actually create anode tufts. The center / bright purple thing is a spherical halo, it's distorted some by the shape of the bell jar. It's pretty spherical and it's the anode and riding on top of that anode are anode tufts. And so, the major property of these anode Tufts is that they're made up of positive charges. And as such, you can think to yourself, just basic knowledge of electricity.. If those things are each one a group of positive charges then they don't like each other. They're going to be repelling each other and so you see they're quite evenly spaced over the surface of the sphere. And as you'll see in a minute when Monty increases the current he increases the number of tufts and he increases the brightness of the tufts and finally they turn into something in the arc mode just like we see on the surface of the Sun. So the, as I said before, I think I said before, the main basis of the of the Juergens model is an analysis of those tufts so we're going to be thinking of travelling in a line, if you can visualize, from the purple surface there, the surface of the anode, up through the tuft and then out beyond the tuft. And let's think what, what would we expect to see there. I'll tell you what Juergens expected to see there and I think it's exactly what Monty is seeing and is going to see in the SAFIRE experiment. Anyway, Juergens' electric sun model and there it is, you've seen that picture many times, every time I talk, I think I show it. It's fairly complicated but let's take it one step at a time and I think, I think you can see what I'm saying. The upper one of the three graphs there is a plot.. well on all three of them the horizontal axis is the radial distance, up from the surface of the sun, up through the tuft and out into the corona. The top graph plots the voltage that you would see if you had a voltmeter in your hand and could have a ground someplace out in space and look at the various, the voltage, the voltage varies as you come up out of the Sun through the tuft and then out the top of the tuft. On the left-hand margin of the left-hand axis there, the vertical axis that's labeled energy per unit charge, that's volts. Energy, that's what voltage is. A positive charge has more energy if it's at a high voltage then if it's at a low-voltage. The analogy is, that's the cross-section of a mountain and the positive charge, the analogy there is a tennis ball. So suppose you threw a tennis ball on top of the.. I'm sorry didn't I got ahead of myself here, no i didn't, I'm sorry, this is fine. I'm looking at the next slide. I'm cheating on you guys. The tennis ball thrown on the top of the photosphere, well if you throw a bunch of them there and they begin to have a sort of a billiard game at the top on that horizontal surface of the photosphere, if one of the tennis balls goes too far to the left, that is to say between the axis and point A, it will roll off down the hill with increasing velocity. Same thing if if one gets bounced over beyond point B. Can you see point B there? And gets onto that ski jump that I've labeled the chromosphere. It will accelerate off to the right. The second plot, the middle plot there if you can read it, the axis says, the outward electrical field which is force per unit charge labeled in Volts per meter. So the electric field, for those of you who have learned any physics, is the negative of the gradient of the voltage, what I mean by that. Well look at the voltage and if it's sloping, if it's going down that's a negative slope like in the chromosphere. That means that the electric field to produce that is positive, it's the negative of what the slope does. So we're, say, if you start at the vertical axis of the the upper plot, you can see that the voltage is increasing as you move from the axis to point A. So, the voltage in the middle of the tuft is the highest voltage that you're going to see in this whole area. And to get up there, to get that positive slope on the voltage, the electric field is, is negative. Now it's, it's more negative right at the axis because the voltage curve is steepest there. I don't know if you.. if you don't follow me don't worry about it, if you do you see what I'm talking about. At the top of the photosphere where the voltage curve is flat there is no electric field, there is no force on the tennis ball pushing him one way or the other. But if the tennis ball, i.e. the positive charge, gets over beyond point B, there is a positive volt.. positive electric field and that will tend to accelerate it toward the right. The bottom curve is nothing but the resulting velocity. So clearly, once you get.. think of all three plots, if you get at the point B and slightly to the right of point B, the force is positive, outer force is positive. The electric field is positive and getting bigger and the, and the force is maximum where the slope is steepest. The skier is accelerating most rapidly at the steepest part of the ski jump. And so the voltage, I'm sorry, the velocity - the bottom curve, is continuing to increase it in.. the increase in velocity, the acceleration, is maximum at Point C. Once you get beyond point D, there's no more force on the skier, the tennis ball or the positive ion and so the velocity is constant. But it's moving. It's fast. Instead of talking about analogies let me say it straight out. A positive ion is accelerated by a voltage drop. The higher the voltage drop, the higher the resulting velocity. It's like saying, if you drop a rock from a height, to drop it from one foot it will get to a certain velocity when it hits the floor, if you drop it from 10 feet it's going faster. OK, that's all of this. The red marking there on the lower curve just talks about the region of turbulence and that is as these, as this stream of ions goes out into the lower corona, there are some collisions. Collisions mean, that's what temperature is, right? Most people, I think the average person at least, has a very poor idea about what's a temperature. I know it's hot outside but how, what is it? It's a measure of the vibration of the atoms in the stuff that you're talking about the temperature of. What's the temperature in space? There's no temperature in space unless you're in a cloud of stuff. You have, you have to talk about the temperature of whatever it is you're dealing with. Lastly, in the in the central curve there, the electric field curve, you'll see there's some blue areas and some salmon colored areas. This is strictly from Maxwell's equations. If you're going to have an increasing electric field, doesn't make any difference what the sign of the electric field is, if it's negative or positive, makes no difference. If the electric field is increasing, you're in a region of plus charge and you can see that's what happens there right next to the, the vertical axis in the middle plot. So, that's the positive charge layer. Where the photosphere, the voltage is not changing, there is no electric field so there is no charge. And the little triangle out around, between points B, C and D, the electric field is at first increasing and then decreasing, always in the same direction. The outward force is still positive outward but that force is increasing for a while and then decreasing for a while back to zero. That's the famous double layer. You're going to hear people in here talk about double layers. Hannes Alfven was famous for double layers, Irving Langmuir got the Nobel Prize for his work with double layers. That's a double layer! That's all it is, that is what it is. Why don't those positive charges and negative charges come together and neutralize each other? Why do they stay separate? Irving Langmuir found out. That's why he got the Nobel Prize. There has to be a continual current through that double layer in order to keep it stable. And the reason that the spicules pull, fountain those electrons up through the chromosphere is so that they can come back and satisfy Langmuir's requirement that that double layer has to have electrons and positive ions. So it all seems to work. Langmuir's work, the double layer, Hannes Alfven's work and now Juergens' work. All works the way it does and it's, it all, it all correlates. Anyway I'd like to show you this, courtesy of Monty, this short video clip. The first thing you're going to see is a set of anode tufts under very low current excitation and then the currents going to increase in strength and the plasma tufts are going to go into the arc mode.. You'll see the photosphere, there they are. They don't like each other. It's like a bunch of Kabuki Warriors pushing each other away. They're both, they're all positive and they're all looking for advantage and not finding any. You might hear Monty's voice in the background if they have the audio on.. There's this increase of the current. The tufts have begun to go into that's, I know the word, it is a high glow mode or.. That's arc mode. You can see now, it's a better model that you can see the sun spots, sunspots are where there are no tufts. There's something that, he's got the excitation such that it looks like the chromosphere. That little black thing in the bottom, I guess, Michael can tell me what it is. Is this a spectroscopic probe or it's a probe of some sort? There's the corona. The ring around the outside is the cathode. And, of course, in the model, in the SAFIRE model, you need a cathode. But in real space of course there is a cathode, there is a virtual cathode. But there's the, the corona. The reason, the reason that the corona there looks like it's only on one side is because the, the anode is closer to the cathode on that spot where you get the corona. If they were equally spaced you'd see the corona all the way around. Sorry for the hooky ending, that's a, that's what Stanley Kubrick used, it's the end of 2001 The Space Odyssey, but I really do believe that that's, it is the beginning. Okay, down to business. There are two different types of solar wind and this diagram, it looks complicated as all get-out but it's not, it's very simple. It, forget the nice picture of the Sun. Just, it's there for eyewash. This is a radial graph. The farther out you get from the center, it talks about the velocity of the solar wind so you can see that at latitudes, of, higher than 30 or so degrees and actually lower than negative 30 degrees, the maximum velocity of the solar wind is somewhere around 800 kilometers per second. Maybe they're here, it's more like 600, they say it's about 800. In the equatorial plane of the Sun you notice that the diagram sort of collapses, the maximum speed of solar wind is low, it's about 400. This is a picture obviously, look at the upper left, from Ulysses, the Ulysses probe - SWOOPS, that stands for "Solar Wind Observation over the Poles of the Sun". You're kidding? They didn't get over the poles! You see the diagram stops there, they don't know what's going on up there. But they did get to about 85 degrees or so. But Ulysses, when it got to 85 degrees, it was way out beyond Jupiter so this is not a closed-in measurement. And what is, the plot here is what they measure at about one astronomical unit, which is where we are. On the upper pole, what Ben was saying, the the upper half of this is sort of tinged in red and the lower half is tinged in blue and you notice on the lower left it says, the outward IMF. Outward Interplanetary Magnetic Field is coming from the north at this, at this point, and then back in to the southern hemisphere. But that's from NASA. Anyway, the fast solar wind comes from normal regions from higher solar latitudes. This is where we begin to divide into two different kinds of solar winds. A fast wind is one that comes from the, not in the equatorial region, and it gets up to about 800 kilometers per second. The, it comes from normal regions, that is to say, it comes out of the tops of the solar, of the photo.. photospheric tufts. Out of the, out of the anode tufts. The slow solar wind comes from active regions on the Sun's surface, in other words sun spots. Sunspots mainly are, they wander all over the place but they're very often in, generally in the what you'd say the tropical zone of the Sun. The near, near the equator. So just to state it succinctly, the fast solar wind emanates from regions on the Sun where there are no sunspots, generally at more than 20 degrees latitude. And it comes out of the tops of the photospheric tufts. It approaches 800 kilometers per second and it gets to that maximum at about nine radii. It's not too far out. I used to think it accelerated beyond Jupiter. It doesn't, not too much anyway. Another interesting thing is, it's less dense, it carries fewer ions than the slow solar wind. So it goes faster but it carries, it's less dense, it carries less stuff. Question is why? Well, I would suggest, this is the reason why. There's that first voltage curve again and the purple is an area where there are excited ions trying to leave the Sun. Sun, remember, is positive, positive ions don't like that, so they're out of here. It's kind of like the cross-section of a dam at the end of a reservoir. The reservoir is the purple area in the upper left and so you can, I think you can visualize that if the most excitable, the most excited, the most energetic positive ion in that distance, in that, close to the surface area, is just higher than the voltage of the photospheric tuft, some of those positive ions can trickle over the top of the dam, if you will, and just down the.. get accelerated down through the corona, down through the chromosphere into the lower corona. It's sort of reasonable that there wouldn't be too much density in that. It doesn't, not too many of these guys are able to make it over the top. So although they drop far and they're going like crazy when they hit the bottom, there are not too many of them. Because not many of them are able to get over the top of the tuft. So that's the reason why the fast solar wind is fast but it's less dense, at least that's what the Juergens' model says. There's a sort of analogy. That's Hoover Dam or part of its associated dams. The Hoover Dam is up the road there. A high-velocity, low-density flow. The water, not much water, gets over the dam there. Even less would get over if you raised that wall a little bit and that's my solar transistor model. This is kind of like the, emitter, the base and the collector of a PNP transistor. If you raise the voltage on the base you cut off the current. So again, the velocity is high but the density is low. There is some turbulence at the bottom but it's intentional in this hydraulic analogy. You can see they put rocks along the bottom. They're trying to aerate the water before it gets past. If you could take those rocks away and make that a nice smooth concrete surface, there wouldn't be any.. that would minimize the turbulence anyway. How about the slow solar wind? It emanates from the equatorial region mainly, from sunspots. The maximum velocity is about 400 kilometers per second and the ion density is more than 3 times denser than the fast solar wind. OK, so the slow solar wind is slow but it's got a lot of stuff in it. My, sort of my thought analysis, my memory crutch on this is that the fast solar wind is like a sports car. Goes like hell but it doesn't have much space for the groceries. The slow solar wind's like a dumptruck. Goes slowly but boy can it carry stuff! So, the ion density is more than 3 times denser than the fast solar wind. So again the question is, why? Well, is there an analogy for this one? Well, remember we said that the slow solar wind emanates from regions where there are lots of sunspots. What's a sunspot? Sunspot is a place where there aren't any tufts. The dam is gone. Somebody put a hole in the dike and there's nothing to prevent the water. I used a, I'll show you a slide in a minute, that I used to show this hydraulic analogy of the slow solar wind and I chose a bad one. The real analogy for the slow solar wind, and if I've done it right I would have gotten a photograph of the Mississippi River right after Hurricane Katrina busted the dike. So that the water in the Mississippi isn't much higher, that's what, 8 feet or so higher than the ground outside and when you break the dike, the water, the voltage drop, the hydrostatic head, if you wish, is not very high. So there's no really high velocity but when that Dyke breaks, wow is there a flow. So it's again, the slow solar wind is a region of high density, low velocity flow. It's like a broken dike. Anyway, that's another movie and I've heard people decry that that cannot happen; "Is that what you're seeing, don't believe your lying eyes, believe me. I'm gonna tell you what happened." No, that's what really happens and that's a picture of what the penumbral filaments look like. And it's kind of interesting that.. I maintain and you think of it yourself, the umbra is a place where there aren't any any tufts. So if you look at a cross section of this thing, you can see tufts, tufts, tufts, tufts, tufts, they're all pushing on each other, you know, the samurai warriors, they don't like each other.. But when it comes to the edge of the place where there aren't any tufts, these guys don't have anything to hold them back so they fall in. And you can see that's happening. The reason I say you can see it happen is, concentrate on the, on the circular ring right on the outside of the penumbra, right between the yellow and the, what-is-it, ochre colored areas. You can see that the regular tufts, the yellow area, right near where the tufts are breaking away, are going outward. Can you see that? When the tufts in the penumbra are going inward. Sure they hate each other, they're both positive, groups of positive charges. They're elbowing each other and so when the group that is not being held back by anything and just falls off, when it starts to flow, to move, it's still pushing on the other guys. The space is opening up and so some fall in and some fall away. So there's, I think that that is proof, the fact that the yellow ones actually move outward while the other ones are moving inward when space opens up for them to be able to move, shows that what you're seeing is an electric reaction. It's not a gravitational reaction, at least I maintain it's not. The analogy, of course, is the calving of icebergs. You get a glacier and you got the ocean or whatever that water is out there and these things eventually break loose and fall in. In this case this guy that's falling in, the process of falling in, is not pushingon anything. So there's no tendency for the tufts, if you will, the potential icebergs there in the wall of the glacier, there's no tendency for them to move away. Because nothing is pushing on them. Only gravity is pulling the one down that's falling in. This is not the case, so this is a partial analogy. It is sort of like, makes you think about what is happening on the Sun. But on the Sun, this guy that's falling is pushing back like crazy on the one that he just came away from and he's moving back. Here's again that picture and this is what I claim is happening. Just look at the red dot, dotted line there for a second. The voltage V2, the higher voltage is the voltage of the, of the photospheric tuft. V1 is the voltage of the umbra. And ions in the umbra look up and they don't see anything. They just ... it's outer space out there, that's the corona. So they tend to fall along that dotted path, the dashed red curve is a voltage profile taken up through an umbra. And how many of them are there? Zillions! Because there's a lot of positive ions inside the Sun that would love to get out and the only reason they can't all get out is because in a lot of there is the, the photosphere granules that the dam stops them. But at an Umbra there is no dam wall. That's d.a.m. So they flood out voluminously but they don't fall from such a high height. They fall from V1 out to the low voltage of the solar.. of the corona. Whereas the fast solar wind ions that come over the top, they leak over the top of the dam and go all the way down in front of it. They fall from voltage V2 so the fast solar wind comes over the top of the dam, screams down that cor.. chromosphere, ski jump if you will and fly out the bottom. The slow solar wind, many more of them because they don't have to just trickle over the top. They just go. So the slow solar wind has a lot of ions in it but they're not going as fast cause they don't drop as far. There is a side view of a sunspot. What you're seeing of course, if you listen to mainstream astronomers they say; "Well that's a magnetic field!" That's not the magnetic filed, that's plasma! You don't see magnetic fields, magnetic fields are invisible. So are electric fields, they're invisible too. But plasma, no, you can see that, and so you you're seeing there the side view of a sunspot and the plasma is pouring up out of that sun spot. Over on the edge, on the lower right, that's where, that's a normal tufts. Here are they. Stuff is still coming out but much less of it. So that's the reason why there's the slow, the voluminous slow solar wind and the very fast but not very voluminous fast solar wind. There's the slide I wish i didn't put in there. I should have shown a picture of a broken dike. This is an interesting thing. This is the reversing falls. I think it's a national monument. Does anybody know where it is? I think it's up in Montana or maybe Idaho, I'm not sure. But this is a, it's not a man-made thing, it's a natural thing. It's the reversing falls and it converts a fraction of, or all, of the kinetic energy that's coming down from the upper left, into potential energy. In other words it it's coming down from the upper left as a rather large volume of water. When it hits this stagnant, stable, placid pond into which this thing flows, there's a collision of those atoms of water. Then there is, there's a turbulence. The electrical analogy of course is that you've got a high-current coming down hitting a place where there are static ions. And there's a collision and the kinetic energy is turned back into potential energy, higher voltage. And so what you get, the electrical analogy of that turbulent high bunch of water is a concentration of positive ions right at the bottom of the ski-jump. A concentration of positive ions is a good place for an E-field to begin and that E-field, I claim, is what accelerates the solar wind. Here's a sort of a wrap-up slide that shows, it shows it all. You can see the photosphere, you can see the sun spots there to the center, to right of center.. And then coming out of that is a tremendous flow of slow solar wind. At the chromosphere, there's collisions with the stable static ions in the chromosphere and in the corona even more so. To the, to the left, so the middle left of the corona you see one of the famous coronal holes. Coronal holes hooo, mystery. There's nothing mysterious about a coronal hole at all. It's just above one of the normal posit.. normal places on the, on the photosphere. It's, the coronal hole is not where there's sun spots. That's all it really is. And so, what comes out of the coronal hole? The fast solar wind! Sure, where is it coming from? It's coming from the tufts in the photosphere. So it all makes sense. It's elegantly simple. Here is, I have to put this in because I think it's a, it really says what I'd like to say. This is by R.R. Grail, he's a very well-known or was a very well known solar astronomer. He said; "Our results in measuring the solar wind indicate that the acceleration of the solar wind is almost complete by ten solar radii, much closer to the Sun that had been expected." Okay, good. "This suggests that the acceleration of the solar wind and the heating of the solar corona occur in essentially the same region and thus that the underlying mechanisms may be strongly linked. They're not strongly linked, it's the same thing! It's the same mechanism, there's only one mechanism and that's what does it. Juergens' model says it all. And all of these properties of the fast solar wind, the slow solar wind, the densities.. are all explained by.. OK, one sort of just, I would call it a technical slide but it's, it's the statistics. What they say, statistics don't lie but statisticians do. Here's the statistics so they don't lie. The two columns are; one for the slow solar wind and one for the fast solar wind. The first line is the flow speed. And you're talking about the velocity of protons, VP. And so the slow solar wind's highest velocity is around 400 kilometers per second, by fast solar wind it's about 800. I hope you guys in the back can read this. The proton density however, in the slow solar wind, is 10.7 per cubic centimeter. In the fast solar wind it's 3. So the fast solar wind is, contains one-third less than the slow solar wind. The proton temperature is, if you go down there, it's a 2.3 times ten to the fifth. It looks like you're comparing 2.3 to 3.4 but you're not. 3.4 is multiplied by 10 to the fourth so it's kind of like comparing 3.4 to 23. OK, so the fast solar wind, that proton temperature is much higher than the slow solar wind, why? Because it's been through the mixmaster, it's been through the ski jump. Then look at, and this is the last thing I will look at this page, the electron temperature. It's just the opposite. The electron temperature is 1.3 in the solar wind and 1.0 in the fast wind. So the electrons don't take part in this. Why? Because the electrons don't go over the hill, they don't get excited. That hill is a hill only for positive ions. If you want to know what happens to electrons, you have to take that cross-section of the of the dam and turn it upside down. If you turn it upside down it looks like a saucepan. So if electrons are coming into the Sun from the lower corona, they collect in the saucepan. What's the saucepan? It's the photospheric tuft. The electrons come pouring in, happy as larks, because they're coming downhill, "yeah here we are we're going to collect in the pan" and they build up and build up more and more electrons and finally what do they do? They neutralize the positive charges and they kill the photospheric tuft. That's why the photospheric tufts disappear. They fill up with incoming electrons. Anyway there's more I can say about that but I'm running out of the time here. The only quantitatively determined force capable of achieving a fast solar wind acceleration is the electric force. And I did some work on this. I won't bore you with the mathematics but I simply would say that my final result is step 3 there. I've derived the electric field strength necessary to accelerate the fast solar wind to 800 kilometers per second. All sorts of people have tried to do that and have failed to come up with a mechanism. Remember, the corona is a non collisional corona. It's non-collisional plasma. They don't bounce off each other, they just increase in velocity. And if you put a positive ion in an electric field, it will do just that. Well how strong this electric field have to be? There is the answer, less than seven tenths of a micro volt per meter. At a distance of about three solar radii, the end of the corona. Seven-tenths of a micro volt per meter. Monty, that's your next job. Find out whether or not a glow mode plasma can support an electric field of seven tenths of a micro volt per meter. If it can, that's the answer. OK There's the advertisement. That's my website. If you go to electric-cosmos.org, you'll get that. The stuff in white at the lower right hand is a, you can, they are clickable links and if you're interested in the gory details of the mathematics involved in both, the first one is the Birkeland Current thing that I presented last year.. The second one is the solar surface transistor action that says what happens if you raise or lower the dam and and, can you curtail the fast solar wind.. Yeah, you can cut it off! Just like cutting off a transistor, the solar wind stopped for two days, back about six or eight years ago. The third one is what I'm talking about now, the solar wind acceleration. So anyway, I won't bore you further. Juergens' electric sun model explains why the plasma corona exists and explains the temperature profile and I submit that my, what I've just told you, the photospheric tufts are variable electrical barriers for positive ions attempting to escape from the Sun.. Explains why there are two very different solar winds, one fast and one slow, why the fast wind is faster and the slow wind is slower, why the electron temperature is the same in both. Because the electrons don't go through that process, they're just there. And besides, on the average they're coming in. Not that some don't leave, they do. But they're not affected by that, the shoot to shoot, the ski jump and all the rest of that stuff that the positive ions are. And it explains why tufts go away, because they fill up full of electrons.. And why the first solar wind comes out of coronal holes.. And the stretching of sunspot punumbra is electrical. Anyway, I think that only the electric sun model can explain this. Thank you! 
[Music] We previously developed the criteria for model revolution, drawing on Thomas Kuhn's paradigm shift cycle, and explored whether any cosmological models, including the Electric Universe, meet these new criteria. Now, let's take a deeper look at the distinction between the Standard Model and the EU model, as we continue on the path to the next model of cosmology. Implied by the major differences between the two models, is a difference in  world view. According to Thornhill, Electric Universe proponents believe in a resonantly connected Universe which is self-organizing and where entropy can  decrease. In the EU worldview, quote, ”The whole is greater than the sum of the  parts. The Universe is consciousness-filled... with instantaneous information transfer via resonant connection.” End quote. Overall, the EU worldview highlights and emphasizes cosmic connectivity. While the Standard Model does not have  a formally articulated or expressed world view, the EU infers from what the Standard  Model says and, more importantly, what it is silent on, a worldview that is quote, “Disconnected, random, chaotic unconscious, purposeless, with ever  increasing entropy.” End quote. A world view that is very much in contrast with that of the EU model. Given their differences, Standard Model scientists and EU scientists are living in two different and incompatible worlds. As  mentioned earlier, a change of paradigm is ultimately a change of worldview. As noted in “The Structure Of Scientific Revolutions,” quote, “Though the world does not change with a change of paradigm, the scientist afterward works in a different world.... Rather than being an interpreter, the scientist who embraces a new paradigm  is like the man wearing inverting lenses. Confronting the same constellation of objects as before, and knowing that he does so, he nevertheless finds them trans- formed through... and through...” End quote. From this statement, we can conclude that a change of paradigm will upset the scientists’ worldview and field of study, turning them on their head. In light of this, let's look at how proponents of the Standard Model have reacted to the Electric Universe. For a long time, mainstream or dominant science responded as one might expect. Once science becomes institutionalized and entrenched, it tends to function much like other dominant institutions in that it is dogmatic, and unyielding to falsification or change. For years, mainstream scientists have ignored, dismissed and/or mocked the EU model. For instance, why isn't anyone seriously challenging the Big Bang? Mainstream astrophysicist Ethan Siegel dismisses the EU model and lumps it in with what he describes as absurd hypo- theses held by quote ”... crackpots and a few fringe contrarians.” End quote. He also  claims that the EU model is not to be taken seriously and that its predictions are, quote, “...in absurd conflict with observations of the Big Bang.” This is ironic, given the EU's claim of a history of accurate predictions. According  to Wal Thornhill, examples include 1. That solar radiant energy is due largely to transmutation of elements in the electrically active solar plasma, which was confirmed by an independent SAFIRE experiment in 2019. 2. The electrical “flash” discharge preceding the impact of a copper projectile on Comet Temple One. 3. That the surface of Saturn's moon Titan has distinctive lightning scars - called Lichtenberg patterns - with virtually no large craters. 4. Successful predictions about what would be found at the heliopause. and 5. Successful predictions about the heat from Saturn's north pole. These predictions notwithstanding however, it is not surprising that the Standard Model would dismiss the EU, especially given what Kuhn says about incommensurability. In the course of a paradigm shift, new ideas and assertions cannot be strictly compared to, or judged by, those of the old model. Especially since the two models will have no common measure. From the perspective of my own field, Critical Discourse Analysis, judging the EU model by the existing model standards and/or categorizing it as a model that is not to be taken seriously, are prime  examples of how language is linked to power. In CDA, power is understood in broader symbolic terms, including the power to represent someone or something in a certain way. For CDA, quote, ”...language.... is not simply a tool of communication, but a means by which people demonstrate their commitment, in one way or another, to certain ideologies or dogmas.” End quote. From this perspective, language is always about power and control and is never arbitrary. With respect to science, those working within a model that is as deeply entrenched and as heavily funded as the current Standard Model, ultimately you have the power to define and control the very discourse around cosmology, including what is acceptable, or not to be taken seriously. Given the careers and funding at stake, and given the power it has to define and shape the discourse, it is not surprising that mainstream science and cosmology would dismiss or mock, any truly alternative model that threatens or undermines it. Moreover, once this becomes the official discourse on cosmology, i.e that the Standard Model is acceptable and alternative models that deviate from it, unacceptable, it functions as a form of neuro-linguistic programming that ultimately signals to the broader population how they should think  about cosmology. Ironically however, it is the very resistance to new ideas that eventually forces institutionalized science to change. By resisting novelty, normal science, or dominant science, prepares the way for its own change, not least because crises that are left unresolved eventually force individuals, including scientists working within the existing model, to look elsewhere for new and better answers and explanations. It must be stressed that this entails fully abandoning the existing broken model. New  models demand the destruction of the old paradigm. In a scientific revolution, the new paradigm does not simply revise the old model, it replaces it. Now, while mainstream science has typically ignored or dismissed the EU model, more recently there has been what I describe as Electric Universe adjacent language in the mainstream. Examples include the following titles. -- How Magnetism Shapes the Universe - PBS Spacetime; -- The magnetic field in the Milky Way filamentary bone G47 - phys.org; -- Juno and Hubble data reveal electromagnetic ‘tug-of-war’ lights up Jupiter's upper atmosphere - phys.org again; and -- Astronomers discover 1,000 strange ‘filaments’ of radio energy bursting from the galaxy’s center - Live Science. From the titles alone, we can see that this language is different and uncharacteristic from what's been typically reported by the mainstream in the past and appears to be more closely aligned with the discourse of electromagnetism. One title even mentions filaments and while two of the titles deal exclusively with magnetism, according to the EU model, it is meaningless to talk about magnetism without also considering the electric force. So, what might this recent change in mainstream discourse foretell? While it is too early to say for sure, one possibility is that more advanced technology, with more sophisticated probes, will make it increasingly impossible to deny the role of electricity  in space. Thornhill notes that the Electric Universe paradigm has an unparalleled record of successful predictions in the space age. He expects that this will continue and that images and findings from the new James Webb Space Telescope will further support the predictions of the Electric Universe. Given the recent additions to their lexicon, can proponents of the Standard Model be preparing to get ahead of the curve, and make room in their discourse for electromagnetism and cosmic electrical forces, all the while maintaining their authority? In other words, could they be preparing to include electricity as an add-on or an extension? Will we suddenly be reading about e-gravity for instance? Kuhn's framework and everything discussed so far, clearly demonstrate that this is not sustainable in the long run. Mixing incommensurate models with fundamentally different paradigmatic languages, would only hurt science and could not be considered a true paradigm shift, or scientific revolution. Due to their fundamental differences, the Electric Universe model and the Standard Model cannot coexist in the same paradigm. They are too different. As Mel Acheson aptly maintains, trying to add the Electric Universe as an extension to the Standard Model would simply muddy the waters. Given everything we know about the paradigm  shift process, including Kuhn's clearly articulated criteria for a model revolution stage, we must conclude that the future of cosmology cannot, and will not, be an  ad hoc revision to the Standard Model. On the contrary, due to the very nature and definition of a scientific revolution, the only way forward is a truly alternative cosmological model with a radically different paradigmatic language and world view. Could this be the Electric Universe model of cosmology? Time will tell. [Music] 
welcome to the thunderbolts.info podcast for december 6 2012. we bring you all the latest news information and analysis from the electric universe shedding new light on the many mysteries that dark theories have yet to illuminate one of the hottest trending news items in the last week was the anticipated announcement from nasa of a purported discovery of historic proportions by the mars rover curiosity i can tell you in all honesty that we at the thunderbolts project were not surprised that this supposed historic revelation turned out to be a vast disappointment perhaps for millions of people around the world we're now being told that it was all just a big misunderstanding due to some miscommunication between curiosity's chief scientist and a journalist with npr but the truth of the matter is that we have no shortage of incredibly exciting and thought-provoking mysteries surrounding mars and the nasa rovers in fact when we scrutinize each of these mysteries it becomes readily apparent that the most exciting discoveries on mars are not even on the table for discussion among nasa scientists at least not in any public statements so what we're going to be doing over the next month or so on the thunderbolts youtube channel is flashing back to the most fascinating and enduring recent mysteries surrounding nasa's investigations into the red planet now today we're going to be talking about an ongoing anomaly that truly is one of the great mysteries in mars exploration in january of 2004 the mars rover's spirit and opportunity arrived on mars about three weeks apart each of these rovers was given an anticipated lifespan of 90 days but for reasons that no one at nasa has satisfactorily explained almost nine years later the rover opportunity is still alive and transmitting information to scientists on earth the rover spirit eventually died around 2010 but only after being ensnared by sandy soil in a martian crater how on earth could two rovers that were given lifespans of 90 days stay alive for so many years now the scientific explanation for this ongoing mystery is at least from our perspective incontrovertible and it provides powerful verification of the electrical martian environment and the environments of all the planets that reside within the sun's electrical domain i'm going to bring david talbot onto the line now david is of course the director of the thunderbolts project he is co-author of thunderbolts of the gods and the electric universe and he has handled the enormous task of organizing the forthcoming conference the tipping point from january 3rd to 6th in albuquerque new mexico and david is going to be with us for a series of discussions over the next month devoted to unraveling a number of the ongoing martian mysteries that to date nasa scientists have been unable to resolve david talbot welcome to the show today yes greetings michael now david as i said we're flashing back to january of 2004 and i know that when the rovers first arrived on mars there wasn't anything particularly mysterious about their missions but then events began to unfold and nasa scientists really had to struggle and in fact they still struggle today to provide any satisfying explanation why don't you take us back to the moment when the mystery began to unfold that today nasa scientists are still scratching their heads in truth trying to figure out it was in january 2004 that the two rovers dropped onto the planet mars and began a project or an exploration of the surface that was envisioned to last some three months or 90 days now the reason for the short lived anticipated project was the incredibly dusty atmosphere of mars this is an interesting mystery in itself because the martian atmosphere is 0.008 as dense as the earth's atmosphere so just the fact of such a dense presence of dust in the martian atmosphere is itself a great uh enigma for planetary scientists but accumulation of dust on the solar panels was envisioned to occur so rapidly that the solar panels would basically be deactivated within a three month or so period of time now what actually occurred seemed to clearly verify that this was going to happen after just a few months spirit's output dropped to 400 watt hours the opportunity output dropped to about 500 watt hours due to dust accumulation affecting the solar cells so this is what the project was designed around but that's when something actually amazing happened it was something akin to a car wash as the scientists themselves put it and nasa scientists were quite frankly stunned this this coming back to life that occurred with these rovers remains a mystery today and why did it happen in spurts during the martian nights power increased by up to five percent and it was not long before the power had peaked at the original 900 watt hours in other words a full recovery of both rovers powers so opportunity and spirit just kept going and as you said opportunity is still going today it's nine years after the landing on mars so what what in the name of heaven happened nobody could say actually well it may be that they can't say and yet they do say they do give their explanations and as is so often the case in the science media the guesses they are offering are actually routinely reported as fact it's a fact that one of the rovers had a fortuitous encounter with a dust devil and the wind from the dust devil blew off all the dust from the panels what was the first guess they offered to try to explain these miraculous cleanings well the first is wind they just appeal to the martian wind which would have the most trivial impact on accumulated dust and even in a hurricane you cannot clean a car on earth by wind so the fact that that was given as the first and most plausible explanation is is very telling this is all incredibly ironic because the truth of the matter is that many technical folks in and around nasa have worked for years with electrostatic cleaning electrostatic cleaning nasa engineers have attended conferences on electrostatic cleaning and it's a process that actually was envisioned for keeping solar panels clear technologies to clear the panels electrostatically electrostatic deposition and electrostatic cleaning are extremely prevalent in industry now this was something that i pointed out myself way back in 2005 in a picture of the day that it's just ironic that nasa scientists the technical folks have been so aware of electrostatic cleaning but the people at the top who are well let's just say they're closer to science by news release and they you might say as well that their gatekeepers who are responsible for the public image of the sciences and so on they seem to know nothing about electrostatic cleaning so right after all of these years i was encouraged to see a headline in the mit technology review uh it was from august 2010 the headline was self-cleaning solar panels and it specifically referred to mars and the mars rovers solar panels and it specifically referred to electrostatic cleaning and its intended use on mars rovers so that's when this dismain aspect of the article jumped out at me the article said this about spirit and opportunity the spirit and opportunity mars rovers lasted longer than expected because occasional gusts of wind have cleared off their panels i'll just add one more point here the article then quotes a project monitor at the jet propulsion laboratory quote we may not be lucky all of the time well this was part of an article designed to foster interest in electrostatic cleaning and to know that the margin atmosphere could actually be accomplishing this electrostatically would it be helpful to business let's put it that way right and and let's be clear about what we're talking about here this is not a case of just one or two happenstance instances of a miraculous cleaning by a gust of wind somehow clearing the dust from these rovers so that they can then reboot their power we're talking about cleaning after cleaning after cleaning extending the expected lifespans of these rovers from 90 days to a period going on now nine years it's absolutely amazing michael because the margin atmosphere is an incredible witness to the behavior of electrified wind or electric wind and so if there's any planet which we should be closely investigating the potential for electrostatic cleaning naturally it would be the planet mars this electrified atmosphere of mars needs to be a key part of the podcast that you're preparing now for the next few weeks because mars is giving us all kinds of indicators of the role of electricity in the natural environment of the planet it's one heck of a story right well there was also the recent trending news item relating to the global dust storms on mars and that is of course from your perspective an electrical phenomenon yeah the the dust devils on mars are so clearly electrical because you see them actually gathered in in bunches very tightly packed at the leading edge of storm fronts on mars this is a great topic in fact to just emphasize how we're failing to to see what is actually occurring on the planet you can't have dust devils which is what they're being called you can't have dust devils in a neutral electrical environment gathered close together at all because they require for their very existence a broad circle of atmospheric circulation so these are the kinds of things that i i think we'll want to look at and it does add up to one heck of a mystery for standard science right well again and in conclusion here and we're going to be keeping each of these segments relatively short we're going to be doing a series as i said on these ongoing martian mysteries but dave just to drive the point home again in conclusion with people i challenge anyone to point to an instance when their car has gotten cleaner on a windy day that is a very uh good point and i think the complementary point is that we we want to uh we want to emphasize that there's this huge divide between working scientists on the one hand who delivered these incredible uh technological achievements a divide between his army of working scientists and and the top-down ideological stagnation that we see i mean the the latter appears now to have virtually destroyed the inspiration in the sciences because all of the real paths of discovery have been shut down no sense of things yet to know no sense of true mysteries the only mystery that we find of late is the mystery was life once active on a surface it's really a crying shame but to always remember that the uh the inspiration and the rapport and the dedication and the conscientious work of the scientists who actually got these these instruments into space and onto planets this is an incredible and admirable achievement so it's it's very important that we keep perspective on this ideology is only a damaging science but the dedication of the working scientists is what we want to appeal to now well david this was a lot of fun i'm glad that we've done this first installment of a series of videos on these ongoing martian mysteries you talk about your hope to resonate with some appeal to the working scientists and we see the evidence of this happening now i know there are a number of highly accredited scientists who will be in attendance at the tipping point conference in albuquerque and i look forward to these ongoing broadcasts and ongoing investigations into these really fascinating martian mysteries we have a lot more work to do and this is going to be a lot of fun very good michael yes all right thank you very much david talbot and thank you the listeners for joining us yet again we have lots of breaking news continuously now to talk about stay tuned to our youtube channel youtube.com thunderboltsproject and keep checking back to thunderbolts.info for all the latest news and analysis on the electric universe thank you very much 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info Today, physicist Eugene Bagashov continues his analysis of the scientific missions to the asteroids Bennu and Ryugu respectively. As Eugene explained in the previous episode, one of the hypotheses scientists have proposed to explain a number of asteroid anomalies is that many asteroids are essentially "rubble piles." In fact, when asteroids have occasionally displayed dramatic and completely unexpected comet-like tails, the explanation astronomers have offered is that the so called rubble piles simply began spinning faster and faster, hurling material into space. However, as Eugene explains as he continues his discussion, the latest scientific data offers little support for the rubble-pile asteroid hypothesis. Let us now talk about the other issue, that is the spin of these asteroids. Currently, Ryugu has a spin period of 7.63 hours and Bennu of 4.29 hours. But here the interesting stuff begins. One thing that the researchers from Hayabusa2 Mission keep referring to is the hypothetical long-term trend in slowing down of the spin of Ryugu. In that way they are able to, more or less, explain on the basis of the rubble pile model, the surface slopes of the asteroid and also the distribution of boulders on its surface. And they attribute this hypothetical spinning down to the so called Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Razdievskii-Paddack effect or YORP. This effect basically implies that the irregular form of the asteroid leads to the imbalance in its thermal emission in different directions, which in turn causes the object to experience some very small torque, and on long timescales it might alter the rotational period quite a bit, introduce tilting of the spin axis, wobbling and other things like that. Well ok, perhaps, but let us look at Bennu now. Here we see not the hypothetical but actually observed spinning up of the asteroid. It has been derived from a series of ground- based observations, the earliest one being made in 1999, and now confirmed by the OSIRIS-REx data. Bennu is spinning faster and faster, losing about a second of spin period each century. That would mean that the doubling of the spin rate would happen in only 1.5 million years and the rubble-pile model used by the researchers in OSIRIS-REx team predicts that it would be incompatible with the stability of the asteroid. At this rate of spinning up, it should have been torn apart by centrifugal forces very long time ago. Perhaps the reasonable conclusion that should follow from that is that the body should be much younger than even ten million years but the researchers are obviously not happy with that conclusion, so to somehow cope with this, they invoke additional and not very plausible assumptions such as some unexplained long-term cycles of spinning up and spinning down etc. But that's not even the real problem. The problem is that they're trying to explain the observed spinning up of Bennu, with the same YORP effect that Hayabusa2 team is using to explain the hypothetical spinning down of asteroid Ryugu. It starts to make really little sense from that point. Now, it is true that theoretically, and I repeat ― theoretically, YORP might indeed lead to both spinning up and spinning down and that would depend mostly on the shape and orientation of the object, but the thing is that Bennu and Ryugu have almost exactly the same shape. More than that, they have almost the same orientation Take a look at this picture for example. Here I've plotted the orbits of inner solar system planets, that is; Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. On the next picture, I've added Bennu's orbit in darker blue and on the third picture, I've also added Ryugu's orbit in red. So if I now add here the orientations of their spin axes, you'd immediately understand what I mean. Numerically speaking, their spin axes differ less than 8 degrees so they're pointing almost in the same spot in the sky. Note also that they are both spinning backwards, just like Venus, here I've plotted all the other planets' spin axes. So from that I conclude that if YORP is indeed acting upon both of these asteroids, it should follow that it would have the same effect on both of them and therefore either Hayabusa2 or OSIRIS-REx team is wrong in interpreting their data or maybe even both of them, but since we're already looking at orbital diagrams, which I personally enjoy doing, let me note another thing that might not be immediately evident. Both these asteroids essentially, at some point of their orbits, cross the orbit of Earth. I have indicated these crossings with purple circles. In fact, both these asteroids might potentially impact Earth in the next couple of centuries, and I'm only mentioning this to support my next statement that in my opinion, the orbits of these objects might indicate that they actually originate from this area of the solar system and they're not some intruders from the inner asteroid belt. It would only seem logical that if they both originated from the catastrophes that involved, for example, planet Earth and Mars, or maybe Venus too, they wouldn't stray too far from the area where this catastrophe occurred. That would potentially explain why both these asteroids move roughly between Earth and Mars, even more so if one looks at the exact arrangement of the orbit of Ryugu, another fascinating thing would surface, that its perihelion is really well aligned with Earth's, if one discards the difference in orbital inclination. The coincidence is quite incredible, both Earth's and Ryugu's ecliptic longitude of perihelion is 102 degrees. Here I've shown the perihelia positions with thin black lines. Yes, potentially it is possible to explain all of that through some long-term gravitational interactions, tidal forces and resonances, and things like that, but remember that first we need to somehow drag these objects here from the inner asteroid belt without them being destroyed or thrown away into the outer system by these gravitational interactions. So maybe it would be reasonable to assume that these alignments are the result of these asteroids being born from some catastrophic processes involving the inner planets in the first place, maybe not even the Earth but the Moon for example, as I've noted that the spin axes of Bennu and Ryugu are almost exactly opposite to the Lunar spin axis depicted with grey arrow in this picture. There's only 4 to 5 degrees difference between them. OK, let's now return to the issue of the spin rate change. What are the options from the standpoint of electrical excavation of these bodies from planetary crusts? Of course, theoretically here YORP effect might also play a role so that explanation is possible, but at the same time I wish to repeat the points made in the previous video following from that paper with liquid droplets, that perhaps these objects continue to very slowly relax to a more spherical shape after being squashed by electrical forces during the time of their birth. In this case, as more and more matter moves closer to the spin axis, the angular momentum conservation would dictate that the body should spin faster and faster. If that is true, theoretically if we'd observe the objects long enough, we would see the very slow shrinking of their equatorial radii in favor of higher latitudes radii. Unfortunately however, we haven't been able to determine their shape with good enough precision previously. The mean value of ground-based radar observations gives a diameter of Bennu of 492 meters, while OSIRIS-REx shows a 490 meters of diameter, so one could say that indeed the Equator is shrinking, but the error bars of the first measurement are so big that they include the second value as possible too. And finally, at the moment I wouldn't even discount possible electromagnetic effects of spinning up the asteroid, especially if it's at least slightly magnetized. Its interaction with the solar wind plasma might potentially induce a torque that would spin it up or down depending on the field configuration. Now, let's discuss the surface properties of these asteroids. One thing that both Hayabusa2 and OSIRIS-REx teams indicate is the noticeable lack of small craters. They assume that it is the consequence of either the dynamic reshaping of the surface or of the presence of regolith, that is dust, that would quickly bury them. The problem with that however, is that both Ryugu and Bennu demonstrate some craters even in the equatorial region, which suggests that their equatorial bulges appeared before subsequent alteration of their surfaces and the surface hasn't completely relaxed ever since. But researchers themselves acknowledge, especially in case of Ryugu with its hypothetical spinning down, that the equatorial bulges should be really old so why didn't they also reshape during all these supposed hundreds of millions of years? Large craters also did not relax to the overall shape of their surroundings and their depth to diameter ratios of about 0.16 are consistent with other asteroids such as Eros and Vesta which have this parameter of about 0.15 but not in any way represent rubble piles. That seems not really consistent with a rubble pile hypothesis and perhaps indicates a higher internal strength of the underlying material than what is assumed by the researchers. Conversely, in the electrical scenario, some of the craters might have appeared due to plasma discharges on the surface as it was rebalancing its electric potential after the initial catastrophic event that has led to the formation of the body. So perhaps the deficit of small craters might be explained if one assumes that the strength of the surface is underestimated so that only really energetic processes would leave craters. And it doesn't really matter if we're talking about discharges or impacts here. It's quite peculiar that asteroid Ryugu has twice more large boulders than asteroid Itokawa per unit of area, but the same number of craters, and in the case of Bennu, the researchers themselves admit that these boulders and their complexity "...imply energetic events that far exceed what Bennu can support." The researchers actually sometimes start contradicting themselves and state that, "Evidence for structural strength includes Bennuis nonhydrostatic shape, the high-standing longitudinal ridges, the long linear grooves, and apparent mass wasting. A fluid-like hydrostatic shape ... with Bennu's density and rotation rate is not stable." So how then is, this supposedly rubble-pile object exists? Maybe it's not a rubble pile after all? With regards to the regolith, I should note that it seems that there is much less of it than what was assumed. For example, MASCOT lander has found no regolith where it landed on the surface of Ryugu and the same seems true for the photos from other two landers. It's definitely very rocky out there but also not very dusty. In fact, OSIRIS-REx team has been complaining in some of the papers that the abundance of rock and the deficit of pristine flat dusty areas might compromise the success of the mission, since initially they, "...hypothesized that, over time, gravel migration had built up the equatorial ridge that was apparent in the radar shape model. Even though the equatorial region is the geopotential low, it is in fact dominated by large concentrations of boulders with little apparent fine-grained regolith. Bennu does not contain the extensive patches of fine-grained regolith according to which we designed the mission." Other fascinating find is a relatively low values of thermal inertia, on average 350 for Bennu and 200 to 500 for Ryugu, where the units are joules, divided by meters squared, divided by Kelvin, divided by square root of a second. Compare that to some other similar objects' thermal inertia, for example asteroid Itokawa has 750 and the lowest thermal inertia documented in a meteorite is 770 in the meteorite Cold Bokkeveld. Basically, thermal inertia is a measure of how hard it is to heat up or cool down a body, so in my opinion, low values of thermal inertia of asteroids Bennu and Ryugu would imply a relatively good heat conduction and therefore a relatively strong internal structure, at least in the near surface layer that would allow the heat to be quickly transferred to and from the asteroids. Now, this is not a definite evidence for that per se, as the properties of boulders and even small amounts of dust covering the surface would also play a huge role in the measured value of thermal inertia, but coupled to some other hints that I've mentioned, in my opinion it provides a more or less coherent picture. Speaking of boulders, Hayabusa2 team acknowledges that they seem to be internally strong. I quote, "The shallower slope in the small size range suggests a non-negligible mechanical strength of individual boulders/pebbles on Ryugu." And also I quote, "...the boulders on Ryugu have survived impact processes during catastrophic disruption, the re-accumulation process and more recent impacts on Ryugu; they are not dust balls with little cohesion." So if these boulders are supposed to represent some primordial material and they demonstrate significant internal strength, why is the rest of these asteroids considered to be so weak? Maybe they aren't after all. We'll examine some more evidence for that in the next video and also talk about the recent finding of dust grains in space around Bennu. Stay tuned for part 3 
What follows is a look back at the progress of The Thunderbolts Project as of the 2018 year end. Since the inception of The Thunderbolts Project in 2012, we've experienced substantial and continuous growth, emerging as the leading voice of the Electric Universe movement. The many testaments to our growth would include five full-length documentaries all emphasizing the extraordinary role of the electric force in the natural world. Well over three hundred episodes of the highly rated video series Space News from the Electric Universe. The popular Thunderbolts Picture Of the Day or TPOD under the guidance of editor Stephen Smith offering wide-ranging factual and visual support of the Electric Universe. 39 episodes of the series Discourses on an Alien Sky exploring the extraordinary natural events from which the ancient myth-making epoch arose. And several international conferences sponsored by The Thunderbolts Project to bring together leading innovators in both the sciences and in the study of the ancient cultures. Also of interest to followers of The Thunderbolts Project, we should note the independently organized ongoing experiment called the SAFIRE project exploring the electric discharge patterns in the laboratory as possible corollaries to enigmatic features of the Sun and other bodies in space. As we settle into the new year, this is also a good time to reflect on the great surprises in space, as one discovery after another reinforces the core tenets of the electrical paradigm. Consider for example the recent findings in our own solar system where new discoveries have overturned long-standing beliefs about planetary origins and about comets, meteors and asteroids, even throwing into doubt many popular teachings about the Sun at the center of the system. According to electrical theorist Wal Thornhill and others, comets are not the assumed leftovers of a solar system formed from gravitational collapse and accretion billions of years ago. Comets, along with great multitudes of asteroids, meteoroids and other cosmic debris, were torn from planetary surfaces by powerful electric discharge in a prior more violent phase of solar system history. With a broad field of evidence now in front of us, the comet provides ideal opportunities to test key tenets of the Electric Universe paradigm. The truth is that close-up images of comet nuclei have revealed rocky desiccated surfaces, exactly as anticipated by electrical theorists. We now know that these bodies bear no resemblance at all to the dirty snowballs of traditional comet theory. In fact, the recently published scientific papers on the Rosetta mission to comet 67P, continue to confirm the predictions of the electric comet model. As we reported last year, comet specialists now acknowledge that 67P cannot be billions of years old as was commonly believed. It also seems clear that the double lobes and rocky terrain of 67P not only present insurmountable problems for a theoretical model once considered unassailable. Tellingly, many astronomers now suggest a remarkable collision of two such minuscule bodies across millions of miles, placing an exclamation point on the improbability of the underlying claim. If Electric Universe proponents are correct, the most fundamental scientific mistake in our time has been the exclusion of the electric force from events in space. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the blind assumption of cosmic neutrality affected the field of view within all of the space sciences. According to Thornhill and others, it was this intellectual confinement that prevented space scientists from seeing the electric force at work in the discharge activity of comets. And yet, as telescopes have expanded our view to thousands of exoplanetary systems of planets outside the solar system, nothing we have found is consistent with today's popular theory of cometary origins. The traditional nebular hypothesis suggests that comets were born billions of years ago in an imagined diffuse cloud of gas and dust, the very cloud from which stars are claimed to have been born. It was from that ideological foundation, the nebular hypothesis, that not only comet science but all of the planetary sciences emerged over the past century. More recently however, the entire ideological framework has been shattered by the surprising discovery of abundant planetary systems with so called 'Hot Jupiters' or gas giants bizarrely located in seemingly impossible proximity to their parent stars. In response to this surprise, astronomers now routinely point to evidence for large-scale planetary migration -- a radical departure from traditional theory. In the scenario most recently offered, theorists suggest that the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn formerly acted as so-called 'wrecking balls' plowing through the inner solar system to destroy the planetary order in its earlier evolutionary phase. Of course this conjecture, if accurate, could only add support to the radical claim of today's electrical theorists that chaos formerly reigned in the solar system. Not just billions of years ago, as now proposed, but extending into much more recent times to powerfully affect all of humanity. The result of such developments in the theoretical science has been a remarkable convergence of the Electric Universe movement with new perspectives on the origins of ancient thought. We are confident that those who investigate this convergence will find the doors opening to an unprecedented synthesis of ancient experience and modern science with a host of wonders and surprises along the way. 
welcome to space news from the electric universe brought to you by the thunderbolts project at Thunderbolts dot info on May 12th 2013 a series of powerful solar flares begin to erupt from sunspot AR 1748 over a period of 48 hours the sunspot produced a total of four x-class solar flares the most powerful type of solar flare known to science the proton storms that solar flares and CMEs sometimes produce can potentially affect life on Earth as evidenced by the one-hour radio blackout associated with its latest solar activity some CME's have astonished mainstream scientist by reaching the earth in a matter of minutes to understand the potential dangers of such events let us first consider the electrical model of the Sun this model says that the Sun is a highly charged ball of plasma the charge is reckoned to be somewhere around 10 to the 19th coulombs now CME is an event that for some reason indicates a rupture in this skin of the Sun and so the Sun kind of burps out a huge bubble of high energy high intensity plasma when this material streams away it's quite spectacular and it can be dangerous to life on the earth CME's are categorized into three categories a c-class low energy Class M class which is the lowest class that can really affect things on earth our radio transmission and satellites and so on and then the high energy class is the X class and X class CME's can be very dangerous you need to understand that there's almost in infinite directions from the Sun that things can go in and the earth is like this tiny little Bibi miles and miles away so we would almost never get hit by a rifle bullet fired from the Sun but since CME's come off in a huge bubble why we can be intersected but most CME's of course miss the earth now talking a little more about the structure of the Sun a salient point is that the Sun has a radial electrical field and gives off electrical particles which are called the solar wind and these things accelerate away from the Sun and when they pass the earth they are going 200 times as fast as they were when they left the Sun it's just absurd to think that there is anything other than an electrical field that can accelerate electrical particles in that fashion now one of the most dangerous aspects associated with some solar flares and some CMI's are what are called solar proton events and sometimes we can get a burst of proton particles called a proton storm and these can do great damage and they arrive not in one to three days but within fifteen to forty minutes this just amazes establishment science to gain perspective on the potential threat Assia me might pose to earth let us consider the historical precedent provided in 1859 by the Carrington event in 1859 two astronomers in England one in particular named carrington I happened to be watching the Sun and witnessed a huge flare and real strong brightening of visible light soon after witnessing that why then the earth experienced severe magnetic effects and at the time of course we did not have the same technology that we have today probably the highest level of technology that we had that was affected was the telegraph lines Telegraph service and those of course picked up what's called a geomagnetic induction current that caused some havoc with the Telegraph service and disrupted it partly at times during the event but also it allowed the operators to use the Telegraph equipment without the batteries being connected so a CME that engulfs the earth kind of buckles our double layer and it produces spectacular aurora in the north and the south the bad part is that an event of the magnitude of the Carrington event would in the blink of an eye send us back to the Bronze Age and here's why the modern power grid especially in the United States and the grids are similar elsewhere have power lines attached out overhead at distances criss-crossing nearly two hundred thousand miles this grid acts as a giant antenna system which would easily pick up the electric currents induced by a geomagnetic solar storm we've already experienced a sample of this when in 1989 Quebec experienced a power outage because of a CME the hydro-québec outage resulted from the malfunction of more than 15 discrete protective system operations from the initial event to complete blackout only one and a half minutes elapsed hardly enough time to assess what was occurring let alone to intervene the u.s. electrical system includes over 6,000 generating units more than 500,000 miles of bulk transmission lines approximately 12,000 major substations and innumerable lower voltage distribution transformers all of these can serve as potential geomagnetic induced current entry points from their respective ground connections so at high risk today is our network of extra high voltage transformers that operate approximately three hundred and forty thousand volts and above spread around the grid these house sized transformers cost around twelve million dollars and of course their manufacture is highly specialized and the replacement delivery time takes about a year and wouldn't you know they're manufactured in India and China Carrington event would bring down our grid which is very much our dated and it would generate powerful GICs or geomagnetic induced currents that would burn out these extra high voltage transformers the North American grid meltdown effects would be like this the monetary loss resulting from just a year long electrical blackout across half of the United States could easily be measured in trillions of dollars the loss of electricity disables much of our civilized life-support system including portable water production and delivery waste and sewage treatment and disposal refrigeration would go down hydrocarbon fuel production transport and delivery would cease to a large degree of course heating the modern heating equipment in residences and businesses are all initiated and controlled by electricity food production would be disrupted food storage transport delivery and preparation affected firefighting rescue and emergency service would be almost totally degraded communication because cell tower and cell phone functionality would be gone in a few hours television transmission would be a goner with only limited Radio surviving for those with battery receptivity financial transactions would be immediately limited to hard currency mode with the normal banking services completely lost computer telecommunication and network functionality almost completely gone and finally medical treatment severely hampered with medication supply to run out in about a month now harking back to the Carrington event that event was so severe people that were connected to the wires a telegraph system and other equipment were shocked if they were grounded some were stunned and the reports are that some were even killed so if we dropped everything if our government said forget about doing much of anything except let's all concentrate on getting our grid back up the most optimistic estimate is on the order of weeks or a few months because no business wants to have a stockpile of 12 million dollar house sized replacement units sitting around the US would be severely set back if we did have a Carrington event and put it into a global perspective if 50% of the electrical grid around the world went down we just probably wouldn't recover for a long long time we would be back in the Bronze Age so what to do NASA is currently implementing a project called Solar shield which is designed to provide warnings to vital systems after an earth affecting CME occurs since CMEs take one to four days to reach us from the Sun an early warning system has some possibility of ameliorating the effects if we were really wise we would shut down and disconnect vulnerable equipment but that's a massive step to take in disrupting the whole fabric of our lives and the fabric of our businesses on just the possibility that those things are going to be at risk and going to be affected also at risk is satellite functionality that would further eliminate communicational capability the Global Positioning Systems would go down I will leave it to your imagination to think about doing without electricity for three months or longer for continuous updates on space news from the electric

You have just entered the theater of an alien sky. If the words and images seem strange to you, there's a reason for this - our world was once a vastly different place. To experience this won't hurt you and there is nothing to fear. This little video will be the first in a series looking at celestial events that changed human history and catalyzed the birth of the great civilizations. Nothing I'll propose in this series will be found in familiar text books but the events can be confirmed by factual evidence. That means fundamental facts that are not in dispute. It happened just a few thousand years ago when we lived in the presence of the gods. Planetary powers ruled the celestial theater in the lost age of gods and wonders. Planets gathered in close congregation, as if alive, engaging each other electrically. But then the gods grew violent and they went to war, driving human witnesses to take shelter in caves and rocky enclosures. Humans left to remember - to remember the powers of the gods - formations and cosmic events not to be forgotten. Yes, how could we know how? How could we know that extraordinary natural phenomena in the sky above our early ancestors provoked an outpouring of human imagination? Of course, the ancient witnesses did not understand and they relentlessly misinterpreted their experience, but this experience was the most awe-inspiring and terrifying occasion in all of human history. Every ancient monument was, by it's very nature, commemorative. Every crowning of a king, every sacred marriage, every sacrifice to the gods, every sacred temple and city, every obelisk, pyramid and tower re-enacted a critical juncture in a remembered age of gods and wonders. This truth comes down to us without exception. And the over-riding, fatal mistake in modern perception is the assumption that the mythic archetypes can somehow find their explanation in phenomena occurring today. But the events that provoked the global archetypes, and the entire symbolic content of the first civilizations can be systematically reconstructed. Rational and well-established principles will enable us to draw reliable conclusions from a crowd of unreliable witnesses. That's the long-overlooked truth of the matter, and it's that message I intend to confirm in this video series. Not that long ago our world was, indeed, a very different place. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info In the first five installments of this series, we outlined some of the most compelling evidence that the role of electromagnetism throughout the cosmos is vastly more significant than modern space science has ever entertained. So far, we have explored this question through an examination of the highest- energy electromagnetic phenomena at the vastest scales throughout the cosmos. We now move our attention to our own celestial neighborhood and the dynamic interactions between the Sun and all of the bodies which move within its electrical domain. Today we'll explore why planetary electrical discharges are the 6th of 10 reasons why the Universe is electric. Charged Planets in the Inner Solar System At no time in history have human beings been more dependent on electricity for everyday functioning and survival. On Earth, electricity's significance both for society and in nature, seems self-evident. Yet in the Space Sciences many strange and outdated notions about Earth's atmospheric and weather phenomena endure, despite an ever growing wealth of scientific data. It was in the early 20th century that the Norwegian experimentalist Kristian Birkeland correctly hypothesized that electric currents from the Sun power the Earth's auroras. For many decades, the scientific mainstream largely rejected the thesis favoring instead the idea that Earth's magnetosphere is an impenetrable envelope "squeezed" by the solar wind to induce auroral activity. Only when satellites detected the magnetic signatures of electric currents in the aurora in 1973, was Birkeland's hypothesis irrefutably validated though even today many scientists still resist the implications of the discovery. In testing his ideas about the Earth-Sun connection, Birkeland built a vacuum chamber and placed a magnetized metal ball called a terrella inside it, representing the Earth. He observed how the terrella behaved in its artificial electrically charged atmosphere. In addition to solving the riddle of Earth's auroras, Birkeland's electrical experiments also uncannily simulated planetary rings and the energetic displays of cometary jets. More than a century after Birkeland's polar expedition to investigate the Northern Lights, mainstream scientists still express surprise or even astonishment when they observe the tell-tale signs of electrical circuitry connecting the Earth and the Sun. Of course, the Earth is the most well-studied celestial object and much has been learned about its electrical environment. The Space Age has brought a much greater understanding of the Earth's upper atmosphere and ionosphere as well as the inner and outer radiation belts. With greater technological data, the challenges for planetary scientists to explain discovery have only increased. Lightning is the most powerful electrical phenomenon on our world. In near the end of the 20th century and continuing today, terrestrial lightning has held new surprises for atmospheric scientists. As far back as the 1960's, some airline pilots reported their observations of powerful electrical discharges that appeared to originate above thunder clouds, reaching towards space. It wasn't until the early 1990's that scientists were able to verify the phenomenon definitely exists including blue jets, seen exploding from thunder clouds, and enormous red sprites, even higher in the upper atmosphere. Scientists today acknowledge that the phenomenon remains mysterious but amazingly, above-clouds-lightning was in fact predicted nearly a century ago. In the 1920's, the Scottish physicist C.T.R. Wilson predicted the existence of brief flashes of light above large thunderstorms. On the cause of the phenomena, an important clue was uncovered in 2001. A physicist named Professor Edgar Bering flew a high-altitude balloon above a thunderstorm. He made the unexpected discovery that when lightning strikes occur above and below the clouds, the electrical charge was already present and did not take time to build up between lightning strikes. This contradicts the standard notion that lightning is a generator of the clear-air electric field measured at about 100 V/m between the Earth and the clear sky. Bering wrote on his findings that sprites and jets "...may be an essential element of the Earth's global electrical circuit." However, physicist Wal Thornhill notes of the standard scientific literature on our planet's 'Global Electrical Circuit', "As big as the term 'global' sounds, the circuit is too restricted. It is a circuit that assumes heat-driven convection in clouds is the global electricity generator. This generator mysteriously separates electric charge in storm clouds to power world-wide currents. However, the circuit is 'unplugged'. It is isolated from electrical connection with anything else in the universe. Such a lack of a holistic or cosmic-scale vision is a fundamental constraint on theorists." In the Electric Universe, the ultimate circuitry driving atmospheric and weather phenomena is the electric current system connecting planets and the Sun. In recent years, it has become increasingly evident that the Sun affects our own planet's atmosphere and weather in ways that standard theorists had never imagined. In 2014, we reported on the discovery that charged particles from the Sun appear linked to increased lightning on Earth. According to an article on the Institute of Physics website, a team of scientists, "...found a substantial and significant increase in lightning rates across Europe for up to 40 days after the arrival of high-speed solar winds." And indeed, the ramifications of the confirmation of Kristian Birkeland's thesis on the Earth's auroras become more and more evident with each new discovery. Earlier this year, the ESA Swarm mission reported the groundbreaking discovery of "supersonic plasma jets" high up in Earth's atmosphere which can push temperatures up to 10,000ºC. A phys.org report on the discovery stated, "The theory that there are huge electric currents, powered by solar wind and guided through the ionosphere by Earth's magnetic field, was postulated more than a century ago by Norwegian scientist Kristian Birkeland... While much is known about these current systems, recent observations have revealed that they are associated with large electrical fields." The existence of Birkeland currents in space is now confirmed by scientific discovery. But of course, many differences remain between the standard interpretation and predictions and those of the Electric Universe. The notion that celestial objects cannot have an excess of charge is a guiding principle of astronomy. Yet as Thunderbolts' colleague, Dr. Michael Clarage, explained in his 2014 presentation 'Earth's Electric Environment', "Overall charge neutrality is not really the point. A battery that you hold in your hand has no overall charge on it. But the point is that we've separated the charge in it so it can do work." And as we will see as we continue, charge exchange between celestial bodies seen most dramatically between the Sun and the planets in its domain, is the most promising explanation for many spectacular atmospheric phenomena that remain unexplained in standard astronomy. As we turn our attention to our planetary neighbors, we see the need for a new understanding of all forms of lightning on our own world. When the, then Soviet Union's, Venera probes touched down on the planet Venus more than half a century ago, they recorded surprising evidence of lightning that was much more frequent and powerful than earthly lightning. Yet Venus has no water clouds which means that the electrical discharges traversed directly from the ionosphere to the ground. In a scientific paper on the Venera discoveries, planetary scientist professor Donald Hunten wrote: "The indications are that lightning is likely to occur in any substantial planetary atmosphere. Theories of electrification are faced with the need to explain its presence under a wide variety of circumstances and atmospheric conditions." The so-called "strange magnetic ropes" detected in Venus's atmosphere are evidence of its electrical connection to the Sun which is more direct than the Earth's. The mysterious ropes' twisted filamentary structure reveals the electric currents required to sustain the detected magnetism. Incoming electrical currents open the doorway to explain many mysterious atmospheric and weather phenomena on Venus. In 2006, the ESA's Venus Express satellite recorded the astonishing images of a twin cyclone above Venus's south pole. For reasons that still elude planetary scientists, the cyclone structure constantly evolves and it appears to be a permanent fixture at the South Pole. However, we see not the first instance when science discovery has confirmed a seemingly preposterous prediction of the Electric Universe theory. In 2005, when scientists using the Keck Observatory discovered a warm vortex at the South Pole of Saturn, Thornhill made a prediction that could only seem preposterous from a conventional viewpoint. He wrote: "The Electric Universe predicts, experimentum crucis, that BOTH poles should be hot, not one hot and the other cold." In 2008, NASA's Cassini scientists were astonished to discover a mysterious hot spot at Saturn's north pole. This was astonishing because the freezing pole had been deprived of sunlight for over 12 years. On Venus, twin tornadoes have been observed at both poles. This is important, because the Electric Universe states that the Sun's electrical input generally occurs at the poles of planets which we usually see in the form of auroras. As we see, the constantly shifting structure of the south polar vortex seems strikingly reminiscent of the spiral galaxies' forms reproduced by plasma scientist Dr. Anthony Peratt's simulations of two current filaments interacting in a plasma. In the Electric Universe, the incoming electrical currents are also the driver of Venus's mysterious superfast winds which are difficult for conventional meteorology to explain. Cloud movement show a four-day rotation period of the upper atmosphere at the equator which declines to two days toward the poles. Within the framework of standard theory, no force is present to drive the upper winds around the planet at such a speed since Venus itself has a rotational period of 243 days retrograde and the planet's lower winds are exceptionally sluggish. Since the planet is the same temperature overall, there is no temperature gradient to drive these winds either. In recent years, it was reported that the superfast winds of Venus have actually been steadily accelerating for a decade. This is explained through analogy to the simplest electrical motor called a Faraday disk motor. The Faraday disk motor requires only a magnetic field and a disk conductor or something symmetrical. When a current is directed inward to the poles of the object and out at the equator, it will cause the object to rotate. We note that while the Venusian winds were found to be accelerating, scientists found that the planet's rotation was mysteriously slowing down. In the Electric Universe theory as developed by Wal Thornhill, the deposition or extraction of charge from an object will change its mass, and therefore its rotation rate which has been observed on Earth in small changes of the Earth's rotation called glitches, when we receive a large blast of charged particles from the Sun. On Venus, both the accelerating winds and the planet's slowing rotation could be due to a variation in the incoming electrical current flow. As we turn our attention to Mars, mysterious wind and atmospheric phenomena again point to the planet's dynamic interactions with its electrical space environment. Mars has an atmosphere only around 0.5% as dense as Earth's so it has been a puzzle for decades why powerful dust storms sometimes encompass the entire planet. How is the dust removed from the soil and accelerated into massive clouds, sometimes up to hundreds of miles per hour in the near vacuum of the Martian atmosphere? Adding to the mystery, when the most dramatic dust-storm ever seen on the planet occurred, it involved packed congregations of dust devils, a completely unexpected feature in standard meteorology. In conventional theory, an atmospheric vortex requires a vastly larger circulation of wind than what is clearly seen in edge-on pictures of storm fronts on Mars. Electrically speaking, what produces a global Martian dust storm and other tremendous dust-raising events on the Red Planet? To begin to get an idea, let us consider the dust devils seen in association with the global storms. The so-called dust devils on Mars are so enormous and energetic, they routinely dwarf Earthly tornadoes. A NASA press release describes a typical Martian dust devil as a, "...monster column towering kilometers high and hundreds of meters wide, 10 times larger than any tornado on Earth." The reason meteorologists call them "dust devils" instead of tornadoes, is because they are not associated with water-laden storm clouds which don't exist on Mars. The powerful electric fields associated with dust devils, both on Mars and on Earth, are now acknowledged in scientific literature. But meteorologists can only look to solar heating, air convection and dust particle friction as their cause. The electrical nature of the tornadic dust fountains on Mars may be better understood through an examination of their cousins, water spouts. A great breakthrough in understanding water spouts came from the work of Russian plasma physicist V.A. Rantsev-Kartinov. From his investigation, he concluded that these phenomena are the result of a long-lasting discharge current between the plasma networks of a water surface and the electrical charge of the clouds above. Both the rotation and the narrow coherent and undulating funnels of water spouts are thus explained in terms of plasma discharge behavior. All of this relates to the unfounded assumption of planetary scientists that mechanical processes must separate charge wherever they see electrical activity. The Electric Universe's counter viewpoint on Martian wind and weather is summarized in a 2005 Thunderbolts Picture Of the Day article. It states: "Since Mars has no thunderstorms to 'charge-up its ionosphere', it should present a good case study of the Electric Universe. The electrical model predicts that the Martian ionosphere is indeed charged, and it posits no isolated dynamo to 'separate charge'. On Mars, electrical effects will reach directly from the ionosphere to the surface without the ameliorating leakage via storm clouds that we see on Earth. Unlike radiant energy from the Sun, electrical energy can accumulate in the 'planetary capacitor' for some time, with a potential for planet-altering events when the atmosphere finally 'breaks down' and massive discharge activity is initiated." The Thunderbolts article also offered the following prediction: "The intensity and number of dust devils will be affected by solar outbursts and the planet's elliptical orbit." In fact, in recent years the electrical interpretation of dramatic Martian dust-raising events has been stunningly confirmed. In 2012, amateur astronomers first spotted seemingly inexplicable plumes rising hundreds of kilometers above the surface of Mars. In 2016, scientists using the Mars Express spacecraft discovered something completely unexpected to planetary scientists. A coronal mass-ejection hit Mars immediately before the plume was first spotted. The leader of a team of scientists said of the discovery, "It's very surprising that was affecting Mars right before the plume was first observed." And of course, the electrical nature of the event seems undeniable. The 2016 New Scientist report states: "One possibility is that plasma could be interacting with ice grains or dust lower down in the atmosphere and electrically charging them, boosting them higher, but it's not clear how the effect would be big." An analogue to the Martian dust raising events might be the electrostatic dust storms that are now known to occur on the Moon when it encounters the Earth's magnetotail once a month. We also note that when the largest global dust storm on Mars began in 2001, Mars had reached opposition and was the closest that had been to Earth in about 12 years. As noted at the beginning of this video, planetary scientists are only now recognizing the pervasive electric current systems on our own planet which were postulated more than a century ago by Kristian Birkeland. Of course on Mars, far less is known but NASA's MAVEN mission has provided important new data and insights. One of many surprising findings was characterized as follows in a 2015 NASA press release: "NASA's... (MAVEN) spacecraft has observed two unexpected phenomena in the Martian atmosphere: an unexplained high-altitude dust cloud and aurora that reaches deep into the Martian atmosphere... The presence of the dust at orbital altitudes from about 93 miles to 190 miles above the surface was not predicted." As mission scientist Laila Anderson stated, "If the dust originates from the atmosphere, this suggests we are missing some fundamental process in the Martian atmosphere." Also surprising to MAVEN scientists was the discovery of a highly energetic glowing aurora that reaches shockingly deep into the Martian atmosphere. As one team member stated, "What's especially surprising about the aurora we saw is how deep in the atmosphere it occurs -- much deeper than at Earth or elsewhere on Mars. The electrons producing it must be energetic." As the NASA press release explains, "MAVEN's Solar Energetic Particle instrument detected a huge surge in energetic electrons at the onset of the aurora." Today, within the Electric Universe community, experimental research such as that which Birkeland pioneered, continues. Through simple experiments with electric fields, we see the routine replication of many atmospheric, weather and geological phenomena. These experimental analogs place the endless surprising space discoveries in an entirely new light and emphasize the desperate need for a new perspective in planetary science. One which recognizes charge exchange between celestial bodies. In our next installment of this series, we will turn our attention to the gas giants in the outer solar system whose dynamic electrical environments offer further testimony that the Universe is electric.

Welcome to the Electricity of Life, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info In part 1 of this presentation, our guest Dawson Church discussed his remarkable investigation into the role of consciousness in one's physical well-being. In his book 'Mind to Matter' Dawson cites voluminous scientific research which suggests that our minds can profoundly affect our bodies and even the external world. Emotions can be "stored" in the body and over time can lead to imbalance and illness. In this conclusion, Dawson begins by addressing the notion, which is highly controversial in Western medicine, that energy exists in the body and can aid in healing. I've read critics, for example, who say there's no plausible role for energy in biology or in medicine or in healing and when I read those comments, I think hey guy, have you ever looked at an MRI of our magnetic field? Our EEG is reading our electrical field, it's reading the electro-activity of the brain. You can measure those fields of the body, 15 feet up from the body with a simple device. I carry a little pocket device called the galvanometer with me when I go to conferences or to do the demonstrations and in just a few seconds I can show where your acupuncture points are because they have a different electrical charge than the skin around them. So we are energy beings and MRI’s, EEGs, all these things, use those phenomena to diagnose and to treat people who are sick, so they're energy medicine too, energy shifts produce dramatic changes in cells and in bodies and again, I have a lot of these stories in Mind toMatter, a lot of these studies in Mind to Matter. There's lots of case histories, lots of evidence, there are lots of randomized controlled trials. On our nonprofit website, we have over 600 studies, people healing from anything, from Alzheimer's to ADHD to obesity to kidney disease to metabolic failure, all kinds of healing studies. are people who use energy therapies like Reiki, like EFT, energy medicine, Johrei, therapeutic touch and so on and so yeah, this isn't, you know, three studies, this is over a thousand studies cumulatively of these kinds of techniques and they show that energy therapies are, not only are they often effective, they're often effective really quickly. Dawson explores in 'Mind to Matter' the scientific research of Dr. Bill Bengston which showed remarkable effects of quote 'energy healing' in many laboratory experiments. While The Thunderbolts Project, as always, takes no position on these questions, we asked Dawson to enumerate the findings of Dr. Bengston’s studies. Yeah, Bill is unique because there are a lot of animal trials, Bill's method which is called cycling. It's the energy healing technique where people hold their hands over a human being or over an animal and they do a mental process that is designed to shift the energy of the disease and Bill's work is unique because there are now 13 randomized controlled trials that various people have done of his method on, usually on mice and the usual way these experiments are done is that the mice were injected with a substance that causes them to develop cancer and they develop these large mammary cancers which eventually crush the organs and they die in usually 15 to 20 days. The longest a mouse has ever survived in these trials is 21 days. And in Bill's research, in the research of Bill's method, just a study after, he finds that these mice heal. These mice heal and not only do they heal from those cancers, they did live out the full lifespan of a mouse, which is about two years, and they're immune to cancer after that as well. In one really cool trial I report in Mind to Matter, they had Bill sending energy to a group of mice at a distant location and they were measuring the electromagnetism in the room right below the cage that held the mice. And so, at random intervals a buzzer was sound in Bill's home a long way away, he would then send energy to this cage of mice in a room at a university, distantly, and then there are other mice in other cages in other parts of the university but only one, which was in a room painted green, that he was targeting. So mice in the green room got energy from Bill, the mice in the red and purple rooms, different parts of the campus, didn't get that and they had this magnetometer underneath the cage and at the very moments when there were those signals for Bill to send energy to those mice, the magnetometer fluctuated by about 25 percent so massive shifts in electromagnetism, this is an energy field. It supposed to be totally stable at any geographical point on the Earth's surface, and energy fluctuated hugely and only at the very moment when Bill sent energy to mice in the green room and the magnetometers in the purple and red rooms were unaffected. So energy heals, there's so much evidence for this that I really urge people to use energy approaches, they're not invasive, there are no bad side effects, they don’t hurt your body, in fact in one review I cover in the book in Mind to Matter, I show that there are 175 studies published over the last 50 years showing the beneficial effects of various energy therapies on our bodies and these  effects Nare not small. Stem cells regenerating, stem cells adhering to diseased tissue and repairing it, telomeres lengthening, enzymes that are helpful to our metabolism--increasing in amounts; stress hormones, like cortisol-- decreasing, immune factors like immunoglobulins increasing, all of these things happening on the basis of energy treatments. So even though it's energy, its producing massive shifts to the physical material of our bodies. When I began to look at the science of how our consciousness affects the world around us, I thought I would find a few suggestive studies. What I was surprised at was how many things I found and what they show. And so it turns out that there is evidence, either subjective evidence or really solid evidence, that our consciousness, human consciousness affects the four fundamental forces of physics and those are electromagnetism, gravity, the strong nuclear force that holds the atom together, and also the weak nuclear force which is measured in the radioactive decay of uranium, plutonium, americium, francium, all of those elements, they give off these particles and then degenerate over the course of years. That is the weak nuclear force, but there's evidence that all four of these forces are affected by human awareness and the most interesting practical studies I talk about in the book are those conducted on water. And so, water is a very simple molecule, it has one big oxygen atom, two small hydrogen atoms attached to it and the bonding angle between those three atoms is 104.5  degrees and that's just a constant, it's been measured for close to a century, we know the angle at which those two hydrogens join that big oxygen, is always 104.5 degrees. That's just a fact, so one of the most intriguing studies was done looking at that bonding angle after water had been blessed by a Healing Touch practitioner. So the practitioner held his hands over the vial or glass of water, didn't actually touch it but held his hands near it, had the intention of healing flowing through his hands and then the water was measured again. And that bonding angle between those two hydrogens changed from 104.5 degrees to less than that. There was a substantial change in the actual molecular structure of water that was blessed by a healer. Then in another series of studies, researchers took water that had been blessed and used it to water plants and they found that the plants that had been watered with blessed water, grew much faster, much stronger, had a higher chlorophyll content than those that were watered with control water. And so it looks from these kinds of trials that we are literally able to shift, purely by intention, the molecules at least of water around us. Now, there's other research which I talk about in the book showing that we can affect DNA and this series of phases was really intriguing because they had people intend to change the configuration of DNA and DNA of course is a double helix, has certain degree of twist, it looks like a ladder but a twisted ladder and the amount of twist, the degree of twist in a sample of DNA can be measured using some elaborate equipment, so researchers said to these volunteers in the study they said, ok, here's a beaker containing human DNA and we want you to make that DNA twist tighter and so these people sat there in the room at the beaker thinking of DNA, focused their attention on the DNA to put the twist tighter, the scientists measured the DNA after the attention, nothing happened. But then they had those volunteers enter a deeply coherent state so when you're meditating, when you're in deep meditation, your heart rhythm becomes coherent, your brain rhythm becomes coherent and those entrain your whole body. When those coherent people projected their attention into the DNA flask, the DNA did indeed twist tighter. So then, the researchers (they) did a whole series of these experiments and then said ok, we'll leave you three vials of DNA. So they're across the lab, you see there's a middle one, there's a left hand one, there's a right hand flask of DNA, identical samples of DNA. We want you to intend to twist the one, the DNA in the middle flask tighter and leave the flask on the right and the left untouched. And again, when they weren't in coherence then it happened, when they were in coherence, they changed the middle flask but not the two other flasks. The researchers then said ok, let's see if this is an effect, an artifact of your own individual energy field, let's move these things 50 miles away. They then put the three beakers 50 miles away, they then said okay, now we want you to change the twist at only the right-hand one, and not the other two and the meditators were able to do that. So here we have human attention literally affecting the conformation of the DNA molecule and if that isn't exciting, think that your thoughts, your consciousness, your degree of coherence is literally shifting molecules, distantly away from your body in the next group, 50 miles away, in the case of one Chi master 1,200 kilometers away, the effect was still seen so this is really amazing that science is now giving us the tools to show these effects and we're just at the dawn, of being able to use them therapeutically and for human good. 
"...All the stories, characters and adventures narrated by mythology concentrate on the active powers among the stars, who are the planets." Episode 1 Symbols of an Alien Sky The dance of the planets So regular and predictable, one may think they've moved like this forever What a contrast to things claimed by the first astronomers of ancient Mesopotamia and numerous cultures that followed! They watched planetary motions with a compulsive fear. Why would diligent astronomers insist that the planets were the towering gods of a prior time? Planets ruled the destiny of kings and kingdoms and they were the agents of doomsday, the End of the World. What was it about planets that inspired such reverence and fear? The Babylonian priest astronomer Berossus said that planets, moving on different courses than today, produced world catastrophe. In Greek, Roman and Gnostic thought, this was ekpyrosis, a catastrophic meeting of the planets. But the memory of planetary disorder is echoed by numerous ancient sources. Plato expressed it, and so did Zoroastrian texts. The Hindu Mahabharata, Taoist teachings, and the Chinese Bamboo Books. Far from the spotlight, today, researchers are exploring these questions of planetary history. They bring wide ranging backgrounds from comparative mythology to planetary science and plasma physics All are asking if the solar system may have been unstable in the past, alive with electrical activity? Allow this question to be asked and the doors open to a new understanding of the past, a planetary history, and the rise of Civilization itself. Monumental Cultures "What is normal in nature and society rarely exites the myth-making imagination, which is more likely to be kindled by the abnormal, some startling catastrophe..." When we hear the word "civilization," most of us think of new technology, economic advances, rapid communication and expansive metropolitan vistas. But earlier civilizations are much different, and they pose a mystery yet to be resolved. Early civilizations were obsessed with the past. All looked back to extraordinary events, to an age of gods and wonders. All insisted that powerful gods ruled for a time, then went away. Monumental cultures arose, and the monuments themselves meant much more than a display of technical skill. A monument commemorates something collectively remembered. It was obsessive acts of remembering that shaped the early civilizations. From the cities of Egypt stretched along the Nile to those of the Fertile Crescent of Mesopotamia. From India to Southeast Asia and China and no less so in the Americas. From the early predecessors of the Aztecs and the Maya to the archaic cultures of the central Andes. All reveal a desperate urge to recover something lost. Egyptian priests called this lost epoch "The Age of the Primeval Gods." It began with the rule of an earlier sun-god, Atum who later departed. Cuneiform texts speak of the god An, who ruled with terrifying splendor, then fled the scene. The Greeks celebrated the lost age of Kronos, but he too was replaced by another power, the towering Zeus. Sages of India likewise remembered the rule of Brahma, though the god progressively faded into the background. So too, the Chinese Cheng Di and Huang Di The Aztec Ometeotl and the Mayan Itzamna All either departed for remote regions or faded from their original prominence. Remembering the Gods "The broad spectrum of cultural responses to cataclysmic events attest to the profoundly unsettling impact chaotic events in the skies may have had." Through festivals and symbolic rites, the cultures remembered the lives of the gods. With every temple construction, every sacrifice, every harvest, every installation of a king, every royal marriage, every New Year festival, the celebrants reenacted critical turns in the lives of the gods themselves. Were you to remove the stories of the gods, there would be no cultural content left in the early civilizations. Who were the gods? And why did the early astronomers declare that the most powerful gods were planets? Here's a clue: The mythic accounts are punctuated by terror and cosmic violence. Urgent prayers and hymns reenacted the deaths or ordeals of great gods, recounting how one world age passed violently into another. "...modern astronomical evidence does not support the common supposition that the night sky has been unchanging for 5,000 years." At least some of the artistic and mythological themes will be familiar to you. The myth of Paradise or the Golden Age, for example, a perfect time before a descent into cosmic disaster. An exemplary sun, revered as the King of the World, ruling before the present Sun. A Mother Goddess, a symbol of beauty and of life A great warrior or a hero born from the womb of that very goddess to rescue the world from monsters. That are also unexplained. Dragons in the Air "Although people have been probing into facts and stories about the dragon for hundreds of years, the dragon has yet elluded final interpretations." Perhaps there's no better example of an unexplained mythical theme than the serpent or dragon. This remarkable creature with origins in prehistoric times has no counterpart in the biological world, yet it was remembered on every habitable continent and persisted across the millennia into modern times. Well, we can find amusement in the comic book versions of this monster, but nothing in nature today will explain the dragon's long, flowing hair, its fiery breath, its beard, its twin whiskers, its wings or effusive feathers, or its global occurrence as twins, or its global association with lightning. Thousands of years after its prehistoric birth, the monster continues to linger in human fantasy, it will not go away. But ask yourself, how could the dragon archetype have arisen without provocation? And should we not wonder if uniquely modern prejudices are the primary reason the mystery remains unsolved. With one voice, every ancient culture insisted that our world was once a much different place. PLASMA FORMATION IN THE SKY "Are all these legends a confused account of great events on a planetary scale which were beheld in terror simultaneously by men scattered everywhere over the word?" Several thousand years ago events of beauty and terror provoked an explosion of human imagination. This was the myth-making epoch of human history. First came the enchanted realm, the theater of venerated gods and goddesses. The gods were prodigious. Their celestial habitat towered over the world, a model for temples and commemorative monuments on Earth. But the gods grew capricious, one celestial power metamorphosed into another. Preposterous creatures never seen on Earth roamed the sky. The gods turned violent as heaven itself fell into chaos. Then celestial warriors and monsters appeared to battle in the heavens wielding weapons of thunder, and fire, and stone. Our challenge will be to account for this outpouring of mythic content. Meeting the Archetypes "Past cultures wordwide often shared in a single cosmic vision, and we must not let our own present fragmented fields of knowledge hinder out attempt to recapture that vision." The eminent psychoanalyst Carl Jung called these deep patterns "The Archetypes." He saw them as universal structures of the unconscious, lying beyond rational or scientific explanation. ARCHETYPE: Dragon-slayer Yes, the myths seem incomprehensible to us, but the Archetypes offer a pathway through the confusion, they are the points of agreement between the far-flung cultures. And this agreement rises above the carnival of confusion and contradiction. ARCHETYPE: Pillar or Mountain of the Gods Every major culture remembered a Cosmic Mountain around which the Heavens turned. ARCHETYPE: Angry Goddess And every culture chronicled the terrible aspect of the Mother Goddess. Were there no common experience, the archetypal agreement would not even be possible. ARCHETYPE: Ouroboros, the enclosing serpent All that is required here is a willingness to meet the archetypes and without fear or prejudice or any advanced assumptions, to hear their message. ARCHETYPE: Ladder to Heaven The existence of hundreds of archetypes is a fact, and it is a fact as well that no archetype speaks for natural events occuring today, not a single one. ARCHETYPE: Dying God At the Dawn of Civilization all of the Archetypes were already present. "...The extreme preoccupation of most early societies with celestial imagery... appears to be part of a world wide phenomenon." "Could the prehistoric 'sky' have been much more active than now?" Today, we are fascinated by the monumental scale of the antique civilizations. But what were the essential memories that drove the monumental cultures so obsessively? The threads of evidence trace deep into the prehistoric past, a world barely recognized but not entirely lost. More than ten thousand years ago, Paleolithic artists painted these images on the walls of Lascaux cave in France. They were realists, with an exceptional eye for detail. Why these talented artists of the Stone Age disappeared remains a mystery. But the greater mystery is the epoch that followed. It seems that Neolithic artists lost the ability to depict nature as we know it. Accurate representations of nature are present, but the dominant style produced a carnival of ghostly creatures and absurd forms never seen in our world. How did this tendency arise? Not in one landalone but on every habitable continent. Absurd? Yes, but what provoked the distinctive patterns? A stick man with no head, just a duck or other bird on his shoulders? Hundreds of variations on this theme occur in the American Southwest. But the pattern doesn't end there. Notice the twin dots on the two sides of these crudely crafted stick figures. One instance alone is just a curiosity but the widespread patterns must have an explanation. And other details only accent the irrationality. Recently an answer to these mysteries came from outside traditional archaeology, from plasma science and laboratory experiments with electric discharge. Plasma scientist Anthony Peratt of Los Alamos laboratories has shown that these stick forms recorded electrical events in the sky. Something like the Northern Lights we see today but a thousand times more energetic. And he matches the rock art forms precisely to the configurations taken by electric discharge in the laboratory. The rock art images are explained as sheets of intense electric current in the evolution of a plasma discharge. The central column you see in this stylized representation is the axis of the discharge. Wrapped around the axis is a torus or donut-like tubular sheet of charged particles. The observer sees through the transparent formation: champagne glass above, squashed bell-shape below, so the plasma density is greatest at the limbs. Drawn in two dimensions, the formation matches the stick man carved globally on stone by the thousands. The two dots under the stick man's arms are the exceedingly bright high-energy radiation called synchrotron radiation, emitted from the center of the torus. The current sheets continually warp as the electric discharge progresses and this form is not uncommon. A two dimensional representation might look like this. Peratt's work has shown that the stick man, the duck headed version of the American Southwest and variations from Hawaii to Saudi Arabia is a plasma discharge formation, a subject on which he's an acknowledged world expert. Peratt's investigation is entirely independent from our own. Thousands of rock art images have enabled a supercomputer to identify formations as seen from different positions on Earth. The fit that he has documented can not be accidental. And yet our own investigation, which preceded Peratt's by almost three decades, converges with his in extraordinary ways as I shall clarify in the second episode of this series. For scholars and scientists as a whole, rock art remains an unsolved mystery. For two hundred years experts have debated over the vast library of images on stone. Definitive considerations are now in hand, calling for a new perspective One that follows the compelling evidence for high-energy electrical events in the ancient sky. And those who pursue this line of investigation must not be afraid to ask how the movements of planets may have contributed to an electrified cosmic environment, of which science knew nothing only a few decades ago. IMMANUEL VELIKOVSKY Is it possible that a fundamental mistake has crept into the sciences? Today we witness an unshakable confidence in the regularity of planetary motions, but is this confidence truly justified? I need to take you back about thirty-seven years. That was when the controversial theorist Immanuel Velikovsky lit a fire for me. He was the author of the book "Worlds in Collision," first published in 1950, and several other books that followed. In these books he reinterpreted both planetary history and human history. A distinguished scholar, colleague of Albert Einstein, Velikovsky had claimed that planets formerly moved on unstable courses. And more than once a planet came close enough to Earth to cause global catastrophe. Scene from "Remembering the End of the World" Most astronomers dismissed the book out of hand and some threatened a boycott of the publisher Macmillan, forcing the company to drop the book when it was the number one bestseller. But when the space age arrived our probes of planets and moons revealed devastated surfaces inspiring renewed interest in Velikovsky's claims. With Velikovsky's cooperation, I had the privilege of publishing a ten issue series on his challenge to science. Velikovsky said that cosmic catastrophe left its marks on the now-peaceful planets, our Earth included. He said that the planet Venus appeared in the sky as a comet and that its near-collision with the Earth decimated early civilizations. He said that electricity was highly active in these events. Planets moved on erratic courses and on occasion they nearly collided as cosmic lightning bolts flew between the approaching bodies. and he said that human memories of these events constitute evidence that science can not afford to ignore. It soon became clear to me that Velikovsky had opened the door to a new possibility, perhaps even a new understanding of the mythic archetypes as a whole. But why did the evidence always seem too preposterous to believe? Why did all of the archaic cultures stake everything on memories of the gods as towering bodies in a former sky? I was particularly enchanted by something Velikovsky proposed in a work still unpublished at the time. He claimed that, in the earliest remembered epoch, the planet Saturn dominated the sky, close to the Earth, presiding over the mythic Golden Age It was an outrageous idea and yet I found in it the inspiration for a life's work. Ancient cultures, the world over, insisted that an exemplary sun once ruled the sky. For the Egyptians, this former power was the creator Atum-Ra, ruling from the center and summit of the sky. In ancient Mesopotamia, we see the primeval sun as a great turning wheel in the heavens and the astronomers named this body as the planet Saturn. It was from the Romans that we received the planet's name, Saturn, but an archaic Latin name for Saturn was Sol, the Sun. In earlier Greek texts, the planet Saturn, called Kronos, was also named Helios - the Sun. "Helios and Kronos were one and the same god." Even the alchemists preserved this preposterous identity. They called Saturn "The Best Sun". Best sun, superior sun, exemplary sun .. the core idea always pointed directly to the axis of the sky, the celestial pole, around which the heavens visually turned. As improbable as it may seem, this is where the Egyptians located their primeval sun-god, Atum. "The great god lives, fixed in the middle of the sky." "[Atum was] the arbiter of destiny perched on the top of the world pole. Here must be the node of the universe, the centre of regulation." This motionless spot in the heavens is precisely where later astronomical traditions from Greece to Persia and China, all claimed that Saturn had ruled the world. A contradiction of every principle we take for granted today. "What has Saturn, the far-out planet, to do with the Pole? Such figures of speech were an essential part of the technical idiom of archaic astrology." Ancient chroniclers insisted that the planet Saturn, now just a speck in the sky, had presided over the Golden Age. An epoch of abundance, cosmic harmony and grandeur. The archaic name of Italy was Saturnia and tradition held that this very name was given to the original site of Rome. The Sabbath, the special day of rest and reverence was Saturni Dies, Saturn's day. A day honored throughout the Mediterranean, the Near East and beyond. The popular Roman festival, Saturnalia, was a symbolic return to the Saturnia Regna, Saturn's Reign, the Golden Age. Much symbolic content of our own New Year's and Christmas celebrations will trace to the Roman Saturnalia and related ancient festivals. In one form or another, every culture that remembered Saturn's reign regarded the planet-god as the Father of Kings, the Father of the Nation or the Race, Ancient traditions identified the Ugaritic and Hebrew El as Saturn. And it was said that the Israelites once saw themselves as Saturn's children. In the same way the Greeks invoked Kronos as their first father and the Romans insisted that they were the true descendants of Saturn, arriving in Italy through the adventures of the legendary ancestor Aeneas. "Deign to know the Latins, Saturn's race, a race freely self-controlled as in the olden days [the Golden Age]". But there was a dark side to Saturn, reflecting the catastrophic end of the Golden Age. This was when, in the words of Manilius, Saturn, the First Father, fell to the opposite end of the World Axis. This sudden onset of chaos, when heaven itself seemed to fall out of control, has haunted civilizations across the millennia, erupting as doomsday anxiety, the fear that what happened once will happen again. It's almost impossible to believe that ancient people sacrificed their own children, either symbolically or literally to the planet-god Saturn. Saturn was remembered as the devourer of his own children and as Moloch, demanding sacrifice. and as El or the Elohim commanding Abraham to sacrifice his own son, Isaac. In the face of evidence that can not be denied, the reasonable course is to bring the catastrophic source of these memories into the light of day. My book "The Saturn Myth," published by Doubleday in 1980, began the reconstruction of a spectacular formation formerly seen in the sky: a gathering of planets, looming immense above the ancient witnesses I was working with the mythic archetypes, cultures everywhere using different words and different symbols to describe eerily similar events. but the planetary model presented in "The Saturn Myth" was far from complete. Amongst the greatest of enigmas was the cosmic wheel recorded by every ancient culture. Images of a wheel in the sky, carved on stone, are older than civilization itself. Many archaeologists see these wheels as an imagined vehicle of the Sun, rolling across the sky. But in its most common form, the cosmic wheel doesn't go anywhere. Often it rests on a stationary pillar Or atop of a stairway or ladder Or is turned by a rope while resting on an altar or table. And the spokes of the wheel are not functional as such; they are fluid and etheric. Archaic gods and heroes hold a wheel in their hands. A cosmic wheel served as the throne of gods, and cultural heroes, and wise men. Symbolically replicated in the wheel-thrones of kings on Earth. The wheel-throne of Buddha underscores our point. And even the popular footprint of Buddha recalls the same wheel in heaven. The inspiration did not come from our Sun. Compare these prehistoric instances of the pictographic wheel from Ireland and from California. Different parts of the wheel are clearly evident. A large circle or sphere, though not always present, a central star and a smaller darker circle or sphere inside the star-like form. The images do not depict a single object, but three objects, as demonstrated here, where the artist placed the small dark sphere well below the central star. I can assure you that the placements are not random. These forms in the sky were planets in close congregation and immense above the ancient sky-worshippers. The stories begin with the appearance of this celestial formation Heaven, when "Heaven was close to the Earth" The original Unity Of The Sky formed by the Great Conjunction when a straight line or arrow would "pierce the hearts of the gathered powers". The Motionless, Superior Sun ruling before the present Sun. The Father of Kings and first in the mythic line of kings. And a dying or displaced god. In later times the first astronomers identified this overarching ruler of the sky. They claimed it was the planet Saturn, remembered as the owner of the Cosmic Wheel before the god departed for distant realms. The astronomical traditions also name the central star as Venus, the Mother Goddess and they name the darker, reddish sphere as the planet Mars, the cosmic warrior. In these three hours I intend to demonstrate that the stories of the gods are the stories of what happens to these celestial bodies. You're looking at reconstructed images of the formation in the heavens just a few thousand years ago. The configuration evolved through many phases, evoking reverence and awe, a model for kings and kingdoms for thousands of years. Great temples and cities and sacred mountains all pointed back to the mythic age of gods and wonders. Let the world's first astronomers point the way for us. They knew that what the myths and hymns and prayers called gods were planets and aspects of planets. Planets appeared close to the Earth in a heaven-spanning configuration. Memories of that celestial splendor still surround us, even if humanity later forgot much more than it remembered. Reconnecting with our forgotten past will be essential, essential for our own cultural integrity, essential for the study of human consciousness and essential for all of the sciences. The Cosmic Thunderbolt Just a few thousand years ago our ancestors witnessed the gathering of planets close to the Earth. An explosion of human imagination occurred, an outpouring of mythology and symbolism that defined cultures for thousands of years long after the celestial provocation itself was forgotten. In these early historical times, there are no records of the present planets, no diaries recording planetary motions or periods, Planets as we know them today did not exist, these were the gods, awe-inspiring and at times capricious and terrifying. Saturn Early star-worshippers speak of a great Light of Heaven, motionless in the sky. The Egyptian Atum or Atum-Ra The Sumerian An The Babylonian Anu and enigmatically, early astronomers knew the overarching figure as the planet Saturn whose story will be a centerpiece of our third episode. In the beginning the gathered powers were not seen as separated gods but as the primeval Unity of Heaven, the perfect conjunction or Great Conjunction of the Golden Age. A massive sphere hung in the sky and in its center stood a radiant star surrounded by explosive streamers. Cultures the world over came to see this star in feminine terms as the Mother Goddess, the planet Venus. Remembered as the Great Star, the Mother of all stars. This was the central eye, heart and soul of the primeval Sun, his animating life, power and glory and much more. One of the most enigmatic cultural themes is the transformation of the life-giving Goddess into a monstrous form, attacking the world. This was the terrible Goddess, raging in the sky with wildly disordered hair, or multiple flailing arms, celestial spectacle radiating a paralyzing light. When instability and displacement occurred, the streamers discharging from Venus grew chaotic, giving the planet a frightful countenance. The angry goddess was a comet. The mythic prototype of comets. Immanuel Velikovsky's Great Comet, the planet Venus. Aphrodite Comaetho: "the Comet Venus" Roman image of Venus as "the comet" "The ignorant masses of the people had considered Venus as a comet." Mars Seen in front of this central star was a smaller, darker, reddish sphere. This was the mythic warrior, The masculine "Heart of the Heart" The "Child in the Womb" The "Child on the Lap" The "Pupil of the Eye" The "Axle of the Cosmic Wheel" The most active figure of world mythology Sky-worshippers everywhere knew the identity of this warrior, the victor over dragons and chaos monsters. This global identity of Mars as the greatest of warriors shouts to us an unrecognized history. Star-in-Crescent On the great sphere of heaven a bright crescent appeared, with the orb or star of Venus between its horns. Things never seen in our sky were once revered around the world. As the Earth rotated on its axis, the crescent marked out a cycle of day and night. Crescent below in the phase of greatest brightness, crescent above in the phase of dimming. Though our Sun was present, casting its light on the configuration, it was not itself in the visual theater of the gods. I call this "The Polar Configuration" because the Earth itself rotated in alignment with the forms in the sky, placing these forms at a celestial pole around which the heavens visually turned. The configuration evolved through numerous phases. The number of streamers changed repeatedly, as did their observed form. Every change in relative position produced dramatic changes in the appearance of the configuration. Electric Universe In 1996, the Canadian filmmaker Ben Ged Low spent many months in Portland, producing a 90-minute documentary on the reconstruction. At that time many dynamic issues were largely unresolved. But later that year, the Australian physicist Wallace Thornhill flew to Portland for a 30-day visit. He convinced me that the forms I'd reconstructed were electrical. They were plasma discharge streamers, stretching between planets. He explained that, in a radial electric discharge, both the number of streamers and their concrete form will change with the intensity of the discharge. The whirling forms I'd reconstructed in the common symmetry, which I'd often laughed about, did indeed have a physical explanation. At the time of his visit, Wal Thornhill had devoted more than 25 years to exploring what he called "The Electric Universe." His work follows in the traditions of the electrical and plasma science pioneers, who showed that electricity plays a major role in space. That galaxies, stars and planets are formed electrically. That comets, with their bright tails, move through an electric field of the Sun. His electrical interpretation extended to the origin of bizarre landscapes on planets and moons now explained by the well-tested principles of electrical arcing. In an electric solar system, if two planets or moons approach each other from regions of different potential, electric discharge will occur, producing plasma formations stretching between the approaching bodies. Plasma laboratory experiments can tell us what the formations might look like. The backbone is typically a column of twisted filaments, but disks and embedded cylinders also arise to evolve in spectacular ways. The counterpart to such formations can be seen in ancient depictions of the cosmic thunderbolt. But what an outrageous idea, that exotic formations could arise between planets in close approach! "The space between the two planets lights up and is set aflame by both planets and produces a train of fire." "Heavenly fire is spit forth by the planet as crackling charcoal flies from a burning log." "[Archaic traditions say] that these bolts come from the planet Saturn, just as the inflammatory ones come from Mars." What then was the relationship of the cosmic thunderbolt to the magical swords, arrows, clubs and spears of the great warrior-gods? With a stunning accord, ancient languages identify these weapons as special forms of the cosmic thunderbolt. Scholars have already identified the sword and arrows of Apollo The spear of Zeus The trident of Poseidon as aspects of the divine thunderbolt. The same linkage occurs with the Greek Ares, the Latin Mars, whose sword was his identity. Ares (Mars) "darted swift and bright as the thunderbolt terribly flashing from the mignth hand of Zeus." First came the thunderbolt, the core archetype, then came its mythic interpretation as a weapon of the warrior-god. "...A 'derivation' of the sword from a 'root' or archetype in lightning is universal and world wide." Placed in the hands of the Gods, the cosmic thunderbolt provides a bridge the Latin Mars, the Latin Mars,joining the mythic world to the leading edge of plasma science. POLAR CONFIGURATION The Dawn of Civilization One simple truth will change the future of science and our understanding of human history. The ancient sky bore no resemblance to the sky we see today. Above human witnesses, planetary formations hovered close to the Earth. ARCHETYPE: Mother Goddess as "Great Star" ...with numerous variations Babylonian star of Ishtar (Venus) ...with enclosed, inidentified sphere One electrical form metamorphosed into another in the celestial dance of the mythic star-goddess and the cosmic warrior, astronomically identified as the planets Venus and Mars. Ancient observers saw the head of the warrior-king wrapped in the radiance of the star-goddess, it was his crown of glory. ARCHETYPE: Star Goddess as Crown And it was the warrior's magical protection, worn as a helmet or crest, but much more. The dancing Aztec god wore the rays of Venus as a crest but also held the so-called half-star of Venus in an outstreched hand. And he even wore this protective radiance as his skirt. The theme is universal, the warrior's armor was the radiance of the great star and that is the explanation for the unexplained "radiate crown of kings". Greece: Warrior god Apollo Crown of Antiochos Roman crown of kingship Heraldry: "Celestial Crown" As the forms of the configuration changed, the mythic interpretations changed as well. ARCHETYPE: "Spread Tail Feathers" In pictures and words, the ancient chroniclers recounted the cosmic conjunction of the goddess and the warrior. ARCHETYPE: Orb (eye) in the "Hand of God" The goddess was the eye and the warrior was the pupil of the eye. Two spheres in alignment inspired a mythical interpretation as an eye and pupil inscribed upon the Hand of God. In ancient Egypt, the "Hand of Ra" was the Eye goddess Iussaset. The Egyptian warrior gods were named arit, the "pupil" of the feminine eye. The five fingers of the hand were the visible aspects of an eight-spoked wheel in a different phase. Buddhist symbolists knew that the hand bore a secret relationship to the eight-spoked dharma-wheel. Buddha was the motionless axle of the wheel, enthroned upon the hand of heaven, he was surrounded and protected by the celestial fire of the gods. Every form that arose provoked a variety of mythical interpretations, not just a single idea. The spokes of the wheel were the animating soul and power of the universal sovereign, exploding into life at sunset, that is the meaning of the mythic "Plant of life". ARCHETYPE: Goddess as "Plant of Life" Greece: Rosette of Aphrodite (Venus) Things seen in the sky provoked hundreds of imaginative images and not one speaks for the events in the heavens today, not a single one. Even when the concrete form of the cosmic original was forgotten, the imaginative idea persisted for thousands of years. ARCHETYPE: "7-Headed Serpent" Innumerable concrete details would not allow us to just make up explanations for the myths and symbols. ARCHETYPE: "Spread Tail Feathers" Some symbols remained abstract but more often they added mythical interpretation to the underlined form. And many mythical images, seemingly incompatible, will trace to the same tangible form. Goddess Venus as dove The plant of life was not just an attractive design element, it was a form in the sky, inspiring a story of vast influence. ARCHETYPE: Goddess as "Plant of Life" In his birth or re-birth the warrior-god emerged from the radiant flower. Egypt: birth of the Warrior-King Egypt: Nefertem emerging from the lotus The diverse mythical interpretations and the larger stories told about these events, all point to a unified substructure of human memory. ARCHETYPE: "Wheel of Heaven" A great wheel turned in the heavens and it was remembered around the world. Even the modest displacement of the aligned powers was captured in ancient images. ARCHETYPE: "Displacemente" Scallop: symbol of Aphrodite's "birth" and departure Why was the Egyptian goddess identified as the headdress of the warrior-king? It's the underlined form that gives us the answer. Warrior Hero A primeval sun ruled the world shining most brightly in the night sky. A crescent came to adorn this primeval sun and it certainly was not our moon. The great star of Venus rested between its horns, and visually seated within the star, was the planet Mars. A luminous stream appeared to descend from Mars, the first form of the cosmic thunderbolt. Greece: forms of the cosmic thunderbolt Tibet: forms of the cosmic thunderbolt Human imagination saw sword or dagger, thrust into the region below. The warrior-god was his sword, envisioned also as an axial pin, peg or mooring post of the turning sky. The same thing as the stem of the plant of life. And the pillar-like lower limbs of the goddess. The same form in the sky was seen as a protruding tongue of both the warrior and the angry goddess. A pronounced movement of Mars occurred, close to but not precisely on the planetary axis. Now the celestial crescent appeared as the horns of the warrior himself, in his identity as the Bull of Heaven. ARCHETYPE: "Bull of Heaven" And it should not surprise us that the foundation post bore the image of the bull at its apex. When it reached the Earth, the stream presented the form of a great pillar or cosmic mountain. "O Great Mountain (Enlil), whose head rivals the heavens, Whose foundation is laid in the pure abyss. Whose horns gleanm." Perhaps it is too much to believe that the famous Bull of Heaven was just the pillar and shining horns, "I am the bull, the Old One... I support the sky with my horns." "...the pillar of hte stars, the Bull of Heaven..." "whose horns shine, the anointed pillar, the Bull of Heaven." To these events we will trace the worldwide myths of the heaven-lifting cosmic giant, the first active form of the warrior-hero. His upraised arms were precisely the same thing as the horns of the Bull of Heaven, ARCHETYPE: "Cosmic Pillar" a testament to the integrity of the substructure, the archetypes. Greece: Heaven-lifting Atlas THE MYTH OF CREATION Conical Crowns of the Warrior King In some phases with the movement of Mars, dust and electrified plasma, streaming between Mars and Venus, became visible to terrestrial observers, even small changes in this dusty plasma stream, were we to view the formation from space, would create distinctive differences in the appearance of the configuration. The great kings of ancient times wore conical crowns in numerous and always enigmatic varieties. For these revered forms the experts can find no referent in nature today. Yet the priestly chroniclers of antiquity knew that these crowns imitated the vestment of the cosmic warrior, the prototype of the warrior king on Earth. The Curling Life-Breath ARCHETYPE: "Curling Life-Breath" With progressive instability and displacement from the axis, the stream joining Mars and Venus spiralled outward. This was the mother goddess herself, the radiant eye, heart and soul of the primeval sun, now externalized as a curling lock of hair. And the earliest sources leave no doubt that it was a visible form in the sky. Egyptian texts invoked "the lock of hair which circles round about." The primeval sun god Ra had "the light of the lock of hair on him." The side lock of the warrior-king mimicked that of his predecessor, the cosmic warrior. Horus: "He of the Sidelock" This curling life breath provoked innumerable symbols, far more than we could include here. Just one example was the mooring post in the sky signifying the outflow of the eye and the evolving form of creation itself. A critical turn came with the removal of the life breath curl unleashing the terrible goddess and a cosmic crisis. In his rage, the Hindu Shiva tore out a lock of his hair from which arose his own dark aspect, the monster Virabadra and close by the terrifying form of the angry goddess whom we recognize as the comet Venus. The life of the legendary King Nisus resided in a tuft of hair. His death resulted when Aphrodite Comaetho removed the strands of life. The Greek name Aphodite Comaetho translates astronomically as "the comet Venus." Chaos Serpent or Dragon ARCHETYPE: "Chaos Serpent-Dragon" The medusa archetype was only a nuance away from the celestial serpent or dragon, with its bright filaments, effusive feathers, long flowing hair and lightning emanations, the global symbols of the great comet. In Egypt, the eye, heart and soul of Ra, departed from the god to become the fiery Uraeus serpent, rampaging in the heavens. "The tip of its flame crosses the land from the sky... No one at all can approach her, the streams behind her are flames of fire." Astronomical traditions throughout the Mediterranean and Near East confirm that this goddess was the planet Venus. The ancient Sumerians identified Venus as Inanna, the serpent or dragon mother, unapproachable in her rage. "Like a dragon you have deposited venom on the land... Raining the fanned fire down upon the nation." The disordered comet-like hair of the Chinese dragon was an overriding feature, as was the discharging sphere or so called night glowing pearl its spiraling attributes. And the lightning emanations of the dragon itself. Long after the remembered events the Aztecs still knew the comet as streaming feathers. They knew the connection of the comet to a cosmic serpent, and they remembered the connection of both to the planet Venus. Creation From the episodes of disorder a phase of celestial construction emerged, focused on the activity of the spiraling form or rayed spiral, remembered as the Serpent of creation. This was the expanded enclosure of the Mother Goddess herself, the motherland in the sky, the two subject of the archaic creation legend. ARCHETYPE: "Serpent of Creation" The mythic home of gods and heroes lay within an enclosure formed by the body of the celestial serpent or dragon. ARCHETYPE: "Oroborus" (Enclosing Serpent) The evolving forms noted here are provable phases in the biography of the mother goddess, largely ignored but confirmed at the level of concrete detail in the early cultures. The priests of ancient Egypt knew that the White Crown was the Mother Goddess. "I know my mother, the White Crown." They knew that the life-breath curl and the revolving lock of hair were the same goddess. Isis and Hathor were also named, "the side-lock" Across all of Egypt, the chroniclers remembered the luminous spiral with its radial projections as the agent of celestial construction. Egypt: Serpent of Creation From north to south, they described the goddess originally "The Eye of Ra" taking the form of a flaming serpent, whose hieroglyph means goddess. "The cobra-snake of Ra, who came forth from him - The Eye of Ra. She is the flaming goddess." And it was this very serpent that came to form an enclosure, the boundary of Neter Ta, the celestial kingdom. Meso-American artists understood very well that the fire serpent or dragon, enclosing the land of the gods, had appeared as a rayed spiral. Four Streams of Life The created land of the gods, emerging from the dance of the goddess and the hero, presented four streams of light and life. Here was the mother land in the sky, the celestial model for every kingdom and city on Earth. The lost land of mythic ancestors, divided by four rivers or animated by four explosive winds and turning as a great wheel in the sky. To be sure, the evolution of myth over time brought endless elaborations of the archetype, yet even in the enthusiasm to extend the symbolism, the substratum of human memory does shine through. The complexities of the Aztec calendar-wheel did not eliminate the axial role of the warrior-hero, or the four exploding streams of life-energy, or the circumscribing, often double-headed, serpent, or the identity of that serpent as the fire of the gods. As a rule, later spiritual traditions did not displace this human memories either, but found in them the symbolic landscape for expressing insights and beliefs that would guide later interpretations of myth. Mountain of the Gods Lastly, we must acknowledge one of the most pervasive symbols of world mythology. All mythic traditions agree that the land of the gods rested on the golden or fiery mountain of heaven. It is evident that the core symbols of the human yearning, suffering and devotion across the millennia, trace to the very events from which the first civilizations themselves arose. Now the question must be asked: if the great mythic archetypes are explained by events unknown to our world, what can the Electric Universe and the leading edge of Plasma Science tell us about the ancient experience? 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info A new scientific report may provide stunning support for the role of a form of electric current called a Birkeland current on the cosmological scale. A team of scientists using the ALMA telescope to study the doughnut-shaped cloud of gas and dust at the center of the galaxy NGC 1068 made a shocking discovery -- two separate disks of gas and dust are rotating in opposite directions. Phys.org reports on the team's discovery, "Unexpectedly, they found two counter-rotating disks of gas. The inner disk spans two to four light-years and follows the rotation of the galaxy, whereas the outer disk (also known as the torus) spans 4 to 22 light years and is rotating the opposite way." The lead author of a paper on the discovery states, "We did not expect to see this, because gas falling into a black hole would normally spin around it in only one direction. Something must have disturbed the flow, because it is impossible for a part of the disk to start rotating backward all on its own." Those who have followed this series might understand the potential significance of this discovery. In 2015, retired professor of electrical engineering Dr. Donald Scott published his mathematical model of the structure of a Birkeland current, which he identified visually as counter-rotating cylinders, and it's being seen at vastly different scales in the cosmos, from galaxies to planetary aurorae. We asked Dr. Scott for his thoughts  on this latest discovery. Well, a week or two ago, National Radio Astronomy Observatory announced their again of course, "unexpected discovery" that in another galaxy, it happens to be M 77, the galactic disk was experiencing counter-rotation. While the part of the disk that is closest to the center of the galaxy rotates in one direction, the outer regions of the disk rotate in the opposite direction, and so there is counter rotation. And the only explanation they could offer was that, "...counter rotation always results from the collision or interaction between two galaxies. What makes this result remarkable is that we see it on a much smaller scale, tens of light-years instead of thousands from the central black hole." And of course, their amazement is the result of two different errors that are actually compounding each other and making the whole thing worse. The first is, since they still refuse to acknowledge the existence of any electrical effects in the cosmos, the only tool available to them is the attractive force of gravity. So of course, they declare that any case of counter- rotation has to be caused by some sort of collision or near collision or near- miss or something like that. And the second error, expressly in this press release but in other places of course as well, they repeat the self-contradictory idea that black holes that suck in matter due to a singularity -- that's an infinite concentration of matter which is impossible -- they also spit out matter at incredibly high speeds up to five hundred kilometers per second, which is more than a million miles an hour. It's all getting sucked in, how can it be blasted out again? But anyway, how can this have anything at all to do with the counter rotation in this particular case is not really discussed. I feel that their mentioning of the black hole that exists there is just a red herring to distract the reader from asking the obvious question, how do you explain the counter rotation in the first place? And I submit, there is no known scientific process that naturally produces two concentric discs that rotate in opposite directions, other than the natural counter-rotation that occurs within a Birkeland current. It's just that simple. So very similarly in another case I'm familiar with, there is a galaxy NGC 4550, and a well-known British astronomer tried to explain an earlier case of galactic counter-rotation in this galaxy by saying that another galaxy that was spinning in the other direction must have come close to or collided with the first galaxy. And anyway, I discussed this in an earlier paper that I published. But the reason the counter-rotation of stars within a galaxy hasn't been discovered as often as it might, I suggest, is because 1) the galaxy has to be oriented in such a way that the red-blue shift that reveals the counter-rotation can be measured. It has to be oriented so that it can be measured. For example, galaxies that are face-on to us will not show spectral evidence of counter- rotation, because it takes the stars, the stars that are involved have to be moving at least partially toward us and then away from us as they rotate around the galaxy, and that'll be so if the galaxy is at an angle but not face on. But also, in my estimation, the primary reason that this hasn't been discovered, as much as it's seemingly being discovered now, is that it's easy not to see something if you don't really want to see it. And so we do know of the existence of several galaxies within which counter-rotation has been measured, but in the explanation, none of them have a satisfactory explanation if electrical phenomena such as Birkeland current structure are intentionally excluded and ignored. And by the way, if you do a web search,  anyone who sees this, just go ahead and do a web search using a search engine on 'galactic web' and if you do that well, I just did this morning as a matter of fact, and I found a Wikipedia description of the galactic web and it says the following, "In the standard model of the evolution of the universe, galactic filaments form along and follow web-like structures of dark matter. It is thought that this dark matter dictates the structure of the universe on the grandest of scales. Dark matter gravitationally attracts normal matter and it is this normal matter that astronomers see forming long thin walls of super-galactic clusters." Well of course, what they're missing is that the strings are made up of plasma and the formation of filaments is a very normal thing within a plasma. That has nothing to do with dark matter or anything else, any other fairy dust they conjure up to explain what they can't normally explain. It can't be explained without thinking about electricity up there. Anyway, they confidently say these kinds of things about dark matter as if they actually have seen some and measured what its properties are. Maybe they will now say, dark matter causes things to spin! They haven't said that one  before, but that's a possibility. Anyway, the filaments that make up the galactic web undoubtedly consist of plasma in the form of force-free currents. They carry electric currents to and from the galaxies that form along them and when these filaments emit visible light, they're then properly called Birkeland currents. And we've talked a lot about Birkeland currents here on Space News. We know that the cross sections of those Birkeland currents have regions of counter-rotation, it's the only thing in the universe that naturally does have counter-rotation. And of course, the galaxies that form on those filaments will probably also exhibit that same counter- rotation because that's how they're formed. Astronomers ought to know these things as well but they don't. They'd rather talk about things smashing and crashing together and reject the idea that anything electrical is happening. Therefore, the only tool they have to explain things is the attractive force of gravity, so the only thing left for them is to assume collisions or near collisions are the cause of just about everything they see. Their Big Bang story says that everything blew apart. OK, if you accept that, fine, but in addition to blowing apart, then what causes everything in the universe to spin? We don't know, no answer. Every time we hear about or observe counter- rotation of disks or cylinders anywhere, especially at galaxies that have a common center, think Birkeland currents, don't think collisions or explosions. So every time we hear about counter-rotation, just think about Birkeland currents. It's the only thing in the universe that does have counter-rotation. 
Our celestial neighbour, the planet Mars. Astronomers once considered Mars to be a long barren and geologically dead rock in space. But since the arrival of our probes beginning in the 1960s, the planet has come alive for us. It does not reveal the inactive and worn down landscape astronomers and planetary scientists had expected. Nevertheless, investigators continued to apply geologic concepts based on their understanding of the Earth and the Moon. They could only see volcanism, erosion, surface movement and surface collapse, all punctuated by episodic impacts from space over billions of years. What force created the sharply cut gouges and depressions across the surface of Mars, looking as if a giant trowel descended to scoop out material, at radically different and irreconcilable depths. Running north to south, we see massive interwoven scratches or grooves extending hundreds of miles. And how remarkable that a planet only half the diameter of Earth exhibits canyons on a scale dwarfing anything seen on our own planet. And mountains that would tower over Mount Everest. Today, no planet outside the Earth has received more attention than Mars, but the mysteries and theoretical contradictions have grown spectacularly. For decades now, investigators have wondered why the two hemispheres of Mars look as if they were formed in different worlds. A southern hemisphere dominated by craters, a northern hemisphere with only sparsely scattered craters. And note, the contrasting crustal depths of the two hemispheres. Shallow crust in the North, much thicker crust in the South. Why would a planet evolving in isolation display such a profound dichotomy? It's as if, some unknown force excavated the northern crust miles deep. The hemispheric removal of crustal material requires a force external to Mars, acting on the planet. But when it comes to external events scientific convention has only one thing to work with: random collisions. Could a planetoid or huge asteroid crashing into Mars have removed millions of cubic miles of crust? A shattering impact is all that theory would allow. But what would Martian history look like were we to include electrical events? Events on a scale sufficient to sculpt the surface of the Red Planet from pole to pole. Of all the enigmatic features in the solar system perhaps none provokes greater amazement than Valles Marineris. The largest canyon on any planet or moon, the deep trench complex stretches a third of the way around the planet, hundreds of times larger than the Grand Canyon. It would reach from San Francisco to New York and beyond. Prior theory of planet formation had never anticipated such a chasm on a small planet. What natural force excavated this colossal trench? With the arrival of the Mariner probes, NASA scientists thought the chasm could have been cut by water erosion, though nothing even close was ever achieved by water on the known watery planet Earth. In any erosional hypothesis, three million cubic miles of material were removed. 3,000,000 cubic miles! And it had to go somewhere. Neither the means of fluid drainage, nor the vast outflow required are in evidence. Now, we know that Valles Marineris reaches to a greater depth than any outflow channel originally envisioned. And the tributaries imagined by some turned out to be cleanly cut alcoves and stubby depressions. They are not connected to feeder streams at all. One portion of the Valles Marineris system, in particular, underscores our point here. Planetary scientists acknowledge that Hebes Canyon, much larger than our Grand Canyon, is an inseparable part of Valles Marineris. The scientists have now acknowledged it was certainly not created by water. Hebes Chasma: "a fairly large canyon in the Valles Marineris complex that has absolutely no inlet or outlet on the surface." Nor is it plausible to suggest that surface spreading created the massive caisson of Valles Marineris with its repeated morphology of sharply scalloped walls. The surface was not torn, it was carved and the detailed images imply a removal of material along the entire length of the chasm, a process clearly illustrated by the neatly machined so-called tributaries all the way up to their rounded, cleanly cut terminations. Whatever formed the canyon complex could not stop at the margins of the primary channel, but added irregular craters and crater chains, and surface grooves and gouges. So, the question can not be escaped. Is there anything known to science today that can account for the extraordinary profile of Valles Marineris? There is an explanation well-known to science though it's never entered the geologist's lexicon. Lightning! In the plasma laboratory, it's power is demonstrated in electric discharge experiments. But the form unfamiliar to conventional science today is the cosmic thunderbolt. It was the brilliant engineer Ralph Juergens, who first suggested decades ago, that cosmic thunderbolts carved Valles Marineris. "..This entire region resembles nothing so much as an area zapped by a powerful electric arc advancing unsteadily across the surface..." With the benefit of more recent data, electrical theorist Wallace Thornhill returned to this extraordinary possibility. "Valles Marineris was created within minutes by a giant electric arc sweeping across the surface of Mars... ...Rock and soil were lifted into space and some fell back to create the great, strewn fields of boulders first seen by the Viking and Pathfinder landers." Yes, the electric hypothesis will unnerve many scientists but it is the only hypothesis that meets the test of direct observation. Here is a scar left by an electric arc on a piece of wet wood. Electric discharge provides a direct and complete explanation for the Valles Marineris. The so-called tributaries of the valley were cut by secondary streamers of the discharge. That is a typical signature of an electric arc when it cuts a surface channel. And here is the scar from electric discharge to an insulator. Notice in particular the network of secondary streamers to the left; a perfect counterpart to the western edge of Valles Marineris. It was long held that this remarkable region on Mars was the result of uplift, fracturing and spreading. And from a distance, it did look like fracturing. But with a closer view in front of us, it is simply irrational to cling to that interpretation. Material has been cleanly removed, exactly as in the discharging to the insulator. The evidence now available demands a new perspective, a larger field of view. In Thornhill's interpretation, the discharge took the form of a plasmoid, not unlike the plasmoid from which the spiral galaxy is formed. Plasmoid simulation On his website, Thornhill noted how the discharge effect spiraled upward to the East and downward to the West, an effect that shows up quite clearly on the elevation map given on his website. In fact, if we extend the view of the elevation map, we see an even larger effect. It seems that the spiraling trails to the East and West nearly completed two circles as they swung back to the trench itself. But one difference between the northern and the southern extension stands out. The northern extension is entirely constituted of ravines and depressions, while the southern extension consists of ridges and mountainous terrain. For this unusual contrast, electrical experiments offer a startling explanation. It was George Christoph Lichtenberg who in the 18th century first showed that electric arcs create ravine networks on more negatively charged surfaces and elevated ridges on more positively charged surfaces. Could it be that simple? ...that a cosmic thunderbolt carving Valles Marineris acted on two regions of different charge, negative to the north and positive to the south? If such was the case, the only plausible cause of the charge differential would be an electrical exchange between Mars and other charged bodies in the past. And what was the relationship of these events to the hemispheric dichotomies, the removal of crustal material to the North and the densely cratered southern hemisphere? In the electrical interpretation, the violent excavation of the surface to create Valles Marineris would have created immense deposits of sediment on surrounding topography. And indeed, we see that previous craters in the region were completely buried, with only the largest craters appearing as outlines penetrating through the deep deposits. It's apparent that the released material had a net drift to the West, since the blanket of deposited sediment stretches all the way to the eastern flank of the towering Olympus Mons. Keep in mind as well that an electric discharge at energies necessary to create the chasms of Valles Marineris would have ejected great volumes of rocky material into space. Much of the rocky debris would have fallen back to litter the Martian landscape. And indeed, shattered rock of all sizes across the surface of Mars is a long-standing mystery. And the mystery is resolved by electrical events on a continental and even hemispheric scale. Given the energies of the events considerable volumes of material would have surely escaped the planet altogether. And what might this tell us about the Mars-Earth connection in our reconstruction of ancient events? Or the surprising discovery that rocks from Mars have fallen on our own planet? When Meteorites Fell from Mars One of the great surprises of the Space Age was the discovery that certain meteorites had arrived from the planet Mars! Initially, most scientists rejected the idea outright. For rock to escape Martian gravity, they could only imagine an asteroidal impact blasting rock into space at more than three miles per second! That is five times the muzzle velocity of a hunting rifle. The energies would either pulverize or vaporize the rock. But the question was eventually settled by gases trapped inside a suspect meteorite. The gases bore the atmospheric signature of Mars. Martian meteorite "The trapped gases match these that Viking measured in the martian atmosphere." By 2003, at least 30 meteorites had been identified as Martian. But how could the removal of rock from the Martian surface have occurred? Planetary scientists began to offer exotic speculations based on mathematical models. No one seems to have wondered if the vast debris fields of Mars might point the way to discovery. Even the smaller rocks viewed here from space would weigh tons on the Earth. We have proposed that in a former epoch of planetary instability electric discharge excavated the Martian surface miles deep, throwing massive quantities of rock into space. This would mean that most of the Martian rocks reaching Earth would have come from well below the surface and would not even bear the atmospheric signature of the planet. So, it is not unreasonable to suspect that the planet Mars was not a small contributor ... but the greatest contributor to meteoric bombardment of Earth in ancient times! On this question, ancient testimony holds a surprising answer! Worldwide accounts describe apocalyptic wars of the gods punctuated by lightning and falling stone! Rocks from space falling on the Earth have no connection to lightning and thunder in our own time, but the ancient connection is clear. In many different languages meteorites and exotic rocks were called thunderstones, or thundereggs, said to have fallen in the great wars of the gods. It seems that the answer lies with the worlds first astronomers. They insisted the rocks from space were hurled by the warring thundergod, the planet Mars. "The ancient Babylonians specifically referred to meteorites falling from the planet Mars." "You hurl the towering stone... You hurl the stone in fury." From one land to another ancient sky worshipers celebrated the planet Mars as the cosmic prototype for the warrior on Earth. It seems that rocks encircling Mars, when Mars loomed huge in the heavens, appeared as a fiery retinue of warriors with ablazing countenance. The terrifying Maruts of Hindu literature derived from the same Indo-European root as the Latin Mars. They are the sons and companians of the Hindu Rudra, "the Red One" who could hardly be other than Mars itself. The Marutas hurled in the heavens bringing blasts of fire, of lightning and falling stone. "The glittering army..." "Armed with lightning spears..." Babylonian astronomical traditions declared precisely the same thing of Nergal, the planet Mars. "Raging demons with awesome numbers run at his right and at his left" the texts say. In the same way, the classical poet described the dwelling of the Greek Ares, the Roman Mars, ringed by a thousand Furies. Just as a horde of Berserkers, or the furious Valkyries, accompanied the devine warriors in archaic traditions of Germany and Scandinavia. Phobos For many years, our claim has been that catastrophic electrical exchanges between Mars and other planets at close range removed immense volumes of rock, dust and debris from the surface of the Red Planet. But now planetary scientists face an additional challenge. The surface of the Martian moon Phobos reveals a chemistry very close to that of Mars itself. Scientists now say that Phobos is not the captured asteroid that they have once thought. Like the meteorites from Mars, even this moon seems to be composed of material blasted from the planet's surface. "Observations from Phobos appear to match the types of minerals identified on the surface of Mars." "This moon might itself have originated from material thrown into orbit from the Martian surface." Theorists envision rocky debris orbiting Mars after a major impact event, then gradually accreting into the observed moon. But, it is surely more likely that collisions of rocks in orbit would progressively wear them down not create a moon... The idea of gravitational accretion followed by meteoric impact is, in fact, contradicted by the most visible surface features of Phobos. Imagine the secondary collision that impact theories required in order to create the gigantic Stickney crater 5.6 miles (9.01km) in diameter, almost half the diameter of Phobos along the axis of the supposed impact. The trivial gravity of the moon could never hold together a loose collection of rocks experiencing such an event. Parallel channels and crater chains running in every direction. Is it a coincidence that everything required to fuse material in the implied way... has already been demonstrated by electric arcs in the laboratory? Pinching material into spherical shapes - the same electric force that produces parallel channels and crater chains. Electric arc experiments It should not surprise us that a body fused electrically into a rough sphere would continue to attract the surrounding dust created by the prior catastrophic events on the Martian surface. But no popular theory has explained how Phobos acquired a surface layer of dust or fine grain estimated at a hundred meters deep. Even moderate vibrations created by the larger supposed impacts would immediately have propelled collected dust grains back into space due to the rock's minuscule gravity. Enhanced colors suggest electrical sorting of dust The available evidence points directly to the very center piece of ancient fears ... the cosmic thunderbolt ... and the ancient story of the great warrior in the heavens of his raging companions and of hurled stone does not end here. Scarface No surface feature on any body in the solar system is more recognizable than the great scar of Valles Marineris. And it appears, that ancient nations preserved the story about this memorable scar. The scarred face of the Aztec god Xipe, the celestial model of the devoted warrior, is not easily forgotten. And many cultures recall a legendary warrior or giant recognized by his distinctive scar. But could this scared god really have been the planet Mars? Scarface was the name of a legendary Blackfoot indian warrior also called Star Boy. His counterpart among the Pawnee was the great warrior named Morning Star not Venus they say, but the planet Mars. The Greek Ares personified the lightning weapon and the Greeks identified the god as the planet Mars. When wounded in battle he rushed to Zeus with the shout of a thousand warriors to display the deep gash. In the different cultures, the warring god appears alternately as a hero vanquishing chaos monsters and a rogue warrior or dark power. We see the two aspects of the warrior archetype in the Hindu Indra, famed for the cosmic thunderbolt. And the giant Ravana, who is said to have been permanently scarred by the thunderbolt. Greek poets knew the monster Typhon as the owner of a lightning weapon but also as the lightning scarred god. And the same is true of the giant Enceladus, alternately said to have been scarred by the thunderbolt of Zeus or the spear of Athena, which meant the same thing. We have good reason to ask, therefore, if the scar-faced theme derived from remembered events when planetary gods waged battles in the sky and the planet Mars acquired it's unforgettable wound. Olympus Mons In it's sheer size the towering Martian mountain Olympus Mons dwarfs anything seen on Earth. The great mound on the Tharsis Rise stunned planetary scientists as it rose through a dust cloud to greet the Mariner 9 mission in 1972. Almost as flat as a pancake, Olympus Mons is three times the height of Mount Everest and as wide as the entire State of Arizona! From its discovery onward, planetary scientists interpreted Olympus Mons as a classic shield volcano, comparing it to the great shield volcanos of the Hawaiian islands. But, Olympus Mons is as large as the entire Hawaiian island chain of mountains, from the sea floor to their summits. Numerous features distinguish it from any shield volcano on Earth. It's steep scarp rises up to 4 miles (6.43km) high. No shield volcano offers a counterpart to this towering cliff. (Belknap Shield Volcano) The defining feature of a shield volcano is the gentle extrusion of fluid or low viscosity lava. Shield volcanoes do not present a scarp and a scarp 4 miles high is simply out of the question. "The scarp is of unknown origin." "This steep cliff around Olympus Mons is peculiar and not characteristic of terrestrial shield volcanoes." In fact, one engima after another leaps out at the observer. A blanket of incredibly fine, filamentary ridges and ravines, a surrounding aureole, exhibiting sharply cut ridges and channels and stupendous carved blocks. "The origin of the deposits has challenged planetary scientists for an explanation for dacades." Subsequent to its formation, much of the aureole to the East was apparently buried by equally enigmatic activity in the region. Indeed, the Tharsis Rise as a whole is a long-standing enigma, 2,500 miles (4,023 km) across and more than 6 miles (9.65km) high. A vast bulge of this sort has no place in the standard evolution of an isolated planet. "The origin of the Tharsis Rise is not well understood." Planetary scientists still debate the enigma, but if Mars formerly engaged other charged bodies at close range, the great bulge is the very deformation we would expect. We have claimed that the surface of Mars was sculpted by electric discharge in an epoch of solar system instability and planetary violence. Yes, this is an outrageous idea, but Olympus Mons itself has all the characteristics of a lightning blister. Such raised bell-shaped blisters can be found on the caps of lightning arrestors after a cloud to ground strike. And we find them in other natural settings as well, they're elevated fulgarites, what some have called fulgamites. The discharge that creates raised fulgurites is often followed by lesser strokes along the same ionized path creating overlapping pits on the top of the formation, just like the circular craters on the summit of Olympus Mons. On the Martian mountain the smaller craters center on the walls of the larger and are cut to a greater depths, as if with a cookie cutter. The material that forms the raised fulgarite is scavenged from the surrounding surface. The result is an encircling depression or moat. This characteristic is so clear and obvious as to raise an critical question... Is there a moat around the base of Olympus Mons? Planetary scientists say there is a moat, but that its remains are only slightly visible to the West and the rest of the moat had been buried by later deposits of material who's origin is still debated. They explain the moat as being an effect of Olympus Mons sinking into the local terrain over long spans of time. But is another explanation possible? The features of Olympus Mons are, in fact, a perfect fit to an electrical interpretation down to numerous details. Several years ago, Wal Thornhill conducted a laboratory experiment to demonstrate the effect of an electric arc on a positively charged, or anode clay surface. At moderate power, the electric arc raised a circular mound from the surrounding material to create both, a moat and an encircling fluid aureole extracted from the clay, while also carving a crater on the top of the mound and cutting pits and gouges in its flanks. As the power was increased, the arc briefly stopped moving and burnt a smaller circular crater within the pre-existing crater, leaving a glowing spot. Scaled up to an interplanetary discharge, that glowing spot represents a duration and temperature sufficient to melt the floors of the Olympus Mons caldera craters and to produce their remarkably flat surfaces. The Olympus Mons aureole also has it's analog on the aureoles of lightning blisters showing concentric scarring. This distinctive pattern directs our attention to a stunning, highly enigmatic counterpart on the Olympus Mons aureole. In conventional terms, the similarity can only be accidental. And, here is an equally profound mystery. Much of the original aureole was overwritten by subsequent scarring. It is only necessary to look closely at the images to see that the overwriting was achieved by a force acting from above with no regard for previously formed ridges and channels. That's the trademark of the electric arcs acting on a surface. In an electrical interpretation of Olympus Mons, successive strokes from a cosmic lightning bolt lifted the peak and carved the craters on the summit. The Olympus Mons caldera illustrates the effect of a sputtering, rotating arc, superimposing flat bottom craters on the summit of an anode blister. It's rapid movement will frequently cut steep terraces into the walls of the superimposed craters. We see the effect most clearly on the caldera walls of neighbouring Ascraeus Mons. On a planetary scale a cylindrical rotating electric discharge can be seen as an array of smaller cylinders. A good example is the cylindrical Earth auroras formed by curtains of smaller discharge cylinders. When electric arcs sputter across a surface they will often stick momentarily to one spot, creating a distinctive scalloping effect, an effect evident on the caldera walls of Olympus Mons and even more evident on the caldera walls of Hecates Tholus to the North. Cleanly cut scalloping is not apparent on the walls of shield volcano calderas. The highly filamentary blanket on the summit of Olympus Mons is to be expected if an 'interplanetary' arc created a focal point of negative charge on a positively charged surface - like the fine filamentary tail of a comet moving through the weak electric field of the Sun. Here we would look for a similar effect on the massive cloud of dust and sediment that fell upon the region. Radial filaments, perhaps even electrically fused material would have poured over the flanks and scarp of Olympus Mons to fill the surrounding moat as a permanent record of the movement of charge. In truth, no shield volcano on Earth replicates the morphology of Olympus Mons. Yet, the pattern is repeated more than once on the Tharsis Rise of Mars, not just superimposed craters and terracing, but as seen in the laboratory experiments with electric arcs, a spectacular array of surrounding pits and deep surface gouges. And most extraordinary is the fact, that the expansive carved surface seen here reveals not a single opening to the great voids that are supposed to lie beneath the surface - the voids into which scientists have assumed these pits and gouges collapsed. Collapsed pits are typically quite obvious revealing either their connection to local fissures or openings to cavernous space below. Examined critically. the supposed shield volcanoes of Mars do not reveal the expected features. This may not exclude the possibility of active volcanoes in the planet's violent past, but with higher resolution images the spectrum of engimas has broadened spectacularly. Electrical events are scaleable, and it should not surprise us to find that events similar to those producing Olympus Mons occurred on a smaller scale, as well. In fact, the surface of Mars is replete with small mounds surmounted by craters. Abundant cratered mounds remain mysterious to planetary scientists. Many of these mounds are remarkably similar to raised fulgarites. In many instances, we see the cratered mounds surrounded by moats or barrow pits. An electrical explanation may be the only explanation that can withstand scrutiny. Most of the formations are under half a mile in diameter. Where we see one cratered mound we typically see others, sometimes by the hundreds, even by the thousands. We see strings of cratered mounds and we see parallel strings; an unresolved geological enigma, but an enigma that reminds us of the parallel streamers common to electric discharge. Many of the higher resolution images are quite recent and yes, it is too early to impose any sweeping interpretation. But, the greatest mistake would be to ignore the converging lines of evidence, evidence that points to planet-wide electrical sculpting of the Martian surface not that long ago. Electrical Sculpting of Mars Is it possible to identify the events that shaped the surface of the planet Mars? A planet of vast but unrecognized landscapes, vista after vista eluding every attempt to explain them. Scientists labour to solve the mysteries through text book theory, but if, as we have claimed, the cause was electrical, they will never get the expected answers. Many details of a new interpretation come from laboratory experiments with electric discharge, but how far can this new interpretation take us toward an understanding of Martian history? One advantage of the electrical perspective is that its every implication can be tested against massive layers of evidence now available, including wide-ranging experiments with electric arcs. Lab discharge between two spheres Anode (Positive charge) Cathode (Negative charge) If as we’ve proposed, Mars was immersed in hemispheric discharge, the planet can be viewed as a laboratory in space for testing the electrical hypothesis. Lichtenberg Figures As seen in lightning displays, electric arcs exhibit dendritic branching called Lichtenberg patterns. These look very much like the dendritic erosion created by flowing water. And electric arcs exploding across a surface can produce sinuous channels that also resemble fluid erosion. Lab discharge to wet wood But there are differences. In electric discharge to a solid surface the electron pathways frequently create dark spotting, or chains of craters, running along the channel floors or close by. The presence of crater concentrations in relation to surface channels offers a fundamental test of the electrical hypothesis. In electric experiments, we also see coronal streamers radiating perpendicularly from the primary discharge channel. Both, the cratering and the coronal discharge are keys to a new understanding of the Martian surface. Martian Channels: scalloping; crater chains; alcoves; pseudo-tributaries Did electric arcs cut the great channels on Mars? Nirgal Vallis is some three miles and more in width and 250 miles in length. Yes, it did look like a dry river bed when first seen by the Mariner 9 mission in 1972, but the original confidence of planetary scientists soon gave way to doubts, then to contradiction. "It is not clear how this channel formed..." A river can take many twists and turns along its path but its tributaries will not look like the blunt alcoves of Nirgall Vallis. Martian channels exhibit the predictable features of an electric scar. Rotating cylindrical arcs sputtering along the primary discharge path produced scalloping of the channel walls with sharp angular projections that are inconsistent with fluid flow. The same process left overlapping craters and alcoves that make no sense in terms of familiar erosional patterns. We see virtually identical craters, alcoves and sharply cut stubby gouges along Nanedi Valles. Nanedi Valles: "The valley's origins remain unclear." Numerous other Martian rilles underscore the same enigma and the unanswered questions grow year by year. Nirgal Valles "tributaries" Electric arc to wood "Collapsed Lava Tubes" Planetary scientists identify depressions such as these, as collapsed lava tubes. Lava tubes form as flowing molten rock cools and hardens at it's surface, insulating the lava below so it continues to flow in a tube that eventually empties. When an empty lava tubes collapses, the result will be an entrance to a lava tube cave. A good example is "Barker's cave" in Australia. So, a cave entrance is the first thing to look for on Mars. The second thing to look for is a rubble field created by a collapsing roof. And a third thing to look for is abundant outflow since the emptying of a lava tube requires an outflow region. Lava outflow But in reviewing innumerable instances of claimed lava tubes collapse on Mars we find no cave entrance, no rubble field from a collapsed roof and no outflow. The depressions stand alone with literally nothing to support the theoretical interpretation. Like any fluid, lava flow follows topographical relief, always running downhill. The channels seen here change directions randomly in apparent disregard for topography. They make 90 degree turns unrelated to surface gradients. And they also cross over each other with no disturbance of either. These depressions can not be collapsed lava tubes, but what are they? What you see here is not the planet Mars. It is a surface affected by very high voltage, but microamp current, creating a complex of gouges and craters. Again, in electrical terms craters and channels are inseparable companions. "Fractured" Terrain In responding to the mysterious channels and depressions on Mars, many planetary scientists thought they saw spreading and fracturing and, indeed, evidence of fracturing is present on Mars as seen here. Here there are no associated craters or crater chains and the nature of the stresses acting on the surface is an open question. Planetary scientists think in the same terms when considering the region of Avernus Colles. They identify the channels as cracks or fractures. But why the concentrations of craters and crater chains? A rotating electric arc traveling across the surface can alternately sputter forward to produce linear chains of craters, or advance on a continuous path to cut channels as if by a router with uniform depth and parallel sides. As seen in laboratory experiments with electric discharge channels, here, the channel width will be the width of the rotating arc at it's contact with the surface. VEMASAT Laboratories, Earth Avernus Colles, Mars Crater Anomalies The question of crater formation on rocky planets and moons must be re-opened. The impact explanation would mean it is only necessary to count craters in order to calculate the age of a surface. But electric discharge on an hemispheric scale could quickly create a surface that looks a billion years old to those counting craters. Plasma scientist Dr. J. C. Ransom of VEMASAT-Laboratories conducted a series of experiments with electric arcs. Electric discharge produced surface cratering patterns closely resembling those observed on planets and moons. Even a surface darkening and central bumps or mounds of so many craters on Mars were present in the laboratory experiment. Electric arcs can also produce cratering patterns that could never be produced by impact. Complex terracing of crater floors and crater walls are a common effect of a rotating electric arc or discharge streamer. Across the surface of Mars we observe countless examples of exotic terracing. Impact theory was never able to resolve the mysteries. So-called bull's eye craters with a central crater inside a larger crater are surprisingly common on Mars. Could this be a rare accident? That explanation is reduced to absurdity when two such craters are seen side by side. In fact several bull's eye craters appear within the same region of Mars. But an ionized discharge path of lightning does allow for subsequent discharge along the same path. The bull's eye crater is a logical extension of the electric model. And when it comes to improbable events side by side these two craters with central peaks each terminating in another crater will certainly never be explained by impact. Impacts do not create hexagonal craters. But look closely at this region of Mars and you'll see several hexagons, an observed form taken by rotating plasma as seen in the planet Saturn’s electrified polar hexagon. In an extended discharge, systematic cratering, pitting, or etching can be the norm. That's why in industrial applications electric discharge machining can achieve exceptionally dependable results. The microscopic pitting of electric discharge can give a consistent depth and a remarkably smooth surface despite the fact that the surface is entirely constituted of craters or pits. The same effect can be observed on seemingly smooth surfaces in the northern hemisphere of Mars, surfaces that have been excavated miles deep. But look more closely with the help of recent high-res images and smooth surfaces are revealed to be nothing more than fields of small densely packed craters. The baffling crater field seen here, like so many others on Mars, is a perfect counterpart to an electrically machined surface. Martian region in high resolution Electric discharge machining (electron microscope) And don't underestimate the scale of this dilemma for planetary scientists. We witness a pattern at both, the low points and the high points on Mars. From the bottom of Zunil crater in the depressed northern hemisphere to the highest point on Mars, the summit of towering Olympus Mons. Here no grasping for conventional explanations such as a dune field could possibly account for what leaps out at the observer. The baffling crater fields seen here, like so many others on Mars, is a perfect counterpart to an electrically machined surface. Electric discharge machining (electron microscope) Lightning's Dendritic Forms Lightning in slow motion More than two centuries after Benjamin Franklin flew his kite, the origin and behaviour of lightning continues to amaze and to puzzle the lightning specialists. Lightning will occasionally imprint it's distinctive form on terrestrial surfaces, Lightning strike on a sidewalk and even on the skin of humans. In the laboratory, the counterpart to lightning is the Lichtenberg figure, perhaps the most common and fascinating form taken by electric discharge. Dendritic means tree-like branching and dendritic forms can be easily confused with fracturing. The dendritic patterns seen here are not fracturing, as the term is normally understood, but electrical break down channels on a polycarbonate plate. Georg Christoph Lichtenberg appears to have been the first to demonstrate the different forms taken by dust on positive and negative surfaces. A line of investigation later followed by others but with no impact on planetary science. Late in the 19th century, industrialist Lord William G. Armstrong explored the power of electricity to produce exquisite forms on surfaces of different charge. The feathery qualities of Lichtenberg figures on a negative surface could be compared to the more dendritic patterns on a positive surface. "Captured" Lightning At Stoneridge Engineering, the technology of Lichtenberg figures has produced an art form, lightning captured in clear acrylic blocks. The blocks are bombarded by electrons from a 5 megavolt particle accelerator arriving at nearly the speed of light but, coming to a stop within a fraction of an inch into the block, a cloud of trapped negative charge. Here, the event producing the dendritic channels is triggered by a simple stroke of a metallic pin. That is all it takes for a breakdown of the insulating material and a nearly instantaneous release of charge and dendritic channels. A millisecond lightning storm frozen into the acrylic block. The branching of the electron channels is a spectacular fractal pattern, apparently occurring all the way down to scale, to the molecular level. From what we have earlier presented it is evident that planet-wide electric discharge created vast regions of raised Lichtenberg figures on Mars. Mars: dendritic ridges Laboratory experiments show that in regions of positive charge dust will typically gather into raised Lichtenberg formations standing out from the surrounding terrain. In fact, sharply sculpted dendritic ridge systems are abundant on Mars showing up wherever the highest energy events are implied. The great trench of Valles Marineris is an extraordinary example. Here, we find the raised Lichtenberg figures exactly where we would expect them, running down from sharp cliffs and high points in predictable patterns, stretching for hundreds of miles along the trench. Yet, strangely, the mystery receives almost no mention by planetary scientists. We also observe dendritic ridges on the great mound of Olympus Mons, both, on the miles high scarp and on the caldera walls. In fact, the mystery is global. We see the same pattern on the walls of major rilles. We see it along the so-called fractured terrain of Noctis Labyrinthis. And everywhere on Mars we see the dendritic patterns reaching down from towering cliffs and mesas. We even see such ridge systems descending from the rims of large craters, opening the door to a much broader perspective on crater formation. Scalloping In the hypothesis presented here, many craters on Mars were produced by the same electrical events that created chains of craters and a great variety of channels or rilles. As a discharge column sputters across a surface, it's diameter will vary with discharge energy and a narrowing or pinching by the induced magnetic field. The pinching effect will be most strongly focused at the point of contact with the surface. The sputtering arc will leave a unique signature in the form of scalloped walls. Popular explanations say that surface collapse must have produced these crater channels. But scalloping effects on Mars are by no means limited to chains of craters. Planetary scientists cannot agree on the forces that created this bizarre channel network north of Valles Marineris. Other channels, that are said to have been caused by fluid flow, either water or lava, exhibit the same scalloped walls. Similar neatly cut scallops appear on the cliffs of towering mesas. And the so-called calderas of the great mountains of Mars reveal the same pattern. Even the celebrated Victoria crater, supposedly formed by impact, exhibits alcoves and scallops similar to those of the great rilles and valleys. And the scalloped walls of Zunil crater are virtually indistinguishable from the scalloped walls of Valles Marineris. Scallops and Ridges Additional patterns enter the picture, as well, including a consistent global connection between scallops and dendritic ridge networks. The explanation appears to lie in the fractal nature of cylindrical current sheets. Current flow can metamorphose into secondary cylinders and fractal-like sub-structures to be pinched by the induced magnetic fields into a narrow highly focused discharge. We see this interplay of different scales in the cylindrical currents of Earth's auroras as charged particles enter and exit the polar regions in an electric circuit. Invisible current sheets, magnetically pinched at Earth's poles divide into visible curtains of secondary cylinders, all dancing in the turbulence of Earth's upper atmosphere. The same electromagnetic structure arising from charged particle movement will at times be seen in the electrified tails of comets. In the larger scale events carving the surface of Mars, we envision multiple columns of charged particles being pinched into a narrow discharge at the surface. This established principle will be crucial to comprehending the giant Valles Marineris with all of it's accompanying chasms. Smaller scallops within larger scallops, they are the imprint of pinched cylindrical currents, constituted of smaller cylinders. The pattern occurs repeatedly and is surely no accident. Consider the consistent relationship between the scalloping effects and Lichtenberg ridge systems. The most prominent of these dendritic forms are those that separate the larger scallops. The smaller dendritic ridges define the boundaries between smaller scallops. At both scales, the ridge networks can be seen as the final events in catastrophic discharge activity as charge redistribution gathered and fused lose material into the familiar Lichtenberg patterns. In this revisioning of Martian history contradictions find a unified resolution in an electrical cause. Enigmatic craters, crater chains, dendritic ridges, scalloped craters, calderas and rilles - all are connected to the observed behaviour of electric discharge. Negative Lichtenberg Figures Here is an image of electric arcing to a negatively charged surface capturing the feathery discharge glow, or corona. The corona is constituted of extremely fine hair-like filaments radiating from the primary streamers. On a surface affected by electric arcing, experiments show that regions of localised charge can attract dust or sediment into a record of the electrical activity, or discharge pathways, down to many fine details. Martian surface Here is a ridge complex on Mars covering thousands of square miles. The ridge forms have puzzled planetary scientists for more than a decade now. Since standard geology does not include such forms, this unique behaviour is a logical test of the electrical hypothesis. Examined closely, we see perpendicular hair-like filaments illuminated by the Sun confirming that electric discharge attracted dust into raised relief. Martian surface This exotic formation was produced electrically by D. Z. Parker on a CRT screen showing a gathering of dust in a region of previous discharge activity. The ridge with its fine filaments offers a striking counterpart to the baffling Martian formations. Surface Etching We have suggested that the northern hemisphere of Mars was eroded electrically to a depth of 5 miles or more, as seen on the global elevation map. It is only reasonable therefore to look for transitional zones on the margins of the more depressed or heavily eroded regions. If the erosion was electrical, what should we expect to find, particularly in the regions that separate the low lying northern latitudes from the elevated and densely cratered southern hemisphere? We should expect to find what we do find - vast regions from the equator northward showing the predictable phases of electrical erosion. First electric arcs raking across the surface created a network of channels cutting the region in discrete blocks. Then the arcs acting on the sharp edges of the blocks continued to extend the Valley floors leaving separate angular islands. The islands standing out above the newly excavated terrain were then progressively eroded into various pyramidal forms then mounds as electric arcs continued to erode the sharp edges. And finally the remaining mounds were etched away. Just as industrial applications of electric discharge machining can erode high points to produce a flat surface. All that is left of the earlier Martian plains are the few scattered remnants of sculpted mesas and bluffs disappearing altogether in a flat depression farther to the north. This transitional process can be observed across great distances on Mars with a consistent pattern, highly cratered elevated plains to the south giving way to isolated blocks, then mounds, then a smooth lower terrain that characterizes so much of the northern hemisphere. Blueberries In early 2004, the Mars rover "Opportunity" returned images that alone could alter our ideas about the recent history of the solar system. The rover had landed in a crater and scattered around the walls of the crater were a multitude of BB-sized spherules. Their blue-grey colour set them apart form the reddish hue of the iron-rich Martian soil. Thus, the informal name given them: blueberries. As "Opportunity" rolled across the Martian landscape it found a profusion of the little spheres that apparently occupied the Martian surface by the trillions. But how were they formed? Not long after the discovery of the Martian blueberries, Dr. Ransom set up an experiment to test the effects of electric arcs on different materials. He obtained a quantity of hematite roughly comparable to the Martian soil and blasted it with an electric arc. The results are quite spectacular. Embedded in the soil were perfect counterparts of the Martian blueberries. From what is now known about the Martian surface, it's clear that if the planet was engulfed in electric discharge, the spherules are a predictable effect. Mars VEMASAT laboratories Ransom's experiments did not end the investigation either. Cameras of the rover "Opportunity" captured a flat floored channel with parallel sides from both walls of the channel we observed jagged razorbacks. One more feature with no place in the geologists' lexicon. But Dr. Troy Shinbrot, and his colleagues at Rutger's University, recently produced this very form, razorbacks, in electro-static experiments. And the researchers did indeed see a direct connection to the razorbacks recorded by "Opportunity". Shortly thereafter, D. Z. Parker also produced razorbacks on the charged surface of a CRT screen. Both, the razorbacks and the blueberries, point to electrical events. And electrical events are scaleable. Formations created on a small scale can also appear on a much larger scale. In fact, our orbiting cameras have found numerous craters with domes or spheres resting within them looking very much like the spheres and craters of Ransom's blueberry experiments. The pictures seen here of domed craters on Mars are from the "Mars Global Surveyor". But in contrast to the rover's blueberry images the domed craters range in size from a hundred meters or less to a mile or more in diameter. And the pattern occurs even on a larger scale. In the polar region of Mars the domed craters are up to many miles wide. It is surely reasonable to ask if the tiny blueberries, and the far more massive domed craters, were produced by the same electrical force acting on widely different scales in an earlier phase of global electric discharge? One thing is certain, if it was electricity that sculpted the Martian surface, the events were vastly more dramatic than planetary scientists have ever imagined. Symbols of an Alien Sky Episode Two The Lightning-Scarred Planet Mars 
[Music] The Electric Universe paradigm has an unparalleled record of successful predictions in the space age. In stark contrast, as telescopes have improved and covered more of the electromagnetic spectrum, astronomers have become more perplexed by exoplanets, stars and galaxies that shouldn't exist. A few brave souls have declared cosmology to be in crisis, but at no time has the belief been shaken in Einstein's gravitational cosmology and its meaningless Big Bang expanding universe. Now, 21st century technology has built and prepares to launch the James Webb Space Telescope, also known as the JWST or Webb Space Telescope. It is described by NASA as “the largest, most powerful and complex space telescope ever built and launched into space, it will fundamentally alter our understanding of the universe.” But fundamental changes in understanding are subject to the dead hand of academic peer review, which is governed by a coterie of top experts who have a great deal to lose if they don't control the consensus narrative. So, there has been no substantial change in our understanding of the universe since the middle of the 20th century. Instead, the narrative has simply become more and more complicated as barnacles of ad-hoc theory have encrusted the Titanic of institutionalized science. Fundamental changes break the consensus. They're the icebergs awaiting sciences’ Titanic. So, fundamental changes almost always come from individuals on the fringe. The field is wide open for the successfully predictive Electric Universe cosmology to be critically tested by the new Webb Space Telescope. NASA states, “The Webb Space Telescope is an orbiting infrared observatory that will complement and extend the discoveries of the Hubble Space Telescope with longer wavelength coverage and greatly improved sensitivity. The longer wavelengths enable Webb to look much closer to the beginning of time and to hunt for the unobserved formation of the first galaxies, as well as to look inside dust clouds where stars and planetary systems are forming today.” Observe this aim is unscientific and therefore unlikely to fundamentally alter our understanding of the universe, since it presumes only the consensus Big Bang gravitational paradigm for study. We've seen that to maintain this narrative, there has been an endless introduction of ad-hoc forces, particles and impossible objects like neutron stars and black holes. Meanwhile in the 1960’s plasma cosmology was introduced by Hannes Alfven, a plasma scientist who won the 1970 Nobel prize in physics for his research. Plasma cosmology is a model of the universe in which plasma and electromagnetic forces play a dominant role on the galactic scale. It's based heavily on observation and experiment, but due to specialism in the 20th century, it's studiously ignored by astrophysicists. They ignore Alfven's Nobel speech warning that their treatment of space plasma as a mysteriously magnetized fluid, is fundamentally flawed. Meanwhile, plasma cosmologists produced the spiral shape and non-gravitational rotation of a classic spiral galaxy experimentally, and with supercomputer models. When they included the weak force of gravity in the computer models, it had no appreciable effect. Such experimentation and simplification are hallmarks of classical physics. Galaxies are governed by electromagnetic forces, not by gravity. Well-organized galactic magnetic fields have more recently been mapped and conform to plasma cosmology. Such fields are unexpected and unexplained in gravitational theory. This alone knocks out the gravitational foundation of Big Bang cosmology. Imaginary black holes and dark matter are not required. All we know about the force of gravity is that Newton's law operates within the present orderly solar system. We can't presume peacefulness in the solar system for most of Earth's history. That's merely wishful thinking and flies in the face of geological evidence of past global paroxysms. And the notion that Newton's law of gravity and the gravitational constant as measured on the Earth, applies universally, is characteristically geocentric and myopic, when you consider our short history and the discovery that gravity theory doesn't work at the galactic scale. So, let's first get Big Bang history right. The Belgian priest-astronomer Georges Lemaitre is usually identified as the first to theorize that the recession of nearby galaxies can be explained by an expanding universe. Einstein is supposed to have said and I quote, ”This is the most beautiful and satisfactory explanation of creation to which I have ever listened.” End quote. But we can forget Einstein. He did away with the force of gravity and try telling someone who has just fallen over that it was the Earth’s warping of space-time that told him to hit the ground. Two years after Lemaitre's epiphany, Edwin Hubble provided evidence that the velocity of a galaxy away from us, increases with its distance from us, a property now known as Hubble's law. The Hubble law implies that the universe is expanding. But that simply assumes the redshift of faint galaxies is due almost entirely to the Doppler effect, which is the increase in wavelength and consequent lowering of frequency of the light from a fast receding object. Mathematicians jumped on Hubble's law for their new creation myth by retro- calculating to a point origin in a magical Big Bang. They now tell us with religious fervor how the universe began and how it may end. What we are not told is that Edwin Hubble termed his famous discovery a ”...redshift versus apparent-distance relationship.” Wisely, Hubble didn't accept his discovery as proof the universe is expanding. Rather than signifying that some faint galaxies are accelerating away from us at a good fraction of the speed of light, Hubble maintained that it was likely some new physics was involved. This was later proved by the astronomer Dr. Halton Arp, who became known by his followers, including some leading astronomers, as the modern-day Galileo, following his banishment by the mathematical priesthood of Big Bang cosmology. Like Galileo and Hubble, Arp worked directly from telescopic observations. He studied the photographic plates and lined his office walls with images of galaxies. He produced the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies. By careful observation he found physical links between high-redshift quasars and low-redshift active galaxies, which proved Hubble was right. High redshift is not evidence for an expanding universe. Arp's research into high-redshift quasars shows they are local. The universe is of unknown age and extent and is essentially static. A Big Bang never happened. The origin of the universe, if that has any real meaning, is well beyond our present deeply flawed science. Let me explain quasars. When discovered in the early 1960’s, quasars were utterly mysterious. In 1963 the Dutch astronomer Maarten Schmidt solved the mystery of quasar spectral lines when he discovered they were highly redshifted. This placed the brightest one, 3C 273 about 1.5 billion lightyears away. The radio astronomer Gerrit Verschuur wrote quote, ”What could possibly look like a star, produce tremendously strong radio waves, resemble double radio galaxies and yet produce so much energy? The full mystery of the quasar becomes more profound when all the information is considered together. They are very far away and the luminous cores are very small. At the distances inferred by the redshift, quasars emit the energy equivalent of 100 billion stars like the Sun, all the energy being generated in a volume of space not much larger than the solar system.” End quote. To make matters worse, it was found that quasar 3C 273 underwent sudden changes in brightness over a period of 80 years. Verschuur notes “This incredible discovery was also completely unexpected.” The sudden changes in brightness were found to be associated with blobs of matter being blasted out in jets at irregular intervals. At the assumed redshift distance of the quasars, those blobs were apparently moving faster than light. Halton Arp published a paper in 2007, ’Quasars and the Hubble relation’, in which he states “...a continuity exists in redshift from the highest redshift quasars to low redshift Seyferts, active galaxies and allied galaxies. Evidence is discussed for this sequence to be an evolutionary track with objects evolving from high to low intrinsic redshift with time. At the end of this evolution the objects are nearly the same age as our own galaxy...” In the case of quasar 3C273 the odds are 100 trillion to 1 against Arp being wrong. Remarkably, Arp found the quasar's redshift decreases discontinuously, in quantized steps, and their mass and brightness increase as they move away from their parent, slowing down to eventually form companion galaxies. Quantization of redshift verifies that it is intrinsic to the matter in the quasar, rather than anything to do with the light on its journey to the Earth, which solves most of the quasar mysteries at a stroke. They are not at the edge of the visible universe. They are local, small and faint, and not moving faster than light. Arp's evolutionary sequence adds a pleasing biological nuance to plasma cosmology which, instead of a black hole, has a doughnut-shaped electromagnetic plasmoid at the galactic center. The plasmoid is formed by electric current fed radially into the galactic center in the case of a spiral galaxy along the spiral arms. The current produces the ordered galactic magnetic field. A similar plasmoid, produced in a laboratory, is the most extremely compact and complex form of electrical energy storage known. The lab plasmoid is formed by a radial plasma discharge between a central conductor, and a concentric outer conductor, which mimics plasma cosmology's galactic circuit. Laboratory plasmoids are observed to emit intense beams of neutrons axially as they lose energy. The Electric Universe model proposes that when the energy density inside the surface of the plasmoid nearest the axis is sufficient to form neutrons from protons and electrons, the neutrons escape axially from the plasmoid's intense magnetic field to subsequently decay into a beam of electrons and protons. On leaving the active galactic plasmoid, the light electrons spiral in the galactic magnetic field, more than the heavier protons. The result is an electron-deficient smaller plasmoid, or quasar, jetted along the active galactic plasmoid's umbilical intergalactic Birkeland current. The coaxial galactic Birkeland current, identified by its magnetic field structure, acts like a cosmic dense plasma focus. Mapping the magnetic field in a jet along one of these intergalactic Birkeland currents, has shown the current to be on the order of 10 billion billion amps. The knots seen in galactic jets are embryonic galaxies. The Electric Universe further explains Arp's quantized redshift and increasing mass and brightness of quasars. The umbilical galactic Birkeland current has an axial current surrounded by a more negative current cylinder, rather like a cosmic coaxial cable. It effectively imitates the dense plasma focus device’s structure. Electrons from the cylinder flow radially into the axial quasar, powering its embryonic plasmoid and, quickly at first, increasing the charge polarization of its subatomic particles and consequently, its particles’ energies and masses in quantized jumps. That gives rise to its increasing brightness and the quantized decreases in redshift, and slowing of the quasar due to conservation of momentum. Arp's discovery demonstrates a galactic- scale quantum effect. In summary, the active galactic nucleus is the plasmoid womb and origin of the jets and the matter forming quasars, or embryonic galactic plasmoids. This simply explains the phenomenal jets and radio-lobes of both parent and child. Halton Arp’s research showed sensibly the universe is of unknown age and extent. It is not collapsing under gravity, or mysteriously expanding. As nature repeatedly demonstrates, it is in balance. Arp realized this raised a serious issue, because it implies that gravity between celestial bodies, must be repulsive. Otherwise, balance is impossible. Of course this is completely counter- intuitive, because we experience gravity only as an attractive force. But there are historical precedents for a theory of repulsive gravity, which was first proposed in the 1690’s by Ncolas Fatio de Duillier and considered at the time by Sir Isaac Newton. Arp studied a later theory known as Le Sage’s theory of gravity. Theoretically it works by a shadowing effect under bombard- ment from all directions by strange high-speed particles, but no plausible particle impact mechanism could be found. However, as I've argued in the past, gravity is a subatomic dipolar electric force which for all celestial bodies has one pole facing outwards and the other inwards. It's equivalent to having spherical magnets with the same surface polarity. This side-steps the problems with Le Sage’s theory. We experience gravity as an attractive force, simply because we are as much a part of the Earth as are the air, rocks and water. We are polarized within the Earth's gravitational sphere of influence, like iron filing stuck to a magnet The James Webb Telescope has the power to see fainter red-shifted quasars, more clearly than before. So, my first prediction is that the James Webb Telescope will support Halton Arp’s research, which shows plainly that high-redshift quasars are born in pairs and emitted in oppositely directed jets, along the spin axis of a low redshift active galaxy. They are not at the edge of the visible universe. They are in the neighborhood of their parent galaxy. Therefore they are not incredibly distant, bright and large. There is no superluminal motion. They are nearby and youthfully faint. By carefully tracking quasar redshift evolution, we will see the transformation from a naked, high-velocity and low-mass plasmoid, to a low-velocity high-mass companion galaxy. Experimental tests of active galactic nucleus behavior by plasma cosmologists should be possible using the dense plasma focus device. In other words, a return to real physics. Theoretical physicists on the other hand have failed to self-correct their theories for a century. It is time for plasma and Electric Universe cosmology to explain Halton Arp’s universe.

”In the sphere of thought, absurdity and perversity remain the masters of the world, and their dominion is suspended only for brief periods”, so opined Arthur Schopenhauer, my favorite of the well-known philosophers because he could look on the dark side. Let me attack some of the absurdities regarding ‘space’, ‘ether’, ‘nothing’ and ’infinity’ by jacking apart the word ’cosmological’. Note the middle word is ‘logic’. Really intelligent, but irresponsible creative thinkers have found the perfect intellectual playground: ‘cosmology’. The subject is far enough removed from practical life that we really don't care that much. We love the sensationalism and creativity and the not so very mundane mystery. But this playground is now costing the world a lot of resources. Hear ‘money’, ‘cash’, ‘moolah’, ‘filthy looker’ or whatever your favorite term may be. In the current expositions of the James Webb Telescope with its discrediting of the Big Bang, now is a good time to call a halt to the cosmological chicanery or ’cosmo-illogicality’. Even prior to the James Webb Telescope revelations, astronomers had discovered large-scale galactic structures. Actually Birkeland currents, which they characterized as ‘massive spinning filaments’ with unclear provenance. These are not so much of unclear provenance in the Electric Universe paradigm, which goes a long way towards climbing out of the rabbit hole, at least in the material realm. Heidegger, a heavyweight thinker, noted quote ‘nothing nothings’ end quote. In other words, nothing doesn't do anything, it can't contain anything like a marble or like the universe. And it doesn't make up real space or volume in the physical universe. There is no such thing as ‘nothing’ or ’nothingness’. The term is just and only a mental marker used for contrast or as a reference, like zero. The philosopher Michael Miller wrote quote, “As Parmenides pointed out about 2,500 years ago, and as Ayn Rand reminded us more recently, there is no nothing. To say that a void exists is to say that there is a place where non-existence nevertheless exists. Voids are absurd - an epistemological error, a figment. There is something everywhere; reality is full. It has no gaps.” End quote. And also philosopher Michael Miller claims quote, “The universe is not in space, space is in the universe.” End quote. Hooray for Michael Miller. Yes and yes. I sometimes wish we could do away with the cosmological word ‘space’. Cosmologically, the term is only good for a vague reference to a region out beyond the observational point. There is the real volume of the universe, which we often call ‘space’, and then we have the imaginary infinite extension of the Cartesian coordinates, x y and z which we call ‘space’. We mistakenly conflate the two concepts. But these are not the same thing. This false idea of space cannot be valid, or reified nor specified. But neither can volume be reified for that matter - but only specified. Neither volume, nor space in general, can be reified into something that stretches, shrinks, curves, warps, or ripples. The material inside the volume may ripple, but not volume itself. Given both sound reasoning and evidence, the EU paradigm has confidently settled on the conclusion that the volume of the physical universe is filled with an ether. In other words, the existence of an ether is axiomatic. It should not be up for debate. Currently, the EU thinking is that this ether is composed of polarizable neutrinos, where there can be no such thing as voids of nothingness. Again, the philosopher Michael Miller has paved some of the way to the model. Quote, ”’Curved space’ is a staple of 20th century thought. Space warps are a cliche of science fiction. Generations of science students have tried to make sense of curved space, and succeeded only in warping their own minds. Curved space is taken for granted among the learned; if you protest that curved space is absurd, they roll their eyes and shake their heads pityingly.” End quote. And also, Michael Miller said concerning the theories of relativity and lack of an ether, quote, “The infamous Michelson- Morley measurements cited by Einstein were poorly done, had too short a path length, were  plagued by other instrumental problems, and did not consider the possibility that ether could be entrained by the earth.” End quote. But what does the term ‘curved space’ even mean if we're curving something not even real? Not only is it a reification but how does it measure up against the principle of immutable units. It clearly violates this principle. There is a correspondence between the human mind and physical reality, which means that if you cannot visualize it, it cannot be real. Bottom line: the whole monstrous mathematical edifice of Einsteinian thinking about relativity, and there being no ether, has a false philosophical foundation. It violates axiomatic physical principles and space-time is a double reification absurdity. Do we not  need to do a massive rethink of all this? More and more, people are beginning to understand that modern academia has fabricated this circus assembly of falsities. A modern mythology little better than the primitive ones at which we scoff and  sneer. In my opinion, our wholesale rethink must also concern the origins of humans on Earth, languages, religions, cosmology, ancient civilizations, the unsound psychological condition of mankind, and more. Not because of the dictates of sacred literature, not because of some mystical revelation does this awareness begin to dawn, but because these unwieldy constructs cannot stand the force of logic and critical thinking applied to the vast amount of evidence and information now available out  there. Much of this corpus fails to become integrated into something more meaningful that makes sense. Thus, we wind up with a construction that fails the simple test of coherence and consistency. Mankind may be on the verge of the most sweeping intellectual revolution ever seen in this world. For the first time in history, there is now a convergence and reconciliation possible between the worldwide catastrophes the first men on Earth tell us they experienced. This ancient global experience, adequately buttressed by geology and planetology, demands a scientifically defensible foundation - a cosmology called The Electric  Universe. When just the framework of this is developed, this reconstruction of the ancient times sweeps away the modern mythology. It will transform our understanding of Earth science, paleontology, anthropology, biology, etymology, origins, and especially psychology and religion. To further characterize this soulless modern mythology, it remains adamant about some of its absolutely absurd and disconfirmed claims, such as the invariance and randomness of radioactive decay; the constant speed of light in space; the absence of an ether; and the universal constant of gravity, among many other aspects. This modern mythology and its followers largely remain impervious to understanding the electrical force as being the major structuring and energizing agency in the universe, as well as the major factor in sculpting the geological formations on the surface of the Earth and the other planets. Would you believe that the proponents of the modern mythology sling vast amounts of time around as the explanation for otherwise inexplicable developments? You don't have to strain to believe this, quote,  “The doctrine that the Earth was of unlimited age allowed geologists to explain any phenomenon, not by the laws of physics, but by ‘reckless drafts on the bank of time.’” End quote. Chamberlain 1899. On the other extreme from nothing or zero, ‘infinity’ may also be a useful mathematical construct. But it cannot be applied to any countable or measurable aspect of the tangible physical universe. It is misguided to think of space being infinite, just as it is for zero being a number. The physical universe may be vast, beyond our scope or scale, but it is misguided to think of it as being infinite in its particulate makeup or volume. The number of galaxies, stars, planets, atoms and subatomic particles, including ether particles, are all countable and the number cannot be infinite. To think otherwise, violates our foundational logic and opens the door to mysticism and intellectual and spiritual chicanery. So, does the physical universe have  a boundary? Maybe not so much. Think of this boundary not as a thing, but rather as a limit of what is included with nothing else. The  non-sequitur question is often asked, what is on the other side of the boundary of the universe? The obvious answer is - nothing. Nothing. The definition of the universe is such that it includes everything that exists, and there can be no thing outside of it. Modern man remains also in denial as to the tenuous hold on biological viability that the earthly biosphere actually has. Essentially in denial that a major X-class coronal mass ejection or a nearby gamma-ray burst could sterilize our globe. With enough warning modern man, via the aid of our military and space exploration technology, might be able to deal with an asteroid on a trajectory of impact. But there is no conceivable way to even ameliorate an incoming giant CME or gamma-ray burst. Given that point locations in space are addressed by the Cartesian coordinates, we can become aware that the solar system is playing a kind of Cartesian doomsday roulette with humans on earth. The frequency of the most powerful CMEs, strong enough to send us back into the Stone Age, evidently averages out to about 50 years. In March 2023 two X-class CMEs were released from the Sun, the most powerful directly opposite to our direction. But even then, it affected our communications. Something to think about, because  we are largely in denial of this threat, and we could do something about it. Burying our national electrical transmission grids, would protect them from both natural CME threats and from nuclear weapon electromagnetic pulses. Recently, plasma torch technology has been developed that makes tunneling 50 to 100 times faster and easier. My final point is a distressing one. In spite of what the truth actually is; about the Electric Universe; about the ancient Saturnian configuration and its catastrophic breakup; about the significant chronological reduction that needs to be done, our human race consistently distorts, misrepresents and sometimes denies what the reality actually is. And we  fabricate something to fit an erroneous paradigm or false sense of security - and for a wide variety of perverse reasons. Maybe someday soon more people can get a glimpse of how far down the rabbit hole as a race we really are. There is a way out, but not without becoming intellectually responsible. [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info In recent months, according to a number of scientific reports, the dusty winds and sand dune formations on the planet Mars have grown even more mysterious. For decades, the Martian winds have  puzzled planetary scientists on Earth. The atmosphere on Mars is of course incredibly rarefied. It's only 0.6% as dense as  Earth's, and yet on Mars, incredible dust storms vastly more powerful than anything ever witnessed on Earth, sometimes engulf  the entire planet. These dust storms are sometimes composed of vast congregations of so-called dust devils, or dust tornados reaching as tall as Mount Everest. All over the Red Planet, countless  strange wind-driven features also present huge mysteries. These include so-called sand dunes which are very different from earthly sand dunes in important ways. In some instances, the dune features appear to be permanently frozen in  to the terrain. In August of 2003, the New Scientist article "All Eyes on Mars" remarked on this and several other Martian  geological oddities. It states, "Mars is proving more enigmatic than ever at the moment. The latest images of the Martian surface taken by NASA's orbiting Mars Global Surveyor have revealed profoundly mysterious landforms that have left geologists scratching their heads. The features include a combination of surprisingly stable dunes, canyons without craters and  rapidly eroding ice caps. All point to amazingly fast processes taking place on the surface. Mars has changed considerably in the past few thousand years -- in some places, even the past two years.  Yet nobody knows why. Unraveling the mystery will require a radical leap in theoretical thinking, says Michael Malin, the geologist  in charge of the MGS camera." However, 16 years after these remarks were published, the required "radical leap in theoretical  thinking" has yet to occur. Planetary scientists today remain confined to the theoretical toolkit which only recognizes the geological processes of wind and water erosion, plate tectonics, periodic impacts from space, and volcanism, as the basic forces shaping  planetary surfaces. But as we shall see, standard geology fails to explain either the processes occurring on the Red Planet today nor the ones that devastated its surface in the past. This point is made emphatically if we examine just one type of geological feature on Mars,  the sand dune. Earlier this year, NASA's Odyssey  orbiter stunned planetary scientists when it captured images of a "dune field" with a roughly hexagonal shape. The dunes are found on the floor of the crater Terra Cimmeria which appear in a heavily cratered southern highland region of Mars. Perhaps tellingly, another dune field, also at least partly hexagonal, can be seen in a nearby crater. As planetary scientists have noted, the dunes and "ripples" that appear on Mars's high southern latitudes, are thought to be stable and so they suggest the dunes could essentially be fossils of ancient Martian winds. But as an EarthSky report on the  puzzling dunes asks, "What about the hexagonal shape? Are we surprised? Yes and no. Hexagons can be found in other places in nature. Another striking example is the jet strean formation at Saturn's North Pole, which is a massive, near-perfect hexagon centered at the pole itself. It's  absolutely astonishing." As those who have followed the Electric Universe theory are well aware, the hexagonal shape of any feature seen in nature may give an essential clue to its formation. Hexagonal craters are seen on rocky bodies throughout the solar system; including Mars, Mercury, the dwarf planet Ceres, and the asteroid Vesta. One hypothesis planetary scientists have proposed is that in each and every instance meteoritic impacts have struck fault lines which have collapsed over time eventually producing the hexagonal form. But of course, this strange reasoning would not account for the hexagonal dune field. However, as we have repeatedly noted, the hexagonal form is seen rather routinely in craters produced by electrical discharge machining in the laboratory. On the aforementioned hexagon at Saturn's North Pole, the mystery for planetary scientists has  only deepened over time. For several years, scientists on earth had pointed to the appearance of hexagons in simple fluid dynamic experiments as the ideal analogue explaining the Saturnian  hexagons formation. But as we reported last year, scientists studying data from NASA's Cassini spacecraft were amazed to discover that the hexagon reaches hundreds of kilometers higher in Saturn's atmosphere than was previously thought. This is problematic because, as noted in a Sciencealert report, "...since wind conditions change dramatically with altitude, the fact that the hexagon shape persists so much higher than the cloud tops is a baffling conundrum." And yet the Electric Universe theory has always proposed that the hexagon formation is ultimately produced by an external electric current entering at the pole. In fact, it was this reasoning that led physicist Wal Thornhill to predict in 2005, that Saturn's North Pole would have a "hot spot" which would match the one already discovered at  the planet's South Pole. When this prediction was confirmed in 2008, it was to the astonishment of planetary scientists, since the pole had been deprived of sunlight for  over 12 years. For decades, the chief principals of The Thunderbolts Project have proposed that experiments with electrical discharge provide the greatest potential for understanding both past and current geological phenomena in our solar system. As we have noted many times, in addition  to producing varieties of "weird craters" seen on rocky bodies, electrical discharge in the laboratory also routinely creates both dust levitation and plumes of ejected material, as seen in this experiment  by Jacob Gable. And ionic winds which can organize dust into dune-like patterns, as seen in this experiment  by Billy Yelverton. These experiments could also provide insight into what actually drives the incredible, towering dust devils, and planet- encompassing dust storms on Mars today. Planetary scientists do indeed recognize that tremendous electric fields are associated with the  giant dust devils. Although they believe that the electric fields are generated by grains of sand and dust rubbing together. However, this begs the question, with such low atmospheric pressure and so little force in the Martian wind, how does one account for the dust particles leaving the surface? Physicist Wal Thornhill suggests a fundamental confusion of cause and effect among  planetary scientists. He writes, "...in an electrified universe charge is already separated on the macroscopic scale and the movement of air in a dust devil is an effect of charge recombination, not a cause of charge separation." The hexagonal dune field on  the planet Mars may have been indeed formed in the past by the same type of electrical discharge that ravaged much of  the Martian surface. As Wal Thornhill explains, "No amount of theorizing based on slow evolutionary geological principles will explain how the giant canyons on Mars are so young that they have no  craters in their walls. The very formation mechanism of Valles Marineris is a mystery to geologists. However, if we make use of the forensic evidence from the past, the formation of Valles Marineris was witnessed by modern humans in late prehistory. We don't need to theorize. Mars, the God of war, was memorialized as the heroic figure in a celestial battle fought with thunderbolts. Mars was struck and a visible scar remained. For the scar of Valles Marineris to be seen by the naked eye requires that Mars  was about 100 times closer to the Earth than it is on its closest approach today!" Indeed in our next episode, we will explore why Mars's identity as the God of War is the ultimate key to understanding the events which make Martian geology so mysterious to this day. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info The planet Mars -- our planetary neighbor and a source of enormous mystery for space science and academia. In our previous episode, our guest Ev Cochrane summarized some of the incredible identities given Mars in ancient myth, astronomical traditions, and religion. For reasons that defy explanation based on Mars's appearance and behavior in our sky today, Mars was globally recognized as a masculine warrior hero, the God of War, a Dragonslayer. Cochrane also described the equally inexplicable, in modern astronomical terms, relationship between the "masculine" Mars and the feminine Venus in ancient storytelling. For decades, Cochrane and his colleagues including David Talbott and the late Dwardu Cardona have worked to reconstruct the catastrophic celestial events that inspired countless global recurring patterns in myth and religion. As Cochrane explains in this conclusion, the reconstruction of these events has involved not merely a cross-cultural investigation of myth, but also sheds remarkable new light on the origins of words and language. I've now had 40 years of experience reconnecting these myths and is becoming more and more apparent that not only are the myths all around the world, but comparative mythology works hand in hand with comparative linguistics or language. And so, take whatever language you want, it doesn't make any difference because languages will always include archaic vestiges of these catastrophic events, and so words will mean things that have no reference whatsoever in the current natural world or the current sky. When you find that confirmed on virtually every continent, you get a level of confidence that suggests that we're on the right track, that's for sure. To take a classic example, we mentioned eclipses earlier, so the universal myth of the eclipse is that a sun-like object is swallowed by a great dragon, right? Of course, as you said, there are no such things as dragons. So what does that mean? And you will find that cultures all around the world will always say, that was a time of tremendous terror, disaster and that indigenous cultures all around, they always made a tremendous noise like banging on drums or clashing shields together or shouting and screaming at the time of an eclipse. Their goal was, according to them, to scare away the dragon. None of that makes sense by current standards. I mean, we just had a full eclipse of the Sun here in the last year or so, which was a spectacular event, but number one -- there was no disaster, there was no loud clanging of sounds, the end of the world did not happen. And so, as you start to piece these things together, you realize that these traditions surrounding eclipses have nothing to do with the current eclipse whatsoever, they had to do with a prototypical celestial disaster that was interpreted as a sun-like object being swallowed by a giant dragon. To give you another example, I think that uses a little bit of language, that will make my point. The Sumerian word, again, Sumerian is theoretically the oldest language on the planet, you know, started writing about 3000 BC, and in the Sumerian language the word for Sun is Ud, but the Sumerian word for storm is also Ud. Now, how is that to be explained? Why would a culture use the same word to describe a Sun as they used to describe a storm? Well, if you pull up the earliest artworks in ancient Mesopotamia, you will see this picture of the Sun will have a giant Thunderbolt or lightning bolt right in its center. So, slowly but surely, you start to deduce that the former Sun was electrical in nature and the former Sun God was the Thunder God. So turn to Greece or take any culture, doesn't make any difference; the same bizarre association of Sun and storm will show up in other cultures as well and also in other languages, so it's not just a wild guess about comparative mythology. This is comparative linguistics and so, that is a powerful argument that some historical event caused these bizarre associations in these various languages. The earliest pictures of the Sun show a giant lightning bolt set right in the center of it. Dave and I had reconstructed that the center was where Mars was at, and so you get this image that Mars was at the center of an intense lightning storm, and so it was constantly being subjected to these unbelievably powerful exchanges of lightning, plasma, whatever you want to call it. Unbelievable torsion of its geological structure. Again, the language also is going to describe that, so when you talk about early words for lightning bolt or thunderbolt, they will have the word star in there. So like you will have, a word for thunderbolt is "astropeleki" for example, and there's dozens of words that I can cite just like that, but it clearly means star-something, in that case star-axe. The original thunderbolt was a celestial, star-caused event. That has never been discerned before, or properly recognized as being at the heart of so much of comparative mythology, but it clearly testifies to the solar system having a radically different appearance in former times. In 1971, when the Mariner 9 spacecraft returned the closest images of the Martian surface to that time, planetary scientists were astonished to observe the stupendous feature of Valles Marineris, an enormous canyon system which is four thousand kilometres long and reaches depths of up to seven kilometers. If Mars was indeed drastically closer to Planet Earth only several thousands of years ago in prehistory, then, as Ev explains, perhaps it's not a coincidence that a figure in myth and storytelling is the scar-faced warrior. I don't think there's any doubt about it. The particular myth that Dave has cited very early on, I'll just read it to you, it's describing this character named Scarface in North American myth and it goes like this, "He was so poor he had no clothes, not even moccasins to wear. He did not play with other children, because they made fun of him ... He had a ridge-scar on his face, and they called him Scarface." So, as I mentioned earlier, when Mars was close to Venus a long ways from Earth, it appeared small, like an infant at Venus' breast, but when it moved on its orbit towards the Earth, it grew giant in size, and so you get the impression that you could see a lot of the surface fixtures on Mars, kind of like we can see the structures on Moon right now when we've got a full Moon, you know, you'll see certain sections of a crater on the Moon or whatever. But there's no doubt that Mars was much bigger than the Moon and when it got close to the Earth, if the scar was there, Valles Marineris, yes, I think that's a very strong possibility. One of the great surprises in planetary science has been the discovery of Martian meteorites on planet Earth. While many mainstream astronomers initially challenged the validity of the discovery, Ev explains why Martian meteorites on our planet are both explicable and necessary in the catastrophists' hypothesis. When we first started discussing this subject in the mid-90s, Dave and I were on the internet trying to get some feedback from the scientists, we had a bunch of JPL scientists on there, the world's famous figures, each and every one of them denied that meteorites could get off the planet Mars, they could not, they had no way that they could figure out how these giant rocks could get ejected off the planet Mars. But we had statements from ancient Sumerian texts and stuff saying meteorites come from the planet Mars, so we were pretty confident that not only did meteorites from Mars make it to Earth but they make it to Earth in tremendous numbers. That just based upon our reading of myth and so, within about five years, very quickly, the scientists came up with this ejection hypothesis where they have some massive celestial objects smash into Mars and ejecting these meteorites. And of course, they place it many many millions of years ago and these, we're supposed to imagine that these rocks have traveled around solar system for countless millions of years and then they just happen to make their way to Earth. Our theory, of course, argues that because of these tremendous exchanges of thunderbolts, the lightning, plasma, and the torsion going on between Mars moving close orbit to Earth, that it just naturally follows that gargantuan amounts of Mars rocks were launched into the atmosphere and because of the close proximity to the planet Earth, it follows that they fell in great numbers on the planet Earth, much higher numbers than would ever be expected from the mainstream theory, and at the same time now, you have a perfectly natural explanation for why Mars lost its water, why it lost its atmosphere. I mean, mainstream astronomers have no envision for why Mars looks like it had tremendous oceans and flowing water and yet there's no possibility of having water today because it's out in the middle of nowhere, it's frozen solid. But given our theory, where Mars was right next to the Earth, it stands to reason that just like the Earth, it probably had water at some point in time and it certainly had an atmosphere at some point in time, and according to our theory of course, it's lost both here in the last five to ten thousand years as a result of these stupendous catastrophes. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info The following presentation is an adaptation of the Mel Acheson picture of the day article Another Fogged Image of Stephan's Quintet. The link to the article may be found in the description box of this video. This image of Stephan's Quintet is befogged with the same obsolete commentary as previous images: the foreground galaxy, collisions, shock waves, and heat. The foreground galaxy, on the bottom-left, is believed to be in the foreground solely because of the consensus belief that redshift is a measure of distance: the foreground galaxy has a redshift of z=0.0026; the others range from z=0.019 to z=0.0225. The consensual conclusion is that the foreground galaxy is 250 million light- years closer than the others. This belief in redshift as a cosmic meterstick has been disproved since the 1960s, but facts seldom affect institutionalized belief systems. Unremarked is the fact that the differences in redshift to the background galaxies place them, under consensus belief, farther from each other than the foreground galaxy is from the Milky Way. Does that make the foreground galaxy a member of our Local Group? Apparently, the illusion of foreshortening with distance works on beliefs as well. Another fact that's consistently overlooked is that the bright ionized hydrogen regions in the background galaxies are about the same as those in the foreground galaxy. Since it's also consensually believed that bright ionized hydrogen regions tend to be of similar size, the consensus has simply ignored the fact. Perhaps the dark matter in the foreground galaxy is positioned exactly right to magnify the bright ionized hydrogen regions beyond through gravitational lensing. The long tails on both the foreground galaxy and the one immediately above it are mentioned and then dismissed as due to "complex interactions in the past." The interactions must have been complex in the extreme to have affected the foreground galaxy. A characteristic of consensus astronomy is a flight into tunnel vision: attention is narrowed to single objects or even to parts of objects and larger connections are disregarded. So with the long tails. On deep images, both tails trail off, in parallel, far toward a large active galaxy, NGC 7331. Radio observations reveal a bridge of radiation that follows the path of the tails and connects Stephan's Quintet with the active galaxy. The bridge continues on the opposite side of NGC 7331 to a cluster of quasars, which coincidentally have similar redshifts to the high-z members of the Quintet. This is obviously another instance of paired ejection from an active galaxy. Of course, what's obvious to one eye is not to another because eyes tend to see what they believe. It's no shock that Consensus eyes are blind to the facts of ejection pairs. Another consensual blind spot covers a high-z quasar that lies in front of the upper-left galaxy. According to its redshift, the quasar should be billions of light years behind the galaxy and therefore as invisible as dark matter. The galaxy is full of dust, completely opaque, and displays an energized region leading right up to the quasar. When scanning this galaxy, consensus astronomers blink in unison. The ridge of X-ray radiation and the core of Stephan's quintet is consensually ascribed to gas heated by shockwaves from colliding galaxies. At 70 million Kelvin, the heating is truly shocking. Overlooked is the fact that long before such a temperature is reached, the gas has been fully ionized into a plasma in which electrical and magnetic forces dominate. The 70 million figure is an artifact of runaway extrapolation from a theory about solids. In reality, the X-rays are synchrotron radiation from high-speed electrons that is an electric current spiraling in a magnetic field. Since temperature is based on random motions and the electrons are aligned in the magnetic field, the concept of temperature is not even relevant. A final observation that appears not to have been mentioned before concerns this X-ray ridge. Stephan's quintet is considered to be a "compact cluster," of which several thousand are known. George Abel catalogued many of them before X-ray observations were possible. A review of several of them shows similar ridges of X-ray radiation across their cores. Others show simply a spot. If these compact clusters are fragmenting quasars on their way to becoming companion galaxies around the parent active galaxy from which they were ejected, the X-rays delineate the central pinch in the parents' ejection circuit. Ridges of radiation show up in clusters whose axis is inclined to our line of sight; the spots result from our "looking down the barrel of the discharge." 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info Planet Earth is home to an extraordinary diversity of species. Their current total numbers are estimated at around 10 million including between 1 and 2 million animal species. However, scientists estimate that documenting all terrestrial species, if it could ever be achieved, could take as long as another thousand years. The consensus theory of the origins and evolution of life on Earth states that it all began 3.8 billion years ago, with single-celled organisms. Through an exhaustive study of the geological record, scientists have constructed a story of our planet's history and the life that inhabits it. But how reliable is this story? We have proposed a radically different origin and history of planet Earth and indeed of our entire solar system. Planets do not form from accretion in gravitationally collapsing nebular clouds. Rather, the Electric Universe has proposed two forms of planetary formation. The ejection of rocky planets from the cores of gas giants and planets forming from the electromagnetic z-pinch effect along the same networks of filaments where stars are now known to form. The discovery of countless so-called 'baffling exoplanetary systems' have further demonstrated the emphatic failure of the two and a half centuries old nebular hypothesis. In our Electric Universe, the actual age of the Earth, our parent star and our solar system, cannot be quantified based on our current understanding. Further complicating any attempts to assess our own planet's age is the overwhelming evidence for relatively recent global catastrophes, events that were recorded in the myths, folklore and countless ancient and religious texts around the world. We have proposed that in an epoch of planetary instability in the inner solar system, powerful interplanetary lightning carved planetary surfaces. A hypothesis with an increasing body of scientific support. As our growing community of experimentalists have demonstrated, countless familiar geological features are easily reproduced by electrical discharge to a solid surface. Of course if these events did occur, both the geological and anthropological timelines of popular scientific theory must be reassessed. Indeed, in our Electric Universe the entire question of evolutionary time-tables must be reopened for further scientific investigation. And today, recent scientific reports have delivered a shocking blow to the standard theory of the evolution of life on Earth. Earlier this year, scientists from New York and Sweden published the results of a sweeping study of 5 million DNA barcodes from about 100 thousand animal species. As reported by phys.org on May 28, 2008, the results are, "...sure to jostle, if not overturn, more than one settled idea about how evolution unfolds. It is textbook biology, for example, that species with large, far-flung populations ― think ants, rats, humans ― will become more genetically diverse over time. But is that true? 'The answer is no,' said Mark Stoeckle, lead author of the study, published in the journal Human Evolution." In addition to this surprising absence of genetic diversity, the authors were stunned to conclude that about nine out of every ten species on Earth appear to have come into being at about the same time, apparently sometime between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago. Study co-author David Thaler said of the findings, "...this conclusion is very surprising, and I fought against it as hard as I could." One unavoidable possibility that these results raise is articulated in the phys.org report which asks, "Was there some catastrophic event 200,000 years ago that nearly wiped the slate clean?" In part one of this two-part presentation, Thunderbolts colleague Peter Mungo Jupp begins a comprehensive and radical reassessment of the questions. How old is the Earth and how has life unfolded upon it? How old is the Earth and all its species? In 1650 AD, Bishop Ussher proposed that the world's age, gleaned from the biblical Genesis, was 6,000 years old. This relied on stated timelines from the book of Jasher. It was not until more recent times that new paradigms started to take hold. William Buckland, in the early 1800's, noted the part that catastrophic events had formed the geological landscape. However, Buckland's student Lyell broke away to form a radical new scenario. Drawing on the work of Hutton, he argued that the Earth was transformed not by unimaginable catastrophes but by imperceptibly slow changes, many of which we can see around us today. For instance, rain erodes mountains while molten rock slowly pushes up to create new ones. The eroded sediments form into layers of rock which can later be lifted above sea level tilted by the forces of the uprising rock and eroded away again. These changes are tiny but he reasoned, with enough time they could produce vast changes. Both Hutton and Lyell therefore argued that the Earth was millions of years old. Time in the form of millions of years was the key to explaining the geological landscape. Uniformitarianism as a theory was thus born. The use of millions of years as an explanation of gradual change was seized on by Darwin who envisaged evolution as a sort of biological uniformitarianism. Evolution took place from one generation to the next before our very eyes, he argued. But it worked too slowly for us to perceive. So out of this was born Darwin's prime theory, evolution by natural selection. Or as we know it, survival of the fittest. Evolution arose from happy slow mutational changes that were either rejected or finally adopted and passed on to future generations of that species. However, the lack of intermittent adaptive species was and is a fundamental flaw to this time-driven theory. Nevertheless, this paradigm still seems to infect every area of modern geology and biology. It was only later that Alfred Wallace reformatted this theory and expounded a totally new concept. He formed the theory of evolution by intelligent design. Parts of the brain, for instance, were so complex that it seemed impossible to subscribe their formation to accidental development. There had to be a guiding force that designed and managed purposeful change. Both forms of evolution described change through time but only Wallace's intelligent evolution limits the power of natural selection to effect biological change. It suggested, in those areas of the biological world beyond the scope of natural selection's operations, some purposeful intelligence must be called upon to explain their existence. In contrast, Darwinian evolution claims that all biological life can be explained through a directionless process of survival of the fittest and random mutation. This fact has powerful implications for the age of life on Earth as it doesn't necessarily rely on time as the arbiter of species change. Wallace's theory complements the late Stephen Gould's most significant contribution to evolutionary biology. This was the theory of punctuated equilibrium which he developed in 1972. The theory proposes that most evolution is characterized by periods of evolutionary stability which is infrequently punctuated by swift periods of branching speciation. This theory was contrasted against phyletic gradualism, the popular idea that evolutionary change is marked by pattern of smooth and continuous change in the fossil record. Gould's theory lays the groundwork for the penetration of cataclysmic intervention into genetic reformulation of species and ceases the demands for long periods of time to explain the age of the Earth and its inhabitants. Now how can we date the Earth's biology and geology? Proof of theories is very dicey as too often they work towards a predefined finale. These outcomes can strongly bias scientific evidence, often this is the case when one unproven dating methodology is used as evidence for the veracity of some new process. This is particularly true in the case of the mitochondrial-DNA-atomic-clock- -follow genetic studies where we'll be aiming our main critique. But first I would like to summarize the more classic methods of dating in our clarification of Earth age. Now firstly you have classic mythology, historical facts and biblical sources which themselves are quite often historic. They often are underestimated but these can be very important sources of both relative, as for parallel civilizational studies, and absolute dating events. But as the historical Egyptian king-lists show, they can be grossly incorrect depending on the basis from which they are sourced. Velikovsky versus the world is but one controversial academic argument. Nevertheless, they do provide in many cases a broad brush to place historical events. For instance, whether it's the Trojan War which circuits around a thousand BC or Maya civilizations, we can glean some rough idea within at least 500 years' timescale. But this is recent history. Beyond 6,000 years ago, we are beyond the scope of written history and have to essentially turn to modern scientific dating tools to support our work. Now let's first examine carbon dating. It's important to be aware of carbon dating fundamentals and their serious limitations beyond 6,000 years beyond the present time. Standardization procedures involving tree-ring sequences has this limitation. Two of the basic assumptions on which radiometric dating are based are that the Earth is an isolated body in space, unaffected by interactions with other bodies and that the decay constant is not variable. Again, the decay constant is not variable. No matter what, no matter where, the half-life of a particular radioactive isotope remains the same. Carbon dating not only varies with the amount of water to absorb it and thus decrease the amount available to the living organism, but would be susceptible with extraneous ratios from cosmic rays. Now at times for instance, CME's, or coronal mass ejections from the Sun, does dramatically vary carbon-12 to carbon-14 isotope ratio and for that matter carbon-13 isotope ratios. Furthermore, even when absorbed by living organisms as to start the clock for carbon dating, there is no guarantee these ratios stay the same. For instance, bacteria can selectively differentiate carbon-13 from carbon-12 and perhaps take them out of the system. They can alter the isotope balance after death. This anomaly is aside from the fact that carbon-14 dates taken in isotopically chaotic times are necessarily heavily distorted. W.F. Libby, the inventor of carbon dating, clearly saw the limitations of the method and the conditions under which his theoretical figures would be valid. Libby understood the three reservoirs of radiocarbon on Earth; the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the hydrosphere. The hydrosphere or oceans and seas is the richest- the correctness of the method depends greatly on the condition that in the last 40 or 50 thousand years the quantity of water in the hydrosphere and carbon thus diluted in it has not substantially changed. The author Flood quotes from Chappell that the sea levels were low, for instance around the Wallace Line, around Indonesia abutting the Pacific Ring of Fire, around 20,000 years ago. This lower amount of water must then generally falsify results. Even the assumed 20,000 year- -old-figure is unreliable if based on erroneous paradigm. The method depends also on the condition that during the same period of time, the influx of cosmic rays or energy particles coming from the stars and the Sun has not suffered substantial variations. There are a number of possible reasons for the variation in radio carbon content of the atmosphere. Changes in the cosmic ray concentration due to the activity of the Sun and galactic influences and changes in the Earth's magnetic field which modulates proton concentration which in turn affects the rate of production of carbon-14. And as Libby, the inventor of carbon dating, states, "These conclusions (this is on the basis of carbon dating) could be false if errors in the very different quantities ― the intensity of the cosmic rays and the mixing rate and depths of the oceans ― should happen just to cancel one another." It should also be noted, most of these specimens were heavily fossilized and the effects of this process may have important connotations regarding contamination. They also reflect a dramatic environment at the time of death. Fossilization could also heavily influence the validity of the assumptions beyond, for instance, carbon dating. Now let's take an example. When characterizing hominid WHL 50 from the Willandra lakes in Australia, the archaeologist Flood describes silica replacing the phosphate in that specimen's bones. Opalized is the term she uses and this to her is proof of great antiquity, but is it? Similarly, Kow Swamps assemblage in Australia has been preserved by calcification, that's fossilization in other words. This fossilization of human remains has occurred without exception in all of the huge Australian limits. Now remember, De Grazia notes; fossil is typically an accident, a disaster, an anomaly. The problem with fossilization is to stop the decay and that means killing everything in the organism at once, including the bacteria. What dies is thus quickly recycled biotically unless some geological intervention occurs. It's quite possible the fossils found in these Australian lunettes were killed instantly and then petrified. Intervention that fossilizes is almost always connected to the cause of death. I suspect, an enormous electrical shock from the Lake Mungo magnetic reversal might do just that. In fact, as Wallace Thornhill points out, "A huge current flow must necessarily accompany a magnetic reversal." If that's the case, which it must be, then the Lake Mungo and Lake Victoria deposits in Australia might be the result of past catastrophic electrical interactions between the Earth and a cosmological event. Could this fact also signal a possible mutation driver? However, paramount is the fact that all of these remains are not necessarily ancient because they're fossilized. Secondly, as Gillespie, who dated much of the Willandra hominids, points out; The very nature of fossilizing can skew the results of carbon dating. If the carbon is replaced or transmuted to silicon, ratios can easily be altered. From this contamination or selective bleaching of the carbon-14 isotope to heightened age. His doubts are voiced in this quoted article, "Have direct dating measurements on skeletal remains helped to resolve the Lake Mungo, Willandra Lakes, chronology? Should we believe the older dates, which always seem curiously more desirable to archaeologists, measured on base-soluble humic acids fractions, or the younger dates on insoluble residues? The unpalatable choice for both black sediment and burnt bone dates seems to be between soluble or insoluble organic humic substances, both of which are of unknown composition and dubious origin. Now the architect Webb argued for the older soluble humic acids dates on these burnt bones, on my advice at the time. I subsequently changed my view and supported the younger insoluble dates, on the grounds that humic acids of whatever age are not likely to represent the burnt carbon we seek in charcoal or burnt bone. Not much of a choice and neither may be the real age." The problem of the doubtful integrity of fossil carbon dates has also risen with Tom Loy's work at Australian National University. Using a technique of minute samples of blood from the bone carbon residues of human remains, ancient human remains, he was able to accurately date those samples. The reasoning is; the blood, unlike other protein remains, is extremely robust and gives a distinct clean reading compared to other protein samples. These are classically destroyed by many environmental actions, for instance bacteria. With these minute samples, he was able to date not only megafauna from Lake Eyre, South Australia, but samples of the de WHL 50 hominid from the Willandra Lakes. The mass spectrometer reading was 5580 years before the present. This directly clashed with the expected chronology of forty to fifty thousand years that Alan Thorne, the chief archaeologist, expected. Thorne claimed contamination but was it? More likely, the fossilized samples as distinct from the relatively pristine blood, had been incorrectly assumed to be accurate. This is so often the case. Contamination is often cited when great discrepancies occur between expected dates and incongruent results. Stay tuned for part 2

[Music] [Music] so the cultural impact of planetary history this is a huge subject and it's been around the catastrophist movement for decades now and additional nuances just continually come in to the studies the research into the effect of planetary catastrophe on human history probably the greatest challenge for someone coming into this subject matter with an interest in historical studies more interest in history than say in theoretical physics is that there seems to be an incompatibility that these subjects don't seem conceivably aligned up to the level at which a coherent synthesis might be possible but I am here to testify to the possibility that a coherent synthesis is possible up to a level that has never been adequately or fully appreciated it's possible through the lens of a new paradigm and that lens is what give what gave us what gave wal thornhill and myself the possibility of a lifelong collaboration it simply requires us to ask certain unasked questions have planets always moved on their present courses this idea that planets close to the Earth may have impacted humanity up to the level of provoking the early civilizations the whole new cultural expressions storytelling myth-making and monumental construction the birth of civilization itself that consideration required a contribution from Immanuel Velikovsky to give substance to this possibility that planets very close to the earth engaging each other electrically impacted cultures the world over up to the level that history would never be the same I was powerfully affected by Velikovsky's worlds in collision in 1950 he published the book I didn't read it until 1968 but that impact on me personally just redirected my whole life my lifelong interest emerged in a completely different direction I was the founder and publisher of a 10 issue series on Velikovsky that became the first issue became a number-one bestseller on several campuses and this book Velikovsky reconsidered is a collection of articles from that series Velikovsky's message in a nutshell planetary instability within human memory human memories count as evidence and electricity was highly active many people reading worlds in collision did not adequately appreciate perhaps that Velikovsky was vitally interested in the way in which electromagnetism could answer the dilemmas that would not be answered under Newtonian paradigm the comet Venus nothing seemed more preposterous to astronomers in this fundamental challenge left by the Velikovsky evidence that the words and the symbols for comets and the stories about comets were the stories of the planet Venus Velikovsky insisted that the planet Mars was intimately involved in a phase of upheaval the earth and humanity powerfully affected deeply affected by a close approach a planet of the planet Mars on more than one occasion and in these events he highlighted the role of the cosmic Thunderbolt which has become a signature theme for us within the electric universe movement and for some of us just knowing that Velikovsky had an idea about the earlier dominance of the planet Saturn this was not much in the public domain at all as I got to know Velikovsky but I couldn't let go of the this background conversation that Velikovsky had things to say about the original role of the planet Saturn earlier in the Solar System history and so I made a special effort to track down key ideas of Velikovsky on the planet Saturn I went to the triple AF symposium on Velikovsky 1974 in San Francisco and that gave me a really vivid feeling for the nature of the the challenge Velikovsky was so he was so fundamentally dismissed and and the the conflict so unresolvable that I had to accept that anything I would develop in terms of a life's work and I was a well underway in February 1974 but I had to just accept that it would be an extremely difficult challenge to continue work up to the level of producing conclusions that I would see as reliable given the nature of this huge divide a seemingly irreconcilable divided between Velikovsky and mainstream science I developed a most special interest in the mythic age of Saturn received a contract with Doubleday in 1975 my book the Saturn myth was published in 1980 and then there was a subsequent evolution of a theoretical framework but to which I gave the name the polar configuration I came to believe very strongly that a focus on a configuration of planets close to the earth several thousand years ago just ahead of the advance of the emergence of the first civilizations whatever timeframe your own chronological thinking would put to the emergence the first appearance of civilized consciousness with all the unique emphases on symbols and writing and ritual practices kingship and so on whatever that date is it occurs out of a prior epoch of history that was much much different so I want to actually today address a little bit about the phase before the rise of civilization which it so caught my attention everything the Saturn myth related to the earliest symbols of humanity expressed by the great civilizations but it's clear that there was more to it it became crystal clear that there are a set of forces that work against a novel idea in the sciences and that includes the distal cost of challenging authorities but actually hanging even more deeply is cut to the cost of being wrong I mean having to recognize that something was claimed that we had claimed a high had claimed it could not be supported and had to be changed now and the fact is there were critical junctures in the history of my own research my personal investigations forced me to revise things that I had felt strongly previously a kind of conviction but that gradually unravels under further research and then over all of this there is this huge influence of the uniformity principle as today so before we just fire up our computers feed in the movements of the planets and we think we can announce where the planet Mars was in 2020 300 BC something so fundamentally erroneous in this assumption that it's just about well it's the first thing to confront in serious search in catastrophist history the idea that what happened in the past will happen again also infected all of the earlier cultures they were all awaiting the recurrence of doom today they celebrated it every New Year's the catastrophic transformation and reemergence of the world they constructed on earth sacred temples and cities as replicas of a formation in the sky the cosmic temple the cosmic city and there is a pervasive influence of this assumption and a kind of identification between the the motives of the gods and our own motives so we grow angry we get married we commit crimes and so on we argue we go to war that the gods did the same as far as the method of the research that will redeem itself step by step as an investigation unfolds cross-cultural points of agreement must be a first level of the investigation because that's the reflection of a shared experience and the subject of this investigation is entirely focused on a global experience all global archetypes must be included because there was a myth making epic and that myth making epic is the source of the global archetypes highest priority goes to the earliest sources because they were the closest to the experience and there's an observable gradual degradation over the centuries where the archetypes are progressively lost or adapted to local circumstances and interpretations so the authenticity is highest closest to the event and this is a a worldwide experience out of which the great civilizations themselves arose so all of the defining features of the early civilizations have to be a part of this investigation and that makes unavoidable this requirement that we be open to new possibilities because so much of what is to be explored in the mythic archetypes globally registered mythic themes will never find an explanation in conventional terms no archetype ever recorded globally in other words ever identified by cross-cultural investigation will ever find an explanation in anything that we experience today it's it's that fundamental a dichotomy and if the events suggested here actually occurred how could we know if planets were actually hovering close to the earth engaging each other dynamically electrically cosmic Thunderbolts passing between planetary bodies how do we deal with evidence that has remained hidden as evidence for thousands of years everything comes down to patterns that have no explanation but must have an explanation because they are global and they are all inseparably connected to each other acid tests of a new perspective an emerging reconstruction of the ancient past will have to integrate a field of evidence ranging from archaeological the historical testimony respect is from earth become absolutely essential laboratory analogies of discharge phenomena are equally essential planetary science the features on planetary surfaces that are not explained in the terms of the uniformitarian principle radical alteration of surfaces and abundant evidence of electrical sculpting from one planet to another and of course the test of logical consistency we do not indulge contradictive assertions a contradiction means that a correction is absolutely mandatory now let's see I want to go back to a period of human history with which I had many conversations with others in the 1970s in the 1980s but when I got into the birth of the civilizations as a dominant focus that took over it precluded me from giving adequate attention to ideas I had originally considered and conceived in in advance of the polar configuration as a principle and before the counting of time means there are no there are no chronicles there's evidence there's archaeological evidence there are there pictures carved on Stone but there is no referent historically no reference archaeologically to give you a fixed marker except dating processes that are themselves subject to a great deal of criticism but we're talking about before the birth of the first civilizations a very familiar form the rotund goddess I've picked up dates suggested around 3,500 BC I pay little attention to variations in de Deena I'm just personally satisfied that we're going to be going through a period of confusion as to how you find reliable reference with respect to dating but this goddess figure it caught my attention there there are a few people here I think with whom I discussed an idea about the goddess figure the the rotund goddess the prehistoric goddess before the rise of the great civilization there's something compelling and because I was moving into a sense of planetary upheaval I couldn't get away from the idea this possibility that this rotund goddess figure was actually an earlier or signified an earlier phase of planetary alignments or gathering in the sky in a cloud of dust or gas I never used in these discussions the word plasma because I had I hadn't ever even heard of such a word way back then but the mother goddess a very popular study today but look for an explanation of this strange figure I was in imagining planets before the emergence of a polar configuration just immersed in a gaseous environment presenting many many different rather weird formations that suggested to humans on earth perhaps a feminine form there's something compelling about the underlying consistency of the ideas at the same time the lack of precise Accord is at least as as obvious but I've never found in any attention I've given to the Prius this prehistoric phase and specifically this mother goddess figure I've never found anything remotely satisfying as an explanation other than this possibility that there was a celestial condition and planetary bodies gathered in the sky fed this human idea of a great mother now some of you will be familiar with this form and it where we're out of the Paleolithic period fully into a Neolithic phase of human history earlier the earliest emergency emergence of the great civilizations in Egypt and Mesopotamia and this is different what is opening up here in terms of my own lifelong work is a sense that something fundamentally new appeared in the sky and this is associated with a Neolithic goddess form you see these forms heavily emphasized in Egypt for example from where this comes and I have asked myself a year after year is it possible that a coherent explanation of what occurred between that Paleolithic cave art phase and then a Neolithic phase where goddess forms emerge then quickly there are stories told about goddesses and so on that they have no prototype I mean these are the first stories told by the earliest civilizations I see that figure of the goddess is indicative of a transition but then that drew my attention back to what is missing in our understanding of the pre civilized state the artwork the gathering of artists and caves painting beautiful images on the walls of the cave now I want to just suggest an idea and then see if this can be is this confined substantiation in some of the evidence I'll present but here's the idea there was a phase of history before the rise of the civilizations in which the earth moved through a cloud of gas and dust plus rocky material deadly Falls of debris from the sky forced humans into caves and in that environment of deprivation they experienced a yearning for what was lost and what was lost was under whatever name a culture might use the happy hunting ground this open expanse of about natural abundance on earth that ended in horrific catastrophe driving human beings into the refuge of caves the happy hunting ground they yearned for a return to that human condition of abundance and natural ease so having a frame of reference with respect to the occasion an occasion of catastrophe forcing humans to retreat the caves where they yearned for a return to paradise raises a question then about that natural environment we're human beings driven to find that refuge in a cave nothing speaks more powerfully for this possibility of material falling from the sky threatening life than a dolmen the in many instances the most imposing structure is a roof and I could not I have never found in any specialized study of prehistoric art and pre civilized communities I've never found an explanation that made any sense for the rise of dolmens I mean all the way from northern Europe to Korea you find these things but then also you have the occurrence of humans retreating to caves in the American Southwest and so on so there's something to be explored here that hasn't even been touched yet in the conventional treatments of these subjects and there is also a profound sense of incompletion a desperation perhaps to find protection that's not a completed structure if they're interrupted everything is so crude there's no architectural beauty to any of this so what was what was driving this human activity and in a a rather narrow layer of human history nothing of the sort before that layer and nothing afterwards comparable to this isn't this an indication of a desperation for protection it struck me then well if the cave was a place for some humans to retreat and dolmens were another form of protection I wouldn't expect to find a dolmen right outside the cave so it seemed rather an interesting test and I haven't found any dolmens that were in located in very close proximity to a cave but both the presence of humans in caves and the construction of dolmens as protective measures with a certain sense of desperation implied in the crudeness and so this was not an epoch of the in the human past where humans had the luxury of artistic splendor and so on which comes very shortly thereafter was humanity threatened by rocky debris falling from the sky there's a kind of transitional phase indicated where something like protection Iraqi protection begins to merge with a larger artistic and maybe even religious formalism and the nodular temple complex is a good example of that but one begins to take the subject up would find plenty plenty of examples that are suggestive of a transitional phase I need to jump ahead here then there is the myth making a book and this is an entirely new explosive emergence of imaginative expression where there's a bit of absurdity it involved almost nothing is naturalistic except parts of the human figures and animal figures that are combined in these preposterous ways I was originally I was eventually satisfied that all of these representations were due to an overarching requirement to use naturalistic symbols to express aspects of the phenomena being experienced we're often a mere human figure or a mere animal in its natural appearance was not sufficient to capture the country the complex features of what was being experienced this is in close this experience you would place very close to the beginnings of the first civilizations with the sense that the civilizations themselves emerged right out of this experience and provoked by this experience multitude of bizarre combinations of natural forms that were needed to capture the details of what humans were experiencing around the world a bearded serpent a feathered serpent a fiery serpent and so on all of the most prominent archetypal images of serpents and world mythology are ludicrous but it is significant that they all exhibit the defining features of comets with the first emergence of a language of comets in the early astronomies the language is the language of comets was the language of a planet and we'll get right to it to that and speaking of absurdity there there has to be an explanation for the things that could never make sense in terms of our familiar reference because features such as the single eye well this is worldwide we can't dismiss these things just because they have this appearance of absurdity but everything as it comes to be expressed with the expansion of artistic representation everything just appears completely disconnected from what we know what we actually observe and yet the signs and symbols of that human experience are global just shadows nothing to give them real life or believability leading to the question what was the age of gods and wonders there would not be a civilization emerging let's just say 5,000 years ago that failed to remember a mythic age of gods and worth gods and wonders the gods ruled for a time and then they went away now is that a natural story to tell it just seems too well focused on a human memory that has to have an explanation and why did we stop believing in the gods well we stopped believing because the natural order no longer supported any of the myths every myth became absurd against a test of natural experience why then the mythic archetypes not one second here when did I start 10 19 okay if I could if somebody could give me a three-minute warning I'll have a good sense as to how to wrap it up ten minutes left super thank you one of my favorite quotes of all time all that the earth inherits will be what will he assures us that's Berossus be consigned to flame when the planets which now move in different orbits all assemble in cancer so arranged in one row that a straight line may pass through their spheres talk about absurd there's no there's no basis in human experience ever in planetary history deposit this sort of primeval state of things and yet it is exactly what we would expect from the evidence that a configuration of planets hovered close to the earth a polar configuration as I called it initially in 1972 involving planets in alignment with an axis running right through the centres of these spheres and associated with a primeval time that occurred and then disappeared fell into confusion giving way to Wars of the gods archetypes stand out Saturn as the all-encompassing sphere of heaven a preposterous idea Venus the animating heart and soul the feminine glory of heavens this was the mother goddess in ancient Egypt always called the eye of raw raw the primeval Sun not our Sun today but the the founder of the world of the gods in primeval times always associated with the rise of civilization itself the connection of Mars mythically to the innermost reddish masculine heart of the heart the Egyptian haben Hattie the male apart within the larger sphere of the hata heart and Jupiter hidden behind Saturn in this phase we never seem to have a sufficient opportunity to take on the Jupiter aspects of this configuration even though from the very first formulation of a configuration I had Jupiter hidden behind Saturn and the story is absolutely fundamental and one of my promises of the past year that I've expressed to a few people is that I'm going to bring the notes on to out into the light of day because that started way back in 1972 and there are many hints of people picking up that this is actually a critical part of the story of Saturn Saturn gives way to Jupiter as a a kind of reincarnation of himself it's the Jupiter emerges as the younger version of Saturn and this is the new year's festival underlying concept the primeval universal sovereign gives way to a rebirth of himself and each of these most fundamental archetypes reveals an aspect of what I've called the great conjunction which defines the polar configuration an alignment of planets unlike anything that we observe in our own time basic themes to explore if you open up this field of investigation for yourself the idea of a primeval unity always associated with the Golden Age remembered as an undifferentiated form of the sky great conjunction of the first time which means the beginning of time this planetary configuration can be traced back to the myths and symbols of how time began that means how the counting of time began how kalindra chol systems were inaugurated on earth central Sun is the heart of creation that's a global theme and then the astronomical traditions that central Sun is consistently identified as the planet Saturn even Helios was archaic Lee remembered as Saturn and the central Sun had a station in the place it was the axis of the turning sky at the celestial Pole all of the heavenly bodies moving visually around that Center the identification explicitly in Mesopotamia of Saturn as Hamas the Babylonian sun-god shamash is explicitly named as the planet Saturn and of course no one has ever explained why in various astronomical traditions Saturn was not just associated with the Sun but was located at the celestial Pole the Chinese one D for example probably out of this whole field of research nothing is more important than the creation legends but the importance of the creation legends only emphasizes the essential discovery that the creation legends emerged out of human experiences it wasn't remote speculation backwards or anything of that sort the creation legends involved human beings recounting how the gods themselves in the beginning of time created a huge towering edifice in the sky as their homeland this is the land of the Gods the place where the Wars of the Gods occurred the place of creation and this evolving configuration in the sky I have proposed is the entire subject of world mythology and I'm satisfied sufficiently now with the integrity of that evidence to say there there are no other myths than those that relate to the history of the book of the polar configuration no other mythic archetypes so I'm not making a statement about a local story or anything of that sort but if you find a global pattern I will assure you that it will have an inseparable connection to every other global patterns and the net and the aggregate effect of those connections will be the story of world mythology global patterns mean everything because they couldn't be there without the human experience that's the idea to carry forward in this investigation once it begins to register nothing will look the same Venus was always the mother goddess in every land no nothing in the appearance of Venus that could be identified either in any I mean from any vantage point on earth or anything of that sort would have any bearing on this universality of Venus as the mother goddess and Venus as the great comet there's been a great deal of discussion of the cometary aspects of Venus you can find many video presentations relating to the comet Venus on the Thunderbolts project website the Thunderbolts project YouTube channel and so on Mars is the cosmic warrior wielding a cosmic Thunderbolt that looks nothing like lightning cosmic Thunderbolt no connection to the appearance of lightning association with the ancient warrior and identified as the cosmic mark as the planet Mars Mars also presented as a great pillar or world mountain stretching between the earth and the center of the sky the domain of the gods themselves in primeval times I've really not in recent years said anything about the primeval seven but people asked people on the Saturn mythical seven lesser bodies in the presence of Saturn what are they and I just identified as the primeval 7 another worldwide theme how much how's my time doing right now bill two minutes perfect the jovian New Year deserves much more investigation than has been published and I do know that there are individuals who are bringing significant research to this subject and I hope that folks here will keep their eye out for the emergence of this story I do intend myself to add to this discussion on the jovian new year myself this is actually the place for me to stop that all right two minutes yeah okay [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] 
[Music] [Music] dr. bill Mullen classics degree from Harvard in 1968 and PhD from University of Texas postdoctoral fellow at Berkeley I mean the man's been all over the place but he's finally put down roots since the 80s at Bard College in New York but we're glad that he uprooted himself long enough to be here with us today dr. bill Mullen Thank You Tweedledee so hieroglyphics and the ancient sky remembering assimilating easing forever a little over 40 years ago and as we've been saying in the Bible 40 years means a very long time this 40 years ago I had the youthful presumption to write an essay entitled a reading of the Pyramid Texts published in the Talbots Paul say series Immanuel Velikovsky reconsidered reading in that title meant of course interpretation today matured I hope by those forty years I will be giving you another reading of the Pyramid Texts and other Egyptian writings you should be forewarned that by reading I mean not only interpreting but also a good measure of reading out loud with these texts and therein Cantore rhythms my interpretation is summed up in my four gerron's verbal nouns in my subtitle so remembering assimilating easing forever in these gerunds refer to structures of thought habitual to the priestly scribes who composed texts for the dead the same structures of thought I will argue so as for fundamental and omnipresent ways in which Egyptians thought accommodated itself to cosmic catastrophes and ultimately learned to cease to fear them to forget them at its simplest forgetting came to take the form of the fading away of an earlier meaning of a single hieroglyphic into a non cataclysmic later meaning let's begin by looking at a single hieroglyphic on the title here the so called I of Horus it is a Falcons eye the vertical line an enclosed area to its left or plausibly enough interpreted by Egyptologists as the typical black line coming down from the Falcons head though you will find other interpretations in this room to the right however is a line curving in on itself a curl and this line is simply not to be found on Falcons I'm sure because I checked with a cadet and the falconry Club at the United States Air Force Academy and with due diligence he sent me copious Falcon photos and none of which was the mysterious curl to be seen in recent work F Cochrane whom I hoped would be here to speak after me has argued that this curl is the hair of the comet Venus whose rampage on earth and sky he associates with the planet Mars he argues forcibly in unpublished work but also in a chapter in his recent 2010 on fossil God's and forgotten worlds the chapter the Horus star that Horus is none other than the name for the planet Mars and the two goddess Hathor is none other than the name for Venus the curl on the eye of horus he argues would be specifically depicting the hair of Venus in cometary form the curl cochran points out can be found on the red crown one of the two crowns of the Pharaoh as commonly depicted as wearing a mysterious curl moving up from the Crown's base and this curl can be found in representations accompanying other hieroglyphic texts independent of either the Eye of Horus or the red crown another such glyph is a this is another this is the second of my Horus with the red crown the white crown together Anna on the moving up from the right the curl another such glyph is a disc with the famous your Reyes affixed to it on the far left a Cobra that spitfyre we do not see such a thing in today's sky the third gift is a circle with four sets of parallel lines inside converging on its center this is on the far right used in words for city or town it's standard interpretation is of two crossroads intersecting enclosed in a disc there's no evidence of circular walls or actual streets intersecting at right angles there any relation to the plan of a normal Egyptian city Dave Talbot has shown the dominance of this figure in cultures around the globe and sees it as visible in the ancient sky and interpreted by different cultures as different forms it does not in any obvious way depict the way Egyptians design cities for Talbot it is the celestial City one of his many archetypes which are counterintuitive because they are not seen in today's world my final glyph the second from the left is the simplest a circle with a dot in the middle to be found as part of the spelling of the word raw it is used in everyday phrases such as rah Neb translating everyday translate it every day and fitting the context as such but why a dot in the middle of the circle my thesis can be summed up and symbolized by the last of these hieroglyphs if this glyph as Dave Talbot has been arguing for 40 years once depicted the presence of a smaller planet in front of a much more massive one and we've had the great pleasure of seeing this in glorious color and just now a presence of a planet aligned between it and our Pole and therefore seen from the earth as it's at its centre the larger disk the larger planet and the the discs of the point in the center or the small circle in the centre you must also have over long time come to be used by Egyptian writers of hieroglyphic language to mean simply the Sun we see today in other words it was read by Egyptians as the Sun who's reliable rising in the east and setting in the West were symbols of stability and sent eternity an older understanding of a glyph had faded into a newer one as an example of a better and is example of this latter meaning here is the famous adoration of Raw at the beginning of the papyrus of ani adoration of Roffe when he rises in the eastern horizon of heaven can you see the the circle with the dot at the center just as one of five components of a glyph over the second word raw all right so we have it spell it with a mouth and an arm raw we have the picture raw and then we have the symbol of a god all right so this is a perfectly normal use of it in Egyptian which let me use this one cosmic cliff now to unveil the four somewhat cryptic participial nouns or jaren's which form my subtitle remembering assimilating easing for every taken as an ensemble I will argue they bring to the surface some of the deepest patterns of meaning in Egyptian texts and in no instance better than in the process by which this glyph comes to mean our daily Sun I will give examples of these Jarrod's at work from two representative sets of Egyptian writing an earlier and a later the first from the Pyramid Texts of the Old Kingdom specifically from the spells of the pyramid of who knows the oldest to contain inscriptions by the way here you can see a reconstruction the funerary temple leading down to the Nile the causeway the mortuary temple greeting the body or sarcophagus and then if you look at the schematic diagram once you've arrived at the enter entrance you can see a burial chamber I don't know if I should get into using this or not but the sarcophagus is brought through here it arrives at a burial chamber and the ritual of resurrection is to get the Kings body out of the sarcophagus at this western side and move into this eastern side from which Polaris will be happy to remember there is an exit for the Kings soul headed north all right inside you can see how splendidly preserved the hieroglyphs are there stars on the ceiling and various designs here but then if you look at most of the wall is perfectly preserved hieroglyphs only a one break and this is as though you were reading in the world's oldest book because most stable book the pyramid has no space into which to collapse so it remains stable and the lifts are in stone and legible and we can read them today the second set of inscriptions is from the book of the heavenly cow in the New Kingdom I will show you the Helena cow right now it is from the scene on the a number of New Kingdom teen tombs most particularly the Hall of columns and the tomb of Seti the first and to get a better glance you can see how the cow is heavenly or celestial because the bark of the Sun goes across it like this and sets there we will come to the story about how this cow became the heaven on which the Sun moved in a just a moment I want to make clear that by using old and New Kingdom examples I am just by the way making a point that there's no essential difference between the two in other words don't expect that I will find in the Pyramid Texts secrets about the ancient sky different than those I find in the New Kingdom texts alright this is one pattern I see earlier and later so let me in a way in a preliminary way go through my jaren's with examples in the order in which I've arranged them I will then use examples from my two sets of texts to to show their evident pattern of meaning in the Egyptian mind and proceed from there the first round gerund remembering designates the narrating of these anomalous events in the sky which affected the earth catastrophic lay Egyptian literature is curiously deficient in straightforward tales of world destruction by celestial beings more often in Egypt such events are just alluded to in a cryptic phrase or cryptic if the reader does not already know the story but both a narrative and an illusion are forms of remembering and I will treat both as such by looking at my two chosen texts assimilating next is my word for the omnipresent spells by which the deceased becomes one God or another in simple declarations such as I am raw such assimilation is to be seen in all mortuary texts not just royal ones as god of the dead Osiris has pride of place in the Book of the Dead which anyone wealthy enough could Commission ascribe to fashion for his tomb in the well-known papyrus of ani from which I showed you the first line a second ago we read incessantly of Osiris on me doing this or that of the next world Osiris Omni converted into the god Osiris assimilated into the great God in the Pyramid Texts the King is commonly assimilated into the being of the greatest of all gods hot war my third term easing is a short word for a lovely process it refers to the many ways in which the deceased is said to be at peace and at ease peace consists of doing things deemed Pleasant in Egyptian life sailing in a stately Barker barge such as a God might sail in smelling a lotus playing a board game wandering in Pleasant fields such as the Greeks would call elision these mortuary texts allude occasionally to catastrophes in the for time the combat between Horus and Seth or the raging of the eye of the Sun or the eye of horus but for the most part they speak of present and it recurrent serenity the eye of horus is too clear to have been returned to the deceased like Horus the deceased has been judged by the court of the gods and found vindicated as reward for his purity the deceased has spells from mounting to the very bark of the Sun itself there he is said perpetually to reverse the sky from east to west in the company of this most radiantly visible god of the present the idea of a perpetual present takes me to my last gerund a word I made up for evering I use it as a transitive verb for what the spells of the scribes mean to affect for the deceased the King will live for millions of years in eternity and everlasting us he's entered a state of being which is totally secure and whose changes are only those of a cosmos dominated by the unending circling of the Sun psychologically one may say that all anxiety whether triggered by memory of world destruction or by the thought of personal death has been allayed and once we admit psychological thinking it is easy to go further in analyzing the true dynamic of this forever it is denial a denial enabling amnesia forgetting so now let's go through quotations from the two sets of texts I mentioned at the beginning each of which represents one or more of the four processes to which these two texts are devoted in a brief paper such as this one you must of course take my word for it that I have not been selective for my own purposes I submit that my reading of either of these two texts in their totality the book of the heavenly Gao or the Pyramid of Lunas will find that my for Gerrans are the dominant themes and that they are representative of the body of a gypsy or Egyptian mortuary tax as a whole so we begin with remembering to be red parks and also in the tomb of Seti the first in the narrative of how tours destruction of mankind a story dear to all the test refers for its explicitness raw the self begotten and self created and the creator of mankind by the weeping of his eye that grown old and weary and it had come to his attention that humans were complaining of his age and plotting against him the Council of the Gods approved his response that his eye be brought to him with all its destructive power let sure I go forth it wise to the council and destroy for you those who revile you with slander for there is no I whatsoever that can go before it and resist it when it makes its progress in the form of hot or hot or and another version then went forth a segment slew the rebels so many of them that raw repented and called her back come come in peace hot or for the work is accomplished but the goddess found the destruction of humans too sweet to stop she waited about in their blood until a divine ruse distracted her Mandrake's and beer were added to the human blood she had shed and mashed into a potent brew which made her so drunk that she lost her interest in her rampage a remnant of human beings were left in which rock took no more interest this narrative contains all the elements found around the world for a great memory of destruction visited by sky beings on inhabitants of the earth a high God becomes cognizant of the vicious imperfections of the humans he created through his agency some being from the sky destroyed vast portions of humanity in the end though the God repents and relents enough for some humans to be alive to tell the tale of their distance to their descendants and in so doing deposit some kind of meaning for it when we look for remembering now in the texts of the Pyramid of Una's we find the great catastrophes only tersely alluded to in spells whose primary purpose is to facilitate the Kings rebirth and felicity since these spells are often wrapped repeated in later pyramids and that of unas was the name of different pharaohs inserted i will generalize by referring not to Eunice but simply to the king and one extended passage the spells repeatedly begins king except the eye of horus the vicissitudes of that eye above all on the combat between Horus and Seth are then named in the set of phrases except the Eye of Horus which went away which Seth trampled which he pulled out which he carried off on which he caused devastation which escaped from Seth which he rejoined and the so called resurrection ritual by which the sarcophagus is brought into the final burial chamber the Kings Herald tells him to go to your father to autumn who has given birth to Horus in his identity as the one at which the earth shakes and the sky trembles in such language there is never an overtly narrative intent the phrases of the spell subsumed the past and are always aimed at transformation of the King in the present I of Horus to come high and big towards the king behold King you were more soul and more in control the gods of the Mont Nile remembering thus is for the sake of transforming cosmic disturbance and in so doing bringing the king to ease control exultation my next gerund assimilating refers to the recurrent assertion that the deceased is some Godhead or other the proportion between narrative and spell are reversed in my new Ingham New Kingdom and Old Kingdom texts the New Kingdom book of the heavenly cow consists mostly of the elaborate narrative I have summarized after hot Wars all but total destruction of humankind we next read of the old sons determination to retire what he wants it turns out is to distance himself from earth and humans and to mount up to a new sky one provided for him by not at his command in the form of a cow note trembled because of the new height of the sky so rah decreed that supports of the sky come into being only after a complex of narrative a complex narrative of the instating of a new world order does the instruction briefly turn to the deceased and provide him with spells to assimilate him to a godhood I am this pure magic which is in the mouth and in the body of raw I am raw the luminous one I am raw amid his court his nine made of magic I passed by uninjured I belong to the flame which the soul of fire thus you see narrative morphs into spells by which assimilation to raw is consummated in the old kingdom the spells of the Pyramid Texts are likewise aimed at assimilating the deceased into multiple gods they contain no extended narrative but abound in such assimilations the spells have one difference from our New Kingdom texts and the Pyramid Texts the King assimilates himself not just into the gods of creation and regularity but also the ferocious gods who have shown themselves capable of wreaking havoc in the cosmos sometimes he takes on Horus his face and destructive power the king will come with his faith that of the great God who is Lord of rage who grew among the end who grew strong from the injury to him Horus will grant you the fire of his I that it's circle or around that it put tempest among the evildoers put its well under the primordial God's he will strike shoes armed from under the sky this is one hieroglyphic texts where at the very end of the second line you can see for transformations into Horus and the last hieroglyph is the falcon all right sometimes Horus is mentioned only in the background and the Kings threatening presence in the sky is claimed as something unseen before shaking in the sky we saw something new say that primordial gods Court are the nine gods Horus is in the light the King will take hold of the sky will open its orbit the king is Bane sometimes the King spreads terror all on his own the king is baying to the heart is the son of shoes heart extended to the limit with scorching lights the king is the fire and the top of the wind to the sky's limits to the Earth's limit when the arms of the lightning bolts had become discharged why am need I stress here that the terror is a new electrical phenomenon I now enter the second half of my proposed structuring easing and forever ring the two gerunds which move away from the terror in tomb from terror in two modes of forgetting it listen to the sweet details of ease inserted at the final stretch of narrative in the book of the heavenly cow in a spell efficacious for whoever shall recite the words of this composition behind his ears shall be pure and natrone and sweet-smelling salve shall be on his lips he shall be arrayed in a new double tunic and his body shall be purified with the water of the Nile easing in the book of the heavenly cow has as its conclusion spells to enable the deceased to move around after death some of its promises are negative sentences of protection such as I pass by uninjured I belong to the flame which is the soul of fire I have no adversaries among men God spirits among the dead or at anything in the whole of this land others make more positive promises as for anyone who knows the divine words and the spells in his mouth he can ascend and descend within the sky the entire composition comes to an end with such promises short but decisive in stressing the ease the deceased may enjoy through its spells to turn to the Pyramid Texts there are this easing of the king is not always purged entirely of catastrophic consciousness as so often in any court the Kings power may be part of his beauty as in this spell how fair the sight how pleasant the beholding to God say of this God's going forth to the sky atop him his souls that he sides his terror at his feet his magic more often though the serenity of the king is wedded to his assent to the company of the heavenly deities in orderly movement you shall become clean in the cool waters of the stars shall board the bark of Raw on the shoulders of Horace Oh ferryman who faces forward fetch for the king the latter whose name is salve of contentment on the back of Osiris that the king go forth to the sky upon it that he escort raw in the sky we come at last to the gerund I made I made use of forever hang in the book of the celestial cow the most striking affirmation the king will take his place forever in the order of the new cosmos occurs in an illustration on the wall there the king shown three times with his skirt and his urias joins the company of a male God eternity and a female God everlastingness and in both cases the activity is holding up the sky with a support to show you the next slide your more particularly are the Eternity with the name thereof below it's him and everlastingness with the name below here so they are joining the king in holding up the sky all three like shoes support the new sky which raah has mandated and which is now made up of the sky goddess nut as a cow in which - who's in - whose body rah has retired from earth and the underworld the accompanying spells can veil the same message the one who recites this spell shall live in the necropolis and respect for him shall be greater than for those who are upon earth if they ask what are your names the answer is eternity in everlasting us then they are bound to say this is truly a nod the language could not be clearer that there is a new world order and that it is to last for what we see at the end of the book of the heavenly cow occurs farm off and throughout the Pyramid Texts there the celestial melding of serenity and orderly motion leads naturally to an assertion that the new order brought about by the Kings arrival in the sky will be stable and at ease forever on heaven and earth alike he will remain undisturbed by any memory of terrifying phenomenon the King's house in the sky shall never perish the Kings seat on the earth will never end most tenderly the king becomes the son of autumn rah in a perpetual embrace autumn rah your son has come to you the King has come to you it resolved him to you encircling with your arms this is the son of your body forever we have the same archetype here as Christ returning to sit forever at the right hand of the Father so I have proposed a schematic separation of smells into four processes or four gerron's but we have already seemed some overlapping and my survey would not be complete without giving you one example in which all four gerron's are conflated from the Pyramid Texts the King has come from the isle of flame the king has put order in the place of chaos the king is he who owns the linens guarded by the Cobra of fire during the night of the great flood that comes from the Great Goddess the King will appear as the fair god as the water lily at the nose of raw when he comes forth from the place of radiance every day there is an implicit remembering of a deluge brought by a major deity during the night of the flood comes from the Great Goddess note also that the King is implicitly assimilated into raw or Horace in his possession of the Urrea spit fired his enemies but most of the imagery invokes pleasurable ease the King appears is the beautiful water lily which Ross smells on his coming forth and the final phrase constitutes the purest of affirmations of what I have called forever Aang when it comes forth from the place of radiance every day here we have its concise and affirmation as of the assuring ly recurrent as any that Egyptian culture was accustomed to make every day rah Ned as I said at the beginning is more literally every Sun and the same disc with a circle at the center of it is used in

[Music] Science portrays that our corner of the Universe is nothing special. At the heart of the assumption lies the Copernican principle which states that humans on Earth are not privileged observers of the  Universe. Not only is our solar system highly unusual, but our Sun is not a run-of-the-mill star. It is a yellow dwarf star which, you may think, together with white dwarf stars, should be common elsewhere, but unfortunately this is not the case at all. And instead, red dwarf stars are by far the most common star in the Milky Way and they present some rather large problems referred to as the Red Sky paradox. Most stars in the Universe are red dwarf stars; they outnumber stars like our Sun by a factor of five. According to mainstream astronomy, these stars also last about 20 times longer in comparison to our star. This means that none have reached  the end of their Main Sequence lifespan during the assumed age of the Universe. Here, I must caveat both of those, as there is a different way of looking at this problem, which we will explore in a little while. So, let's return to the Red Sky paradox. If red dwarf stars are the most common star, and are also so stable, we should  also not consider ourselves to be special. The very fact that we are not orbiting a red dwarf star, but instead the not-so- common yellow dwarf, and yet we have not found any other forms  of intelligent life elsewhere in the Universe. This presents rather an interesting problem that is dubbed the Red Sky paradox. A new paper attempts to examine this in more  detail. As solving this paradox may provide guidance for targeting future remote life-sensing experiments. Red dwarf stars are an attractive prospect for the search for extraterrestrial  life. They emit less energy in comparison to our Sun, which would mean any planets orbiting them would need to be closer to the star in order to reach the habitable  temperatures. In the paper, the author outlines four possible solutions to the Red Sky  paradox. Resolution I - An Unusual Outcome. The first possibility postulates that nothing is different about the emergence of intelligence between yellow dwarf stars and red dwarf stars. We are simply an unusual member by finding ourselves around a yellow dwarf star. If the rate at which life emerges around both types of stars is similar, then Earth is an outlier with a hundred-to- one chance of forming. This does however, create tension with the Copernican principle. Resolution II - Inhibited Life under red sky. Here, the idea is that red dwarf stars create environments that are not supportive of life compared to yellow dwarf  stars. Consequently, life evolved far less often around red dwarf stars. They estimate that this could be as much as a hundred times less likely. We know that red dwarf stars have the highest flare rate of any star type, and because the planets would need to be much closer to the star, due to the low output from these types of stars, it puts any planet in the firing line of these massive super-flares. Resolution III - A Truncated Window for complex  life. The concept here is that life has not had enough time to emerge around red dwarf  stars. The reasoning for this is that terrestrial worlds forming in the main sequence habitable zone of red dwarf stars, will be subject to an initial phase of higher radiance, potentially pushing them into a runaway greenhouse state that persists even after this phase is over. Resolution IV – A Paucity Of Pale Red Dots. Here, the idea is that planets forming around red dwarfs may be more  uncommon, especially in the habitable zone, compared to yellow dwarf stars. Currently, around 16 percent of red dwarfs have exoplanets that are rocky, but maybe this is not the norm. These surveys sample the most massive and brightest red dwarfs, but what if the smaller ones, of which we know very little, don't  have any rocky planets in their habitable zone? Since the low-mass red dwarfs are the most common, this could mean that the habitable zone rocky exoplanets are a hundred times less common around red dwarf stars in comparison to yellow dwarfs. In this case, intelligent life is rare amongst the cosmos and spawns universally between red dwarfs and yellow dwarf  stars. This would mean that the vast majority of known Earth-sized temperate planets around red dwarf stars are somehow inhospitable to life, or that they  rarely host habitable worlds. Now, there are some immediate questions that this research raises. Firstly, why are red dwarf stars so much more common than yellow dwarf stars? The mainstream explanation here is that they are so small, and have such low mass, they evolve very slowly. An estimation puts their main sequence lifetime at a hundred billion years. This, they claim, is why there are many red dwarfs. Bigger stars come and go as slowly the number of red dwarf stars grows and grows. In the Electric Universe, stars are not thermo- nuclear, but instead, are electrically powered. So, if this is the case, why would we see more red dwarf stars than yellow dwarf stars? The assumption is that the type of star is not determined by what stage it is on on the mainstream's idea of the evolution  of a star. Instead, it is determined by the electrical input and the environment the star resides in. Red dwarf stars are just receiving a lower input compared to a yellow dwarf star, which in turn receives less compared to a blue star. As the input changes, it can cause a star to change from a red star all the way up to a blue star. Observations show that stars do seem to  undergo sudden changes after brightening events. So, why would we see more red dwarf stars in the Electric Universe? I see that there are three different ways of explaining this. The First - Stars form in pinches along filaments. Research shows that these stars can be ejected from the central filament. I have done a separate video on the slingshot mechanism which you can find on my channel: See the Pattern. This means that as stars are initially born at the heart of the filament, they start near the highest current density and will burn bright blue. Depending on the kick they gained from the filament, they will slowly start to move further away from the central axis, where the current density steadily decreases, meaning they will become redder in color. The Second option - Although most stars are created close to the center of the filament, the filament itself is not stationary and could move slowly over time. This means that most stars will not end up being close to the center, and over time, as it migrates, more stars would have reduced current density due to their location. And lastly - High-powered stars are more likely to experience electrical stressing. In  simple terms, this means that the incoming current is too great for the surface area of the star to be able to deal with. There is a significant excess of charge. In some cases, this can lead to the star splitting in two, a process referred to as fissioning. The two smaller stars would end up with a greater combined surface area to deal with the current. This process could also impart a kick to either one, or both of the stars, once  more leading to it moving further away from the highest current density location of the filament. It is also possible that a combination of these factors is at play, rather than just a single one. The next question is the question of where intelligent life is likely to develop. Here, it is interesting to point out that the article only focuses on the contrast between a yellow dwarf and a red dwarf star. What about the other star types? Larger and brighter stars are probably less hospitable, but what about the cooler stars? If  we examine brown dwarf stars, you will quickly realize that these are just as common, if not more common in our Milky Way. The problem until recently has been detecting them, as they are even fainter than red dwarf stars. But new studies reveal that the Milky Way is filled with brown dwarf stars. Again, here the three possible reasons I outlined for red dwarf stars would equally work for explaining why brown dwarf stars are more common than yellow dwarf stars. But surely, life could not survive around a brown dwarf star. They are cooler and smaller than red dwarf stars, but also seem to show strong flaring events. This is often how they are actually detected. Certainly, if you look the goldilocks zone, which is where they consider life to be habitable around a star, this  is almost on top of the star itself. At first glance, this would appear to be a non- starter. But the assumption here is that life starts on the planet. Brown dwarfs are similar to our gas giants, and now scientists have suggested that life could survive in the upper layers of a brown dwarf atmosphere which have temperatures and pressures similar to Earth's. This could then provide a springboard for life to migrate to planets that could have been ejected from the star. Is it possible that planets and life could exist  within the plasma sheath of a brown dwarf? This is not something that I have investigated yet, but it is one of the Electric Universe theories that the Earth was once part of Saturn, which at the time was a brown dwarf star. Within the envelope could life evolve and would this hide their existence from our  view? Could this be a different way of explaining why we have not discovered life elsewhere? There are many open questions this concept raises that are worth considering further. [Music] 
The Electric Universe understanding portrays the prevailing cosmology as substantially misguided, and challenges almost every facet not established by rigorous experimental and testing results. In other words, the scientific method. Here is a quote regarding this view from Halton Arp, “After all, to get the whole universe totally wrong in the face of clear evidence for over 75 years merits monumental embarrassment and should induce the modicum of humility.” The Electric Universe paradigm development has been primarily focused on the things that we can apprehend with our senses, from the microscopic level, looking down, to the telescopic level, looking up. But mostly on the directly tangible level. On just these three levels, there is an overwhelming abundance of evidence, both in phenomena and structure, that show that the physical universe aspects, galaxies down to cells, all work electrically. Much if not most of this should be obvious, and would be, if an extensively faulty paradigm hadn't taken hold of academia and mainstream cosmology, and thus didn't obscure the thinking. For instance, welders and machinists familiar with electric discharge machining, get the electrical cratering and scarring aspects immediately, usually exclaiming that it's obvious that these are not primarily from impacts. Electrical engineers often find other aspects to be easily assimilated and accepted. But many plasma phenomena on this triune level are not that familiar. For example, Birkeland currents, double layers, plasma cells, red sprites, blue jets, plasma elves and Peratt instability formations. And  these haven't been widely understood. Also, plasma phenomena can be quite complex, besides being outside of our normal experience. Let me just mention a few major aspects out of a dozen or so in the prevailing cosmological paradigm that are misguided or faulty. The most egregious is the Big Bang which was introduced by Georges Lemaitre in 1927, and which was buttressed by the equally egregious Theory of Relativity by Einstein. Quite simply, ‘Relativity’ is unnecessary because the finite universe is the needed frame of reference for everything inside of it. Until recently, thanks to the James Webb Telescope, the Big Bang has been the prevailing view. Another, ‘redshift equals distance’, has been thoroughly discredited by Halton Arp and his associate astronomers. And  another, ’stars powered by nuclear fusion’, the fusion actually takes place on the surface of the photosphere, not in the core, and is driven by the impinging Birkeland currents. The fifth is ‘gravity’ instead of electricity being the foundational force at work in organizing, structuring and controlling the physical universe of galaxies, stars, planets etc. Let me reiterate a few frank reminders about our investigative limits. It should be understood that, below or above the directly tangible level, we have to rely on only one of our senses - sight,  vision. Below the level of the various microscope tools, or beyond the various telescope tools, when thinking about the material universe, the aspects and attributes of phenomena and structure cannot be apprehended directly by  any of our five senses. We can only do experiments and get clues as to what  we are dealing with and then we can only build models for them and/or project metaphors from our tangible experience upon them. I suggest that we don't know what we think  we know. This restricted domain on the lowest level includes the basic atomic particles and we can only get blurry visual interference patterns of nuclei, their shape and where they are located and arranged in material. Until lately, theory has claimed that atomic nuclei must be symmetrical in three dimensions, either spherical or flattened spheroidal. Now, we can confirm that some nuclei are pear-shaped and thus pointed in a direction. This development, the implication of which is not widely understood, actually sweeps away much current cosmological theory. Even the orbital model of the atom has not been confirmed and part of the time it must be discarded in atomic thinking. Take a look at the stellar work of Edwin Kaal, who developed the Structured Atomic Model known as SAM, a significant improvement over the inadequate orbital model. As an ex-chemist, long uncomfortable with the orbital model, I favor a most dense packing model. But Kaal must be given great credit for going in the right direction. On the other end of the spectrum we should be mindful that outside of our limited solar system exploration via rocket probes and satellites, we have only electromagnetic radiation given off by radiating bodies or structures that we can access through our telescopes. No direct chemical analysis to determine material or molecular structure. No physical analysis to determine density, specific gravity, index of refraction, hardness, viscosity conductivity, etc. No application of tape measures, scales, hydrometers. Just and only patterned electromagnetic radiation, visual and radio astronomy with which to work. So, down on a more fundamental level again, concepts that we have often can be little more than speculation. We  have a tendency to project the orbital metaphor down to the atomic level but this has already been challenged. Mainstream thinking has imagined  quarks below the atomic particle level, and the Electric Universe talks about sub-sub- atomic particles as positive or negative subtrons. The point is that beyond sensationalism, there is little justification to present these ‘physics flights of fancy’ to the public as knowledge or fact. Let's also be mindful that all of our relevant observations have taken  place from a platform within familiar, non-redshift-determined distances within the heliopause, and essentially within a platform perpendicular to the axis of the  Sun. When considering bodies outside this arena of our platform in more distant outer space and beyond that, we are projecting from our own environment and then speculating. We  actually don't know enough about the true distances, the true sizes, and the attributes of the region such as charge differentials, ether densities, field strengths, etc., to confidently extend meaningful values on the decrease of force within distance squared. Electrical Universe theoretician Wallace Thornhill even suggests that the attractive force that we call gravity actually turns repulsive at some point. The Electric Universe lays a theoretical foundation for all of this on the lowest particle level by positing just and only two electric charge carriers of negative and positive matter particles, just and only three dimensions, just and only  two forces, electrical attraction and repulsion. Being a stickler for a correct terminology, I point out that the traditional four, electromagnetism, gravity, the strong nuclear and the weak nuclear, should not be called forces, but rather force sources or initiators. Not to mention that the EU considers the latter three to be aspects of electromagnetism and dipolarity. Linear motion, orbital motion and reciprocal motion, oscillation, vibration, resonance also have a fundamental role. Finally we have the aspects and constrictions of the geometry of three dimensions, which is the basis for polarity, Along with sequence of events, what we call time, these generally account for or undergird all other physical phenomena. Also, in the Electric Universe paradigm, the definition of energy is that it is always matter in motion. And, like time, not something mystical, nor a thing in and of itself. So, let's deal with the Michelson-Morley experiment of 1887, that has been widely interpreted as proving there is no ether. The overlooked phenomena in the Michelson- Morley experiment by Paul Marmet. Abstract, ”We show that Michelson and Morley used an oversimplified description and failed to notice that their calculation is not compatible with their own hypothesis that light is traveling at a constant velocity in all frames. During the last century, the Michelson- Morley equations have been used without realizing that two essential fundamental phenomena are missing in the Michelson-Morley demonstration.” ”We show that the velocity of the mirror must be taken into account to calculate the angle of reflection of light. Using the Huygens principle, we see  that the angle of reflection of light on a moving mirror is a function of the velocity of the mirror. This has been ignored in the Michelson-Morley calculation. Also, due to the transverse direction of the moving frame, light  does not enter in the instrument at 90 degrees as assumed in the Michelson- Morley experiment.” “We acknowledge that the basic idea suggested by Michelson-Morley to test the variance of space-time, using a comparison between the times taken by light to travel in the parallel direction with respect to a transverse direction is very attractive. However, we show here that the usual predictions are not valid, because of those two classical secondary phenomena, which have not been taken into account.” ”When these overlooked phenomena are taken into account, we see that a null result, in the Michelson-Morley experiment, is the natural consequence, resulting from the assumption of an absolute frame of reference and Galilean transformations. On the contrary, a shift of the interference fringes would be required in order to support Einstein's relativity. Therefore, for the last century, the relativity theory has been based on a misleading calculation.” Well, I certainly agree with that. There is at least one other explanation for why the Michelson-Morley results are  invalid. If the ether with increased density is somewhat partially entrained by either the solar system or the Earth, Michelson- Morley would be invalid. Of all the violations of philosophical concepts and metaphysical principles, probably the worst and most insidiously pervasive, concern ‘nothing’ and ‘infinity’. ‘Infinity’ cannot be applied to any aspect of the physical universe. Of course, there is no such thing as ’nothingness’. On a fundamental-philosophical level, there can be no voids of nothingness in the material universe. Thus, because of both sound evidence and reasoning, the Electric Universe paradigm has confidently settled on the conclusion that the volume of the physical universe is filled with an ether. In other words, the existence of an ether is  axiomatic. Currently, the thinking is that this ether is composed of polarizable neutrinos, where these are all but empty matter/particles or packages that have vanishingly small amount of mass, energy, dipolarity and friction. If you build a universe of three dimensions that can't have any voids of nothingness, then you have only two regular polyhedrons that can fill or tessellate, volume  with no voids. Those being tetrahedrons and cubes. So, if we think of shape, we should probably think of ether particles as having one of these two forms. Note, holographic universe enthusiasts would say at this point that we have crossed the border into a different realm, and are deep into projecting a topological shape metaphor onto it. But, since other more substantial particles and objects apparently move without significant friction through this ether medium, the particles must be quite flexible and compressible. ’Squidgy’ in my words. Try not to think of fish swimming through  water. Their frictionless surfaces, along with their vanishingly small mass, would generate vanishingly small viscosity. We also need to think of force as something tangible and not as something theoretical. We should also note that when we feel a substance with our fingers, it is not the atomic material that we feel with our tactile facility, but rather the electric repulsive force from the material. So the bottom line in this page of the EU ledger is that, since there is no ’nothingness’ between objects or particles, and when there is no contact between atoms in this instance and every other one, force is transmitted across distance by contact between the ether particles. The EU model sees the ether medium as a key part of a proper construction of physical reality. [Music]

Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info Recent episodes of Space News from the Electric Universe have provided a ground-breaking foundation for a new beginning in Earth geology. Thunderbolts contributor, Andrew Hall, has introduced his hypothesis for the formation of familiar geological features, not from incremental processes over eons of time but rather due to high energy electrical discharges in Earth's unique atmosphere. In this episode, Hall concludes his video series with a closer examination of evidence for dramatic electrical scarring of our planet's surface. In part 1 "A New Beginning" we introduced the evidence of electro-hydrodynamic forces that built mountains in an instant. The evidence is frozen into the shape of land exactly as it occurred. Let's review: An arcing current creates a shock wave, that ablates the land, raising a rooster tail of molten materials to form the core of a mountain. The expanding gas and reflected shock wave create an exploding mushroom cloud in its wake. And the updraft it forms provides sustaining energy to the shock envelope by drawing supersonic ground winds through the standing waveform. The supersonic ground winds are channeled by the shock waves to form triangular buttresses. A mountain displays triangular buttresses in a near perfect mold of the waveform that created it, even displaying complex pressure variations within the waveform. We've seen waveforms that displayed expansion and contraction, characteristics of super-imposed transverse and longitudional waves. We've seen waveforms that display harmonic repetition caused by shock wave reflection. We've seen how the elasticity of the substrate and the shock wave interacting in critical ways, producing effects that we can analyze, measure and quantify from the known behavior of shock waves. Now let's look at some electromagnetic effects. The stratified layers of triangular buttresses are often segregated by mineral composition, this is evidence of electromagnetism. An electric field will ionize particles; the magnetic field will sort them. The results can be dramatic. Stratification is evident at all scales from large scale landforms to the morphology of the rock itself, right down to the microscopic scale. The shock waves are energized with current. The shock wave is a highly stressed region, a dramatic shear zone of pressure, temperature and current density. Current coarsing through thin shock waves molds the electromagnetic fields in the coherent form of the reflected shock and sorts the material according to its dielectric properties. Arc flash necessarily has a magnetic field surrounding it. Magnetically generated horizontal rotation seems to modify the winds, adding momentum to one side and taking it away on the other, creating asymmetry. Polarization is seen here in this colorized Schlieren photo of a supersonic shock wave. It can produce a mild rotation effect as seen on this mountain, that displays triangular buttresses on both sides, indicating inflowing wind that meet in the upground. Or it can form shear winds in opposite directions leaving buttresses on one side of a narrow ridge or it can even scoop a valley within a mountain. One feature that appears often is where an arc contacts ground. The result is a blowout, a crater blasted into the mountain. These features are typically asymmetrical craters with the spill-out on one or both sides of the mountain. This mountain has been split in two. It appears in these instances the arc is finding a conductive path beneath the ground, perhaps a mineral deposit or aquifer and sends a forking tendril to connect with it. More evidence of the electrical arcing that creates the mountains is displayed in an unusual way on Mt.Kavushku in Iran. Here is the result of two arcs interfering with each other. The footprint of Mt. Kavushku is seen in this overhead view as the large symmetric oval to the lower right. The second astrobleme is the smaller kidney-shaped hill connecting with it at the center. Both are ringed by blast zones. Here is a closer view. Triangular buttresses can be seen on both sides of the mountain surrounded by the concentric pressure ridges of the blast zone. This view's been rotated, so the small ridge along the bottom of the frame is the second astrobleme. What's unusual is that the second astrobleme has cut the end off of Mt. Kavushku. The second shockwave sliced the tip of the mountain away. Do you see how the sections have fallen forward like slices of bread? And the second arc deposited entirely different material between Mt. Kavushku and its head. The head still displays triangular buttresses from inflowing supersonic winds. The tip of the mountain has been displaced forwards and sideways. But if you piece it back together, it fits nicely. The shock events happened almost simultaneously, which is evident in the pressure wave patterns caused by shear winds between the two blast zones. The stratified layers show the opposing directions of winds meeting at a shear zone, which attests to the fact that it was created in a single arc blast event. The land didn't split apart to separate the mountain. Two forks of an arc reclosed and one shock wave sliced the other apart. Large mountains are also built the same way. Now that you recognize triangular buttresses as shock wave forms, let's look at what the rooster tail can do. You will recall the rooster tail is like what you see behind a speed boat, something like this. This is the Mt. Fitzroy group in Patagonia, the southern end of the Andes on the Argentinian-Chilean border. The clean granite faces are a famous challenge to big-wall mountain climbers. You can see why. You can also see how the rock is layered almost vertically at one orientation in the core and another orientation on the flanks. Its height is a little over 11,000 feet. The core of the mountain has been sucked up into a series of narrow shards by the rooster tail of an extremely powerful shockwave created by an atmospheric arcing current. Its flanking ridges are layered onto the core, welded in parallel, stratified layers, perpendicular to the wind that made them, oriented radially towards the core. And triangular buttresses show their consistent angles of reflection on the western flanks. Here the Sun catches the large triangular features well in this view. Of course, other big mountains were made this way too. I can't think of the name of any right now but we will find some new case studies soon. There is a great deal more to be said about the electric earth. You are watching the results of a new research as it unfolds. Arcs in the atmosphere, blistering mountains with arc blasts, is not all there is to the form of the Earth. However, there had been ten visually evident similarities presented between mountain forms and shock waves. Skeptics like to say extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. For mountains to display the exact features of shock waves, including repeating reflected standing waveforms, superpositioned transverse and longitudional wave expansion and compression, harmonic reflection, wind- and shock-oriented stratification, pressure ridges, normal shocks, waveform compression and cancellation, waveform instability, expansion fans and boundary effects, all of which collectively point to a single coherent shock event of their origin, begs for a coherent explanation. No uniformitarian theory provides that. The arc blast model does. Others with perspectives and skills that complement mine are involved. As we gather and prepare new evidence for presentation, please stay tuned. Thank you! For continuous updates on Space News from the Electric Universe stay tuned to Thunderbolts.info 
[Music] Our solar system is unusual in many ways and one of the strangest features is the asteroid belt. Mainstream science will tell you that these are just the remnants of the formation process of the  solar system. Jupiter is said to have halted the formation of a body in its zone. Others  have speculated that this was the remains of a destroyed planet. Velikovsky felt Venus was a newly-formed body that had been ejected from Jupiter. Venus at this stage was like a comet with a large tail. When Mars clashed with Venus, asteroids, meteorites, and gases were torn from the trailing part of Venus and began a semi-independent existence, some following the orbit of Mars and some other parts. The Electric Universe would build on this concept but would place the origin of Venus in Saturn, not in Jupiter. It therefore stands to reason that these asteroids hold the clues to understanding what might have happened to our solar system in the past. Vesta is one of the largest objects in the asteroid belt, second only behind Ceres. It has a diameter of 326 miles. Its mass constitutes a staggering nine percent of the mass of the Asteroid Belt. It is also the brightest asteroid that is visible from Earth. It was first discovered back in 1802 by Heinrich Olbers. He proposed that these two objects (Ceres and Vesta) were the remnants of a destroyed planet. Vesta's density is lower than those of the four terrestrial planets, but higher than most of the asteroids and all of the moons in the solar system, except Io. In 2011, Nasa's Dawn mission arrived to study the asteroid. In 2012, an analysis of its shape and gravitational field concluded that it was not in hydrostatic equilibrium. They speculated that it has a more dense core at the center. Vesta has been identified as the source of a very common class of meteorite which makes up about six percent of the meteorites which fall to Earth. It boasts some remarkable features across its surface. One of the largest is the Rheasilvia basin which almost rivals Olympus Mons in terms of height. And this is located on the southern pole. Astronomers believe that an impact was responsible for excavating about one percent of the volume of Vesta and producing the smaller fragments that rained down on Earth. The crater itself looks like no other crater I have ever seen, but we will return to this point in a little while. All over the surface there is evidence of scarring; many of these so-called craters have sharp edges with no spray marks and are more likely indicative  of electrical etching, where material is removed from the surface during repeated  discharges. If you look at the entire surface, you will start to notice what looks like troughs running across the entire length of the asteroid. These have presented astronomers with quite a mystery. Some have speculated that they might be the remnants of a cataclysmic impact. When you examine the location of these troughs, they do seem to ring around two massive craters. Now astronomers usually try and date features by a process called crater counting. Here the assumption is that the craters will occur randomly. Older surfaces would therefore have been hit more often than younger ones and will therefore display more scars. But when they examined the craters on Vesta, they found that there wasn't enough information to solidly determine how the basin and troughs were related to each other. This means that they cannot conclusively link the age of either crater to the age of the troughs. When  we examine the images of both poles of Vesta, something rather remarkable stands out immediately. They simply do not look like craters at all. In the south pole we see the elevated part off-center in the basin. All around the basin the land is higher with what appears as a much sharper ridge to the right. All along the left and leading both the top and bottom, we see marks that, if this was a much larger body, would be interpreted as erosion due to water flow. Yet, there is no flowing water on Vesta, nor has there ever been any. Further out, to the upper right-hand side are the trench lines that encircle about three quarters of the area. These features and their connection are really not as obvious when you examine individual images on the surface. Now many of you will recognize these types of features from Mars, where  electrical scarring reshaped the landscape. Here we seem to have uncovered a relic like no others. Here are examples of dome craters. The southern, and to a lesser extent, the  northern basin, has very clear rampart edges. Slightly off-center, in the southern basin, we also find the peak which is not visible in the northern hemisphere. More remarkable is the river-like shapes that seem to fan away and towards the central basin. They are very reminiscent of those found on Mars and also Earth, although in the latter case most now contain water in the form of rivers, hiding their origin from view. The other pole on Vesta also contains some very strange land features, none more striking than what appears as large areas which are very smooth. They are located around, and inside many of the large craters. We also see examples of dome craters, which is a clear sign of electrical discharge. So how can we account for all of these phenomena at once? Electrical discharge experiments readily produce craters with central peaks. Wal Thornhill envisions that twin Birkeland filaments, rotating around each other, would create the dished peaks. The large basin also has sides that appear on three of the sides to be hexagonal with a large distortion appearing on the left-hand side of the basin. Hexagonal edges are observed in some plasma experiments, but also in examples like the north pole of Saturn. All the scarring we see probably stems from the event that caused its creation. If there was a large discharge between two large bodies in the solar system, this is likely to have excavated material from the surface of one of them. This is the origin of the asteroid belt. These boulders and dust would have been torn away from the parent body. In the  near-vacuum of space, the large discharge would have structured according to Don Scott's model, with a series of concentric shells, with smallerfilaments within each of these,  as we saw in Peratt's experiments. Now I'll be honest, explaining all of these features at once is extremely difficult. But here are four possible ways that we could explain all of the features as we see on Vesta. The first one, a body the size of Vesta would act as a focus for a Birkeland current, due to the presence of a high density of charged particles. In this case a discharge would tend to pinch in at Vesta. At a certain threshold the discharge beam would start to break up into smaller vortex-like current bundles and these will tend to pinch at the surface of the asteroid, causing the material to be etched away. The  ridges along the equator might be caused by discharges that occur from the equator, out to the first shell of the Birkeland current. An alternative explanation is that a discharge occurred directly onto Vesta. If we assume the asteroid had a spinbefore the discharge and that the removal of material from one pole would alter the stability of the spin axis and might cause an effect similar to the tennis racket theorem, where the instability of one of the three axes of rotation can cause the object to flip over, and then back in rapid succession. Could this account for both poles being etched? Examining the surface features, we see spiral marks in the northern pole region. Are these caused by etching as Vesta turned over from one side to the other? Did the filaments then break down even further, leading to much sharper and smaller etching lines on the southern hemisphere? Was enough material then etched out of the southern pole to stabilize the rotation, stopping a further  flip? The third possibility is something called cathode spots. Now an electrical comet acts as a cathode and the Sun acts as an anode, and the assumption is that comets are essentially more negative in relation to the object like the Sun. Could Vesta have become more negative and less positive with respect to a nearby highly charged body such as Venus? If this is true then it discharged to the surface similar to the first one that we discussed, and then a phenomenon, called cathode spots, could explain some of the etching marks that we see along the equator of Vesta. As the material was excavated during the discharge, fine dust would be ejected around Vesta, which would be partially ionized. This plasma forms a ring around the equator. This is inherently unstable and causes the formation of cathode spots, or short-duration arcs to the surface. These melt the surface material. They ionize it and produce dense plasma with copious electrons which can in turn enhance the cathode emissions further. These energized electrons form a highly conducting plasma channel to the first cylinder of the larger discharge channel. These arc discharges often create the form of grooves pitted out of the surface of the cathode. The last possibility is slightly more radical. Now some of you will be familiar with a series that I created showing Anthony Peratt's concept of how galaxies form in a plasma universe. What he discovered was that plasma sheets tend to break down into filaments, which in turn tend to pair up and wrap around each other. There was a delicate balance between the repulsion of like charges at short range and the long-range attraction due to the magnetic field each filament created. This means that as the two filaments approached, an area is created between the two filaments where local material, which is not part of the filament, gets compressed. In Peratt's model, this central area would eventually form the galaxy. What if an ongoing discharge between two larger bodies was ejecting material and dust into the surrounding space? The discharge channel was becoming unstable and breaking down into smaller filaments, which in turn started to spiral around each other. Could this actually compress the material between the filaments back into a sphere? Peratt described the compression area  as being similar to those conditions that Eric Lerner had tested in his laboratory using a dense plasma focus device. Could this environment lead to secondary discharges that etched out the marks that we see? Now Peratt was very clear that he felt there were no jets that would exist from the core to the two filaments. Instead,  he saw these as plasma bridges that, depending on the viewing angle, would look  like jets. But it was also clear that he did not model the core in his simulations. So what we see as just large asteroids, actually contain many secrets that help us to try and reconstruct the circumstances under which they formed. The more we examine these lumps of rock, the more that they reveal about the cataclysmic electrical events that have shaped our past. [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info Observers of the spectacular northern lights are offering new testimony on the amazing sounds produced from electromagnetic phenomena in Earth's upper atmosphere. Witnesses in Sweden reported hearing sounds similar to so-called 'laser blasts' from the Star Wars films. A photographer and tour guide named Oliver Wright was able to capture audio of the sound which seemed to grow louder as witnesses approached nearby power lines. A link to the audio may be found in the description box of this video. This is hardly the first instance that witnesses have reported peculiar sounds associated with intense auroral displays. In fact dating back centuries, long before the existence of earthly transmission lines, witnesses from the Arctic reported hearing hissing, crackling or clapping sounds. Recently, the scientific mainstream has begun to recognize that the audible phenomenon is actually real. In 2012 a team of scientists in Finland discovered a pattern of audible clapping sounds that appeared at times of high auroral activity. The lead investigator of the study suggests that the phenomenon is: "likely caused by the same energetic particles from the Sun that create the Northern Lights far away in the sky. These particles, or the geomagnetic disturbance produced by them, seem to create sound much closer to the ground." A space dot com report on the study states: "Scientists still aren't sure exactly how the auroral sounds are created. They can be quite variable, ranging from claps and crackles to muffled bangs and sputtering sounds. Because of this sonic diversity, several different mechanisms might be at work..." The sounds produced by auroral activities seem similar to the sounds reported over many centuries, associated with spectacular meteors. Consider the case of the meteor explosion over Peekskill, New York in 1992. Witnesses reported electro static crackling sounds for several seconds, both before and after the meteor's fragmentation. Witnesses reported electro static crackling sounds for several seconds, both before and after the meteor's fragmentation. In the Thunderbolts Picture Of the Day article "The Peekskill Meteor", author Michael Armstrong asks the question: "Since the fragmentation took place at an altitude of about 41.7 km in a vacuum where there is not enough atmosphere to carry sound, how did this electrophonic noise propagate for over 25 miles?" In 1992, the scientific paper "Electrophonic sounds from large meteor fireballs" attempts to explain the phenomenon. The abstract of the paper reads: "Anomalous sounds from large meteor fireballs, anomalous because they are audible simultaneously with the sighting, have been a matter for debate for over two centuries. Only a minority of observers perceive them. Ten years ago a viable physical explanation was developed, which accounts for the phenomenon in terms of ELF/VLF radiation from the fireball plasma being transduced into acoustic waves whenever appropriate objects happen to be in the vicinity of an observer. This explanation has now been verified observationally and supported by other evidence including the study of meteor fireball light curves reported here." Although mainstream science is now recognizing the unusual sounds associated with terrestrial Auroras and meteoritic phenomena respectively, many mysteries remain that demand new theoretical perspectives. In the early 20th century, the Norwegian experimentalist and electrical pioneer Kristian Birkeland proposed that charged particles from the Sun were the cause of auroras on Earth. For decades the scientific mainstream, including the renowned mathematician Sydney Chapman, largely rejected Birkeland's hypothesis favoring instead the idea that Earth's magnetosphere is an impenetrable envelope squeezed by the solar wind to induce auroral activity. Only when satellites detected the magnetic signatures of electric currents in the Aurora in 1973 was Birkeland hypothesis irrefutably validated. But even today the scientific mainstream resist the implications of the discovery. Institutional science tells us that charged particles from the Sun accelerate along magnetic field lines and collide with oxygen and nitrogen gas particles in our upper atmosphere. The gas particles become excited and release light. But in recent years science discoveries confirmed that the auroras are the product of the electrical circuitry between the Sun, Earth and all planets. In 2007, NASA scientists reported the discovery of "giant magnetic ropes" that connect Earth's upper atmosphere to the Sun, and explosions in the outskirts of Earth's magnetic field. The rope-like structures, NASA describes, are Birkeland currents which are electrical current flowing through the conductive medium of plasma. Recently, professor Donald Scott has published his mathematical modeling of Birkeland currents and identified the tell-tale structures of the currents in the upper atmospheres at the poles of some planets, including the Earth. Visual proof of the Birkeland currents' influence is counter-rotating bands such as those seen on the screen at the North Pole of Saturn. Similar counter-rotation may be seen in this particular video of the Aurora Borealis on Earth. Electromagnetic energy in Earth's upper atmosphere is also the cause of some of the sounds associated with meteor explosions. Standard theory tells us that friction ablation causes meteors to glow, flare and fragment as they pass through the Earth's atmosphere. But, as noted in the aforementioned Thunderbolts article, The Peekskill Meteor; "At about 50 km above the Earth's surface, is there enough material in space to begin a friction ablation process for an object traveling 14.7 km/s? If not, one is justified to conclude that electrical interaction took place to initiate the glow and flareups." In the Electric Universe view, any object that comes far away from the Earth is differently charged than the Earth's plasma sheath and the object will begin to electrically discharge as the difference between it and lower layers of the sheath increases. Again quoting the Peekskill meteor article: "...meteors and spacecraft trigger the formation of instabilities in plasma layers. The energy of the flickering and flaring, as well as of the low-frequency radiation, comes more from the ionospheric plasma than from the meteoroid. The meteors that we've come to think of as 'burning up in the atmosphere' may instead be the targets of mini- thunderbolts from the ionosphere." We also note the European Space Agency surprising discovery in 2014 of a so-called "mysterious song" emitted by the Comet 67P. The song was detected in the form of oscillations in the cometary magnetic field at a level of 40 to 50 millihertz. To make it audible to human hearing, scientists increased the frequencies by a factor of about 10,000. As one scientist said of the discovery: "This is exciting because it is completely new to us. We did not expect this and we are still working to understand the physics of what is happening." A space.com report attempts to explain the finding as follows: "The physical process is somewhat difficult to understand without a deeper understanding of plasma physics, but we can use a simple analogy to have a better idea of what's going on. Consider your garden hose. If you start the water flow, there's a chance that the hose starts to oscillate, generating waves. This is about what happens in the plasma. Of course, the flow we have in the cometary situation is not like water, but it's a flow of charged particles..." But somehow the analogy is suitable. The discovery of electromagnetically produced sounds from comets, meteors, and the Earthly auroras remain a surprise to conventional science, but they offer further proof of the electrical connectedness between the Sun, the Earth, and all bodies in our Electric Universe.

Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info The Greek writer Nikos Kazantzakis once said, "since we cannot change reality let us change the eyes which see reality." Today countless thousands of inquirers are looking at the world and the universe beyond with changed eyes. When one gazes at our celestial neighborhood the planets, moons, comets and asteroids we see defy the speculative history we learned in school. These bodies testify to events not included in any geology textbook. The evidence seems undeniable. High-energy electromagnetic events have indelibly scarred and in some cases devastated the rocky bodies in our solar system. Today this seemingly outrageous theory is being put to the test experimentally. One of the most remarkable of these experimentalists is Billy Yelverton who has successfully replicated countless planetary features through experiments with electrical discharges and electric fields. Here we provide a brief overview and introduction of Billy's research. We begin with a discussion of an especially fascinating experiment to produce features resembling cellular structures, which are also seen on some planetary surfaces. It started with the two copper conductors or two metal conductors, the bottom plate was generally an iron plate we use in our tests and the upper plate happened to be a copper sheet. First time that we noticed them and it is during the time when we do the lifting effect which raises these columns of sand or clay and if you look under the plate after the discharge is over we found is that there tends to be some sort of condensation of moisture that must be from the atmosphere or, you know, the humidity in the air. However, it tends to, you know, condense in the sand and the clay there. It causes it to harden up and it also causes it to cake up on the bottom of the electrodes in these same patterns that we see, you know, cellular shape, fairy circle. So it was pretty incredible to see that. To be honest my jaw fell open, really, I really didn't know what to think. I called Ben up he and I looked at the pictures and what not and discussed it and put it in the morning news, the next morning. Really, I mean, the first thing that came to mind was cellular, you know, some sort of, I mean, this is a, I know we can't say it's biological because it's not at all biological, but nonetheless it had a biological appearance to it. Central Africa has quite a bit of those fairy circle features and the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland is where these columns, hexagonal columns, appear to be solidified in the rock. If you imagine look at them from above. These hexagonal shapes all bunched together. That's what they look like, you know, a cellular type feature and we find them in soft sediment and in a, you know, as we just explained hard sediment too. Devil's Tower in Wyoming is another example. Dating back decades various experimentalists have replicated through electrical discharges different types of craters from those indistinguishable from impact craters to anomalous craters that continue to puzzle planetary scientists. In some instances an electrical discharge may be the only process capable of producing all of the features of certain craters. The first types of craters were done with the dark mode discharge with a single overhead anode, or cathode actually it doesn't really matter and those were done again with dark mode and then we've also created several crater chains and singular craters through layered material with the lightning bolt with the arc mode. We get all a lot of the same features, the rays that tend to scatter out quite a distance from the center of the crater. We created that quite a few times too and the raised rim. We literally can't tell the difference between that and an impact. In the Thunderbolts Project's documentary film "The Lightning Scarred Planet Mars" it is proposed that the towering so-called shield volcano Olympus Mons is in effect a lightning blister from an enormous electrical discharge. Has Billy achieved similar features in his experiments? We did a couple of tries there with arc mode discharge on some clay that I mixed up with water beforehand and almost like a mud peanut-butter texture to it and those two produce, you know, of course it's a gaseous effect, you know, we're heating the liquid of, turning it in back in the gas again and it kind of creates like a blister and then these do resemble Olympus Mons. They take on a concentric type ridge pattern as they like step up higher and higher, as the center rises up but again that could be, you know, as a process of heat and, you know, steam and pressure creates what's similar to a volcano actually. I mean in my opinion if you look at this whole thing overall volcanoes are electric discharge. This is the induction mechanism here, this is what is causing the rock returned to lava, the volcanoes all tend to be this lifted mechanism similar to the, you know, a blister or something like that, you know, a raised feature. It can be done with or without, you know, the arc mode. We've shown that too but the long mountain ranges I found that so far the best reproduction that I've done on the table is with the vibration which in, you know, if we, you know, if we look at this type of cataclysmic event that may have actually happened we'd have to associate some rather large earthquakes with some of these events anyway and what I found is that that most earthquakes take place today between, well, less than 1 Hertz up to about 20 Hertz in frequency and I played around with that a little bit on the table with a vibrator, you know, just an offset counterweight and I determined the frequency by calculating the RPM and at about 25 to 30 Hertz we begin to do the exact same process as we see all over. We get a little raised dendritic features, raised mountain ranges with the featherback, you know, formations and so that's another road I want to travel down here shortly is to integrate this earthquake feature into our electric discharge because, well, we know that the electricity carries these type frequencies with them. A lot of work that Ben Davidson has done is, you know, all but prove that electric discharge is what creates earthquakes. So, we'd have to assume sooner or later that they are integrated together. Given the proven ability of electrical discharges and electric fields to produce familiar geological features then much traditional geology must be reassessed. One intriguing example is the production of sand dunes by ionic wind. This opens the door to a new interpretation of mysterious sand dunes found on Mars, on the Saturnian moon Titan and most stunningly even on the comet 67/P. Those are quite common actually and if you watch this happen on a sheet of acrylic or any type of a dielectric sheet, yeah, I mean it's right they'd unfold right before your eyes literally and you can see that's an ionic wind that's created by the discharge, that's doing this on the table, and to see it perform almost the same way we do in nature makes you want a second, you know, opinion on what actually causes the wind to blow because the features are identical, you know, what we consider to be weather driven wind forces by heat and pressure if we can recreate the same duning effects with nothing but electric discharge. It is incredible and to find these type features on the 67/P recently that really speaks volumes, when you know there's no atmosphere there.

in part two of this extended interview we continue our discussion with thunderbolts Picture of the Day managing editor Stephen Smith on the electrical scarring of planets and moons we now turn our attention to Mars as we explore the evidence that electrical discharges dramatically carved the Martian surface we begin by asking the question did excavated material from the surface of Mars arrive on earth as Martian meteorites Martian meteorites as their name implies are supposedly pieces of the planet Mars that have reached our planet they're usually identified by their mineral and isotope content because various Mars Landers have analyzed the soils there and those analyses are used from comparison so comparing the analysis from say the Spirit and Opportunity Rovers with the analysis of meteorites found sometimes in Antarctica they've concluded that they are actually pieces of Mars so to discuss Martian meteorites we have to talk first about how they might have migrated from Mars to earth in the last interview I mentioned Valles Marineris it's a Canyon on Mars that's four times deeper than the Grand Canyon and it runs for almost five thousand kilometres when the Mariner space probes sent back pictures of it the first thoughts were that it was formed by some sort of catastrophic flooding but a major difficulty with that theory is that there's no Delta or headwater region in the canyon and there's no debris field that might be left over from water erosion also there's no indication of surface accumulation of water anywhere nearby in lakes or ponds that might have formed because of the catalytic utt out the canyon also the so-called tributaries in Valles Marineris terminate in clean cuts and there's no sign of water flowing down into the into them and they don't look any you in any way like a typical drainage formation the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter also saw evidence of olivine inside an area called Ganges casma which is one of the deepest parts of Valles Marineris and because olivine reacts with water its presence seems to definitely exclude water erosion as the cause of the canyon so we have to ask ourselves what force is it that can excavate over 2 million cubic kilometers of rock and regolith from the Martian crust and modern geologists speculate that Valles Marineris was formed by what they call mass wasting meaning landslides or slow movement of material down a steep slope usually in the presence of water and since Mars is thought by many planetary scientists to once have been warm and wet millions of years ago though that influence still pervades their thinking as I said in the last segment investigators were stunned by the images of Mars from space probes that showed it to be more like the moon with its craters rills and its sharp Peaks their theories suggested that Mars should be inactive with a surface that was relatively stable for millions of years nothing like the scale of Valles Marineris was even imagined so bad then back to the question of what did carve up Mars like a pumpkin in the 70s Ralf jürgens a civil engineer and a participant with Dave and Steve Talbot in the magazine ponse thought that electric arcs between planetary bodies created the features we see on Mars as well as the moon and by extension most likely earth so here's a quote from Jergens he said this entire region resembles nothing so much as an area zapped by a powerful electric arc advancing unsteadily across the surface occasionally splitting into and now and then weakening so that it's traces narrow and even degrade into lines of disconnected craters and indeed in many areas of Valles Marineris there are long lines of crater chains the electric universe physicist wal thornhill also wrote Valles Marineris was created within minutes by a giant electric arc sweeping across the surface of mars rock and soil were lifted into space and some fell back to create the great strewn fields of boulders first seen by the Viking and Pathfinder Landers and walls analysis suggests that the discharges resembled the shape of a barred spiral galaxy in Valles Marineris and the listeners can read about walls theory in more detail on his Hollow science comm website and in particular they should read his article called spiral galaxies and Grand Canyon's so like an arc welder shoots Sparks and flux into the air when it fuses metals material from the electric arcs that hit Mars shot gigatons a regolith out into space and this exceeded the planets escape velocity this means that whatever electric force excised Valles Marineris probably threw huge chunks into space some of them undoubtedly fell back to the surface as wal mentioned but some of them love the larger pieces most likely entered orbit and one of my latest picture of the day articles discusses the moon Phobos and it's obvious electrical scarring one of the major objections to the idea of explosions of that magnitude is that they would have melted or disintegrated large pieces of rock however electrical acceleration doesn't do that just like electro magnetic linear induction motors can cause rapid acceleration the upward pull of electric arcs does the same thing and many people might be familiar with the linear induction motors in the amusement park ride called Superman that accelerates the cars to 100 miles an hour in 3 seconds and without heat and the characteristic of electricity that I mentioned that it can cause rapid acceleration helps to explain the features on Phobos as I mentioned I recently wrote that Stickney crater on Phobos is ten kilometers wide which is nearly the same size as Phobos itself I've also written many previous articles that talk about rocky bodies with craters almost as large as they are and I mentioned Saturn's moon test time as an example as I pointed out the so-called impact craters should have blasted the objects apart but there's really no indication visible other than the large craters in the case of Phobos Phobos is like 28 by 20 kilometers in size so Stickney crater is nearly half as large as the moon itself some astronomers say or they claim that the fracture lines around Stickney crater show that there was a great shock to the moon and that it was distorted by whatever forms Stickney crater but when you look closer you can see that the striations that they're mentioning are really chains of small craters and there aren't any fracture lines as they call them there aren't any cracks from a huge shock wave passing through the moon surrounding Stickney crater it's smooth and rounded and there's no large blast debris and it should be mentioned though that Phobos itself is covered with about a meter thick carpet of ultrafine dust and I know I mentioned last time comet Hartley being electrically machined and the surface of the comet being surrounded by a cloud of ultrafine dust there's probably something similar to do with Phobos during whatever electrical event created it since Phobos is about the same size as some asteroids know like Mathilde or eros or Ida and it has gigantic craters just like they do we have to ask ourselves what common event creates similar structures without blowing them apart and the only answer that I can come up with is electricity planetary scientists theorized that volcanoes and flowing lava are responsible for having shaped many of Mars most dramatic features but does this explanation match what is actually seen on the Martian surface another thing about Mars is that there are long canyons and rills that seem to start and stop suddenly even though Valles Marineris has been attributed to mass wasting or flooding by conventional geologists the other abrupt incisions on the surface are even more puzzling to them and the only explanation that they've been able to come up with is that their lava tubes from volcanic eruptions and lava tubes form when volcanoes send rivers of molten magma down their slopes and as the lava hardens it's supposed it supposedly forms a shell around the flowing stream and indeed that is because you can see that there are lava channels around many volcanoes with roofs over them and holes through the roofs show that molten rock is indeed flowing through this shell since the shell creates a roof over the lava it insulates it and it allows it to travel for many kilometres and lava tubes are found in Hawaii and other places around the world like New Zealand or wherever volcanic eruptions have been frequent over the centuries we can see the evidence for collapsed lava tubes in Hawaii and they superficially do resemble the structures on Mars however one important objection that I can point out is there's no sign of any volcanoes associated with most of these big trenches that are supposedly collapsed lava tubes and another objection is the evidence of collapse that we can see on earth when the roof of a lava tube collapses they're often several meters thick of solid rock so the roof has really nowhere else to go except into the bottom of the lava tube so there's big piles of fractured rock and stone covering the floors of these tubes but when you look at the Martian formations the bottoms of these trenches are clean and there's really maybe just a dusting of Sandy ripples in there so you have to ask well where's the roof of this collapsed lava tube since the long trenches and I could name a couple of them like tractus Catina or koh protease Catina have steep clean sides and they have scalloped edges like I mentioned the last time Victoria crater has these scalloped edges so to the sides of some of these trenches they often have dendritic ridges going at their sides too so I'd suggest based on the evidence that I presented last time and some of the things that Dave Talbot has done about dendritic ridges that these trenches marked areas where electric discharges touched down and then traveled along for some distance before they were suddenly quenched so CJ Rams ransom who I mentioned in the last interview has created similar features in his laboratory of these trenches with clean bottoms and steep sides and he's done it by exposing these various materials he's formed two electric arcs and he's either moved the discharge electrode across the sample or he's moved the sample under the arc and that shows me that the lightning bolts that H the deep furrows on Mars were either moving through space above the planet or the planet was rotating under the discharge that was emitted by whatever electrically charged object was above its surface it's true that many Martian trenches are near what are conventionally called volcanoes but I have serious reservations about that description as well one of the most familiar formations on Mars is probably Olympus Mons in the northern region and it's often called the largest volcano in the solar system unquote because it rises more than 27 kilometers that's three times taller than Mount Everest it's also almost 600 kilometers wide across its base in comparison the volcano on Hawaii Mauna Kea when you measure it from the ocean floor to its summit is a little over 10 kilometers high so here you have a volcano so-called on Mars that's two and a half times higher than Mauna Kea but like I said there are serious issues with the description of Olympus Mons as a volcano and particularly in the sense that it's a place in the crust of Mars where supposedly molten magma erupted from beneath the surface building up a conical structure although I should mention in passing that volcanoes on earth might not behave in the same way as everyone assumes so using volcanoes on earth to describe Olympus Mars might be more of a hindrance than a help in the case of Olympus Mons though the structure is definitely anomalous first of all when electric arcs strike a surface they often will stick to one spot and that causes the surface to melt sometimes creating bubbles or blisters and those blisters are known as Fulgham i'ts or lightning blisters and that terminology I first learned from wal thornhill many years ago when he released his cd-rom called the electric universe unfortunately that particular presentation is now out of production but walls various talks in a number of different venues discussed nearly everything that was found there many of his talks are available through the Thunderbolts website by the way but getting back to olympus mons foga mites are sometimes seen on lightning rods after they've been struck their bill shaped blisters with nearly circular craters on top of the blister they have steep sides and they're surrounded by depressions or moats as I briefly touched on in the last interview they also rise up sharply from vertical sidewalls and of course anyone who's looked closely at images of Olympus Mons can see those same distinguishing characteristics these vertical sidewalls surround Olympus Mons then there's a steep upward rise in a bell shape and multiple circular craters on top of the of the volcano I keep referring it to evoke as a volcano but let's call it a Fulghum it-- which it most likely is then again close by Olympus Mons you've got three other gigantic so-called volcanoes that share the same features as Olympus Mons does the other three are found in a straight line just to the southeast of Olympus Mons and to me this means that the volcanoes on Mars are really gigantic lightning blisters and in my last interview I stressed that using earth geological theories to model the rest of the solar system is backwards thinking rather we ought to use what we see in the solar system to model earth geology in the case of the huge vulgar mites on Mars perhaps many or maybe even all volcanic formations on earth can be traced to the activity of electric arcs at some time in the recent past and in that light there's a structure in Namibia called the bran burg Massif that ought to be analyzed in terms of Fulghum aight morphology because the branmer Massif is a circular dome shaped structure it rises more than 2500 meters and it's an area bigger than 650 square kilometers it's described by geologists as being over 120 million years old and it's they think it's a granitic intrusion that's so supposedly punched through Earth's crust long ago of course under 20 million years and but you know when you look at Brandenburg Massif near it our parallel grooves and ridges that extend outward from it for hundreds of miles and there are Lichtenberg figures covering an enormous area multiple craters with strange shapes and dunes that seem to be frozen in place but when you look closer you can see that the so-called dunes are really solid rock waves that march across the desert they're covered by only a thin layer of sand and parallel grooves like this are everywhere in the solar system on Venus which is the hottest spot in the solar system on Enceladus which is profoundly cold near the temperature of absolute zero and if these patterns are found in such different environments then we have to search for a common explanation for them that has to take all that variability into account and I mentioned Lichtenberg figures a moment ago they're named for George Christoph Lichtenberg and they form when lightning bolts strike some material on earth it can be soil or sometimes even human tissue I've seen images on the web of human beings that have been struck by lightning and these branching dict Lichtenberg figures are burned into their flesh and Lichtenberg figures have also been generated artificially in blocks of acrylic plastic by a man named Burt Hickman who sells what he calls captured lightning sculptures on his website also many Lichtenberg figures have been discovered in the south polar region of Mars and we've referred to them in some pictures of the day as Martian spiders but we're not going to get into the Martian spiders too much here today so if the topography surrounding the bran burg Massif and the bran burg Massif itself exhibits details that are found on other planets and moons then conventional theories are going to fall really short of the observations by describing the birth of the bran burg Massif as an event that emerged gradually in the distant past basically planetary scientists are neglecting observational evidence and that evidence is that the formation is in reality a foga might of huge proportions that might have been formed suddenly again I know that this idea sounds far-fetched since earth geology has been well thought out and explained for the last hundred years or more but I will say though that one well-known geologist that I know has been heavily influenced by these concepts so much so that he's changed his opinion about some earth-based structures and now says he's examining his opinions about how they formed in light of new knowledge that he's gained about electrical events so this shows you that once the mind opens to new ideas and a new way of seeing the world is allowed to take hold things that once seemed so settled and stable suddenly take on a whole new aspect a new way of seeing the world evolves this change in thought processes is sometimes described as a catastrophic shift in perception by psychologists that shift in perception was described in the title of the last Thunderbolts conference it's called a tipping point when you push on a tall object it slowly moves off-center until it reaches the point of no return and tips over without further energy input because gravity takes hold and that same psychological impetus occurs in the mind slowly new ideas begin to build on one another until the old mindset topples and a perfect illustration of that it would be the fall of the Soviet Union if you're talking about it from the psychological standpoint I remember hearing about Hungary taking down their walled borders with the West one day and then it seems like only a couple weeks later that lacroix lenses started the Solidarity movement and then a couple weeks after that we saw the East German wall come down I realize it took longer than that of course but it seems like once the ball starts rolling changes become inevitable 
[Music] Ideally a scientific theory of mythology should be able to explain the genesis and specific content of ancient myth. Modern schools of myth, alas, have long since abandoned any pretense of addressing such questions. Much less of offering comprehensive theories purporting to explain more than a handful of isolated mythological motifs from one particular  culture. Stith Thompson's opinion is representative of the skepticism  that currently prevails in the field, quote “The ultimate origin of nearly  all folk tales and myths must remain a mystery.” The theory advanced by  Dave Talbott and myself, in contrast, claims to offer a unifying explanation of nearly every globally attested mythological structure and thematic pattern. Our theory is distinguished from all other modern schools of myth moreover, by the fact that it explains the individual themes at a level of detail rarely imagined by other scholars. The archetypal myth of the Warrior  Goddess offers a case study in this regard. Among the earliest mythological traditions of Mesopotamia are those describing the planet Venus as the warrior goddess Inanna. Indeed, a third millennium kenning describes war itself as the dance  of Inanna. In the following hymn Inanna is described as raining fire and flood from  the sky, quote “Loud- thundering storm. Hierodule, who makes heavens  tremble, who makes the earth quake, who can soothe your heart? You who  pour down firebrands over the earthly orb, who flash like lightning over the highland... Whose cry reaches heaven and earth, whose roar is all-destructive... Your angry  heart is a terrifying flood- wave.” Now I ask, would anyone viewing Venus  in the present sky ever be inspired to describe it as a loud-thundering storm, flashing, lightning and hurling firebrands? Yet this very language is employed again and again in the Sumerian text to describe Inanna Venus. Quote “Like a dragon you have deposited venom on the foreign lands... Raining blazing fire down upon the land... You  charge forward like a charging storm. You roar with the roaring storm... Your  rage cannot be cooled!” A recurring theme places Inanna Venus at the center of a destructive heaven-spanning storm, described alternately as a tornado or a whirlwind. In a hymn to Inanna for example, Inanna is described as clothed in a furious storm, a whirlwind. The word described as whirlwind here is dal-amun denoting  a tornado or dust cloud. Evident in these archaic traditions is an  image of a planet gone amok. Its whirling tornado-like behavior instantiating its terrible rage. It is telling that analogous behavior is reported of other great goddesses such as the Akkadian Ishtar, the Canaanite Astarte, the Egyptian Hathor Ugaritic Anat, and the Indian Kali. Each of these warrior goddesses, several of whom are explicitly identified with the planet Venus, is associated with a destructive rampage at the dawn of time that brought the world to the very brink of destruction. If Inanna was conceptualized as a whirling storm, Ishtar was represented as a whirling dancer. Quote “Oh valiant Ishtar, shining torch of heaven and earth... Furious and irresistible onslaught... Fiery glow that blazes against the enemy, who wreaks destruction on the fierce Dancing One, Ishtar.” The epithet translated Dancing One here as Gushea, literally, “the Whirling One.” Religious rituals celebrating Ishtar Venus featured frenzied dances in which its celebrants whirled wildly. Benjamin Foster in his commentary on these archaic rituals observed, quote “The whirling dance or mock combat the people perform is a memorial to Ishtar, here etymologized by the poet as the ’whirling dancer.’” From the standpoint of modern astronomy needless to say, there is no conceivable reason why the planet Venus should be conceptualized as an agent of storm, much less as a whirling tornado. Nor for that matter, is there any obvious  reason why that planet should be described as a whirling dancer or fire- spewing warrior. Hence the profound puzzle presented by these widespread myths and  rituals. How then is it possible to explain the myth of the warrior goddess? In the historical reconstruction offered by Talbott and myself, the myth in question encodes catastrophic natural events during which Venus's atmosphere became hyper-charged and disturbed, flaring dramatically in the northern circumpolar heaven. The basic image was that of a whirling comet-like object, or hair star. Indeed, ancient artworks from Mesopotamia, Old Europe and the New World depict Venus as a whirling  star. Such imagery is especially conspicuous in the indigenous traditions  associated with the Hindu goddess Kali. According to the various accounts, the goddesse’s frenzy dancing threatened to destroy the world. Quote “The dread mother dances naked in the battlefield, her lowling tongue burns like a red flame of fire, her dark tresses fly in the sky, sweeping away sun and stars, red streams of blood run from her cloud-black limbs, and the entire world trembles and cracks under  her tread.” A recurring theme in the Hindu accounts of Kali's rampage is  the goddess's wildly disheveled hair, reputedly capable of raising a terrible storm that blocks out the light of the Sun. The goddess's hair, as noted by David Kinsley, is a sign of her destructive nature, quote ”Kali's unbound hair may also have a broader, indeed cosmic, significance, suggesting dissolution itself. Considering Kali's identification with  the cremation ground and death, her loose hair may suggest the end of the world. Her hair has come apart and flies about every which way; order has come to an end; all has returned to chaos.” As we would understand this imagery, Venus's swirling hair not only presented the appearance of a giant comet or tornado circling about the polar axis, it was laden with lightning and fire and quite literally constituted a storm that blocked out the light of the primal Sun. Hence the global myth of the giant comet or dragon that swallowed the Sun and threatening to destroy the world. A Sumerian hymn from the second  millennium BC captures this idea perfectly. Quote “My hair will quarrel around in heaven for you like a hurricane.” Students of myth will remember that Kali's dance was not a solo performance. She was joined by Shiva whose dervish-like dancing added to  the apocalyptic destruction. Shiva is Mars, as I have documented in various works. Analysis reveals that Mars features prominently in nearly every aspect  of the myth of the warrior goddess. It was a tornado-like storm associated with Venus in fact which vacuumed up many miles of surface material from Mars, leaving the red planet with a severely flattened northern hemisphere. Doubtlessly, immense dust clouds of recently catastrophically excavated material contributed much to Venus's archetypal status as an agent of destruction and whirling dust devil, not to mention her intimate association with a vast horde of demonic beings. Despite  her many repulsive attributes, Kali remains India's most beloved goddess to this very day. Artworks depicting the raging goddess are ubiquitous, most emphasizing her disheveled hair and grotesquely protruding tongue. It is the goddess's tongue that remains the  most iconic and lurid of all her ghastly features. Quote ”Kali's tongue is a problem... It hangs. It lolls. One cannot help noticing it. In the famous temple of Kali in southern Calcutta, the image of the goddess appears to be nothing but a tongue... The history of Kali's tongue, like the history of the goddess itself, is a story rich in detail but poor in plot.”  "We know a great deal about what the tongue symbolized in specific texts at different periods, but we know very little about how why, or when the different meanings of the tongue developed.” How then would we explain kali's gigantic tongue? The fact that warrior goddesses from the New World, likewise display a protruding tongue, attest the archetypal nature of the imagery in question. As does the fact that cultures on both sides of the Atlantic explicitly compare the goddess's tongue to a dagger or  knife. Here too it is our opinion that the imagery encodes the unique relationship prevailing between Mars and Venus during a specific phase in the history of the polar configuration in which Mars appeared to move below Venus towards Earth, presenting the appearance of a dagger-like tongue. The fact that the red planet was described as the knife star or sword by sky watchers from Early Mesopotamia or Egypt, is certainly germane to our hypothesis [Music] 
[Host, Michael] Welcome to the Thunderbolts.info Podcast for February 12, 2016. If you're one of the many people around the world who's begun exploring the Electric Universe Theory, then you've probably become aware of some very different ideas about how the universe actually works. This is a universe where nothing really lives in isolation from anything else. There is a conductive medium, called plasma, that pervades the physical universe and electric currents flowing through plasma connect and influence separate bodies over vast cosmic distances. And in our own solar system we see this principle demonstrated in the electromagnetic relationship between the Earth and the Sun. And scientists have actually known for many decades that the Sun is the cause of auroras on Earth. This was a confirmation of the hypothesis of the experimentalist Kristian Birkeland and in recent years the evidence for the Earth-Sun electrical connection has grown more and more powerful. So the question is if the Earth and the Sun are electromagnetically connected and if the Sun's influence on the Earth is not merely limited to radiation and thermal heating and kinetic collisions of particles. And maybe, if the Earth itself is a charged body that can be thought of as a kind of capacitor, then it seems inevitable that our basic understanding of the Earth's climate and weather needs to be dramatically reassessed. Do we really understand what it is that creates and drives weather phenomena? Now, under Thunderbolts YouTube channel we've occasionally addressed the issue of global warming or so-called climate change and in fact we've even explored the recent discoveries of mysterious climate change on other planets as well as our own. Well, today we're gonna be exploring this question from a very unique angle. Our guest is a gentleman by the name of Richard Moore and Richard was a featured speaker at the Thunderbolts conference EU 2015, in June of last year. I was recently able to watch the video of Richard's talk which was called "The Pulsating Universe and Planet Earth" and I really felt that it was one of the memorable highlights of the conference. Richard has explored the electrical theory of stars and the electrical environment of our own Milky Way galaxy and he's applying those principles to a thesis that could provide an explanation for natural climate change here on Earth. And Richard's thesis is an example of how there really is not one set or dogmatic, kind of, electric universe hypothesis. There are different people coming into the community and they have their own unique insights and unique takes on all things electrical. And so Richard, whenever I'm interviewing someone for the first time who's coming into the electric universe community, I'm always interested in asking them how they first became introduced to the Electric Universe hypothesis and I'm wondering this whole question of climate change, is that an issue that you were exploring first or did you find the Electric Universe and see its applicability and relevance to the whole climate change debate? [Richard] Well actually, I was interested in climate long before I heard of the Electric Universe model. Like everyone else, I was aware, of course, of all the publicity and concern and activism around what they originally called global warming and now they call climate change. But then, every once in a while, I would read an article that had a lot of a scientific clout behind it and presented what looked like strong evidence that the global warming hypothesis wasn't valid. And so I didn't, I really didn't know what to believe and I'm not somebody who likes to just let things go like that so I decided that what I was going to do is actually download look for the climate data on... official climate data on the web and download it and look at it myself. So it didn't take very long to find the NOAA, what it is, the National Oceanographic aeronautics, or whatever, administration, and I found the ice core data for Greenland and for Vostok, which is in Antarctica. So I had the Arctic ice core record and the Antarctic ice core record which seems to be the most accurate and reliable long-term record of climate, record of diverse temperatures. And I started looking at that and it became apparent, very quickly, that there isn't really anything unusual going on with respect to climate so, just to give an overall picture of what climate variation has been; if you look at the record for the last 400,000 years, which is what the Vostok record shows, see that the Earth is almost always in what's, in what we call, an ice age. And it's only every 100,000 years approximately that there's a sudden spike in temperature, a very sudden spike and a very short-lived spike. So we have about, something like 10,000 years of what we have now, an interglacial period, and then the temperature falls rapidly again, down to the next ice age. So it's good just to have an overall pattern of what, what happens on the Earth. Then it's interesting, the kind of pattern, there's those spikes every 100,000 years, like I said, but if you look at the graph, there's another set of smaller spikes that occur about every 10,000 years. So basically, what the climate record is, is spikes on different scales and the spikes occur with an approximately regular frequency, so it's a fractal pattern. All I knew is that this was what, these were natural things, this is all looking before there was any industrial age. And I didn't have any idea what might be causing it but I said well, this is the natural pattern and we better know about the natural pattern if you want to start talking about something being unnatural. So then I looked at, just the tail end, just the last 10,000 years or so, of the graph, and, lo and behold, you get another series of spikes only ... there about every 1,000 years. And then within that, there's even smaller spikes. So, in other words, it's spikes all the way down. Different frequencies. Now, the one for the last 10,000 years, what you can see, and now I'm looking at the Greenland record, the northern hemisphere. Well, you see the spikes that go up at the beginning and then flatten out and then they go down at the end. So basically there's a spike at about -1000, a spike at the Year Zero, spike at the year 1000, and then it goes down to about an 1800, about 1800 goes down to a minimum and, lo and behold, what they call global warming is one more spike occurring just about when you would expect it to occur, to year 2000. And then I, you know, I found that very interesting. I said well, yeah, there's been 200 years of global warming and it follows the natural pattern. And, according to that natural pattern, it should turn around and start down around the year 2000. So I did some research looking for different articles and, lo and behold, there were about 5 different kinds of ways of measuring, all of which showed that the global warming rise stopped about the year 2000. So I found that very interesting but I still hadn't heard, but I didn't have any reason to think I had any theory about why we had this spiky pattern and why it was now going down. And then, I forget how I heard about it, but I heard about the Electric Universe and I bought the book The Electric Sky and read that and it was just, I mean the... it's just so obviously that it had to be true because what you see in the cosmos are... you know, these beautiful images like from the Hubble Telescope and everything, they all look like the kind of plasma discharges that you can create in the laboratory. And we know that the universe is 99% plasma. So, if what we have is the plasma universe and what we see are what looked like plasma discharges then it makes a whole lot of sense to assume they are plasma discharge. [Michael] Right, it's way to common sense approach to tell, Richard! So, then I looked, sorry, then I put the two things together. What I noticed about all these spikes being a record and the fact that the universe is filled with electric currents and we know by looking at graphs, as I talk and I think you're gonna be able to put some of those up with our podcast, one of the graphs shows the current, there's a current that comes in to the Sun at both poles. That's what powers the Sun, that's what makes it shine. But most of the current, it goes around the chromosphere, you know, around the corona and then goes out over the equator, that's what's called the equatorial current sheet. So that current is coming out across, over the plane of the equator of the Sun, and so it goes to all the planets. So there's a current that goes from the Sun to the Earth and again, just as with the Sun, the current comes in at the North and South Poles and it goes through the ionosphere mostly, some of it comes down as lightning and weather events, just like some of the current goes into the Sun and causes it to shine. Some also comes into the Earth but most of it goes around through the ionosphere and then goes out over the equatorial plane of the Earth and rejoins the current that's flowing away from the Sun. So that current that comes into the Earth, that's what's visible as the aurora, the northern and southern lights. Now, nobody's going to get sunburned from standing under the aurora so it's not obvious how, the fact that an electrical current comes in to the Earth, how that might cause heating. That isn't, it still isn't obvious how that happens. But, the fact is that what else, besides an electric current, can cause spikes of energy on all different scales? Like the standard theory for the ice ages is that the Earth gets closer and farther from the Sun, you know, but if there were an orbital variation of any kind it would be exactly regular, wouldn't be approximately regular. An electric current can carry any charge, I mean, can carry any amount of current. Like, that's why you have spike protectors on your computer power supply cause it could suddenly be a spike coming over the current. So and if, like I, one thing I did just, kind of, for fun is, I recorded some music and then looked at the graph and what you see is something that looks almost exactly like the climate record, it's all spikes at all different scales. So the point is that an electric current is capable of carrying a fractal pattern that goes over a very, very wide range of scales. And electric.. you know, and they're usually cyclical, you know, they're usually some kind of, discharges' circuits tend to have cyclical patterns in them. [Michael] That's an interesting point to raise because our most viewed Space News to date was on a, so-called, impossible neutron star. Scientists, they observed what appeared to be a pulsar with the brightness of, I think t'was 10 million Suns, and so that was a big problem but we, I hear from apologists for the mainstream viewpoint and they say well, it's the periodicity of a pulsar, it has to be created by this kind of mechanical spinning lighthouse effect. It couldn't be something electrical because then you wouldn't get this kind of regular pulsing signal. What are your thoughts on that? Well, you can create discharges in the laboratory that pulse, I mean, electrical circuits do pulse, you know, it's, that's how radio works, you have a capacitor and a resistor and a power supply and depending on how they're set you can decide what frequency you're getting, that is how you tune a radio. So that's standard behavior for circuits. So, in other words, I had this hypothesis that the Earth's temperature record and the fact that we're connected to an electrical circuit could be... so it could be an electrical thing that causes climate change. But I didn't have any... I didn't have any empirical verification of that at first. Then, when I went to the Electrical Universe conference in June, I gave my talk, there was another talk, but he showed that the sunspot cycle, which is the sunspot, the number of sunspots basically is measuring the electrical input to the Sun, the more sunspots, the more electrical energy coming into the Sun which means the more electrical energy that reaches the Earth. Because, you know, it's going to be proportional. Double the energy into the Sun, you're gonna double the energy into the Earth. Well, there was a minimum of temperature around... somewhere in the 1650, 1700, around in there, if you look at the temperature record for Greenland, and it turns out there was a minimum, there was a very clear minimum of sunspots at the exact same time. So, what that, and then, since then there's, the sunspots have been increasing and temperature has been increasing. So there is a very definite, strong, not a slight, no one of these things that points 1%, but there's a very strong linear correlation between electrical input and temperature. Sort of, it's a strong verification of the hypothesis that it is electrical input to the Earth which is causing climate variations. [Michael] Ok, now what might you say to a critic who rejects the very notion of an electrically powered Sun or even an electromagnetic connection between the, the Earth and the Sun, when for instance, the auroras here on Earth, science now recognizes that the Sun is the cause of the auroras but they're still thinking in terms of collisions. So, what do you believe is some of the best evidence that the Sun actually is an electrical phenomenon? [Richard] Well, I mean, that's really, that's really a problem for the whole electric universe community, how do we get people to look at the data? I mean if you... The Thunderbolts.info website, I think, does a very, very good job. It's not that we don't have the arguments, it's not that we don't present them well, it's not that we don't have data, it's that mainstream cosmologists and institution astronomers, they were just not tempted to look at it. If someone told them, oh there's an electric model of the universe, they say; geez, well, there's also sites to talk about UFOs, right? You know, I mean, they just dismiss the idea. If we could get them to actually look at what is on the Thunderbolts.info website, I think that works! You know... I don't think there's any failure in our presentation abilities. [Michael] Well, on the climate change debate, and most of the so-called debates that I've seen, we don't see an alternative view of the Sun or the Earth-Sun connection really being presented. A lot of the discussions are political and there's also debate over the question of CO₂ and a question of the cause and effect relationship between CO₂ and warming. So what are your thoughts on that? Is there a correlation between CO₂ and warming or is it the other way around or do you think the whole issue is horribly overinflated? [Richard] Well, the thing is that, if you look at the what the articles they are publishing, they always say things like, first year on records since records have been kept. Well, the thing is they didn't start keeping records until into the 1800s and there has been 200 years of warming since 1800, there's no doubt about that. It's just that that matches 200 years of warming we've had in the year -1,000, in the year 0 and in the year 1000 and so now we're having a peak in 2000. So there was an accidental in correlation between the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and a natural temperature rise that was going to occur anyway. Now why the, so-called, climate scientists aren't looking at the long-term record, that's, I think, a political question. I think there's political reasons for that, which is really a different subject. But the fact is that, if you look at the long-term record, you can see that this correlation between carbon dioxide of the Industrial Revolution and 200 years of warming has been a complete coincidence. And it turns out that... let's see, we have one graph here from John Christy of the Earth System Science Center and what it shows is, it shows a red line which is what the... what that CO₂ models say is going to happen with temperature and then they have a green and a blue line which would show the actual measured temperature from satellites and other sources. Up until 1995, or so, they were tracking each other. The so-called CO₂ models were tracking temperature. But beginning, you know, just before the year 2000, the CO₂ models are now going way up into the stratosphere and the actual real temperatures are flattening out and beginning to decline. So that really tells the story. It's been an accidental correlation and now the correlation is breaking down because nature is... and the other thing is that the rate of increase of heating was not any higher than normal. In other words, there could have been both CO₂ warming and natural warming, that would have been possible, but then the spike would have gone up at a steeper rate. But it's not, it's going up at exactly the same rate that it went up the previous 3 spikes. So there's no evidence whatsoever of any influence from CO₂. If you actually study the... I mean, I've seen studies of greenhouse gas effect, okay? And so, I mean, you can study CO₂ as a greenhouse gas in a test tube or in a beaker or, you know, in the laboratory. And what you find is that it's a logarithmic thing where, when you, if you, start off with no CO₂ and put some in, then you get a very rapid rise in temperature. But as you begin to get a certain level of CO₂, then the effect of it drops off to almost nothing. So, by the time you get to about 265 parts per million, you're not getting any effect at all of adding more CO₂. So, in other words, we already had experienced the maximum that CO₂ can contribute to warming before the Industrial Age even came along. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by the Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info Wal, I love the topic of supernovas for the Electric Universe for a couple of big reasons. Number one, as I mentioned earlier, it was well over a decade ago, that you wrote your own scientific paper which explains supernovas as a type of electrical discharge. And this paper was peer reviewed and published in the IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science. People who call themselves skeptics of the Electric Universe have always demanded more peer-reviewed material and yet I have to wonder how many of these “skeptics” have ever bothered to read the aforementioned peer-reviewed paper. And number two, in recent years, there have been several supernova discoveries which, according to the scientists making the discoveries, are not merely surprising, but rather they “break all the rules” and they upend all conventional thought on the very nature of stars and of supernovas. The standard story of a supernova of course is that when a star has exhausted its nuclear fuel, it will gravitationally collapse and then a rebound effect produces an explosion. Well, a little over two years ago, there was a supernova which science media dubbed the ”zombie star” because it appeared to first explode well over half a century ago and then more than 50 years later, it appeared to “come back to life” and explode again. Here's what phys.org wrote on this story a couple of years ago. “The finding, published by Nature, completely confounds existing knowledge of the star’s end of life. Somehow this star exploded more than half a century ago, survived, and exploded again in 2014.” And the lead author of a paper on the finding said “This supernova breaks everything we thought we knew about how they work.” Now as I see it, here's the real taproot of the  “crisis” in cosmology, which we've been referring to for over eight years on this series. It's not that discovery is sometimes, or actually quite often, surprising or mystifying for astronomers. Anyone can be surprised by discovery, especially when we're talking about the incredibly complex nature of the remotest phenomena observed throughout the universe. No one, including proponents of plasma cosmology in the Electric Universe, can claim to have all of the answers. But the real essence of the “crisis” is that very simply, discovery doesn't change anything. The aforementioned supernova quote ”breaks everything astronomers thought they knew about how supernovas work.” That's not according to me, it's not according to Wal Thornhill, it's according to the scientists who made the discovery. Today, what indication exists that any new theories of supernovas and of the nature of stars are actually being considered. Science is simply moving forward as if nothing has changed. That's right. There are a bewildering number of categories of supernovae, and new ones are being found that don't follow the rules. The electrical model of stars on the other hand, put forward by Ralph Juergens, has been successfully tested by the SAFIRE experiment, and it shows that plasma double layers, or sheaths, are formed around all bright stars. And a feature of double layers is that they can explode suddenly under stress, and throw over the star's galactic power switch. When that happens, the electromagnetic energy stored in the local galactic circuit, is suddenly unleashed, like an arc welder on the star’s surface. That's why a supernova can briefly outshine its entire galaxy. The nearest recent supernova, 1987a in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a dwarf galaxy satellite of the Milky Way, is only six times more distant from us than the center of the Milky Way and showed glowing features of a star circuit with its three coaxial rings of pearls, defining the characteristic hourglass shape of a plasma pinch. So, when this short circuit occurs at a star, the circuit itself is trying to deliver more power suddenly to the star itself and the circuit in this case became visible, and is still visible. Supernovae type 1a are used as standard candles by astronomers and their faintness used as one measure of the distance of remote galaxies. I said earlier, Halton Arp showed quasars with high redshift are connected to nearby galaxies, which means that the redshift is not a measure of distance. He went on to show that redshift is a measure of the lower energy and youthfulness of an object, and not that it is moving away from us at high speed. In other words, the universe is not expanding; there was no Big Bang and in the case of the lower-than-expected brightness of the supernovae type 1a in these youthful objects, that is due to the lower energy of the quasar itself, having been recently born from the center of an active galactic nucleus. The Nobel prizes for this discovery were awarded, based on an assumption. That assumption is incorrect. Very good. Well Wal, moving on to another example of a high-energy electromagnetic phenomenon on an even larger scale: in late 2019 NASA released a new image of a feature which has been dubbed the “cosmic candy-cane,” near the center of the Milky Way galaxy. This image is extremely interesting for a number of reasons from the Electric Universe vantage point. A NASA press release says that the cosmic candy-cane ”...spans 190 lightyears and is one of a set of long, thin strands of ionized gas called filaments that emit radio waves.... the GISMO instrument detected the most prominent radio filament in the galactic center, known as the Radio Arc, which forms the straight part of the cosmic candy-cane. Scientists say the filaments delineate the edges of a large bubble produced by some energetic event at the galactic center, located within the bright region known as Sagittarius A about 27,000 light years away from us. Additional red arcs in the image reveal other filaments. And a member of NASA's GISMO team says of the image “It was a real surprise to see the Radio Arc in the GISMO data. Its emission comes from high-speed electrons spiraling in a magnetic field, a process called synchrotron emission.” Of course plasma cosmology proposes that something very different from a black hole is actually at the center of the Milky Way, and in fact of all galaxies. So, what are your thoughts on what we're actually seeing in this image? The cosmic candy-cane is actually composed of parallel current filaments, which are drawn together because the electric current is flowing in the same direction along parallel conducting paths. And all of this kind of phenomena were described and explained decades ago, by plasma cosmologists. But because of the specialism that exists in science these days, the specialists in one field having developed their own story, do not like to have it disturbed by paying attention to someone else with a parallel story. Even if that parallel story explains the observations, without having to invent dark matter, dark energy, black holes, and all of the other paraphernalia that current standard cosmology has invested so much time and money in. Filamentary structures at the center of our galaxy are part of the circuit of the galaxy itself. The electric current flows in, in the form of mostly fast electrons, into the center of the galaxy and they spiral in to form what's known to plasma cosmologists as a plasmoid, which is a tiny doughnut-shaped electromagnetic phenomenon, which occasionally, when it becomes too dense, too many particles jammed into the small space at the center of the galaxy, it will break down and emit jets along the axis of the doughnut. Now all of these things are seen and explained by plasma cosmology, but ignored by those who control the funding. Wal, speaking of big funding in the world of science, last year there was a major announcement that garnered international news headlines, when scientists announced the first-ever detection of a collision between a hypothetical neutron star and a hypothetical black hole. But last month, the first papers were released on this alleged event, and what they're reporting is that a scan of the region of space where the hypothetical collision took place, has literally revealed nothing. Here is a snippet from a sciencealert.com report on this development. It states “Last year, the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave detectors pinged with an entirely new kind of collision: not two neutron stars, not two black holes, but a neutron star and a black hole together. Scientists were thrilled: this could be the first time we've ever witnessed such a binary system.” “Now after poring over the corner of space in which the collision took place, an international team of astronomers has seen the aftermath - or rather, the lack of one. Using some of the world's most powerful astronomical instruments, the collaboration found not even a brief flash of light associated with the collision.” And the report also noted that the papers were still awaiting peer review. Now Wal, since we have challenged the very existence of neutron stars and black holes, why don't you explain why a failure to find evidence of a collision between these types of objects is a predictable outcome from the Electric Universe perspective. The standard model is having extreme difficulties because the physics they are using is missing. There is no explanation of gravity or their equations; there is no definition of mass, or energy, in physics today, which is an incredible indictment when you think of the amount of money we spend, chasing various rabbits down holes, that are invented by these standard "modelists." The idea of a black hole, in fact, is one of these tricks that mathematicians use of reifying objects and phenomena that involve infinities. The idea that you can continually compress matter to form a black hole, is based on a total lack of understanding of gravity, and also a total lack, as I said, of a definition of the mass of an object. In fact, even our encyclopedias and textbooks on physics will confuse the two words ‘mass’ and ‘matter’ as if they are equivalent and, in fact, often the words are used interchangeably. But mass is a property of matter. It is not equivalent and E=mc2, that well-known, that misunderstood equation, says that mass is related to energy. In other words, mass is an energetic variable. So, this gives you some idea that modern physics lacks any firm foundation and we can blame Einstein and those who have followed him, for this situation. Because his theory of relativity made each independent observer, no matter how they are traveling, the center of their own private universe and this of course is impossible. Physics, before it left the rails, was blessed with absolute standards of space and time, which meant that you could define things sensibly. We have not been able to do so ever since the theories of relativity were introduced. The fundamental error with black hole theory is that gravity is only an attractive force. But as some wag said, only an idiot would design a universe with an unbalanced force. The Electric Universe says no, there is only one force in the universe; it is the electric force. Gravity, magnetism and the nuclear forces, are all manifestations of the way matter responds to the electric force. And a fundamental issue there is the idea that subatomic particles, protons and electrons, and so on, have structure themselves. Since they have electrical structure, they will deform in the presence of an electric field. And we know this, simply because particle accelerators seem to increase the mass of a subatomic particle in that accelerator. In other words, you apply a force to that particle and the energy is absorbed by that particle, in deformation. It changes shape from maybe a sphere into an ellipsoid, a football shape, and in doing so, it absorbs energy. Rather than accelerating, it is absorbing energy, and that's where E=mc2 comes from: it's very simple. So, when we talk about the effects of a black hole, we are talking about energies which manifests as if the object had the mass of 70 Suns, but instead, we may be looking at a system which is responding to electromagnetic forces and not that of gravity. So, this is where one of the fundamental errors comes in, when people talk about black holes at the centers of galaxies with millions or billions of times the mass of our Sun. No, what we're talking about is an object, a compact object, the most compact form of electromagnetic energy storage known in the laboratory. And so, it's that energy which manifests as if it has that kind of mass. The interest in a merger between a neutron star and a black hole is obvious, because the neutron star signal can be used as accurate as an atomic clock and therefore, as the orbit decays, it spins faster and faster around the black hole. We should be able to see a Doppler shift in the signal from the neutron star. The problem with this particular report is that it assumes that the change in the signal frequency is due to an orbital motion. But then again, the signal from a neutron star, is not well explained ,since it requires an object that has never been shown to exist, that is a star made completely out of neutrons, and also, no other thought has entered the heads of those theorists as to how you might produce such a well stabilized signal: the pulse from the pulsar. But plasma physicists once again, the plasma cosmologists, decades ago, showed that not only the steady signal, but also the glitches and other fine structure in the signal, can all be explained in termsof a magnetospheric circuit of a star. One of the most accurate signal sources known in the laboratory, is known as a trapped-ion signal, and the plasma cosmologists were able to show that a stellar magnetosphere could act as a trapped ion oscillator. So, when the astronomers, using their standard thinking about neutron stars and black holes, couldn't find the black hole, all that's showing is that the magnetospheric circuit of the pulsing star, was changing. Not that it was orbiting a black hole. Well, Wal you've now more than laid the foundation for this last item I'd like to discuss. And I think that this piece, perhaps more than anything we've talked about today, emphasizes your points about astronomers and astrophysicists reifying things which are not physically real. So, let me read briefly from a Popular Mechanics piece entitled: “This is wild. Astrophysicists can see Stars twisting Space and Time.” It states, “A team of astrophysicists from around the world has been following an unusual pair of spinning stars for almost 20 years, and now they say the binary system is persuasive evidence of frame dragging. in a new paper in Science, the researchers say the white dwarf and neutron star that spin extremely fast together, form an edge case to demonstrate relativity.” Wal, I literally have nothing to say about space and time being physically twisted by these stars, so I throw it to you. One of the aspects of these two stars is that “one is a white dwarf, the size of the Earth but 300,000 times its density; the other is a neutron star which, while only 20 kilometers in diameter, is about 100 billion times the density of the Earth,” the press release says. This is sheer nonsense. White dwarf stars are not understood; even Eddington when he produced the standard model of stars, said they seemed to be operating on some different principle. A white dwarf is simply a star that has a corona which is dim and white. It doesn't have a bright photosphere. So it's discharge is a different part of the gas discharge spectrum and it is not the size of the Earth; it is not 300,000 times its density; it is a normal star. The neutron star of course, a hundred billion times the density of the Earth, is sheer nonsense. You cannot compress matter like that; gravity doesn't behave in that way; it is merely a case of extending an equation, like that of the stretching of a spring. After you have stretched it so far, the spring is broken, the equation no longer works. As I mentioned earlier, the notion of mass is not explained at all in modern physics and therefore you cannot tell what the density of an object is by measuring its gravity. So, the whole model of this orbiting system, is invalid. The report goes on to say, the tiny neutron star is the pulsar, meaning it emits a steady beam of light that can be tracked as it spins. Like when the Sun's reflection off a metal object points directly in your eyes, as you walk past. This is a simplistic model that makes no sense, when you consider that the star has to spin faster than a dentist's drill in some instances. So, monitoring the frequency of these spinning pulses led scientists begin to make an overall picture of how the neutron star is orbiting;  it does not. Once again, as I mentioned earlier, the pulsing signal from a star is not due to it spinning. It is due to the fact that it is a magnetospheric circuit that behaves like an atomic clock. It is a trapped-ion oscillator, which is a very stable oscillating system. The report goes on: ”All pulsars are useful for research into astrophysics because of the way their size and density makes them behave extremely.” The extreme density is only a mathematical result of an invalid physical model. So, the pulsar is not locked in a tight and extremely fast orbit and therefore the so-called evolution has nothing to do with the gravitational system. The report finishes with: “All of this means that for the first time, astrophysicists have recorded evidence of the predicted phenomenon of frame dragging. If space-time is colloquially indeed a ‘fabric,’ it's an elastic one, where spinning objects receive that stored energy back from the fabric of space-time itself.” That has nothing to do with physics. Space and time are non-physical concepts. In classical physics, space and time are absolute. So you cannot treat it as a fabric; it's not elastic; and spinning objects cannot store energy in this imaginary fabric. It goes on to say: “ The orbit of the two stars continues to drift and change, like a spinning figure skater who accelerates by pulling in their limbs. It’s is this change in speed and orientation that let scientists observe the frame dragging....” That is an assumption of what the signals mean. “This detection is consistent with an evolutionary scenario in which the white dwarf accreted matter from the pulsar, spinning up the white dwarf to a period of less than 200 seconds.” This seems an incredible piece of work by the white dwarf accreting matter from something that is so highly compressed and held together by gravity. How is it going to accrete matter from it? I think the game is given away in the last paragraph: “Scientists have longed for evidence of frame dragging in the wild, so to speak, because the idea could explain a lot of things we don't understand yet about relativity, gravity itself and forces that affect everything from celestial objects to subatomic particles.” Of course, but you're not going to find the answers by fiddling with non- physical ideas and no definitions of gravity, mass, energy. We stopped doing physics over a century ago. So, the scientists may continue to long for evidence of things, but when their interpretations are so far removed from reality, the answers are always going to be a puzzle. [Music] 
The theme is "Future Science," and this will be our sixth annual conference August 17 to 20 in Phoenix, Arizona. Perhaps you already know that the Electric Universe paradigm is gaining greater traction year by year. Who could deny today that the vastness of space is animated by a life-like sea of charged particles called plasma? Well, the plasma universe is an electric universe, and that's a far cry from the electrically sterile cosmos of standard theory throughout the 20th century. When we speak of future science, we mean science minus the fiction -- no Big Bang, no dark matter, no black hole singularities, no neutron stars, no thermalnuclear core of the Sun, no planets on clockwork orbits for billions of years and few, if any, dirty snowball comets. The Electric Universe movement is a reconsideration of fundamentals in the sciences. Independent research is converged on a series of electrical findings. The confidence driving this movement comes from the demonstrable power of the electric force acting on planetary, stellar, and galactic evolution. No subatomic domain and no corner of the remote universe is free from this influence: the electric force, the long overlooked underpinning of the natural world. EU2017 will include a roster of experts on naturally-occurring electrical phenomena. Our first recommendation to you is, don't be late! The first highlight will be a talk by the internationally recognized expert on electrified water, Dr. Gerald Pollack. Dr. Pollack will report on the surprising role of separated charge in the organization of global weather systems. Then will come our conference keynote speaker, Dr. James Ryder. Before his retirement in 2011, Dr. Ryder served as a Vice-president at Lockheed Martin and as head of the company's Advanced Technology Center. Dr. Ryder is currently Chairman of the Board of the International Science Foundation which funds the SAFIRE project and advises on scientific aspects of the experiment. Dr. Ryder's update will help to set the tone of the conference, in particular the anticipated report on SAFIRE by Project Director Monty Childs. Our Chief Science Adviser, Wal Thornhill, will outline a vision for the future, science incrementally discovering one surprise at a time - The Electric Universe. And retired Professor of Electrical Engineering, Donald Scott, will review recent findings that now confirm the presence of Birkeland currents in space. The environment through which the earth itself moves is not electrically neutral. Add to this electrified mix the contribution of Ben Davidson, founder of the Suspicious0bservers group. Ben will speak on the interdisciplinary implications of the electrical paradigm, ranging across such diverse fields as space science, earthquake prediction, biomedical engineering, and new energy prospects. Of special interest, we will also be devoting a full day to the Immanuel Velikovsky Controversy, one of the most critical scientific debates of the 20th century. Suppression of Velikovsky's work continued for decades and the core issues raised still haunt scientific discourse today. Contributors to this discussion will include the people closest to the controversy in recent years. More than 15 additional experts will be contributing as speakers and panelists. Key themes will include the electricity of life, electrical scars of planetary violence, and the impact of planetary catastrophe on the ancient civilizations. We invite you to join us in this three and a half day exploration of the Electric Universe. That's EU2017 in Phoenix, Arizona, August 17 to 20. 
[Music] New evidence from the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory near Chicago seems to point to a subatomic particle, called a muon, behaving in a way that it should not. It is believed that every particle has what is called a magnetic moment; and this is essentially a sort of wobble. Each type of particle has a very precise value for this magnetic moment. When they ran their experiments, they discovered something rather curious. The muon seemed to be wobbling a lot more than the theory predicted. The scientists who discovered this think that the best explanation for this, is that the muon is being pushed around by types of matter and energy completely unknown to physics. The current model has remained largely unchanged in the last 50 years, and this small discovery could well shake the entire foundation that this is built on. Muons can be thought of as fat electrons as they are similar to a regular electron, but are 200 times heavier and are also radioactively unstable, decaying in a mere millionth of a second into electrons and the elusive neutrino. In the experiments they sent the muons into a superconducting ring and this seemed to show that it was wobbling far more than it should. The wobble, they think, is related to the spin of the particle. The idea of spin was first discovered  in the 1920’s by Otto Stern and Walter Gerlach. They shot silver atoms through a varying magnetic field, and saw something that they couldn't explain. The silver atoms were neutral, so had an equal number of protons and electrons. They had expected to find one of two possible results. Number 1: the neutrality of the atoms would nullify any interactions with the magnetic field, and they would travel in a straight line. Number 2: if the atoms behaved like spheres that could also spin on their axes, then this angular momentum would interact with the surrounding magnetic field, producing a torque. Since each  atom would have a random spin, and hence torque, it would scatter  the atoms in all directions. What they discovered was actually none of these. When they examined the results, what they actually saw was, that there were two very distinct trajectories from the silver atoms. One group heading upwards and the other heading downwards. The experiment revealed that  particles that make up the atom, had previously unknown properties that were only revealed by the magnetic field. Since the atoms sort of behave like spinning balls of electric charge, this property was dubbed spin. From this point onwards particles would have three properties: mass, charge and spin. Through experiments it was determined that the spin property is a fixed quantity. The problem was that Schrodinger's equations did not take account of any spin and it would be Dirac who would come up with a mathematics that would bridge the gap and allow quantum mechanics to work with special relativity. The behavior of these particles is far more complex than a simple spinning sphere. In fact, it is fair to say that there is no useful metaphor for this property at all. In classical physics, the magnetic spin moment would be equal to a half multiplied by the ratio of its electric charge, to its mass, multiplied by its spin angular momentum. However, in quantum mechanics it all gets multiplied by a pre-factor which is called g. If the universe were purely quantum mechanical in nature g would equal 2 and this is exactly what Dirac had predicted. As you might be able to guess, g does not  equal 2. Scientists claim that this means that the universe is not just quantum mechanical. Instead, there are also fields that permeate the universe which are responsible for carrying the forces. So, these fields also interact with all the particles, meaning  g cannot be equal to 2. This value has been observed for electrons for a long period of time. As they have very little mass, they predominantly interact with the electromagnetic force. This in turn means that the g2 effects are dominated by the electromagnetic force and we can calculate the magnetic moment to 13 decimal places for the electron. The muon is a different case. It is unstable, but has over 200 times the mass of an electron. This makes its magnetic moment much smaller than the electron, and  this also means that they believe it interacts with the strong force much  more compared to the electron. It is here that the scientists have found a difference with what their equations predicted, and what is actually being measured. A rival team however would like to pour cold water on their findings and  are rushing to publish a paper that would in fact allow for this greater wobble to exist within the existing models, and no new models would be required. Their calculations also follow the rules of the Standard Model but they relied upon a totally different calculation with very different assumptions. This shows that the physicists cannot agree on exactly how the 17 existing standard model particles interact with muons, allowing for the different interpretations. At this stage it is important to take a little step back, and just examine the experiment, to understand what might be going on. Firstly, they generate muons by firing protons at a target. The collision is thought to release energy which gets turned into matter. It creates something called a pion, which almost immediately decays, forming a muon. This muon lasts for a short period, before decaying into an electron and some neutrino particles. We cannot see or measure pions. They are a theoretical particle. The same can be said for the neutrino. We can only detect the neutrinos by their interaction with other particles. If  we examine the muon, it presents a rather interesting case that seems to highlight many of the problems with particle physics today. It is essentially an electron which is thought to have more mass. This particle can only be made through collisions with other particles and more specifically, atoms. The Standard Model holds that there are protons and neutrons in the nucleus, held together by a force called the strong nuclear force. This stops the protons from flying away from each other and binds them into the nucleus. There is no order to their nucleus, and protons  and neutrons occupy random locations. And yet, radioactive decay will always result in the production of certain smaller components, irrespective of this randomness. The Structured Atom Model shows  us a different way of looking at this. Instead, there are no neutrons,  and there is no strong nuclear force. Protons are held in the nucleus by electrons. An electron and a proton pair is what we see as a neutron. If we add into this the idea of platonic solids and use a simple densest packing rule, we can now create complex atomic nuclei following a very simple set of rules. Even more remarkable is that this structure, and its instabilities in certain parts, perfectly matches and explains  why certain elements are unstable, and why they decay into specific products. So why is this relevant to muons? In the mainstream model electrons do not exist within the nucleus. The muon is produced by colliding a particle with an atom. We know that a neutron decays into an electron and a proton and an antineutrino, within about 15 minutes. Another clue comes from the fact that they are able to create muon atoms. Muonic hydrogen has the muon orbiting much closer to the hydrogen than a normal atom. There is also  a process called muon capture. Here a proton and a negative muon join, resulting in the production of a neutron and a neutrino and sometimes a gamma ray. The muon can be drawn in from the atomic orbital to form a neutron inside  the nucleus. This is actually being investigated for the application in radioactive waste disposal and this would allow them to transmute the radioactive element into something else. We must also consider what exactly mass is. If we examine the famous E=mc2 equation, we understand from this that as particles travel at relativistic speeds, their mass will increase. Wal Thornhill pointed out that this is simply an interpretation of the observations from particle accelerators. Here they accelerate protons and electrons in an electric field and notice that they become less responsive to this field. If, as Wal  suggests, these particles are made up of smaller sub particles which also orbit around a central charge, then as the particles accelerate, their orbits will become more and more elliptical as more and more force is applied. This is used in the distortion of this orbit, rather than in the acceleration of the particle itself. So in the case of a muon, might  this still simply be an electron but in a different excited state? Meaning it does not respond to the electric field in the same way as an electron. Did the initial collision cause one of the internal electrons inside the nucleus, to be liberated in this excited state? This state is unstable and this energy is eventually released, and all that remains is the electron. Again, we must come back to the concept that there is something fundamentally wrong with particle physics. This is the tip of the iceberg, and the  fact that they see a discrepancy from their theoretical models with their observations, may indeed open up the avenue for them to explore an alternative to this particle zoo that they have created. Although, I wouldn't be surprised if they simply invent another member of this zoo to fix the problem. That being  said, there is still much work to do in finding a working alternative to all the phenomena we see. SAM is an excellent step in the right direction, but understandably their efforts are focused on the known atoms and explaining all the phenomena, before they then tackle the more exotic phenomena we see. They have already shown that in radioactive decay, there is no need for the neutrino, and a positron can be explained as an electron  moving into the nucleus of the atom. When you strip away what is actually observed in these experiments, there is room for a totally different interpretation of the data. Which may suggest a much simpler, more logical way in which mother nature works, and would remove Feynman's classical quote where he said, “The theory of quantum Electrodynamics describes nature as absurd from the point of view of common sense. And it fully agrees with experiment. So I hope you can accept nature as she is – Absurd.”  Instead, we should view mother nature in a logical hierarchical fashion where everything has a purpose, where less is more and in this case, the removal of the strong nuclear force, once more points to the electrical nature of mother nature.

the most critical test of the electric comet came on July 4th 2005 that was when NASA's Deep Impact probe fired an 800-pound copper projectile at the nucleus of comet Tempel 1 cameras on the probe recorded the event and even the projectile itself contained a camera to transmit data up to the moment of impact as early as 2001 looking ahead to this event electrical theorists Wallis Thornhill began anticipating the surprises in store for comet science on the evening of July 3rd 2005 the day before the encounter the Thunderbolts website published the predictions of Thornhill and his colleagues these predictions would clearly contrast the standard and the electric comet models you as the Deep Impact probe approached temple one key NASA figures gathered in the control room the comet was racing toward the probe at some twenty three thousand miles per hour when the probe launched its copper impactor toward the nucleus if the comet was electrically charged how would the electronics of the impactor respond to the electric field through most of its journey the impacter signal was clear but in the final seconds the signal was indeed disrupted this apparent electrical disturbance was not all that Thornhill predicted he also anticipated an advanced flash ahead of the projectiles impact a uniquely electrical event this is exactly what occurred and the advanced flash left NASA scientists scratching their heads NASA investigators were well aware of the kinetics of impact explosions but would the projectile be striking a solid icy surface or a more loose aggregation of snowy fluff they did not consider the electrical energy of the comet but Thornhill had long predicted the explosion would be greater than any NASA scientists envisioned it seems that the spectacular explosion that followed the impact was the greatest surprise every scientist viewing the live images expressed his astonishment the scientists had expected to peer into a deep hole in a cometary dirty snowball before the Deep Impact vehicle was too far away but the erupting cloud of silica dust was so thick and the explosion so sustained that it completely obscured the local terrain to the electrical theorists the exploding silica cloud was a predictable effect fortunately the Swift satellite provided a view of the comet explosion not just in visible light but in ultraviolet wavelengths which often give the best pointers to electrical events the ultraviolet emissions required temperatures of over 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit the temperatures of the blast will explain why the initial eruption saturated the sensors on the Deep Impact probe calculations based on pixel saturation indicated a minimum initial temperature of the flash at almost 6000 degrees Fahrenheit the saturation means the temperature could have been much higher the first purpose of the Deep Impact mission was to excavate the envisioned subsurface water ice but electrical theorists have consistently predicted little or no water on most comet nuclei nothing approaching the expected levels of water was detected in the exploding cloud a lack or absence of volatile x' can only mean that something is fundamentally wrong in standard comet theory according to the popular model it's the pressurized gases of volatile x' beneath the surface that explained the impressive velocities of cometary Jets as a last resort in the search for water on temple one NASA scientists hope to identify the vents for its Jets the vents were never found when viewed through the lens of standard theory some predictions of the electric model could only appear absurd Thornhill anticipated that the locations of the comet Jets could actually shift as charge redistribution occurred on the nucleus after a significant electrical event confirmation of this prediction came from the Nordic optical telescope in La Palma Spain as released by the observatory two images of the comet before impact and hours later tell the story emphatically 15 hours after the blast new Jets appeared far from the location of the impact itself the Deep Impact mission promised to give us the best images ever of a comet nucleus on the eve of the impact the Thunderbolts group stated the electrically predicted surface features in no uncertain terms the surface of temple 1 astonished the experts expanse of mesas and steep vertical ridges did not belong on a comet and the presence of craters sparked a debate that continues today fortunately scientists had an opportunity for a second look at temple one after the Stardust mission to comet vilt to that probe was redirected to the object of the Deep Impact mission Stardust was then renamed next or new exploration of temple 1 it would give additional views of the comet's surface with the arrival of the next probe old mysteries only grew more perplexing leaving scientists to debate the contradictions of theory even the scaloppine of Mesa walls and nearly vertical ridges something we've mentioned so often in connection with electric discharge machining was duly noted by NASA scientists at least 60 craters were counted though collisions along the Comets path would be exceedingly rare if occurring at all and the surfaces of active comets are rapidly eroded far too rapidly to preserve a record of rare impacts across geologic timescales in fact most astronomers now reject explanation by impact and that includes Michel Ahern the principal investigator of the Deep Impact mission what then was responsible for the pervasive cratering of the temple one surface laboratory experiments have shown that entire fields of craters are readily produced by electric arcs to a negatively charged surface nothing observed on cometary nuclei has contradicted the electrical interpretation here is the most fundamental question one could ask about active comets is electric arcing occurring at the surface if so should we not see this arcing where there is sufficient camera resolution we have a good example in the energetic plumes of Jupiter's moon Isle where the sensors of the Galileo probe were saturated by apparent electric arcs producing blotches of white out the second example came with the Stardust mission and the appearance of small saturation points on the surface of Comet built - but with insufficient resolution to make a definitive case for what the electrical theorists suspected the enigmatic whiteouts on the active surface of temple one where everything the electrical theorists could have asked for and the most prominent were placed exactly where the electric model envisions them he roading the cliffs of Mesa walls and extending the floors of numerous craters and depressions and yet these extensive blotches of whiteout while receiving occasional comments from the specialists have yet to provoke any deeper curiosity as to their cause but now with a second look at temple 1 we can contrast the surface activity of the comet under two different circumstances deep impact occurred just one day before the comet reached perihelion or its closest approach to the Sun but the Stardust next emission arrived 34 days after perihelion as the comet retreated from the Sun and the electrical activity of the Sun itself was far below its activity at the time of deep impact on July 2nd 2005 two-and-a-half days before deep impact the space weather website reported a remarkable surge in sunspot appearance a direct indicator of surging solar activity an active Sun versus a quiet Sun for temple 1 this means different levels of proton bombardment a couple of days after the ejected particles left the solar surface the contrast is remarkable the more active comet presents an abundance of whiteouts the less active almost none NASA scientists originally estimated that the temple one nucleus lost about a third of a meter in depth with each orbit but the electric model emphasizes selective and focused excavation the new look at temple 1 showed that the most prominent Mesa cliff had been dramatically excavated the Mesa was an estimated 15 meters high and it had retreated some 50 meters the most dramatic change on temple one occurred precisely where the pixel saturation was the most dense the only remaining plausible explanation for pixel saturation on the more active comet is electrical erosion NASA scientists also say that existing craters were extended between the two visits three craters close to the dominant Mesa had been further excavated to form a single trench electric arcs extend crater floors and erode the ridges of mesas and elevated terrain the typical signature of both is the scalloping effect of rotating arcs and it is no surprise to the electrical theorists that these processes energize a comet's Jets in fact almost all of the Jets of Temple won when captured in its less active phase are said to have emanated from the erosion of a prominent scalloped cliff selective erosion is a trademark of electric discharge machining before the Deep Impact projectile was fired at the comet scientists were confident it would strike a dirty snowy surface penetrating well below the surface to excavate deep material that's how the mission would expose the primordial stuff of Comet creation what would this deep crater look like of course if the projectile struck a rock or discharged above the surface in an electrical event the target area might look a lot different then the removed material would be silicate dust and debris but with very little penetration beneath the surface to facilitate the investigation after a subsurface explosion the Deep Impact probe targeted the space between two well identified craters so in the return to Temple one mission scientists knew exactly where to look but almost nothing could be seen and certainly there was no resemblance to the deep crater the scientists had envisioned to identify the crater location the scientists published a view of the region with a circle of arrows around the impact site how are we to understand the absence of a deep crater on this question the investigation appeared to move into weird and theory defying science a typical comet's gravity is perhaps one billionth that of Earth mere walking speed would be sufficient to escape the nucleus altogether how would accepted Theory allow material exploding from the comet at thousands of miles per hour to return to its finite point of departure and to refill the crater in an electrically neutral environment it seems that nothing less than a miracle was required with a lot of material that went up and came back down a key to our understanding of the deep impact events is water production in the coma of an active comet abundant water or hydroxyl in the coma of temple was readily confirmed the NASA investigator saw only trivial levels of water on the surface according to the scientific reports the observed jet and coma activity of the comet would require 200 times more exposed water ice on the surface than was actually detected this fact could only accentuate the absence of any vents to the previously supposed pressure chambers beneath the surface no theoretically acceptable cause could be found for the energies of the comet Jets and nothing was observed that could account for the abundant hydroxyl or water in the coma but this dilemma is removed by the electric comet model the model explains the absence of water the energies of the Jets and the absence of vents to subsurface chambers and the presence of hydroxyl and water in the coma but not as a general rule on the surface or beneath the surface is a prediction of the electric model the evidence points to high-energy electrical exchange electrically sputtered silicates from a negatively charged comet nucleus transacting with the charged particles of the solar wind water production through the electrochemistry of charge redistribution the paradox of trivial surface ice on temple one then finds a coherent explanation the surface ice was produced electrically in the coma meager amounts of this water ice later drifted from the coma to the surface condensing as a few shallow patches of frost it's the hydroxyl radical that gives us the persuasive answer investigators thought they saw an injection of water into the coma from the nucleus several days after the eruption of dust had returned to normal but that conclusion arose from an unsupported assumption based on data from the Swift satellite investigators from the UK and US reported a spectacular increase in water content within the coma but that increase did not begin until five days after deep impact when the normal production of sixteen thousand tons per day increased by at least two hundred and fifty percent continuing for five more days as reported the rise in water content of the coma all occurred with no increase in dust content no increase in dust that's the fact that precludes the investigators interpretation comet outbursts are never dust free in electrical terms the rapid increase in hydroxyl or water would predictably come days after deep impact and this is why the comet's x-ray emissions continued to grow above the nucleus highly energetic explicitly electrical events created a flood of x-ray emission and the water of the coma was the byproduct of that electrical exchange not the cause a reconsideration of water production in its direct link to a comet's x-ray production is now essential taken as a whole the message of deep impact is remarkably consistent but why did the crucial findings all come as a surprise to comet scientists and what does it mean that these surprises were the explicit predictions of the electric model Deep Impact provided us with a stunning confirmation of the electric comet confirming as well the larger electrical environment of the Sun and the implications don't end there as the dominoes fall under the vision of an electrified heliosphere the space sciences will be forever changed

Several years ago, on the planet Mars, NASA's rover Curiosity discovered something so strange it forced planetary scientists to begin rewriting Martian history, a process that continues today. The anomaly was found in Gale crater, a more than 150 kilometer wide so-called impact basin. At the center of the crater is Aeolus Mons, also called Mount Sharp, a central  peak reaching Heights of about 18,000 feet. Among the layered minerals in this terrain the most curious of all the Rover discovered is Tridymite, an extremely rare mineral which only forms at super-hot temperatures and  which is linked to volcanism on Earth. At the time of the discovery in 2016, NASA scientist Richard Morris stated, “It was the last mineral we expected to see. If this stands the test of time, it has a lot of implications for how Mars evolved. We may have to rethink a few things.” The reason tridymite was the last mineral NASA scientists expected to find on Mars is simple. The red planet is not believed to have the kind of dynamic subsurface plates that have always been thought necessary to create volcanic activity. A similar dilemma was presented when Mars was recently found to have significant seismic activity; a complete surprise to planetary scientists. Indeed both conundrums reveal the striking limitations of the standard theoretical toolkit in planetary science, including plate tectonic theory. Today, the discovery of tridymite on Mars remains problematic. A recent ScienceAlert article noted, “Although Mars shows extensive evidence of past basaltic volcanic activity in some regions, the once putatively water-filled Gale crater is not one of those regions, leading scientists to  puzzle about how the mineral came to be there.” A new paper published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters attempts to resolve the puzzle. A team of investigators has proposed the ad hoc hypothesis that billions of years ago, a magmatic chamber existed underneath  Gale crater at a time when the crater is believed to have contained a substantial lake. This chamber, the paper suggests, remained dormant for an unusually long time, eventually exploding massively, releasing silica-rich ash in the form of tridymite which then fell back down into the waters of Gale crater. One basis the scientists cite for this speculation is the extremely focused location of the anomalous tridymite. Mars geologist Kirsten Siebach states, “We argue that because we only saw this mineral once, and it was highly concentrated in a single layer, the volcano probably erupted at the same time the lake was there. Although the specific sample we analyzed was not exclusively volcanic ash, it was ash that had been weathered and sorted by water.” Of course the investigators have no awareness of Electric Universe theory, including the hypothesis that Mars and other rocky planets in the solar system were ravaged by high energy electrical discharge. As explained in the feature length documentary film “The Lightning-Scarred Planet Mars,” this hypothesis can explain countless Martian anomalies, including its dozens of weird geologic formations. Such as frequently bizarre cratering; it's long unexplained hemispheric dichotomy; its weird networks of rills and trenches; and the stupendous Valles Marineris, a vast Canyon which stretches over 3,000 miles across the Martian surface. The question is, can very powerful lightning produce tridymite? Tridymite is a crystalline form of quartz which forms under low pressures at extremely high temperatures. Consider the relationship between tridymite and another high temperature silicate called lechatelierite which is a form of silica glass found in lightning strike features. In fact tridymite has indeed been found as a product of lightning. In the book “The Data of Geochemistry” tridymite was reported as the product of lightning on a roofing slate. No volcanism required. The very focused and limited range of tridymite's presence at Gale crater's central peak should be expected if it was produced by a stupendous lightning bolt. It must also be mentioned that craters with central peaks have been commonly observed for many decades in experiments with electrical discharge to solid surfaces. It's also important to consider another type of mineral on Mars known as perchlorate. The mineral is found in such abundance on Mars that some have considered its potential as a health hazard to future astronauts. Various perchlorates are known to form by electrochemical processes or by electrolysis, and it's been discovered that lightning strikes can produce perchlorate in the presence of chlorite. Amazingly, perchlorates are 10,000 times more abundant on Mars than sands or soils. Again, we're left to question the potential for meaningful progress in astronomy and all of the theoretical sciences when the major surprises fail to force any real reassessment of consensus  theory. Institutionalized science does indeed rewrite history through ad hoc provisions of theory, but always in a fashion that never challenges the underlying  paradigms. A beautiful parallel to the Martian tridymite mystery can be found in just one of the endless puzzles in comet science. The Electric Universe has always stated that our solar system's comets, asteroids and meteoroids were formed in the  same epoch of planetary instability that produced the dramatic geology of the rocky planets. Of course from this perspective, comets are not the primordial dirty snowballs of standard theory. Comet nuclei should appear exactly as they have in every instance they've been photographed: rocky, desiccated and displaying extreme planetary geology. If these bodies were indeed electrically blasted from the surfaces of planets, then of course we expect to find minerals that form at super-hot temperatures. This prediction was confirmed over a decade and a half ago when NASA's Stardust Mission returned dust samples from the comet Wild-2. When scientists on Earth tested the material, what they found was so unexpected, they initially thought that the early sample may have been contaminated by the spacecraft. Rather than the expected ancient interstellar grains, the Wild-2 dust grains were much larger than expected and contained minerals such as anorthite and diopside which require temperatures of thousands of degrees. NASA curator Michael Zolensky said of the discovery, “That's a big surprise. People thought comets would just be cold stuff that formed out...where things are very cold...It was kind of a shock to not just find one but several of these, which implies they are pretty common in the comet.” Like the aforementioned efforts to fit the Martian tridymite enigma into the conventional framework of our solar system's four and a half billion year history, comet scientists responded to the shocking Wild-2 discoveries with similar ad hoc speculations. These range from the comet forming very close to the Sun, then being hurled into the outer solar system, to explosive collisions in the early solar system and ironically, even lightning in the primordial nebular cloud. Again, the alleged causative events are placed billions of years in the past and are always restricted to the unproven and very limited processes in  the standard theoretical toolkit. A recurring statement I've made over many years is that the Electric Universe community can only hope for a fair and thorough hearing in the court of scientific investigation. One cannot claim that this hearing  has occurred unless, or until, institutionalized science actually tests the predictive theories of the Electric Universe. Why this has taken so long to happen, may itself prove to be a mystery for future generations to ponder. [Music] 
”Although its effects can be measured with precision, nobody knows what gravity is. It is also the only force man cannot yet control. Despite the law it is supposed to follow, it often simply does not. Even here on Earth, let alone further out in space, gravity is full of anomalies.” So said Dwardu Cardona, an old world electrical engineer, a towering intellect, major author, and good friend. Globular clusters are a particularly difficult problem for a gravity-only cosmology. According to current understanding of gravitational dynamics, they should not be where we see them, and their spheroidal configuration defies the expectations of Standard Theory. Not to mention that they sometimes form a ring-like crown around the axis on each side of a galactic plane. Quote, “A globular cluster is a spheroidal conglomeration of stars. Globular clusters are bound together by gravity, with a higher concentration of stars toward their centers. They can contain anywhere from tens of thousands to many millions of member stars. The origin of globular clusters and their role in galactic evolution are unclear.” End quote. Today cosmologists continue to wrestle with problems posed by exotic structures in space. These appear to mock Newton's elementary laws. In their attempt to account for unexpected galactic motions, astrophysicists have invoked invisible entities and agencies: black holes, dark matter, and dark energy, which are imagined to be far more powerful than anything actually observed. In stepping out on this lily pad, they have even speculated that as much as 99 percent of the matter in the universe is dark, and can be measured only by apparent gravitational  effects. Because dark matter and dark energy can't be detected, they are a reusable blank  check. A blank check that conventional theorists can use to postpone the bankruptcy of a thoroughly falsified paradigm. It was this resort to unknown matter that caused the notable astronomer Halton Arp to observe in his book “Seeing Red” that quote, “... past 90 percent it begins to make observations irrelevant.” End quote.  You think? I would posit that, past 50 percent or less, would be a more realistic intellectual barrier. Arp: “Please don't tell me the emperor is naked.” In stark plain language, astronomers and astrophysicists that believe this, should stop taking money from public institutions and get a real job making some valid contribution to society. Flipping burgers would be a major upgrade in terms of service to mankind. With our own galaxy, the Milky Way, globular clusters or spheroidal configurations of stars such as M15, are included as a part of the difficulty. By what mechanical magic does gravity hold millions of stars together as a sphere, rather than the familiar disk of more feasible gravitational orbits and models? Gravitational spherical configurations of stars simply ‘hanging in space’ are absurd. Orbits around a center of mass just don't work either for a globular cluster. There would be orbital chaos. Think about it. The problem is heightened by the fact that M15 is one of about 150 known globular clusters associated with the Milky Way. Strictly speaking, they are not a part  of our galaxy, as traditionally defined. Rather they appear close to the core of the galaxy as a kind of halo above and below the center plane of galactic rotation. Yet, astrophysicists rarely acknowledge the dynamical problems this creates. Theory states that clusters above the plane must move on orbital paths around the center of the dynamic system as a whole. And, in completing an orbit, each will intersect the galactic plane twice. Such orbits for a three-dimensional structure would have orbits crisscrossing and even in reverse. There would be numerous flyby interactions that would induce tidal distortions and disrupt the cluster. Of course, another concern is that the structure of the halo could neither be formed nor maintained. The problem was noted by physicist C. Johnson of the University of Chicago. Quote, “It is almost like physicists have been assuming globular clusters just hover there like a swarm of bees. But that wouldn't happen. They could NOT  just follow elliptical orbits above or below the galactic plane. Basic gravitational theory insists that their elliptical paths pass through the Galactic Plane, because the two halves of any path must be on opposite sides of that Plane.” End quote. Johnson suggests that something is missing and not a small piece of the puzzle. Quote, “It would appear that either our understanding of the laws of physics is sadly lacking, or our understanding of the geometry of the situation is greatly in error. The commonly accepted view of a Halo of ancient, stable Globular Clusters hovering around the core of the Galaxy, like a swarm of bees, is just not something compatible with our current understanding of the laws of physics. Clearly, further research is necessary.” End quote. And thereby Johnson illustrates the real problem. It is not more research that is needed, but an open-minded paradigm shift to Electric Universe construction. But heaven save us from that. Anything  but that. Apparently the favorite prayer of astrophysicists would be quote “Dear God. Please don't bring a paradigm shift during my tenure.” The solution of course is that galaxies are electrical structures whereby the various components revolve around the minor axis, never crossing the central plane. The same quandary applies to the relative motions of stars within each cluster. And while Johnson accurately describes the gravitational dynamic, the rule he applies is a formula for chaos. As any gravitational simulation will clearly demonstrate, it would quickly lead to some stars being accelerated out of the system, while others would lose energy and fall to an orbit closer in. Over time, the globular clusters would largely just evaporate, shrink and condense down to ... what? But, from the Electric Universe vantage point, it is not unthinkable that the stars of globular clusters are just hanging there with respect to the cluster's own center of gravity and any cluster plane that may be derived or defined. In the Electric Universe model of stellar  composition and energy, stars are concentrations of highly positively charged material. For globular clusters, such a collection of stars with no other external distorting forces in play, might indeed become a stable ‘ball-of-stars’ formation. In fact, the new view of the universe provides many examples of star-sized masses, even  galactic clusters in symmetrical arrangements that gravitational theorists never dreamt of, including polar alignments. And as for the spheroidal form of globular clusters, the cosmic electricians in the Electric Universe paradigm suggest that the best analogy may come from something as unfamiliar to astronomers as ball lightning, whatever enigmatic material that is composed of. But that is a different anomaly subject. I offer another analogy: Mainstream cosmologists are playing in a children's sandbox instead of on the beach. Our ponderous university and tenure system is suffering from all but paralyzing arthritic inertia. I know, I have talked with some of them and they say they teach what they have been taught and  cannot teach what they haven't learned or don't know. I suggest, given the past track record of institutionalized science, this may border on being a cop-out and being intellectually irresponsible. There is no independent global agency that is looking at the big picture and alerting the university science departments that, given the nature and history of scientific revolutions (which are always vigorously opposed and overdue), it is time to consider a paradigm change. Time to explore alternate thinking, and seek and invite serious challengers to present their arguments. Usually, any  one professor that might raise the alarm, gets marginalized. Just like a heretic in a religious organization. Hmm... Halton Arp certainly suffered this fate. Of course institutional science is a religion, just organized differently from most of the others. The word ‘religion’ comes from ‘roots’, meaning to bind together with logic or reason. Thus I call what we have now, by the term ’scientism’ which is a very powerful force that, in the pertinent area of origins and unfolding of the universe, prevails over those based on sacred writings and mythology. But this popularly supported  dominance doesn't make it right. The solution is, guess what, intellectual responsibility. [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info In part 1 of this presentation, Thunderbolts colleague Andrew Hall began exploring some of the best case studies of electrical scarring on planet Earth. The features don't seem to fit with any standard geological process but as Hall explained, they do show the expected characteristics produced by electrical discharges. Today, Hall continues his presentation with a focus on the stunning geology in the American Southwest. In part one of 'Lightning-Scarred Earth', Shiprock was presented as an example of a pinnacle created by lightning. Fulgarites are created when lightning strikes and current penetrates the ground, leaving a hollow tube of glassy, fused material behind. Current from the lightning vaporizes and extracts material in its path, while its heat vitrifies the surrounding soil, leaving behind glassy tubes. Based on its features, it's proposed here that Shiprock is a standing fulgarite, created by lightning so powerful and sustained that the material began to recombine in the current as it was pulled from the ground, leaving behind a pinnacle of fused material instead of a hollow tube. Once material recombines, it's no longer charged and attracted to the lightning channel, so is left behind, its ionic makeup altered by the current and heat. The morphology of Shiprock displays this very well with columns of fused rocks surrounding an inner core of minette, ionically altered material pulled from the ground by the flow of current. Surrounding the pinnacle are minette dikes radiating away in a star pattern. Minette is high in potassium and low in silica content. It contains high volumes of orthoclase and biotite. Both are minerals with high metal content, such as potassium, iron, and sodium. Silica dioxide will readily exchange oxygen with metals, such as those found in the orthoclase and biotite when sufficient heat is applied. The prevalence of potassium and other metals crystallized in Minette and its under- saturation of silica is evidence of the reduction taking place as it was formed. This suggests that the lightning forming it was positive lightning, which is the type of powerful lightning seen striking from the stratospheric anvil clouds in thunderstorms. Electrons and negative ions in the ground pulled out by the positively charged lightning left behind a concentration of positively charged material which was not attracted and drawn away. The dikes and inner core of the pinnacle show the path of the current being drawn to the lightning discharge. Following the lightning strike that formed the pinnacle, the area was left with a net positive charge, which attracted a secondary ground discharge, or arc blast that emanated from a different discharge process. This secondary discharge will be explored more in the future, but it's worth mentioning now because it left a magnificent Lichtenberg pattern across the ground, unique to the area immediately surrounding Shiprock. The next series of images show the evolution in the magnitude of this type of formation. These are all examples from the Four Corners region in Northern Arizona. First, when lightning similar in magnitude to what we see today strikes the ground, it sweeps surrounding surface sand to it, drawing it to the lightning channel and creating a shallow crater. Examples of this were shown in part one, where lightning created small craters with a pile of sand left behind in a small cone. Again, these are not anthills, although they could easily be mistaken for them on cursory examination. There are no ants, no opening in the mound, and it's dusted over the top with sand fused into pebbles. The pebbles rest in a thin layer over the top, like sprinkles on an ice cream cone. And beneath it is powder-fine sand. The top layer was formed from sand pulled into the lightning channel and fused into pebbles by heat, then dropped back on top of the mound when the flame extinguished. They bear the same character as the Minette material in Shiprock's center and dike formations. All of the mound material and surrounding sand measures high in pH. The following images show buttes at various stages of growth. The first exhibits an up-welling of Minette. The second and third images show the broken remains of the sheath, and the last image shows the dark Minette partially surrounded by the lighter rock sheath. Another type of lightning-formed butte has a different morphology that appears to be created by a negative cloud-to-ground lightning-- the type of lightning that emanates from the belly of a thunderstorm. Because the Earth is generally a negatively charged body, at least in terms of ground charge, it forms a double layer at the interface with the atmosphere. When a thunderstorm forms and the electric field strengthens, positively charged ions in the atmospheric zone of the double layer collect above the ground beneath the storm. Before negative cloud-to- ground lightning strikes, it pulls this material into positive ionic streamers that reach up to connect with the electron avalanche produced by the cloud. When the streamer and avalanche leader connect, a circuit is completed and current discharges through the channel, electrons flowing to ground and positive ions flowing up to the clouds. The magnetic field created by the current wraps tightly around the channel, compressing it to a narrow path in what is known as a Z-pinch. 'Z-pinch' has been demonstrated in the lab by simply passing current through an aluminum can, with the electrodes connected at the top and bottom. The resulting pinch crushes the can into an hourglass shape. In the huge primordial storms that we theorize occurred in Earth's past, such lightning and pinch effects resulted in huge amounts of positive ionic material being swept to the lightning channel with such extreme force it sometimes created supersonic winds. Fulgamites formed by sustained, giant cloud-to-ground arcs display the effects of discharging current, accumulation of ionic dust, Z-pinch, and the supersonic winds and shockwaves they produced. The images presented show the progression of such an event. First, the strike forms a raised platform, with a shallow crater in the center where the lightning created an electrode spot. The rim of the crater is material swept inward by ionic winds and fused. There is a road cutting through the crater in the first image to give some perspective of how large this feature is. These images are from Arizona, near Pastora Mountain in the Four Corners region. A more sustained strike begins to accumulate neutralizing material on the spot, forming a flat-topped dome, like a pancake. As the material accumulates, the pancake grows to a mesa-type structure, held together in a round form by the magnetic pinch. In the next phase of growth, the mesa grows taller and the inflow winds begin to reach Mach speeds, creating shockwaves that mold the rim material into triangular standing waveforms. A detailed discussion of this shock wave and the triangular buttress formations they create is presented more fully in previous articles on Arc Blast. As neutralized material builds, the anode spot the lightning connects with is at the top of the mesa and rises with it. The strength of the pitch narrows the top forming a cone, and new regions of windblown, fused and shock-shaped buttresses form rims outside the older rim. The difference between lightning- formed pinnacles like Shiprock and the broad mountain forms shown in these images seems to be polarity in the lightning. This interpretation is preliminary, but it appears that positive lightning burrows into the ground to connect with negative ionic matter beneath the surface, whereas negative lightning attracts surface winds and dust to it to build a mountain. Positive lightning raises a narrow pinnacle of negatively charged material that boils up from the ground with dikes which display the current path through the subsurface. Not much material is drawn to it from the surroundings, except for the sheath of rock it forms around it. Negative lightning connects with pools and streamers of positively charged matter at the surface and pulls huge amounts of airborne dust to create a dome with hardened, buttressed rims. In both cases, mountains can form around them due to ambient winds and blowing dust. Positive arc fulgamites can form monoclines along the dikes if ambient, supersonic winds strike them to create a standing wave, where dust piles into long, linear ranges of triangular waveforms. The last image of above, taken at Comb Ridge monocline in northern Arizona, shows where fulgamites and dikes are exposed in the monocline. These protrusions created a shock wave in Mach speed ambient winds that formed a linear standing wave, against which the monocline was formed like a dune, as blowing dust accumulated. There are several monoclines on the Colorado Plateau that exhibit the same or similar features. Negative arc fulgamites create their own winds, bringing dust to pile against them from all directions, and if powerful enough, form standing shockwaves that generate buttresses in a ring around the base. The circular craters and mesas in the images were formed by lightning while the mountain was expanded by wind-borne dust accumulating around them. There are several examples of mountains with these features in the Four Corners region. Mountains are a misunderstood feature of the planet. Geological concepts are based on rocks forming deep in Earth's crust and being exposed by erosion and tectonic motions, entailing of course, hundreds of millions of years. It's a very complex process that has not, and cannot, be witnessed or confirmed by experiment. Mountain formation by wind and electric discharge, however, can be witnessed in nature. Sand dunes are a prime example. Mountains can also be produced in laboratories. So can rock. It happens when slag is produced from welding, ore and metal processing, or from chemical reactions like cement. Atomic and molecular bonding is an electrical process -- the exchange and sharing of electrons. Electricity and wind is a far more plausible mechanism for mountain building than what is proposed by the consensus theories. Especially since the actions of wind and lightning that formed mountains on the Earth can be seen in any thunderstorm. One only needs to extrapolate the forces and energies involved to what they would have been when Earth was in a much larger, stronger electrical environment. Amplify the electric field of a thunderstorm by orders of magnitude, and it will produce an ionized atmosphere, screaming with supersonic winds, ionized dust, and incredible discharges of lightning that dwarf what we experience today. For examples, we need only to look at our neighboring planets. These conditions exist on Jupiter, Saturn and Venus. Why would Earth be any different? Thank you.

There are many names associated with the development of the electric and plasma universe. Some get more recognition than others. In this episode, I want to cover someone who is often cited by the late Wal Thornhill, but probably is a name that you are not familiar with. Charles Edward Rose Bruce was a quite remarkable man who saw a deep connection between sparks, discharges, lightning and the cosmos at large. Who was he and what remarkable insights did  he provide? He was born the son of a tailor and graduated from the University of Edinburgh with first class honors in mathematics and natural philosophy. He then joined the Electrical Research Association in Leatherhead, England. Bruce's early years at the Electrical Research Association was spent working on the analysis of oil-based circuit breakers. He published a sequence of papers on the subject, including one that won The Institution of Electrical Engineers’ Kelvin premium award. This helped keep the ERA at the leading edge of the rapidly growing circuit breaker technology. Then in 1939, he shifted his attention to lightning. Two years later, he would publish a paper simply titled, “The Lightning Discharge” which would end up being heavily cited and once more win him the Kelvin premium award. His contributions to the subject include the significant strengthening of the electrical gradient, known to occur in lightning strikes,  as well as a demonstration that the grounding of transmission lines would be counter- productive. After attending a lecture on astrophysics at the Edinburgh University in 1941, he became very interested in exploring this, together with his understanding of electricity. During this lecture, the lecturer referred to a solar prominence which reached a height of 1 million kilometers in an  hour. Charles Bruce quickly deduced that its velocity of propagation was almost exactly that of a lightning leader stroke and that, since it moved like lightning it probably was lightning of some  form. Soon after this, he developed a theory that solar prominences consisted of electrical discharges in plasma, rather than that of moving solar matter. He would go on to publish over a hundred papers concerning the electrical basis of various cosmological phenomena. In 1946 and 1947 he was elected as a fellow of The Institute of Physics and The Institute of Electrical Engineers. Despite this, his work would be largely ignored by mainstream science. In 1944, he produced a privately published monograph titled, “A New Approach in Astrophysics and Cosmogony”. It was spurred on by a lack of success in mainstream science at the time, to explain the major phenomena in astrophysics. He saw that gravitational masses, like stars, were centers of energy liberation and also the origin  of high-speed electrically charged particles, which over time, results in the formation of huge  charged atmospheres, so that masses beyond a certain size become centers of extensive and mainly radial electric fields. These naturally give rise to conduction processes tending to neutralize the currents. It is the resulting electrical discharges which determine the nature and direction of universal evolution. He still viewed stars as being composed of material that at the heart is powered by nuclear reactions. This engine would provide the separation of charge and lead to the discharge events. This would then be the start of a new sequence, the atmosphere condensing on a reduced scale of aggregation which in turn would  become the center of an extensive radial electric field. He saw the same mechanism happening in nebulae, stars, and planets. Now this is very different in some respects from the Electric Sun model we have today, but you will recognize many similarities. He points out that it is no coincidence that the photosphere has the appearance, temperature, and spectrum of an electric arc. A large number of arcs occur in parallel. These quickly result in neutralization of the accumulated space charge in their neighborhood and go out. These are therefore not stable discharges, but are more like a transient spark. In his view it is the coming and going of these discharges which accounts for the observed granulation of the solar surface. In his model, sunspots are explained because those huge discharges drain away the current from the neighboring photospheric arc channels and extinguish those  arcs. He saw that there was much evidence in support of his model. This included solar flares which, at the time, had been shown to have circular magnetic fields surrounding them. He estimated that the current of these was about 10 to the 14 amps. These give rise to a broadening of the hydrogen alpha lines due to the Zeeman effect. The variation of these line widths follows the rapid rise of the current in the flare to a maximum, followed by the slower fall, analogous to what is observed in terrestrial lightning current waves. The Crab Nebula’s filamentary structure provides striking visual evidence of the origin of this structure in electrical discharges. The  light from the Crab Nebula also shows substantial polarization which has allowed them to partially map the magnetic fields in the Nebula. The result of this mapping is that the field is such as would be observed if the filaments carried currents. Novae show light curves that have a sudden onset followed by a slower decline. This is characteristic of an electrical discharge. The rapid increase in emission line width in the Nova spectrum is generally believed to be a Doppler broadening but is also readily explained as Zeeman broadening. In 1958, Bruce presented one of his papers at the second USAF conference on atmospheric electricity. In it he pointed out that there should exist galaxies which are radiating an inordinate amount of energy, which should correspond to the naked-eye phase of a Nova outburst. And this peak-current phase of a galactic discharge should last for millions of years. Four years later, the first quasar was discovered, and in due course their lifetimes were recognized to be millions to tens of millions of years. Much of this work was driven by his desire to understand lightning. Based on his extensive studies of atmospheric electrostatic field building and electrical discharge characteristics, he developed a new theory of discharge propagation for the breakdown of electrostatic fields in cosmological atmospheres, which is different  from normal long spark or terrestrial lightning discharges. The main difference is categorized by the temperature in the leader stroke, which for cosmological atmospheres, would be of the order of eight million degrees. In long cosmical electric discharges, a point is reached at which a radical change will occur in the whole propagation  process. In the discharge channel, a jet of gas will be generated, which will flow along the axis of the channel towards its advancing head. As the temperature of  the channel rises, so also will the velocity of the jet. At a certain point, the velocity of the hot gas will exceed that of the normal process of voltage breakdown in a hydrogen atmosphere. From that point onwards, the propagation will depend on the jet of hot gas. And the  velocity will depend on its temperature. These velocities could exceed 4,000 kilometers  per second. In this paper on the extension of atmospheric to space electricity, he points out that  there are two thermometers which can be used to estimate the temperature of the electrical discharges, whether in a laboratory, atmospheric or cosmic. The first derives from an effect which was first emphasized by Velaski in 1937. The pressure in the actual regions of an electric discharge is increased by an amount proportional to the product of the current and the current density as a result of the movement of the conducting particles in  the discharge's own magnetic field. In an electric arc the current density increases at and towards the electrode spots. Therefore, pressure gradients are set up which give rise to the anode and cathode jets. Their velocity will be that of the sound in the gas. If it can be determined, we  will have a measure of the temperature. Applied to the lightning discharge, the theory explains the existence of metallic lines in the spectrum of the discharge up to the heights of two meters above the ground. And applied to an arc weld, it explains the physical basis of arc welding. The second thermometer derives from an observed relationship between the level of excitation and the discharge temperature. If, for example, the level of excitation observed is nine electron- volts, then the discharge temperature will be 10,000 times more in Kelvin, so in this case 9,000 Kelvin. Based on this, he outlined that discharges in cosmic sources should be characterized by the following: rate of propagation; the speed of breakdown is proportional to the breakdown field and the mean free path; the limiting field is proportional to the gas pressure; and the mean free path is inversely proportional to it. So, there is no resultant dependence on the rate of propagation on the pressure. It may be possible for the discharge to generate a plasma jet with a velocity higher than the rate of voltage breakdown. In this case, the discharge may then propagate at the plasma velocity. Magnetic fields will be associated with a flow of current in a discharge. The fields are circular around the axis of the discharge. This can be recognized by the polarization and Zeeman broadening of the radiation emitted from within  them. Pinch effect. The conducting particles in an electric discharge are within the discharge's own magnetic field which exert upon them a centripetal force proportional to the current and the current density. This results in an increase of the pressure towards the axis of the discharge. Plasma jets. If either the current or the current density varies along the channel of a discharge, there will be a corresponding gradient of the axial pressure. This creates a jet of hot gas, or plasma, which will be accelerated along the discharge. This is the origin of the anode- and cathode-jets observed in the laboratory discharges. The speed of the jet is limited to the speed of sound in the medium of which it is composed. In ionized hydrogen, the sonic speed is 12 kilometers per second at 10,000 Kelvin. It varies as the square root of the absolute temperature. The velocities observed in the discharge plasmas may be interpreted in terms of the temperature of the discharge. Current waveform. The current in an electrical discharge builds up rapidly to a peak value and then decays on a slower time  scale. Anomalous waveforms, sometimes shown by high current lightning strokes, arise from  the self-extinction by the pinch effect. Radiation of atmospherics. A lightning flash or other discharge radiates atmospherics of a characteristic waveform. Parallel discharges will attract one  another. Balls of hot plasma escape at sudden bends in the discharge. The bends constitute holes in the magnetic field of the discharge through which the gas compressed by the field, can escape. His many years of research on atmospheric astrophysics convinced him that not only was the Sun dominated by electrical discharge, but the universe was so to speak, all electric. And that the electric fields and their breakdown in electrical discharges account for the observed phenomena, and accelerate  the process of universal evolution from the universe to galaxies, from galaxies to  stars, and from stars to planets. He viewed atmospheric astrophysics as merely  an extension of atmospheric electricity. In his view, these would be a far  better explanation for the existence of magnetic fields, relativistic electrons, gas jets, the formation of spiral arms, stellar nova, etc. He noted that many phenomena seen above the surface of stars, can be explained as analogues, but on a much larger scale, of lightning discharges observed in the atmosphere of Earth. Although Bruce felt that the charging mechanism for each process was contained locally, he thought that it was not a vital precondition of the recognition of electrical discharges as observed phenomena. As Professor Birch remarked, to deny the existence of what cannot be explained would leave very little work to do. He felt it very probable that the charging mechanism for each phenomenon was the same: a collision between solid particles. The asymmetrical interaction of particles of similar materials leads to charge segregation. [Music] 
Electric Universe 2012 Conference THE HUMAN STORY Seeking The Third Story David Talbott is the founder and director of The Thunderbolts Project. His roots in the catastrophic movement reach back to the 60's, but it was his book 'The Saturn Myth' from 1980 which helped inspire the work of several others now joined in the collaborative endeavor. He is coauthor with Wal Thornhill of the 'Electric Universe', the Book. His work is the subject of a riveting DVD series, 'Symbols of an Aliens Sky'. Two episodes have been published so far, we should be seeing parts of the episode on Mars tomorrow evening and highly recommend that you be present. I think it should be apparent to all that this conference, 'The Human Story' could never have taken place without his inspiration and tireless efforts not to mention his extraordinary ability to galvanize those around him so that to be delegated responsibility by David sounds like a fun and worthwhile thing. David is a muse in chief for this movement. His gentle manner and style combined with a steely passion for the truth is an inspiration to us all and to a new public. Here with talk intriguingly titled 'Seeking the Third Story' is David Talbott. - The Electric Universe - SEEKING THE THIRD STORY I had the interesting experience of mentioning to several people that I'm going to be talking on this subject and more often than not someone would respond, well, I wanna see that talk. Which I find humorous because, well, I haven't told you anything about it yet and as it turns out they do seem to have a sense as to what this means that there really is something wrong with our cultural and scientific environment today and there is a growing yearning for a deeper understanding, a deeper and more clear, and more coherent, and unified, and non contradictory, and non fragmented way of seeing the Universe. Now, it happened today, it happens so often that the first question is, Who Cares? And I can't tell you how many times I've heard that from folks. Because a person with the reporter's eye to a story, for example, will always be thinking in those terms. And it doesn't necessarily register, it may actually on the first words that are used to express the meaning of the Electric Universe, it can seem rather remote but if a person is intellectually alive and has any attention span, let's say, the Electric Universe is going to meet that person at a level of very deep interest. A lot of the entry with respect to what is going on in this group is related to the experience of meaning and inspiration, out of what is being learned here. And that comes clearly from the sense that the truth is somehow shining through, true. Something enduring, something lasting, something that could affect us very deeply. Now, I'm going to show you a brief clip from a future episode of 'Symbols of an Aliens Sky'. How did human history begin? The evidence may seem too complex for generalization. Yet all of history can be stated as just two stories. First came the story of mythology filled with cosmic dramas and celestial wonders. We lived in the presence of the gods. It was the gods who determined the fate of the world, demanding allegiance, even as they called humans to sacrifice. The gods were unpredictable, when angry they went to war, or they destroyed their own creation. Over time, however, man's quest for deeper meaning in the myths ignited sparks of spiritual awakening and it was from these sparks that the great religions arose. But all the world's religions shared a taproot in mythology. And not one freed itself entirely from the momentum of the first story. The second story arose from doubt, as philosophers, poets and naturalists began to lose faith in the myths, and some stopped believing in the gods altogether. That was because direct experience, under a familiar and highly predictable sky, gave no support to the archaic myths. Skepticism inspired closer attention to nature, the essential requirement for the rise of Science and Technology that would change the world. Thus the heroic completion of the second story, rational science rising to vanquish myth and magic. And so the full sweep of human history comes down to just two stories in competition, a cliche, Science vs Myth and Religion. Well into the 20th century it seemed that we were forced to choose. But if you have wondered, could the myths harbor a truth that we have missed? Something yet to be discovered, a message for science, hidden in the myths and symbols of deepest antiquity. The point I want to make is that seeking a third story requires us to reconsider two stories that dominated human imagination across the whole sweep of human history. Two stories. Now, it was my role to investigate the origins of myth, and to pursue that subject I had to come to grips with an unexplained mystery. What was the mythic age of gods and wonders remembered around the world? Every culture said the same thing, the gods ruled for a time then they went away. This age of gods and wonders is punctuated by disaster, and in the end gods pass away or perhaps they're translated into remote stars or planets. Is that just imagination from one culture to another unrelated to anything actual, actually experienced. I had the benefit of having been inspired originally by Immanuel Velikovsky, and Velikovsky was an exceptionally controversial figure. Probably in the history of the 20th century science he was up toward the top. In the controversial quality of his work. He registered a very broad hypothesis about human history, but it had certain key elements that are very relevant today. The first is that the planetary system was unstable within human memory. He said that in dynamic interactions between planets electric arcs flew between these bodies and affecting the surfaces those planets. And he insisted that human memories counted as evidence. And planetary instability and human memories counting as evidence, both disqualified him from consideration by the scientific community. I happened to be publishing a student journal called Pensée in 72 and I had this sense, from our conversations with Immanuel Velikovsky, that this was actually a historic juncture, so as I was envisioning how we might treat the issue of Velikovsky, we eventually came to the idea of putting out a special issue of our student journal distributed free on Oregon campuses. And this kind of cut across the political divisions and so on that we ourselves were fostering, with the kind material that we're putting out and that was Emmanuel Velikovsky reconsidered. And from that moment on my own world just changed completely. 1 issue grew into 10, and this series had a remarkable impact around the world, it provoked this whole renewal of interest in Velikovsky in the light of new space-age data coming back in the 70's. I followed this questioning with an incredible enthusiasm, and for a few years, because of certain things that were arising from my own study I was actually living off of adrenaline for, I swear, 3 or 4 years realizing that an entirely different assessment of human history and of evidence is possible. Research method: based first and foremost on cross-cultural points of agreement. Something that can not be ignored, there is a power in diverse cultures insisting on the same thing at a level of very specific detail. Attention to the earliest sources, in other words, the evidence was increasing that there was a primordial experience. Well of course, whatever has been preserved to the point of cross-cultural agreement you want to refer it back to the very first expressions of those themes. Because there's a natural tendency of evolution over time in the myths to fragment and to distort or to localize the message. There was a point in which I realized that there are hundreds of mythic archetypes of points of agreement, and that they're all connected and that after the myth-making epoch there is not a single new archetype. That was an incredible revelation that secured for me the possibility of a unified theory of myth. There were, must have been something unique and experienced around the world that gave rise to this unified complex of mythic archetypes. In a sense, the monumental construction in antiquity is a witness to something that is simply unknown in human consciousness today. Why would they all looking back to critical junctures in the age of gods and wonders, every monument that was ever constructed, every temple, every city, always involved a recreation of the primordial event and that event did not point to anything that we can name in natural experience today. Because Velikovsky had made this seemingly preposterous claim that the planet Venus appeared in the sky as great comet I kept my eye out for that particular question all the time and I can only say, because we want to cover a lot of ground here, that not only I but all who have seriously investigated this question with the kind of open-mind that is displayed here, have concluded exactly the same thing. Velikovsky was simply and undeniably correct in saying that the planet Venus was a terrifying great comet, the parent of comets, in other words, all of the ideas about comets when they responded with fear to a wispy little comet coming into view, everything that drove them was a result of that primordial experience of the great comet, the mother of comets. You can't pursue the mythic archetypes without beginning to notice that in the naming of planets in relationship to these mythic powers there is a consistency that has to have an explanation and there will be no explanation unless the planets were gathered above humanity in a way that has no conceivable explanation in the sky we observe today. So, that was the heart of a new way of looking at human history and planetary history. What was the age of gods and wonders? Where did the gods live? The answer to that question is undeniably, based on the early sources, they lived in the sky. And why did we stop believing in the gods? For the simple reason that in the course of time with distance from that primordial experience there was nothing in the human experience of nature that would lend any support to the myths, all myths became increasingly preposterous. To gain a sense of the coherence and universality of the myths it's good to start with some of the absolute fundamentals a myth of the primeval paradise, the Golden Age, an age of peace and plenty on Earth, harmony in the sky. There probably is not a well-documented culture in an earlier time that failed to remember that tradition. And then, there was this catastrophic event that brought the age of the gods to its violent conclusion. And what was the power that appeared in the sky in the intervening phase of history? This dragon like form. But the most significant about this form is that when you investigated under the rules of cross-cultural investigation you find that every ancient hieroglyph, within the cultural traditions you're investigating, everyone, every symbol is a symbol of the comet. Long flowing hair, long flowing beard, long flowing feathers, serpentine form, fiery countenance, fiery breath all symbols of the comet. Don't believe in accidents. That's the heart of this research method, convergence on extraordinary detail has to mean shared experience, even if we have not understood it. I can thank Velikovsky and quite frankly a brief outline, I saw from Bill Mullen way back in 1972, it was like a page and a half outline of Velikovsky's idea about the planet Saturn, it was not in 'Worlds in Collision', he had pulled it from 'Worlds in Collision' in order to present a more complete hypothesis. But that was so intriguing, this idea that Saturn had this extraordinary role in the earliest remembered time and so, I followed that. And yes, Saturn was directly tied to the Golden Age, as you can see in this quote about life in the time of Kronos when he ruled in heaven, Kronos being Greek name of the planet Saturn. Follow the threads and everything you encounter just expands the anomaly, expands the sense of something out of our familiar experience that was so much on the mind of the ancients. Today, probably not 1 in a 1,000 people know that Helios, the Greek word for the Sun, was in early time the name of the plant Saturn. Sol - was a name of the planet Saturn. Shamash - the Babylonian sun god, was explicitly identified with the planet Saturn. Scholars investigating this never dispute it, but why that would be so, is disputed. There is an idea of a great conjunction that has nothing to do with what we call a conjunction or even a great conjunction today. We see the planets gathering within a 30 degree arc of the sky and they call that a great conjunction. No, the principle that is inherent is that you see it at the heart of the ancient myths. It's the planets stood in one line, such that line ran right through the heart of those gathered bodies. Now, why would anyone say that was the condition that prevailed in the first chapter of the age of gods and wonders? And that's what we'll see, I'll discuss this in my presentation on Sunday. Every culture in antiquity tended to have a line of kings and they could trace that line of kings back to a mythic first king. And this is where you find the preeminence of the planet Saturn, as the first father, the father Kings. What would that mean? And why did that memory so preoccupy those who formulated the rights of kingship declaring that the blood of that first ancestors courses through the veins of our King? And what was the connection to the myth of heaven close to the Earth? The entire idea as a universal theme, as a mythic archetype, makes no sense, but there's an intimate connection to Saturn that has to be explained because you have a father figure and a younger version of the same figure and that has to be unraveled but the truth is that the myth of heaven, when heaven was close to the earth, is inseparably connected to the planet Saturn for no apparent reason at all. So, I actually got Double Day, very excited about a book before I've written it, just on the basis of an article I have written and an outline. And I think that they had expectations for the book that left them sorely disappointed after it was published. The sales were simply not impressive, and yet there is today a group of people who were inspired by the book, it was effective with those who really paid attention. One incidentally is Ev Cochrane, whom a number of you people know and he is now a world-class expert on world mythology. There was this forgotten epoch and what was seen in the sky bore no resemblance to things we see now. And humans on Earth drew pictures of these forms. The dynamically evolving configuration in the sky pressing in on the Earth, obsessively preoccupying human beings. Out of respect for time I'm not gonna belabor the details but just leave with you this sense of some underline pattern, and as Bill Mullen said, it is this ability to recognize patterns, as is being done within our group as a whole, that means everything. Pattern recognition leading the way and in all every instance you're looking at patterns that are archetypal and every archetype is a defiance of nature as we experience it today. There is a wheel-like character to this form and it provoked this explanation, going back many years, that they must have been drawing pictures of the Sun and imagine that the Sun was a wheel rolling across the sky. And yet the truth is that these pictographs in countless numbers precede the discovery of useful applications of the wheel and that is very evident in fact that the discovery of useful applications was connected to models turned on temple walls and in one way or another as a praying wheel or whatever it might be, this kind of an example of it here in the wheel of Shamash where the wheel is turn on the... on a rope. The useful wheel emerged from the sacred wheel, it's not the reverse. Notice the spokes of the wheel are not functional anyway, very etheric. And "Shamash is the planet Saturn", say the magical texts of Assyrian and Babylonian. So, honestly folks... Does the Sun in our sky look like this? Okay, here we go to a brief segment of the first episode of 'Symbols of Alien Sky'. You're looking at reconstructed images of the formation in the heavens just a few thousand years ago. The configuration evolved through many phases, evoking reverence and awe, a model for kings and kingdoms for thousands of years. Great temples and cities and sacred mountains, all pointed back to the mythic age of gods and wonders. Let the world's first astronomers point the way for us. They knew that what the myths and hymns and prayers called Gods were planets and aspects of planets. Planets appeared close to the Earth in heaven spanning configuration. Memories of that celestial splendor still surround us even if humanity later forgot much more than it remembered. Reconnecting with our forgotten past will be essential, essential for our own cultural integrity, essential for the study of human consciousness and essential for all of the sciences. Here is the fulcrum of a reconstructions stylized but it carries the whole message that I want to leave with folks tonight, the claim that I'll swear by and yet it could only sound preposterous to someone who hasn't investigated this. The story of mythology is the story of what happened to these bodies and there is no other story that really is true. And anyone who follows the rules of the investigation will discover this for themselves. It's happening right now. Maybe when we get to the panel discussions at the Encore event it will have some substantial discussion of the human story and we may talk about it exactly what this means. The point here is, this configuration that is at the center of reconstruction is the culmination of an evolutionary phase that preceded it through which the participants were progressively clarified at clarification of the personalities of the male and female powers. The female power being the great star in the center of the overarching sphere. The smaller star, smaller planet, darker redder sphere was the prototype of the warrior hero. The star burst form was the prototype of the mother goddess, the great star, the great comet, before it was removed to become the angry goddess. So, there's just this sweeping story, it's not gonna be told briefly because the configuration evolve through dynamic and at times violent phases but the point here is, it can be reconstructed because people were drawing pictures, carving pictures on stone of what was seen and today we have this incredible benefit that the pictures that are recorded on stone can actually be evaluated under laboratory examination of electric discharge in a plasma environment. And I should mention, because this form is so unusual, I always laughed when I would take a step back and consider the symmetry of the configuration that I'd reconstructed. I was calling this dust, gas and dust in the emptiness of space. Why would it gather into symmetries? And everything I was reconstructing involved various layers and symmetries that seemed utterly preposterous, and then Wal Thornhill arrived in my office in late 96, early 97, and he explained to me that in electric discharge in a plasma you get this kind of symmetry and he illustrated it for me. Wal Thornhill, so that was the beginning of a collaboration that won't quit now, we published 2 books and the theme is a convergence of myth and science. One of those books, the 'Thunderbolts of the Gods' takes advantage of a fact that the cosmic thunderbolt in the antic world provides us with a bridge between myth and science. And every fact that you can bring forth relating to this cosmic thunderbolt is explicit and extraordinary, and anomalous, the warrior god's weapon was not inspired by any practical function and of course it never looks like lightning. But imagine a warrior within, launching an arrow with the configuration seem here, which would make the arrow effectively disfunctional. But it is a familiar form to those who know electric discharge in plasma. The Assyrian form, there are many variants and it's quite clear that whatever was being experienced it did go through extraordinary evolution in the sky. Not everyone understands this, but the scholars who have looked certainly do understand that the tridents of early myth and symbolism were forms of the cosmic thunderbolt. And now you know why we chose that image of this conference. The ancient image of the cosmic thunderbolt, the Sanskrit vajra, Tibetan dorje, the Japanese Kongo, the weapon of the warrior god Indra and so many others and the identity of that warrior god himself and instance after instance, he is his weapon. The bolt of Odin, this bipolar form is continually recurring. Look at the heart of this figure. The heart of heaven, the innermost heart of that configuration that we initially show was the form of the cosmic thunderbolt in its first phases of evolution. And that sphere that is identified here as the masculine seed is such a recurring element it must, it just must be a part of whatever dynamic sequence is being displayed in the ancient images of the thunderbolt. A few greek examples. And the point to follow is that all artists progressively elaborated the thunderbolt form, it became increasingly complex, there's an underline form that stands out and must be investigated in relation to plasma discharge in terms of the yet evolving ways of artistically representing the cosmic thunderbolt because it was evolving in the sky and extremely common practice was to juxtapose various phases in the evolution of that form. And that's what you're seeing here. Therefore, 5 or 6 different elements of the cosmic thunderbolt in its evolutionary sequence that are displayed here. Fact: the prototype of the warrior god's sword or arrow was a thunderbolt. Now, you have no doubt assumed that the great warrior gods of all of the folk literature and so on, with their magical weapons, they never missed their marker, they returned to the hand of the warrior himself. That these were just based on our experience of warriors with weapons, it's quite the contrary. The original form of the warrior's weapon was the cosmic thunderbolt. Now, there was a time after I converged with Wal and I realized that a thunderbolt it had to be at the center of the whole story of violence in the sky. I thought that I was the only one on Earth that could have possibly known, because it's such a preposterous idea, that all of these weapons of great warrior gods were actually the cosmic thunderbolt. I mean that's a ludicrous idea. These stories of great heroes are claimed to have emerged from our experience in an earlier time of conflict and battles on great battlefields and so on. But I found I was not the first by any means. "When the sacrificer brandishes the wooden sword, it is the thunderbolt that he hurls at the enemy." "The sword is derived from a lightning-flash archetype, of which it is the descendant..." This is why you find the word for lightning in so many of the ancient words for different heroic swords. "... A 'derivation' of the sword, and similarly of the celt, from a 'root' or archetype in lightning is universal and worldwide." in other words, that takes it right into the realm of the archetypes, the points of agreement. "In the matter of prehistoric weapons... in every country without exception they are always 'thunderbolts' and never anything else." René Guénon. Now, I think most of you understand that investigation now is bringing together the myths and symbols and experiments in the laboratory that show bridges that had never entered human imagination previously. Laboratory discharge Knots, toroids and "wings" emerge in plasma instabilities. And this is a discharge form from the Princeton plasma lab. Illustrating or emphasizing that instabilities produce axial columns and embedded cylinders, embedded cylinders. This becomes extremely important consideration. An illustration of laboratory high-energy discharge in a plasma medium. The beginning with a knot. Flattening into a torus. The torus folding upwards into the beginnings of the kind of champagne glass, wine glass form, as another torus is forming. Back to just illustrate, you can see it again in that particular image. A more angular look can be acquired. Embedded cylinders. And pinching of the cylinders at the plasma pinch point, which is key to the evolution of that configuration. The Vajra, yes artistic elaboration has occurred I mean this could be at least one or two thousand years after the actual experience and that's part of the evolution of myth and symbolism over time, but you see everything still in the design element that is inherent in the electric discharge in the plasma laboratory. The form in the hand of Zeus is in that early phase, where it's beginning to send out the petals. I like this image, the red-headed warrior is telling because, I mean, one of the first things that begins the register when you are examining warriors identified with the planet Mars is the red form, but notice his head is surmounted by the upper termination of the cosmic thunderbolt. The warrior is his weapon. Greek images showing that evolution in very stylized forms and the kind of complexity you see here is actually representative of the complexities that will appear in varying conditions in electric discharge. But surely no one needs to emphasize that we've never seen lightning take this form. So, what is being underscored here is the absolute contradiction of the mythic archetypes to the natural experience. Only intense electric discharge in a plasma can create these forms. One step forward, more than 10,000 years ago paleolithic artist painted these images on the walls of Lascaux cave in France, they were realists with an exceptional eye for detail. Why these talented artists of the Stone Age disappeared remains a mystery, but the greater mystery is the epoch that followed. It seems that Neolithic artists lost the ability to depict nature as we know it. Accurate representations of nature are present but the dominant style produced a carnival of ghostly creatures and absurd forms never seen in our world. How did this tendency arise? Not in one land alone, but on every habitable continent. Absurd? Yes, but what provoked the distinctive patterns? A stick man with no head, just a duck or other bird on his shoulders. Hundreds of variations on this theme occur in the American Southwest. But the pattern doesn't end there. Notice the twin dots on the two sides of these crudely crafted stick figures. One instance alone is just a curiosity but widespread patterns must have an explanation. And other details only accent the irrationality. Recently an answer to these mysteries came from outside traditional archeology, from plasma science and laboratory experiments with electric discharge. Plasma scientist Anthony Peratt of Los Alamos laboratories has shown that these stick forms recorded electrical events in the sky. Something like the Northern Lights we see today but a thousand times more energetic. And he matches the rock art forms precisely to the configurations taken by electric discharge in the laboratory. The rock art images are explained as sheets of intense electric current in the evolution of a plasma discharge. The central column you see in this stylized representation is the axis of the discharge. Wrapped around the axis is a torus or donuts-like tubular sheet of charged particles. The observer sees through the transparent formation: champagne glass above, squashed bell-shape below, so the plasma density is greatest at the limbs. Drawn in two dimensions, the formation matches the stick man carved globally on stone by the thousands. The two dots under the stick man's arms are the exceedingly bright high-energy radiation called synchrotron radiation, emitted from the center of the torus. The current sheets continually warp as the electric discharge progresses and this form is not uncommon. A two dimensional representation might look like this. Peratt's work has shown that the stick man, the duck headed version of the American Southwest and variations from Hawaii to Saudi Arabia is a plasma discharge formation, a subject on which he's an acknowledged world expert. Peratt's investigation is entirely independent from our own. Thousands of rock art images have enabled a supercomputer to identify formations as seen from different positions on Earth. The fit that he has documented can not be accidental. And yet our own investigation, which preceded Peratt's by almost three decades, converges with his in extraordinary ways as I shall clarify in the second episode of this series. For scholars and scientists as a whole, rock art remains an unsolved mystery. For 200 years experts have debated over the vast library of images on stone. Definitive considerations are now in hand, calling for a new perspective. One that follows the compelling evidence for high-energy electrical events in the ancient sky. And those who pursue this line of investigation must not be afraid to ask how the movements of planets may have contributed to an electrified cosmic environment, of which science knew nothing only a few decades ago. Now because we just introduced the work of Tony Peratt and I'm sure many of you know that it doesn't stop here, the convergence with Peratt has actually a very interesting history and I'm just gonna address that briefly so as to not get stopped at this point. But Tony became a very good friend traveling to Portland more than once I traveled to Albuquerque and Santa Fe more than once, we got together for dinners and he was incredibly animated. But I was essentially precluded at that time from mentioning any association at all. Now with the passage of time it is, I think, the only appropriate to be pretty explicit as I've been over just the past 3 years or so about the nature of that relationship, how it evolved and what it actually means. I was in 2000 working with Rick Smith of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, database manager in conveying to Rick ideas about a more complex dimension of an evolving configuration that required us to look at it three-dimensionaly. And three-dimensional representation was becoming increasingly important because I was beginning to see that we were observing configurations in a phase of, you might call it cosmic wandering, and in the myths it was the phase of wandering gods. And so, Rick produced an image that I then translated into an illustration of what I had been calling the chain of arrows. And when Wal came to Portland in September of 2000 ahead of the symposium to which we had invited Tony Peratt I showed the image to Wal of the chain of arrows form. I asked him, Wal how did plasma do this and Wal said; "Look, it is so clear that it is a plasma discharge form, but it needs to be investigated more completely." And then Tony Peratt arrived at the conference and in a private gathering of speakers and trusting, you can see that image upper left, he just drew out a form, and he called it the Christmas tree. I said, Tony you've just drawn the chain of arrows. It's a very dominant form in laboratory of discharge experiments, it was named after Tony Peratt, a Peratt instability, his team members honored him with that title. I said that to Tony and he responded, well how does it evolve? And I'm not going to discuss the evolution here but I will allude to it in my talk on Sunday. But essentially it was twin filaments spiralling up the axis of the Earth, dividing into a stack of toruses that took the appearance of a the chain of arrows and then as a latter of heaven, the backbone of the sky. This is such an exotic concept and yet it can be reconstructed in very finite detail and it is simply inconceivable to me that something other than the actual human experience could possibly account for the accord which is global. So, Tony asked me when got back home he said, "send me the rock art". And for starters, though I have thousands of rock art images, I sent him just one and it was entirely on the basis of intuition. I had come to believe that this is one of the purest representations of that discharge form. As Tony recounts it, the moment he saw this he knew that his life has changed. His initial response was fear that somebody had somehow hacked into his computer and diagnosed the plasma discharge from the lot of this stuff back then, before Tony got it declassified, was really top secret information. This form, just given a little bit of three dimensionality on the right so you can see it is three-dimensional and so you have wine glass on top and you have that toroidal form at the base and you have a stack of toruses where the disk is folded sharply upward, that's what does happen and the stack of Toruses, Tony confirmed to me, is absolutely and unequivocally a dominant feature of the evolving configuration in the laboratory. And there is something quite meaningful in this phase, it's not as popularly inscribed on stone for one reason in particular that it's highly energetic and violent and potentially deadly in its radiation, and it collapses into this form, which is the stick-man form. And at the time I learned this from Tony I had never imagined that there was an explanation that I could understand of the stick-man form, and he provided it. Bi-polar discharge in space Of course we now know that the geometries of the electric discharge in plasma are abundantly evident in space. And look at that core of the inner, the most energetic emanation, how beautifully symmetrical it is, and that is a pointer back to that kind of symmetries, bipolar symmetries, that were evident in the ancient sky. Now the people are gonna get bored with this image very soon. Yes, I think it is the third time tonight. But is such a beautiful bi-polar form, and not all the forms exhibit that spectacular symmetry, because conditions in the sky would be widely varying within the Milky Way. But this bi-polar form is so clearly analogical to the thunderbolt form. Really quite spectacular, quite beautiful, but certainly not driven by gravity. Now I'm just going to give an overview of directions for finding the third-story, because our minds must be willing to work with a reconsideration of the first story, and the second story, and we must come to fully appreciate the fact that the 1st story will never be understood in the absence of the Electric Universe and the 2nd story must be rewritten in the light of the Electric Universe. So, this is the basis of the incredible sense of the unified possibility that is emerging now, within this group. Now that we're seeing space across the entire electromagnetic spectrum it is becoming undeniable that things are occurring out in space, that exotic structures are being seem that were simply never anticipated, but are observed in the laboratory. Electricity - the unifying force And as we discussed, what in our cosmic neighborhood would be the best window to the Electric Universe? It seems increasingly clear because the Sun is the most thoroughly investigated body in our solar system, outside the Earth itself that if we live in an Electric Universe, there is a fundamental misunderstanding that must be corrected. Our Electric Sun And then down to the smallest level and in the quantum domain, surely the underpinnings of the natural world seen in terms of the role of the electric force, as Wal and many others who are gathered here today, have begun to explain. That is key. Electricity of Life The people who are here to address that subject now, they are on the cutting edge. It is both the ancient myths and symbols and the modern perception of planetary history that must come together in one analysis. The goddess image in much of our culture today is very very popular but one thing I came to notice is that it's popular and there is almost a kind of reverence for that goddess form but in all of the visionary art and exotic representations of that mythic theme it seemed as if there was nothing actually underpinning it, it was just floating... and in the final analysis it is our role to bring clarity to visionary art, because the archetypes could not be meaningless and we can agree with them on that but we can bring the roots beneath those archetypes, so that they can begin to be interpreted in a way that will be, well, simply more meaningful. The Cosmic Warrior Why is it that amongst all the planets around the world the astronomical tradition always identify the planet of the mother goddess as Venus and always when looking out of Mars, they unanimously agree, that was a great warrior. Don't believe in accidents. What we're all talking about here is the power of convergence, I enjoyed very much Greg Volt's exposition on that. ● Interdisciplinary convergence ● Not artificial consensus ● Meaningful peer review; we all want that but not peer review that is just a gate keeping device. We want those who are open-minded and fully accredited to become the vehicle for assessing extraordinary new ideas and not to be dismissed or fired because they gave their approval to an extraordinary idea and if anyone here doesn't believe that there's that kind of fear active under the present peer review system in institutionalization of science, well, you're dead wrong, we see this all the time. There are people here I happen to know, are anonymous today because of the power of that force. Pattern recognition as Dr. Mullen was just emphasising earlier it's a key, it's leading the way, it's opening the doors to possibilities. You don't start with mathematics, you get the interdisciplinary picture by seeing patterns and understanding what is going on at a practical common-sense level and you direct the mathematicians to begin working with these patterns which are counting us, something is fundamentally wrong. Don't just keep elaborating a present, a previous idea mathematically to make things work. That means we need a broader field of view, this is what I love about the NPA, they know what natural science is, if you're always looking an inch wide and a mile deep, how well are you able to see the evidence shouting at you from the broader horizon of your science? It's telling you that you're, your focus is to narrow and you're missing the things that actually falsify your assumption. And I don't think any body in this room needs to be told that the role of the scientific maverick is absolutely essential today and we are here to support that role, and it is why we came into an alinement with the Natural Philosophy Alliance. And that is the end of my presentation. The Third Story Electric Universe 2012 Conference THE HUMAN STORY filmed by Ben Ged Low for the THUNDERBOLTS PROJECT Thunderbolts.info 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info For more than a decade, among the individuals exploring the concepts of the Electric Universe Theory, a community has arisen which is specifically devoted to exploring the surface of our planet. The geological processes in an Electric Universe go well beyond the theoretical toolkit of standard geology. Laboratory experiments involving electrical discharge to solid surfaces, reveal familiar features seen on every rocky body in the solar system, including our own planet. For a number of years, a variety of independent investigators have participated in regular group expeditions in the American Southwest, gathering evidence and developing analyses based on their observations. One contributor to the Electric Geology Group is Robert Hawthorne Jr., who exhibited at the Thunderbolts Project’s EU 2017 conference, “Future Science” in Phoenix, Arizona. In part 1 of this two-part presentation, Robert offers his analysis on what may be one of the best candidates for an electrical scarring feature on planet Earth: Upheaval Dome in Canyonlands National Park in Utah. The link to the Electric Geology Facebook page may be found in the description box of this video. I would like to first take this opportunity to thank the Thunderbolts staff for giving me this opportunity to speak with you on my paper entitled: ”Electric Discharge - Not an Impact Caused Formation of Upheaval Dome, Canyonlands National Park, Utah.” In March of this year, I was given the opportunity to present this paper at the International Multi-Conference on Complexity, Informatics and Cybernetics in Orlando, Florida, and also I going to be receiving a publication from this paper. Upheaval Dome is a crater in Canyonlands National Park, about five and a half kilometers across the outer rim, and it's about five hundred meters deep. And currently there are two theories on a placard outside the dome and the first one suggests that it was a meteor impact and there was actually a lot of work done by Dr. Shoemaker, who I actually visited the site with, and did some work with him on this when he was still around. The second theory is a salt dome that pushed up all the way through, like a lava lamp, because its less dense initiative surface then completely eroded away. And this theory is losing support, in fact quickly, since they found shocked quartz in the area, suggesting the impact theory. So in 1996, a sample of what was thought to be a tektite was presented to Dr. Eugene Shoemaker and several other authorities on Upheaval Dome. The scientists were baffled as to what secondary processing could have caused this mineral known as analcime, which is a hydrated sodium aluminum silicate, to be in this form below. So, the objectives of this episode of the Thunderbolts Project, is to explain that electrical discharges can form large craters and eject material. I'm going to try to show that these same temperatures and pressures that are needed to shock quartz crystals from impacts, can be generated through electrical discharge. And also, that electrical discharges can vitrify, or turn to glass material struck by these discharges. And a new form of the mineral analcime will also be shown as proof. And it's also to provide an argument that perhaps another mechanism can be applied to the formation of the planet’s many craters. So, these illustrations here show mantle gravity anomalies on the planet. So, the mantle gravity anomalies in this illustration here show that, if the currents were to come in from the Sun at the planet, they would take the path of least resistance. And since we know that current generates heat, we can see that on these fault lines here where the thermal imaging shows it it's probably the most likely place with these currents are traveling in towards the core. And we're going to focus on the Eastern Pacific rise as our primary current here. And if you can see in this little pink circle on the mantle gravity anomaly illustration, that's where our primary focus is going to be. Now inside that circle, there is a magnetic anomaly that's been titled the Farallon Hyper Volcano by Quinn. And you can see here that it's rather large. The peak of the anomaly, if it were to be a hyper volcano, you can see that the city of Las Vegas is almost centered right at the top and it expands all the way up past Ensenada, Mexico with the base of the volcano extending out into the Pacific Ocean. So, this is a rather large anomaly and if it were to have an incident kind of like mount St. Helens, where the volcano collapsed in on itself, it would be evident that the patterns of the river formations there, in the United States, would in fact basically be the electrical discharge and the forensic evidence of that discharge. And here, we actually see we're getting closer to Upheaval Dome. Now these are pictures that were taken of the area of Southern Utah. You can see highway 70 at the top of the illustration and the second flag on the left-hand side, the down, is called Three Fingers Canyon and Upheaval Dome is on towards the bottom of the screen. The second to lowest flag is Upheaval Dome. You can see from Three Fingers Canyon is a canyon that opens out to the west. It extends west to east with walls, sheer walls basically, extending on the north and south sides up several hundred feet, with it opening out on the east side. So, if anybody were in this area to see like an electrical disturbance in the sky, they would easily be able to see what was happening off to the east and if it was over to the south they could easily look over their shoulder and be able to describe on to the stones what they saw in the sky happening over Upheaval Dome. And that's exactly where you find the petroglyph that's on the side here. And if you can see it, this actually highly suggests that there was possibly a polar configuration and even possibly some twin comets that were in this area. And now we're going to get into some electrical cratering theory. Jacob Gable on the YouTube channel Electro Terravision, gave an interview with me on the Electric View, demonstrating electrical cratering in a low-pressure chamber with an anode and cathode and some dirt from the outside of his house. And also you can see here that it wouldn't take a five and a half kilometer wide electrical strike, to create the crater. As you can see from these pictures here, it’s just a thin filament of electricity that's dancing around, in a kind of a circular motion; a bit of a spiral action coming. But as the current was intensified, you can just see this focuses on one spot basically, so it's cooking right through the crater itself. I also wanted to find some actual evidence of electrical cratering on the planet prior to this event, just to prove that the actual lightning can create craters. And on October 30th, 2019 a lightning bolt struck outside a parking lot of a gas station in Fort Worth Texas. The fire department spokesman, Mike Drivdahl, was quoted saying: “When it's 15 by 15 feet, in concrete six inches thick, that's a pretty massive explosion.” And I think that's at least pretty much right there - that's a rather massive explosion. Now on the shocked quartz subject, electric discharge machining versus impact. Shocked quartz has recently been used as a standard to discern whether the impact event has occurred. And regarding Upheaval Dome, shocked quartz samples were discovered by Shoemaker’s team in 1999. However, in 2015, a geology team from the University of Pennsylvania demonstrated in simulation, where an arc of lightning struck a simulated granite substance. The calculated pressure from the strike exceeded 70,000 atmospheres, well within the range of creating shocked quartz. And this was from Reto Gieré’s paper in 2015. Matthew Pasek, a geochemist from University of South Florida, Tampa, who wasn't involved in the study was quoted saying, “The result could cast further doubt on claims of asteroid impacts in Argentina and Australia that relied on observations of shocked quartz. The analysis should serve as a warning to geologists not to rely only on that line of evidence. This definitely shows that geologists need to consider the geological context of their samples.” And now I would like to talk about some fulgurites and the “Obsession Stone.” When it comes to fulgurites, lightning is highly energetic and it's capable of delivering a billion joules of energy, and also temperatures exceeding 2,000 Kelvin. Any material that’s struck usually becomes vitrified or turns into glass, or into a glassy substance. These items are called fulgurites. Now, back in 1996 the discoverer of the Obsession Stone, James Wesley Hill of Moab, Utah and my father, Robert Hawthorne Sr. presented a strange rock to local geologists for identification. After local scientists from BYU and University of Utah could not identify the mineral, they turned to other authorities of meteorites. We went to Dr. William Cassidy from the University of Pittsburgh, who is a recipient of the Behringer award and after he had taken it to the Smithsonian, his graduate student returned us this letter. And in this letter, it states a few things and i'm just going to quote a few parts of it. ”Preliminary observations are that it consists principally of irregular shaped, colorless grains of isotropic material, accompanied by rare rounded isotropic grains. Both the irregular and rounded isotropic grains are probably glass. They are cemented with calcite. By association with the nearby Upheaval Dome structure, it seems possible that the glass grains had an impact origin and were deposited at a site where chemical precipitation of calcium carbonate was occurring.” And he also goes on to say later on, “Therefore, while it seems possible that this material is of impact origin, one would have to suggest the likelihood that it has undergone some type of secondary processing or/and sorting, to remove associated nickel-iron inclusions before lithification. Pending further chemical analysis of the individual grains, we cannot commit ourselves further to it's possible impact origin.” At the request of Dr. Cassidy, we sent our samples to NASA, to Mike Zolensky, who's the NASA curator. An X-ray diffraction was performed on two samples with the results showing that, “The samples are a combination of a analcime and calcite. I am afraid that these secondary minerals have completely replaced the original mineralogy of the samples, so there is just no telling what they originally were. The gross petrography does resemble devitrified glass, but this could have been a volcanic glass. I'm afraid I can do no more with these samples, because they have been so altered from their original mineralogy.” So, after two attempts to try to prove that this was a meteorite and both of them failed, basically we were left at a loss and for ten years I left this rock sit in our yard. And it wasn't until I saw a Thunderbolts podcast from Barry Setterfield, that I actually took a picture of one of my samples and sent it to the Thunderbolts project and within half an hour I was invited to the Electric Universe 2017 conference in Phoenix, where I met Wal Thornhill and a lot of people and that was a great experience.

Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info For many decades, the standard cosmological model has stated that the universe began many billions of years ago with a primordial explosion called The Big Bang. Beginning from an unimaginably hot dense point, material rushed outward at nearly the speed of light and to this day the physical expansion of the universe is thought to continue. When scientists found evidence for the apparent acceleration of the expansion rate of the universe, the hypothetical influence of dark energy was invented. For a scientific hypothesis to be testable, it must make predictions and the technological data available to test the Big Bang hypothesis has never been finer. For over five years, in this series, we have reported on numerous theory-shattering discoveries that challenge the very underpinnings of the Big Bang. From impossibly huge structures that exceed the size limits for any object at this time in the Big Bang universe, to so-called "ancient stars" whose chemical composition is completely wrong if they formed from material in the early universe. To grand-design galaxies that display a complexity of form that defy their theoretical age. To evidence that the so-called expansion of the universe is accelerating at an impossibly fast rate, even accounting for dark energy's influence. Many scientists have acknowledged the major problems these discoveries posed for Big Bang cosmology. Nevertheless, consensus scientific opinion remains that the Big Bang is the best current theory for the origins of our universe. Indeed, a recent Scientific American article aroused a response from some of the world's most revered cosmologists, that demonstrates just how slow and difficult is real change in the culture of science. The article in question entitled "Cosmic Inflation Theory Faces Challenges" proposed that the universe began with a so-called Big Bounce instead of a Big Bang. The authors question cosmologists' interpretations of measurements of the so-called Cosmic Microwave Background. Specifically, they disagree with the interpretation that data first published in 2013 proves that an extremely fast inflation occurred after a Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago. They state, "If anything, the Planck data disfavored the simplest inflation models and exacerbated long-standing foundational problems with the theory, providing new reasons to consider competing ideas about the origin and evolution of the universe... Yet even now the cosmology community has not taken a cold, honest look at the big bang inflationary theory or paid significant attention to critics who question whether inflation happened." In a response letter to the controversial article, 33 scientists, including physicist Stephen Hawking, began with a statement, "There is no disputing the fact that inflation has become the dominant paradigm in cosmology." They then accused the authors of, "dismissing the research of not only all the authors of this letter but also that of a substantial contingent of the scientific community." However, the problems for Big Bang cosmology reach far beyond anything that Hawking and his colleagues seem ready to acknowledge. On the question of the so-called Cosmic Microwave Background, or CMB, the conclusion that the radiation is a "background at all" begins with the assumption of a Big Bang. But, as previously discussed in this series, ample evidence exists to consider that the "asymmetric radiation" is, in fact, a locally produced foreground. As physicist Wal Thornhill has explained, proponents of the Electric Universe and Plasma Cosmology argue that the radiation is due to microwave radiation from the filamentary galactic electric currents flowing in the neighborhood of the sun. In fact, some of the expected structures, a galaxy-wide sample of dense filamentary structures correlated with spiral arms and star formation, have been recently mapped. The image on your screen is an example of a network of galactic filaments. As Thornhill notes, we see a roughly orthogonal branching of tributaries, which is characteristic of an electrical discharge. This principle is seen in this comparison with experimental discharge filaments. If the CMB is, in fact, what physicist Eric Lerner has described as a "radio fog of dense plasma filaments" its presence tells us nothing about the age of the universe. The local origins of the radiation would also help explain the seemingly baffling discovery of apparently vast and remote cosmic voids. The appearance of a cold spot where the "temperature of an area of space is interpreted as significantly lower than the surrounding region" suggests the presence of a void where many galaxies should be observed. The interpretation of the size of the so-called "void" is based on the assumption that the redshift of the surrounding galaxies provides an accurate measure of the object size and distance. In recent years, some scientists have offered the incredible speculation that such a void is actually the imprint of a parallel universe. In fact, the concept of parallel universes or the multiverse is a theory championed by the aforementioned Stephen Hawking as well as Brian Greene, Michio Kaku and the current host of the television show Cosmos, Neil deGrasse Tyson. Ironically, at the time that cosmologist Carl Sagan wrote his iconic book, Cosmos, challenges to the very foundations of the Big Bang were still permitted. On the question of whether the Doppler interpretation of galactic redshift is a reliable indicator of an expanding universe, Sagan wrote, "There is nevertheless a nagging suspicion among some astronomers, that all may not be right with the deduction, from the redshift of galaxies via the Doppler effect, that the universe is expanding. The astronomer Halton Arp has found enigmatic and disturbing cases where a galaxy and a quasar, or a pair of galaxies, that are in apparent physical association have very different redshifts..." Sagan continues, "If Arp is right, the exotic mechanisms proposed to explain the energy source of distant quasars -- supernova chain reactions, supermassive black holes and the like -- would prove unnecessary. Quasars need not then be very distant. But some other exotic mechanism will be required to explain the redshift. In either case, something very strange is going on in the depths of space." At the other end of the spectrum from so-called "vast cosmic voids" are the objects that appear impossibly huge. One such object, the quasar cluster huge LQG, is supposedly so enormous it would comprise about 5% of the visible universe. As one astronomer said of the discovery, it "...upsets the foundation of everything we do." The force of gravity is weak and takes time to move things around. The elapsed time, since the conjectured Big Bang, sets a limit on how big any structure can be. Structures exceeding that limit are, by the cosmologists' own admission, impossible. One possible solution to this enigma is that the objects, simply, are not as distant and huge as they appear based on their measured redshift. Halton Arp proposed that the redshift of quasars depends not only on a velocity value but also its "intrinsic redshift." This would be a property of matter that is subject to change over time. Arp found that the intrinsic redshift, of a quasar or galaxy, took discrete values which decreased with the distance from a central active galaxy. In Arp's hypothesis, many mature galaxies of a specific type eject newborn objects called QSO-s or quasars and these objects grow up to be companion galaxies of their parents. As they move away from the parent, their mass and brilliance changes, their velocity slows and they tend to begin to fall back toward the parent galaxy. Proponents of the Electric Universe, including physicist and chief science advisor to The Thunderbolts Project, Wal Thornhill, agree with Arp's thesis of quasar ejection. However, Thornhill disagrees with Arp's description of the mass of quasars increasing with time. Arp proposed that the existence of a new quasar becomes recognized by matter in the rest of the universe at the speed of light. But in Thornhill's view, an initially positively charged quasar is followed by a beam of electrons from its parent galaxy, which would explain both the quantized redshift and increase in mass. These electrons may come in bursts, like the quasar ejections themselves, which, if true, would predict and explain seemingly impossibly sudden changes in quasars. As we reported last year in this series, many recently discovered objects in space lend great credence to this thesis. A team of astronomers, using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, observed quasars behaving in a manner that completely up-ends conventional theory. Using images from the Pan-STARRS survey, the scientists identified 1,000 objects that appear to vary in brightness over a period of just 10 years. Among these objects were a total of 5 galaxies that the team witnessed shape-shifting into quasars in a seemingly impossibly short period of time. The team also recorded a total of a dozen quasars "shutting down in a period of hundreds of days" rather than the hundreds of thousands of years required by standard theory. As reported by Newscientist.com, "Astronomers expect quasars to use up their fuel and settle down into quiet galaxies -- a process that should take hundreds of thousands of years. So last year, when a dozen quasars were spotted shutting down in just hundreds of days, it was a shock." In subsequent decades, as demonstrated by the recent protests of Hawking and company, little has changed in the culture of science. The seemingly endless cosmic surprises have yet to force any real reassessment of the cherished 13.5 billion year "history of the universe." Institutional science remains unready to confront the possibility that based on our current limited knowledge, we must accept the universe of unknown age and extent. So the surprises for cosmologists will only continue since nature seems to have no regard for human beliefs.

[Music] Congratulations to all the technologists who are responsible for the spectacular success of the development and deployment of the Webb Space Telescope. Notably it has not been matched by successful predictions from the scientists involved. The sharp images of the Webb Space Telescope’s first deep-field image reminded me of the aphorism of the Scottsman, Sir  Walter Scott: ”Oh what a tangled Webb we weave, when first we practice to deceive!” Modern science practice or training is driven by our industrialized education systems. Simply follow the fire hose of money to universities from the military, governments, and corporations. We train specialist technologists, not  broadly educated natural philosophers. And as Leonard Peikoff wrote, “It is the inductive science of philosophy that teaches the ‘hard’ scientists how to be scientific.” Unsurprisingly, our “whatever works”  technology has rapidly advanced, to the detriment of life on this planet. And some top scientists are now declaring particle physics and cosmology to be in crisis based on discoveries from their new technology. Otherwise the many successes of Electric Universe science would demand their attention. The demand by technocrats to ‘follow the science’ has no substance. In 2021 I devoted three episodes to the Webb Space Telescope prior to its launch in which I discussed Webb's significance in the context of Electric Universe cosmology issues, and made several predictions of what the Webb Space Telescope would reveal. This is the first of several episodes that will report on success in relation to those predictions. In September 2021, I said the James Webb telescope, when successfully deployed, will allow us to see finer and fainter detail in the stardust regions of dense molecular clouds, where stars and Gas Giant planets  are born. The twisting and turning, glowing red filaments of constant width are like those in a novelty plasma ball. They are rotating Birkeland Currents threading the gestating stars in those clouds. The stars grow in mass until they are born by a slingshot effect as the filament twists away. The mystery of the upper limit of star mass is simply answered. The James Webb Telescope should put this explanation beyond any doubt, because gravity alone cannot produce such twisting and turning filamentary structures. It is hard to overstate the importance of evidence of helically twisted filament pairs and braids. The Electric Universe position has always been that the Universe is one giant web of rotating electric currents that flow as fila- ments of helically twisted pairs and braids and manifesting that morphology at all scales. That stars are born in an intense magnetic pinching of a galactic Birkeland Current. That every star is connected to the galactic circuit by a coaxial Birkeland Current. That every galaxy is connected to a larger intergalactic circuit by coaxial intergalactic Birkeland Currents. It is often very difficult to remotely observe an electric current in plasma dark mode, passing through the diffuse interplanetary, interstellar or intergalactic medium. For example, the discovery  of interplanetary electric currents has only occurred when space probes have made unexpected in-situ measurements. Nevertheless, it is often possible to remotely observe such electric currents because for example, dust is aggregated to the current via Marklund convection, or because the density of neutral atoms in the local plasma and the current density is sufficiently high for the generation of electromagnetic radiation in different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. As, I have often noted, “Radio astronomy is of particular importance because Birkeland Currents typically emit synchrotron radiation in the radio spectrum.” End of quote. Sheets of moving plasma tend to break into parallel filaments. This can occur whether the plasma sheets are planar, cylindrical, or spheroidal in shape. The parallel filaments are electric currents. Such parallel electric currents generate a self-constricting magnetic field. They exhibit long-range attraction and short-range repulsion that causes pairs of filaments to come together and twist about one another helically. In short, they tend to form helically twisted filament pairs and braids. Eric Lerner has provided an accessible physical explanation for this process in his his book, “The Big Bang Never Happened”. Winston Bostick was one of the preeminent plasma physicists of the 20th century. He was the first scientist to conduct a systematic investigation of the physics of the dense plasma-focused device and the extraordinary plasma structures they produce, for which he coined the term ”plasmoid”. Writing in 1986, Bostick stated, ”...my experimental work in plasma physics for the last 36 years has shown that under many different circumstances plasmas containing non-relativistic or relativistic electrons can spontaneously organize themselves into force-free, minimum-free-energy vortex filaments of a Beltrami morphology.” Eugenio Beltrami was an 18th century Italian mathematician who developed a partial differential equation that could be used to mathematically describe the morphology of helically twisted filament pairs, like  that in DNA; like that in Birkeland Currents. It is a matter that has been confirmed repeatedly by plasma researchers including Hannes Alfven and Anthony Peratt. An example of the tendency for helically twisted filaments to form when a current passes through a low density plasma is afforded by images from the Plasma Crystal Experiment aboard the International Space  Station. Mainstream plasma researchers also confirmed the tendency for electric currents flowing in low-density plasmas, like the plasmas that pervade interplanetary, interstellar and intergalactic space, to form helically twisted pairs. For example, in 2012 UCLA's professor Walter Gekelman, who headed the team that designed and operated the 18-meter large plasma device, presented a paper with Bart Van Compernolle to the American Physical Society, reporting on experiments that created magnetic flux ropes in a low density plasma. With the abstract recording and I quote, ”Magnetic flux ropes are due to helical currents and form a dense carpet of arches on the surface of the Sun. Occasionally one tears loose as a coronal mass ejection and its rope structure is detected by satellites close to the earth. Current sheets can tear into filaments, and these are nothing other than flux ropes. Ropes are not static; they exert mutual electromagnetic (J x B) forces causing them to twist about each other and merge.” End  of quote. In 2014, the journal Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion published a cross-disciplinary special issue on ”Self-organization in magnetic flux ropes.” The guest editor, V. S. Lukin, then of the U.S. Naval Observatory and subsequently a program head at the National Science Foundation wrote and I quote, ”...the ingredient common to all magnetic flux ropes is that the magnetic field lines that thread nearby plasma elements at one location along the flux rope must wind around and not diverge away from each other  over a sufficiently long distance to look like a piece of ordinary rope. In a way, it is similar to turbulence - you know it when you see it.” End of quote. Lukin was there describing helically twisted filaments and braids, you know it when you see it. Precisely. In short, if we see the morphology of helically twisted filament pairs and braids traversing images, this is unanswerable evidence that we are looking at electric currents. In September 2021, I made a specific prediction, and I quote, “I predict that the James Webb Space Telescope with its vast improvement in sensitivity and resolution, will reveal the existence of the connecting network of helically twisted filament pairs and braids even more clearly. We will discover helically twisted filament pairs and braids everywhere we look.” End of quote. That prediction was spectacularly confirmed in the first Webb Space Telescope deep-field science images on July 11, 2022. We start with the so-called ‘cosmic cliffs’ in the Carina Nebula. Here's an image of the cosmic cliffs taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. There are tantalizing hints of helically twisted morphology at several places in that image, but the visual evidence is not compelling. Certainly, there is no clear evidence of widespread twisted filament pair and braid morphology. Now here is part of the Webb Space Telescope image showing the same region depicted in the Hubble image. It shows that this region is dominated by helically twisted filament pairs and braids. And here is the whole Webb Space Telescope image of the cosmic cliffs. If we pan over the whole of the image, we see helically twisted filament pairs and braids almost everywhere we look. This image shows that the entire structure in the cosmic cliffs image is dominated by helically twisted filament pairs and braids. The whole structure is an interconnected Webb of electric currents. And these are electric currents on the scale of light years. The cosmic cliffs are some seven light years in height. Next is Stephan’s Quintet. Here's a portion of a Hubble image of Stephan’s Quintet showing NGC 7319. There's a suggestion of helically twisted filaments in the dark dust clouds along the left-hand edge of the main body of the galaxy. Again, the visual evidence is debatable. Now, here's the equivalent region from the Webb Space Telescope's MIRI and NEARCAM composite image of Stephan’s Quintet. It shows the entire body of the galaxy NGC 7319 is dominated by helically twisted filaments that were not discernible as such in Hubble's images of the same  galaxy. The differences are apparent when the images are compared side by side. The  Webb Space Telescope image of Stephan’s Quintet is proof that electric currents flow throughout the galaxy on a scale in the order of 50,000 light years, and with an overall morphology that has biological overtones. The galaxy center, threaded by an axial umbilicus. Not only that, as we pan down in the Webb Space Telescope image, it shows that NGC 7319 is connected to NGC 7318 a and b by helically twisted filaments. This is compelling evidence that these galaxies are connected to each other by vast electric currents. Look at the light year scale on the compass  image. These electric currents connecting the galaxies are in the order of one hundred thousand light years. Again, these were effectively invisible in the Hubble image. In short, as I predicted, the Webb  Space Telescope Stephan’s Quintet images, and I quote, “... reveal the existence of the connecting network of helically twisted filamentary pairs and braids...” End quote. Both within, and between galaxies, in Stephan’s Quintet, that were not evident in previous images. In September 2021, I emphasized that and I quote, ”It is hard to overstate the importance of evidence of helically twisted filament pairs and braids.” End quote. Let me explain that a little further. The US National Research Council's 1986 report of the Panel on Gravitation, Cosmology, and Cosmic-Ray Physics records the fact that, and I quote,”...the ratio of the electrostatic to the gravitational force between an electron and a proton is about 10 to the 39th power.” End quote. It's uncontroversial that the electric force is 39 powers of 10 times more powerful than the gravitational force. That is a 1 followed by 39 zeros or 1,000 billion, billion, billion, billion, times more powerful. You don't need much charge separation to occur before the electrical force will overwhelm the force of gravity. Standard Model astrophysics and cosmology gives the electric force no organizing role at the macro scale. In Standard Model astrophysics and cosmology, gravity is the fundamental organizing force in the universe at the macro scale. If there are electric currents flowing in space on the scale indicated in these images, then the Standard Model's gravity- dominated worldview simply cannot be correct. A fundamental feature of the universe has  been ignored. What's contended is first, that the force of gravity remains a mystery to astrophysicists and secondly, that gravity takes a backseat to electric currents, magnetic pinches, double layers and various plasma instabilities. It is, as Hannes Alfven put it, “Gravitational systems are the ashes of prior electrical systems.” The Electric Universe assigns a fundamental role  to gravity, which manifests in the inertial and gravitational mass of all matter. Isaac Newton  was right. As I have noted, electric currents flow in the low density plasma of interplanetary interstellar and intergalactic space, routinely self-organize as helically twisted pairs and braids. As I stated in 2021 and I quote, “...there is no tool, or combination of tools in the Standard Model toolkit that can produce helically twisted filament pairs and braids, other than by development of the physics of magnetic flux tubes which are, after all, merely an effect of electric currents.” End of quote. Evidence of helically twisted filaments and braids of the kind provided by the Webb Space Telescope's images of the cosmic cliffs and Stephan’s Quintet is proof positive of electric currents flowing in space at the macro scale, and thus proof that Standard Model astrophysics and cosmology is fundamentally flawed. It is yet another verification, and I'm confident the first of many from the Webb Space Telescope, of the illuminating and predictive power of Electric Universe cosmology [Music] 
Reinterpreting the MAVEN Mission to Mars What I want to do in this presentation is to tell you a story. Scientists have that story, of course, about Mars and they've modeled it on the story of the Earth. In fact they've already decided on the equivalent of the geological ages of the Earth for Mars. They have the Amazonian period and that kind of thing. In other words, all they've done is to transfer the story of the Earth to Mars. What I want to do is to alert you to the fact that there's a spacecraft which is due to arrive at Mars in September. Which is aimed at answering questions that the story that the scientists believe about Mars is correct. And they want to try and learn about the reason why Mars lost its water. There is this belief that there was a time when Mars was much like the Earth. But they want to find out what went wrong. I'm here to tell you that whatever conclusions they draw, it will be based on wrong ideas. So the opportunity is there for you in this audience, after I've told my story of Mars, to be able to compare it later this year, with the kinds of stories that come out of NASA and ESA. So to make it clear what this particular spacecraft is supposed to do, I have a video which will, I hope, explain it. Billions of years ago, when the planets of our solar system were still young, Mars was a very different world. Liquid water flowed in long rivers that emptied into lakes and shallow seas. A thick atmosphere blanketed the planet and kept it warm. In this cozy environment, living microbes might have found a home, starting Mars down the path toward becoming a second life-filled planet, next door to our own. But that's not how things turned out. Today, Mars is bitter- cold and desiccated. The planet's thin, wispy atmosphere provides scant cover for a surface marked by dry riverbeds and empty lakes. If Martian microbes still exist, they're probably eking out a meager existence somewhere beneath the dusty Martian soil. What happened? This haunting question has long puzzled scientists. To find the answer, NASA is sending a new orbiter to Mars called MAVEN. The goal of MAVEN is to figure out what processes were responsible for those changes in Martian climate, says Bruce Jakosky, principal investigator for MAVEN at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Scheduled for launch in November 2013 and due to arrive in September 2014, MAVEN is bristling with instruments to study Mars' upper atmosphere. That's where many researchers believe the answer lies. The only way Mars could have been wet and warm four billion years ago is, if it also had a thick atmosphere. CO₂ in the Martian atmosphere is a greenhouse gas, just as it is in our own atmosphere. A thick blanket of CO₂ and other greenhouse gases would have provided the warmer temperatures and greater atmospheric pressure required to keep liquid water from freezing solid or boiling away. Somehow, Mars lost most of that blanket. One possibility is the solar wind. Unlike Earth, Mars is not protected by a global magnetic field. Instead, it has magnetic umbrellas scattered around the planet that shelter only part of the atmosphere. Erosion of exposed areas by solar wind might have slowly stripped the atmosphere away over billions of years. Recent measurements of isotopes in the Martian atmosphere by the Mars rover Curiosity, support this idea. Light isotopes of hydrogen and argon are depleted compared to their heavier counterparts, suggesting that they have been lost to space. Scientists have also speculated that the planet's surface might have absorbed the CO₂ and locked it up in minerals such as carbonate. However, while carbonates have been found on the surface, they aren't present in enough abundance to account for an early thick atmosphere. MAVEN will be the first mission to Mars specifically designed to help scientists understand the ongoing escape of CO₂ and other gases into space. The probe will orbit Mars for at least one Earth year. At the elliptical orbit's low point, MAVEN will be 125 kilometers above the surface. Its high point will take it more than 6,000 kilometers out into space. MAVEN's instruments will track ions and molecules in this broad cross-section of the Martian atmosphere thoroughly documenting the flow of CO₂ and other molecules into space for the first time. MAVEN's instruments also will measure the solar energetic inputs into the Martian upper atmosphere, and the atmospheric response. This will allow us to determine the processes that are responsible for that loss to space. Once Jakosky and his colleagues know how quickly Mars is losing CO₂ right now and what might be causing that loss, they can extrapolate backward in time to estimate the total amount lost during the last four billion years. MAVEN will determine if loss to space was the most important player in driving Martian climate change, Jakosky says. In the grand scheme of the solar system, Earth orbits alongside a world that began with as much promise for life as our own yet turned out so differently. After all these years, MAVEN could write the final chapter in a haunting planetary mystery. What we have here? A whole string of wrong ideas about Mars, the history of the solar system, the history of the Earth, and the recent history of these planets. So this 4.6 billion year old clockwork solar system is a myth! Of course, by studying mostly meteorites and using radioactive dating techniques, specifically looking at daughter isotopes, scientists think they have determined that the solar system is 4.6 billion years old. But this requires that the solar system has not been disturbed to any great degree since it was formed. It also relies on the idea that it was formed in the way that was advertised and that is via a nebula. What I want to do in this talk is to show you that the story is completely different and it's much more interesting than the fairy tale we've been taught. No theory of planet formation works. But that doesn't stop us seeing and hearing through the media the familiar story about the 4.6 billion year old formation of the planets. In the case of the Earth, there is all these unanswered questions. Why do we have an atmosphere of oxygen? Where did all the nitrogen come from? And why do we have so much water? In fact, why is there so much sodium chloride in the water? None of these questions are really answered by the standard theory. The speculative story of Earth's history involving catastrophic extensions, has been concocted and as I said, Mars has a fabricated history too, with the Amazonian, the Noachian periods. The Electric Universe accepts evidence that petroglyphs are an enduring record of the frightening collapse of a former cosmos. And this is the starting point of this new story. It has taken ten thousand years for us to be able to see in laboratory plasma discharge experiments, what our forebears saw in awesome cosmic proportions in the sky. I would say that petroglyphs are the Rosetta Stones of the recent history of the solar system. The monumental effort involved in carving them shows that what was happening in the celestial arena was of paramount concern to the prehistoric artists. It was a concern that still has echoes in our doomsday nightmares. Velikovsky challenged astronomers again at the 1974 AAA's ambush in San Francisco. He said, "I was greatly surprised to find that astronomy, the Queen of Sciences, lives still in the pre-Faraday age, not even in the time of kerosene lamps, but candles and oil. Nothing has changed. So powerful is the Newtonian ideology. The evidential history is quite different. And this story is built on the evidence looking at, from the point of view of Velikovsky and those mytho-historians like David Talbott, Dwardu Cardona and Ev Cochrane, who have extended his research. The first thing is that, to deal with is the idea that Saturn had a former state as a brown dwarf. And a brown dwarf is not actually a dwarf star in the Electric Universe, it is quite huge. The planet's, Saturn's, entourage of satellites and planets actually existed within a vast glowing plasmasphere. For instance, it's been said that if we could witness Jupiter's plasmasphere from the Earth when it's in opposition, it would appear the size of the full Moon or the Sun in the sky. So if you can imagine Proto-Saturn having that kind of size, all of the satellites of Saturn and also if you would apply that to Jupiter, those inner satellites will all be within that plasmasphere. Brown dwarfs flare and this is a surprise to astronomers because they're supposed to be failed stars, they shouldn't have the energy to flare. But they do! So they must dump matter on their satellites. And this can be an answer to many conundrums about the formation of the planets. Water. We know that Saturn, the rings of Saturn are water ice so here is the origin of the water for the Earth. Oxygen, reddish light, low-gravity, gave rise to the Earth's plant and animal gigantism. The era of megafauna and megaflora. Evidence of the breakup of this earlier system given in "Symbols of an Alien Sky" and Dwardu Cardona's "Star" series of books, has been around for some years now and is available for research for those who would like to test these ideas against what the MAVEN mission finds. And of course as we've seen, the hard evidence of the thunderbolts between planets which sculpted the Martian surface, came from high-energy plasma experiments. So this is a summary, Earth and Mars where planets orbiting a brown dwarf star in a previous life. You could say that we are the aliens in this solar system. It was the most hospitable environment for life. This is something that astronomers have come to recognize in recent years. However, they still talk about a Goldilocks zone. If a planet orbiting around a faint dwarf star or red dwarf star, is in a particular orbit, it can harbor life. What I'm saying is different. The Electric Universe proposes that the real environment for life is within the actual glowing huge envelope of these red stars. The atmosphere, water and minerals are deposited and this can explain layering of moons and planets. The system broke up on encountering the Sun and I will describe this in detail. And interplanetary Thunderbolts stripped the surface of Mars. So let's talk with, actually we've presented quite a bit of material in this conference about stars and planets forming in cosmic Thunderbolts. So we can expect that the Earth and Mars and Saturn, or Proto-Saturn as we call it in its stellar form, were formed in one of these cosmic lightning bolts in a molecular cloud close enough together. So that once the discharge abated, they were able to form a small planetary system. Now one of the things about stars formed in this model, and it refers both to Don Scott's presentation and also to Marklund convection. As Don said, the heavy elements concentrate at the center of these discharges. So the cores of stars are composed of heavy elements. That's not hydrogen. So there can be no hydrogen fusion at the center of the Sun or of any star. They all have cool, heavy element cores. In the Electric Universe model and I've written about this on my website, electricity plays a central role in both the capture and the stabilization of orbits. So that capture is far more likely in the Electric Universe than in the gravitational universe. In fact, this is one of the difficulties that astronomers have to deal with early on, was that a body passing by the Sun will normally just swing past it and then off again. There's nothing to reduce the energy of the incoming object so that it is captured. But in the Electric Universe, as I will discuss, that is possible. In fact, it's likely. The other thing is that one of the big puzzles that have affected planetary scientists in recent years with the discovery of so many so-called exoplanets that is planets around nearby stars, is that they found these hot Jupiters orbiting the central star extremely closely. Some of them going around in a matter of hours or days. There is another aspect of the formation of stars and that is that, if an instability occurs during the formation of the star as I've discussed the other day, each celestial body has an internal electric field, positive charge towards the center, negative charge at the surface. If you can imagine, if the center of the object is positively charged and has a slight displacement, then there is an accelerating electric force which can actually cause the object to fission. And this may be the explanation for why stars exist in a narrow range of sizes. This is also not explained well by the gravitational story. So in the Electric Universe, brown dwarfs are not failed stars too low in mass to sustain hydrogen fusion reactions. As I said, there are no hydrogen fusion reactions, stars are powered electrically. Red dwarfs, shining brightest in infrared, represent about 70% of the stars in the Milky Way. So these are the most likely places to find life. Those faint dwarf stars might be called the galaxy's, (pardon me), silent majority. But red dwarfs come with a major drawback. Their stellar radii are hard to determine accurately. And this is where the astronomers have missed the point that red dwarfs are not dwarf stars. They are huge. All red stars are huge for the simple reason that a star that does not, is not capable of attracting sufficient electrons to satisfy the current demands of their electrical environment, will expand their photosphere. In fact, the red dwarfs and so on, don't actually have a bright photosphere. So the plasma sheath around them expands until it can attract, intercept sufficient electrons to maintain the discharge. These pictures here of red stars you can see, some of the stars are so big, the giant ones, that they can be measured from the Earth. Betelgeuse is a good example which, it's envelope would actually reach to the orbit of Jupiter. So in that particular case, if Betelgeuse does have satellites, they are orbiting within that red glowing sphere. Our brown dwarf is no different. You don't have to have different models for different stars in the Electric Universe. So a brown dwarf is a small star with a very large glowing envelope. Jupiter, the gas giants and so on, if you like. If Jupiter and Saturn were now taken outside the solar system, they would once again become brown dwarfs. In December 2008, NASA found that the brightness of a nearby brown dwarf, at 17 light years distance, was twice that expected for a brown dwarf with its particular temperature. This is using the standard model of stars. So the solution? Completely ad-hoc, the object must have twice the surface area. It must be twins. Now the Electric Universe says, I mean, that is just an amazing ad-hoc solution. The spectra of red dwarfs are crowded with molecular absorption features that are not well understood. So it's hard to extract the physical properties of a given red dwarf from its spectrum. That is also interesting. But the fact that there are so many molecular absorption features, indicates that all of the requirements for life exists within that glowing envelope. So all stars are electric. All stars or red stars are gigantic. Planets can orbit within their anode glow. And even astronomers acknowledge that. They have suggested that there could be satellites orbiting within the Betelgeuse glow. However, with their notion that the red giant is formed by an ultra hot core, those plants would not be suitable for life. In the Electric Universe it has a cool core. Objects orbiting within the red envelope are suitable for life! Now one of the very interesting things is that there are no seasons on any satellites orbiting within that red sphere. Because the energy received on any body within that sphere, is equal over the entire surface of that body so that a planet orbiting within that red sphere has no seasons. Even temperatures. In fact, I would say the brown dwarfs are the cosmic wombs of life in the universe. One of the interesting facts of course that would suddenly come out of this, is that these red spheres are glowing plasma and glowing plasma will not let radio waves pass through. So the search for extraterrestrial intelligence using radio waves is in my opinion a wasted effort. Because anyone living on a satellite inside one of these glowing red wombs, would not even be aware that there was a greater universe out there full of stars. Let alone try and use radio because any radio signals would not pierce that, that plasma. Just an interesting side issue here. So this is my view of Proto-Saturn and I've just put two satellites there but there are obviously more. Titan for instance, would have been one of the satellites... Earth and Mars. So there they are inside this glowing shell, and the evidence of the earliest recollections of mankind appears to be that the purple dawn of creation was the, the sky light. That was the color of the sky. Purple dawn. And that is precisely the color you would expect in this circumstance because you have the red end of the spectrum and you also have a certain amount of the violet and ultraviolet light due to electrical activity in the plasma. So this fits with the, if you like, the earliest recollections of mankind that that was our environment. 50% of red dwarfs have Earth-sized planets in their habitable zone. Remember, I said that astronomers feel this is the place where life is most likely to be found. Now if you look at Jupiter for instance and consider that as a red dwarf, and its plasma sphere was lit up, Io has a 1.75 day orbit, Europa has a 3.5 day orbit, Ganymede 7 days and Callisto 17 days. Any of the satellites that were released from Jupiter's grip, would have a rotation rate which equaled their daily rotation rate because they're locked always with the same face towards the central body. It suggests that the Earth and Mars had orbits which were about a day in length. This is the kind of information that you can get from this kind of model. The other thing is, you'll notice in this diagram there is no Venus. So we have huge red anode glow which was what we call Proto-Saturn. We had a 'purple dawn' of creation and no Venus. These are the important things to understand about Proto-Saturn. Just recently, a map of a nearby Red Dwarf was produced using a Doppler imaging technique. It's one of a pair of red dwarfs near Alpha Centauri with a separation of three astronomical units. There's a bright near-polar region which can be clearly seen in the upper right panels. And a darker mid-latitude area visible in the lower left panels is consistent with large-scale cloud inhomogeneities. However, that's an assumption that what we're looking at is an atmosphere. But we're not looking at an atmosphere. We're looking at a plasma sheath. So that this variation, said in the Electric Universe model, would be due to objects orbiting within that plasma sheath, either inside or outside that plasma sheath because that would affect the discharge. The other thing is that this bright spot towards the pole, is the same kind of thing that's found with Betelgeuse, the red giant, which indicates that that's the electrical connection with the Birkeland currents that drive these particular stars. If I'm right, the patterns here should be more repetitive than weather patterns and without banding like Jupiter, which is undetectable so far by this technique but you never know what they can do tomorrow. Red Dwarfs and Giants changing radius, which is not the kind of thing that you would expect if this is a normal body. However this change in radius is the star's response to changes in its electrical environment. It's quite natural. It's a plasma effect. They also tend to flicker in brightness. All of this is indicative of a star lacking the stabilizing effect of the bright photosphere of bright stars. That's according to Don Scott's transistor model. That is a stabilizing influence in all bright stars. Red stars don't have that luxury. Proto-Saturn's Capture This is the interesting part of it. This took me decades to try and figure out because the model of planets arranged with their poles in a line is unstable. There's no Newtonian theory to explain a daisy-chain of planets. So it eventually dawned on me that what we had was a dynamic arrangement where Proto-Saturn which is in this diagram over here, that's Proto-Saturn, and you can just see a few little brighter red dots behind it. They are the Earth and Mars and other satellites. That's meant to represent those satellites. The explanation came to me once I had realized that the stabilization of the planetary orbits as we see them today... Why is the Newtonian system a clockwork system, or it appears to be a clockwork system, when you only have one force? Well the answer is you cannot have a stable system with one force. There has to be a feedback mechanism. And as I explained the other day, you can change the mass of a planet or a star by either placing charge on it or taking charge away. And it occurred to me that a small star like Proto-Saturn entering the environment of the Sun, would suffer a drastic change in its electrical environment with a result, actually that Proto-Saturn would have become one gigantic comet. Because a body which is negatively charged with respect to its environment, is a cometary body, and a body that's positively charged with respect of its environment is an anode in the discharge and it is a star. So this was a change, a sudden change, once Proto-Saturn approached the solar system at that time closely. At least, it would have been most drastic once it entered the heliosphere, the boundary of the sun's environment with interstellar space. So Saturn as a comet is removing electrons and the result is that it is losing mass, it's accelerating towards the Sun. The bodies behind it... Actually, sorry, I got that around the wrong way. The Proto-Saturn itself is losing electrons as comets do. They are being passed on to the, its satellites. The satellites are gaining in mass, Saturn is losing in mass. Conservation of energy says that Proto-Saturn accelerates towards the Sun and this is part of the electrical capture mechanism. The Earth and Mars and the other satellites gaining in mass will tend to fall behind and line up, rather like comet Shoemaker-Levy 9. The electrical discharge, the polar discharge, in my opinion, then is the central column of Saturn's cometary discharge. We were sitting in this cometary tail, right in the middle of it. And all of the plasma discharge effects that were witnessed by the ancients and chiseled into rock, come from that period of capture. I've said, as the cometary body Proto-Saturn loses electrons. It accelerates towards the Sun. All of this could explain all of the plasma phenomena, discharge phenomena recounted by Dave Talbott and Dwardu Cardona. The latest measurements by Pitjeva and Standish suggest the astronomical unit is increasing about 23 feet per century. That means that the Earth is actually, its orbit is shifting over time. But according to the beliefs of astronomers, the astronomical unit shouldn't change at all. The mechanism I'm describing for the modification of gravity provides a mechanism that can be tested because the Earth's orbit expansion should be a discontinuous function with discrete jumps following major solar storms and at Venus's inferior conjunction when it actually, we sit in the cometary tail of Venus. So there are various means of testing these ideas too, outrageous as they may seem. This is Saturn. In June 19, 2004, I posted on my website Cassini's homecoming. Before the Cassini mission began to send all of the detailed information back about Saturn. And I wrote back then, "a scenario follows that is so alien to any conventional theory of Saturn's history that it should be easily tested against any information gained from the Cassini mission. It shows striking connections between many seemingly unrelated facts about certain planets." Because if the planets that I mentioned were part of the same family in the past, we should be able to see family resemblances. "That is something that conventional cosmogony has not been able to do." That was the end of the quote. For instance, the tilt of Saturn at 27 degrees to the ecliptic plane is itself an enigma unless it formed independently from the Sun. The axial tilts of Saturn, Earth and Mars are very similar. The short-lived rings of water ice that... It's been said by astronomers that they shouldn't last for any length of time, geologically speaking. And yet here they are, brilliant. And as I said before, it gives us a clue as to the origin of all of the water on Earth. We come to Titan because Titan has been examined closely in recent years and it also had the Huygens probe which landed on the surface. I was very pleased that that happened because I predicted what will be found beneath the clouds and I was proven correct. Before the spacecraft descended to the surface, it was thought that Titan must be covered in a methane ocean simply because methane is found in the atmosphere of Titan and it cannot have been there for 4 billion years because it's dissipated continuously. But if Titan (were) lost, lost its place in its original birthplace, only a few thousand years ago, then it hasn't had time to lose this methane. Before the Huygens Lander pierced the clouds and we could see the surface for the first time, I said that Titan would have a surface that looked like the Earth or Mars. And that was proven correct. There wasn't an ocean of methane. Also it has an enigmatic thick nitrogen atmosphere. It has a very thick nitrogen atmosphere. And when you think about it, the Earth has mostly nitrogen in its atmosphere. There's no good explanation for why that should be so. So we come to Titan's big brother, us! Brown dwarfs are noted for flaring. That is, they suddenly brighten and appear to eject material. As I said, that's the only way they have to adjust to their electrical environment. The flare ejects stellar material from the brown dwarf equatorially, preferentially, or axially if it's really serious. So its satellites have solids, liquids and gases rained down on them. The composition will vary depending on the depth from which matter was dredged up from the star and the orbital encounter of the stream of matter with each satellite. It usually comes out in a stream. This helps explain the layering seen on solid planets, moons, asteroids and comets and it can explain global mineral strata on the Earth. Venus is interesting. Its rotation is anomalous, its heat is anomalous, its atmosphere is anomalous. Venus' slow retrograde rotation and odd axial tilt are, in my opinion, due to ejection from Proto-Saturn as observed and recorded by the ancients. "[Venus shows] a surprisingly young surface" and this is a quote from one of the early reports. So the astronomers then had the problem. Maybe it's been resurfaced and that, so that was the explanation. Venus were underwent some drastic resurfacing in recent times. But there's no need for that, if it's newborn. The other thing that's obvious in this picture is this belt of scars around the equator. But the ancients also witnessed planet-girdling filamentary scars. Well, they didn't witness the scars but they saw the discharge in the sky. And this is obvious in Dave Talbott's reconstructions with those radiating streams. And remember, we were underneath the pole of Venus at that time. So those streams are coming from the equator. And they are typical of electrical scars from lightning through a thick atmosphere. The electrical universe account explains many odd things about Venus. Its hellish temperature was born from the cool star, Proto-Saturn. So this gives you an idea of the kind of temperature of the core of a star like a red dwarf. It has a thick 96% carbon dioxide and 4% nitrogen atmosphere plus a bit of a few hydrocarbons. It also has some water in the atmosphere but strangely the water decreases until it becomes extremely dry near the surface. And this is a puzzle. If you think about it, you've got a surface which is of red-hot minerals and you've got this thick atmosphere of nitrogen. It was Louis Kervran, the French scientists who in years gone by showed that nitrogen on a red-hot iron surface can actually be transmuted to carbon monoxide. And there's a process that was used some time in the past to produce hydrogen for burning, you know, home fuel, which used heat, carbon monoxide and water and the water is split to form carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The hydrogen is lost to space and the carbon dioxide of the nitrogen which was once Venus's atmosphere is now carbon dioxide. The process is still going on because the water disappears near the surface where the reaction takes place. So the Venusian atmosphere is an altered version of Titan's atmosphere where nitrogen is being converted to carbon monoxide and into carbon dioxide. Because the atmosphere is so much thicker than that on Earth, Venus's total nitrogen is actually four times more than the Earth's. Let's get back to battle-scarred Mars and this will sort of, lead into the next presentation by Steve Smith. The evidence of Mars' battles with Thunderbolts is written hugely on its scarface. And I wrote, many years ago now, that the huge scar here which extends about a third of the way around the planet, is actually in the form of the most prevalent and most colossal electric discharge in the universe -- that of a barred spiral galaxy. So Mars was stripped of rocks, atmosphere and water. The form of a barred spiral is there, that's just the central part of a spiral galaxy. And the pattern I recognized because this puzzled me for decades, is how did you actually form that huge gash on the planet. And it appears that it came in the form of twin Birkeland currents which are the central axis of a barred spiral and the pattern on Mars is exactly the same. Where you get, the pattern becomes chaotic up towards the left and down here. This is the chaos region. It extends all the way down here Up here you get all these giant channels which come all the way up here. So this is a pattern of a gigantic electrical discharge. And of course, this will rip material off the surface and eject it into space. We're still receiving Mars rocks on Earth today. And there's no good explanation for that in terms of impacts because you would expect that the material would be vaporized rather than forming rocks. This poor planet was severely damaged because it was, acted like a an oscillating charge carrier. It was between Proto-Saturn, you had Proto-Saturn, Venus, Mars and Earth and Mars would move up towards Venus, get zapped, if you'd like to put it that way, and then carry the charge down to the Earth where it would discharge to the Earth. This is why it was regarded as a colossal threat and the God of War because it was the planet that did most of the charge transfer to the Earth. But in the process of charge transfer, it ripped the surface apart. But if you remember and this is important, it occupied a similar place to the Earth in the cosmic womb of Proto-Saturn. So it's quite likely that it had an environment pre- the catastrophes that was very much like the Earth. So we have misunderstood Mars. This is an artist's impression of an early wet Mars. Late Hesperian, this is one of these other, so-called geological, eras on Mars, mythical ones. The up-flow channels are shown. But of course, they may be correct insofar as there was probably water on Mars because it occupied Proto-Saturn's environment. The geologic history of Mars from oldest to youngest are: the Noachian, the Hesperian and the Amazonian. They are defined by the number of meteorite impact craters and here we run into the problem of what kind of craters are they really. If they're electrical craters, they cannot be used for dating. But the Electric Universe says that hemispheric cratering... Northern hemisphere is, there is kilometres of matter been removed from the northern hemisphere. All of this can happen in a single Cataclysm. Martian geological history is a myth. The Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution or MAVEN mission is to study the loss of atmosphere today and extrapolate backwards over 4 billion years to figure out what happened to make the Martian environment so different to the Earth's. I predict the evidence will make no sense for the conventional evolutionary story. But that will not be enough to discard it. The comforting dogma of evolution in place for four billion years requires extraordinary disproof. What will scientists do when lazy retro- calculation and speculation are discredited by proof of sudden catastrophe and links to other members of its original family? So strong is the attachment to the old fairy tale that I'm confident, ad hoc adjustments will be made and anomalies filed a way to be figured out someday or forgotten. As the philosopher David Stove wrote: "Newtonian physics is a guarantee against the occurrence of just about anything disagreeable." The irony for us is that Mars was more Earth-like within the time of modern humans on Earth. After all, until recently we shared the same cozy stellar womb. Life on Mars should have stood an equal chance before the hapless small planet became both a ruddy symbol and a casualty of celestial war. Shrapnel from those prehistoric battles still arrive on Earth today. The story of Mars is far more dramatic and catastrophic than anything dreamt up by theorists or imagined by science fiction writers. Our challenge will be to make sense of data from the MAVEN mission that conforms to the evidence gleaned from prehistoric eyewitnesses of Martian events. They were events beyond all Newtonian imagining. Thank you. Thunderbolts.info 
The Electric Universe is an amazing story and it's my view that humanity, each of us, operates according to a story and sometimes we're so attached to those stories that we'll go to war over it. Now the EU story is in my view an interdisciplinary story which touches everyone at some point. In fact, the Electric Universe Conferences have shown that we can draw people from all disciplines and all walks of life and inspire them because it is an inspiring story and it got its start from my inspiration. The inspiration came from Velikovsky. That's not to say that everything that Velikovsky wrote was correct but he, on certain techniques, this forensic technique of looking at so-called unreliable witnesses, the witnesses of the ancient past, you can actually draw from that evidence a picture of what was happening and then you are faced with the problem of trying to explain it. And my role in all of this has been to look at the evidence that was amassed and then try and explain it. And that has meant dumping a lot of the cherished beliefs, the story that I was brought up with.   Okay. Complexity theory says that you can start with a set of simple rules and repeat those rules, generation after generation, and within a very short time the complexity that arises from those simple rules can be quite amazing. But the other interesting thing about complexity theory it says that you can't work backwards to deduce what those simple rules were in the beginning. Unfortunately the story that we live by, the Big Bang cosmology, treats the complexity that we find now by introducing new forces and new particles, new entities at every turn in an effort to try and match the observations. The Electric Universe operates by trying to imagine what those original simple rules were and thus the result of that has been a synthesis which allows us to get a grasp on how the universe really works in an electrical sense. It's very simple, you could begin to teach it to primary school students and certainly college students would grab it easily. But the other part of it is that it's not only interdisciplinary but it shows how we're all connected and I think this is the big story for the future, is this connectedness instead of the divisions that occur. This has been, as I've discovered, as you get to a certain age you look back over your career and you join the dots and I've been amazed to find that I actually began this journey around the age of 5 or 6 at primary school. The... In fact, I think I'll start at that point. Go back to my primary school. So this is my story. I was born in Melbourne, Australia in 1942, so in the 40's I was at primary school in an outer suburb of Melbourne. The surroundings there were not the, not what you'd call middle class. We didn't have much, my father was invalided after the war and so we were living on a pension but in those days that didn't seem to matter, everyone was more or less doing the best they could after the war. I had a favourite uncle who was a commando in New Guinea and he introduced me to the telescope, he used to show me the moon through the, his army field telescope. He was also a very creative guy and he made a beautiful, beautifully constructed crystal set, which he gave me. So this introduced me to radio. I ended up making crystal sets to order for all the kids at school who wanted one. The other thing that he introduced me to was reading the encyclopedia and so I had the habit of going to school memorizing, having memorized all these facts and made drawings of eclipsing binaries and that sort of stuff and boring the kids in my class with my discoveries. Somebody who made an impression on me too in those, later on in school was Sir Fred Hoyle or just plain Fred at that stage with his wide-ranging ideas and the fact that he didn't like the Big Bang, I've got a little quote there from his book, "The big bang ideas seemed to me to be unsatisfactory even before detailed examination showed that it leads to serious difficulties." When I got to high school, it was about halfway through high school, my father brought home from the military hospital a red-covered book 'Worlds in Collision' by Immanuel Velikovsky and he said, now you might have interest in astronomy, I think you'll be... you will find this interesting. It wasn't just interesting. I'd never read anything like it before! And I think, when you consider that it was a best-seller for many months running in 1950, that many other people thought the same thing. It drew together evidence which showed that the ancient skies were quite different to the ones we see now! And that was inspiring. It gave me another idea to work with. My first thought was well, surely all my teachers can't have been wrong for all this time so I questioned people and when I went to university I went to the physics department and this is the entrance to the Melbourne University Physics Department and embossed in the limestone above the doorway are the words ― School of Natural Philosophy. Well my view was that at university any question could be asked, nothing was taboo and that you could expect a reasonable answer or at least a statement that you don't know. That's not what I got. I found either avoidance of answering the question or outright hostility and that really surprised me and disappointed me. So any... I stopped asking questions about Velikovsky but I decided that as a science undergraduate I would also read books from the anthropology section of the library and in doing so I felt even more strongly that Velikovsky had made a case to answer because I was reading books that he had not referred to and yet the story that he had pieced together left off the pages. Myths from the South Sea Islanders and middle India places like that. So I felt that this dismissal of Velikovsky at the university was unwarranted and ill-advised since I felt he'd provided good evidence that the solar system had changed within human memory. So I was working on my slides the other night and lo and behold there was an advertisement that came through from the National University. I come from Canberra, that's the national capital in Australia. And what it said was that professor Lawrence Krauss presents the greatest story ever told so far. Now I've witnessed Lawrence Krauss speaking to the experts, the astrophysicists at the National University's Research School of Astrophysics, I'm in the great position of being only 10 to 15 minutes drive from the top of Mount Stromlo, the observatory and where they hold these meetings. So I've seen him in action. That's his book 'A Universe From Nothing', the very title makes no sense whatsoever. The introduction, this is yet to happen so I may actually attend this when I go home. The introduction is by Nobel laureate professor Brian Schmidt I have... We actually had a set-to in the national newspaper a few years ago. An amicable one and I tried to organize a meeting with him to have coffee. This is before he got the Nobel Prize. Also I should mention that Brian Schmidt is the Nobel Prize winner who was involved in devising another entity, dark energy, for the accelerated expansion of the universe or at least that's their interpretation. I quote from the blurb that goes with this advertisement and this is ironic, "The real story of the universe is much more interesting and exciting than the unsubstantiated and bland myth pervaded by the ancients." I could hardly believe my luck when I saw this. And it's this kind of dismissal of any kind of history. The idea that science has reached some kind of pinnacle and you only have to deal with research over the last few years to do good research is completely wrong! It's my experience that in order to find the answers you have to go back and look at the historical controversies that were, that raged often for decades or more and look at how it was resolved. And usually it was on the basis of who was the most powerful politically or somewhere in the power structure in science or it was just the case of a show of hands. And as they say, science isn't a democracy or the scien... the science that we accept should not be but on the basis of a vote. "Professor Lawrence Krauss describes the remarkable scientific story that has led to the greatest intellectual edifice ever created by humans, the Standard Model." The strange thing is that we hear these mantras delivered by experts on television with no thought to the fact that there are so many problems that are unresolved in the Standard Model but these are glossed over as if somehow we've almost got the answers. I think the thing about this is what I'm saying was reinforced that this is all about stories. We need a better story! Big Bang cosmology, when you look at the history, sprang from mathematics, pure mathematics and religious beliefs. So the Big Bang is a myth! Once upon a time long long ago there was nothing, which exploded. So here we have nothing doing something. In contrast, the Electric Universe began by analyzing global cosmic myths and this is the inspiration that Velikovsky passed on to those who were inspired at the time and for myself I'm just grateful that I had the doggedness to keep pursuing it all my life. And as a result of the interdisciplinary nature and the number of scholars from all different fields, it's become an astonishing story that shows our real place in the universe, so far. This is an example of the problem you have when your story differs from someone else's. Here we have Steve Crothers, another Australian by the way, who has presented at one of our EU conferences recently and I believe also at the NPA. And he attended last month a meeting in Russia, as you can see the the kind of titles there, and he was an early speaker so what he had to say should have been quite relevant to everything that followed. It was "Flaws in Black Hole theory and General Relativity." Now he has explained this to a general audience in the Electric Universe and they all got it, you don't need to know advanced mathematics to be able to see the flaws in the thinking that go into black hole theory and general relativity. And I recommend following him up on the web if you would like to get a hold of his papers. This is his comments after the event, "I spoke at a conference in Protvino, Russia. I made it so simple" and this is what he's very good at "that all understood and they were very displeased. During question time, they went on the attack but could offer no counter arguments and instead tried to evade the issues." This is exactly the kind of thing that I discovered at university. "Others told me" and get this "that I should not criticize if I did not offer an alternative theory." That's just crazy, I mean science is about testing and if you get disconfirming evidence then that should be a spur to more inventive ideas and an advance in science. The idea that you have to have an alternative theory to replace one that you're discrediting is nonsense. "Nobody would talk to me afterwards." "So what did they collectively decide to do in the end? Pretend that nothing has changed and go on regardless." The following couple of days were about black holes, the Big Bang and everything that he had just discredited. Business as usual. And one of the people who were inspired by Velikovsky, and in turn inspired me since I was looking for answers to how all of the things that Velikovsky had described could have happened, is Ralph Juergens. And I saw him in action at a conference in 1974, that was my first real contact with him but everything he wrote I devoured because he was a very thorough researcher and his insights, I thought, were almost as amazing as Velikovsky's. Since then some things we now know, In fact at the time the neutrino account was also a problem and it continued to be a problem for decades until somebody managed to find some kind of story to cover the problem. The solar wind acceleration still remains a mystery. The super hot corona is still a mystery although many people think they have a solution. Solar activity cycles, still a mystery. The solar convection has been found to be practically absent. And this is supposed to drive everything that we see going on above the Sun. And the Heliospheric boundary, the interface between the solar system and interstellar space has also defied all expectations and this has been good for me because I've been describing what I felt would be found out there and so far it matches. This is the time that I met Velikovsky. It was the first international conference on the recent history of the solar system. Now according to astronomers, of course, there is no such thing as a recent history especially not within mankind's term on this planet. That's a photo I took of Velikovsky from the front of the hall but you get an idea of the audience there. He was able to draw quite a crowd from around the world. Of course his challenge to the mainstream was that, as he said in the opening pages of his book 'Worlds in Collision', if Newton's laws are sacrosanct this book is a heresy and the response of the professional astronomers at the time was to ignore the gauntlet that he'd thrown down and just say Newton's laws are sacrosanct and just, you can ignore the rest. What we now think we know is that our solar system appears to be weird when compared to planetary systems around nearby stars. The Uranus and Neptune could not have formed where we see them. So now you'll see papers appearing frequently talking about rearrangement of orbits, the possibility of an extra gas giant having been present initially which then somehow managed to push two of the other gas giants which became Uranus and Neptune further out into the solar system. And also when we look out at the exoplanets, they appear to be impossible according to the standard theory of how our solar system was formed. So there's a severe problem in even explaining why we're here. Now the organizers of that conference appear on this page. On the right is Steven Talbott, that's Dave's younger brother. It was he who I wrote to and he was the main correspondent that got me to the conference. He invited me to come over. It was there also that I met Dave Talbott. At the time neither of us knew what the other was up to and in fact I'm not sure that we knew what we were up to. But we... It turns out that we'd both been inspired by a short paper that Velikovsky had written about the idea, the outrageous idea that Saturn featured as a Sun in early human memory and that idea to me was the genesis of the idea that the solar system has not only changed but it's actually a work in progress, it had formed by the capture of other objects. I was an avid reader, of course, of all the Pensée Journals, they were extremely well produced, and that was the vehicle that got me to the U.S. to Canada for this meeting. Then it was 20 years later. I had David's book 'The Saturn Myth' and a friend of mine said, "I'd like a copy" and I said, well I'll see if I can contact David. When I rang David it was just serendipitous that it was the year that he had organized an international conference in Portland, Oregon and after I inquired about the book, he said, have you got anything you'd like to present at this conference that I'm about to put on? And I said - Yes I have! And so I was invited to that conference. And it was there that the collaboration began. There was another scientist who was involved with Ralph Juergens, towards the end of Ralph's life. He was an associate professor at the University of Lethbridge in Alberta, Canada. Dr. Earl Milton, his main training was in spectroscopy. He came to Australia and stayed with our family. His family and he joined us at the time that Halley's Comet was in the sky. He felt that the southern skies were the best place to view it. He wrote at one point, "What goes on inside stars is a sort of fantasy which we all subscribe to because none of us have seen what happens inside stars. All we can observe is the radiation that emerges from the stars' surfaces, and what happens to the atmosphere transmitting that radiation." And being a spectroscopist, the next statement is of significance for the Electric Universe model of the Sun. "The major solar spectroscopic identifications represent much more dense materials than implied by the defined density of the Sun." It implies that what's inside the Sun is not what we think it is. He was also well aware of the problems that we faced. "The conspiracy of silence which was imposed by powerful scientists in 1950 upon Velikovsky's work remains essentially intact today in the halls of academia." That was in 1983 when he and I were both in London. Nothing's changed! I had the privilege in 1979, that's five years after the conference, in Canada, to be in Washington, here, working for the Australian government for a few weeks and I rang Velikovsky at his home and mentioned the fact that we'd met at the conference and would it be okay if I visited. He and his wife graciously took me, my wife and three daughters in for the afternoon and my main question to him was, it centered around this problem of what don't we understand about gravity and Newton's law? Because this was critical. His view was that there was electromagnetism somehow involved in the process. So (he) gave me this small monograph which was published in 1946, called 'Cosmos Without Gravitation'. Now the title is a bit misleading because gravity exists, of course, and I think it's useful to maintain the distinction between gravity and the other forms of the electric force, that is magnetism. But in that book he gave a clue. "...in the theory presented here, this attraction is not due to 'inherent gravitational' properties of mass, but instead to the well-known electrical properties of attraction. Two dipoles arrange themselves so that the attraction is stronger than their mutual repulsion." Now chemists know this because all of the visible world that we live in depends upon this dipole to dipole interaction. And when I went back I thought, I'll have a look at the difference between the chemical textbooks and the physics textbooks to see just how close the chemists were to the answer rather than the physicists. That was striking! The physics textbook had only a cursory derivation of the forces between dipoles, the chemical one went into great detail. You know, charged particle to induced electric dipole, induced electric dipole to induced electric dipole and so on. It was about 6 or 7 different versions, each one had a slightly different equation to describe it. And it's significant, I think, that certain well-known scientists in the past, Fritz London was one of them, suggested that gravity might be the same kind of intermolecular force, the thing that holds the solids and the liquids and so on together that gives us the world we exist in. But this was the clue. It had something to do with electric dipoles which, in neutral matter, still attract. So two years later, in 1981 there was a tiny advertisement in the Scientific American for the Journal of Classical Physics. The first article was by Ralph Sansbury. It turns out he was the originator of this journal and its title was Electron Structure. And I thought well this is, if we're talking about electric dipoles and the electron has structure, this is the first place to look. And so I contacted Ralph and we actually met in London, shortly after. Now I enjoyed Ralph's derivation because it is simple, it's a case of a repeated pattern, you take the atomic structure and you suggest that perhaps subatomic particles have the similar structure and because atoms can be distorted to form electric dipoles that means that subatomic particles can also be distorted to form subatomic dipoles and the resulting attraction between them, because of the difference in size which is colossal, gives you the reason why gravity is 10 to the 40 times less stronger than the naked electric force. Anyway, he derived Ampere's law from this simple model, I thought that was an excellent start. Well, one of the requirements of his theory is that the electron stability requires that all of these particles communicate amongst one another near-instantly, otherwise you cannot hold the electron together, it's not coherent. And that speed of the electric force is colossal. This type of mechanism explains gravity simply if you involve all particles in this process. It explains Mach's principle, this idea that all the matter in the universe is connected, only here you have all the matter in the galaxy is connected in real time. And it discards all of these virtual particles, the wave/particle duality. The Speed of Gravity Tom van Flandern who attended many of our early meetings, he showed simply that the speed of gravity exceeds 20 billion times the speed of light. Now that was a lower limit. If that weren't so, a torque would fling the planets out of the solar system in a few thousand years. It's because we would not be orbiting where the Sun is but where it appears to be in the sky and the result is that the forces coming from an angle which tends to act like a slingshot. So his view and his simple observation fits Sansbury's electrical model of gravity and he argued also, a separate argument, for the origin of comets and asteroids from an exploding planet. He felt they had a common origin in some event. The year 2000, it was about September I think, we had a very significant meeting of the Electric Universe proponents in Portland, Oregon and at that meeting there was the astronomer Halton Arp, there was Tony Peratt, the leading plasma physicist, Tom Van Flandern was there and we had scholars involved in the mythological aspects, and professor Don Scott. So we had two former Sagnac Award winners at that meeting, this is the kind of meeting it was, it was really outstanding. But the most significant thing there was that Tony Peratt, who worked at the Los Alamos labs, had access to information that no one else did and that was the form of plasma instabilities when you create the most powerful electrical discharges that man can do on Earth. And when you do that, you get the kind of forms like that one seen in purple on the right. And because the plasma is semi-transparent, certain aspects of it, the edges, become strongly visible. In fact, sometimes the light from this can be so intense it can actually be lethal, it ranges up into the X-rays. Just faintly behind that, you see some of the weird figures that have (been) carved on rocks around the world. The Australian Aborigines have their own Lightning Man and Wandjina figure which they describe in ways which is associated with lightning and with power flowing down from heaven and they're very careful to choose their words when they say these things. So all of this fitted with the Saturn model. And of course the Saturn model when, on first appearances is so outrageous that it's easy to dismiss it but here we had hard evidence, very hard it was carved into rock, that ancient man had witnessed about 80 or most of the 84 different forms of this instability. Of course Halton Arp as the key figure, because he has dealt with the grand scale of the universe, the cosmology. He provided the physical link between high-redshift quasars and low-redshift active galaxies which shows that redshift is largely an intrinsic factor in a celestial object like a galaxy or a baby galaxy quasar. And this gets rid of all of the problems which are ignored by astronomers with things having to be ultra bright, ultra massive and all this kind of thing if you place them at the end of the universe. But if you bring them up close with their, the things that they're associated with, they become normal brightness, normal sizes and everything appears okay. It's, I find it quite odd that astronomers can make these leaps and just say well, it must be huge, it must be really ultra bright, we don't understand how you can generate that much energy to see it at that distance. One of our key members in the early years was Amy Acheson and she used this little cartoon on the Left 'Objects in the mirror are closer than they appear'. And this is the case. In other words the universe, the visible universe is much smaller than we think. It also appears to be relatively static, according to Halton Arp's reconstruction. This means there was no Big Bang. The universe is of unknown age and extent. We can say nothing about origins. And really, it is very arrogant of us to think that in the last microsecond of our scientific endeavor that we've uncovered the secrets of the universe. This is something that Halton Arp said to those of us that he was associating with, he's always had a keen regard for amateurs and those who are prepared to ask questions. I hold him in the highest regard. "The greatest part of the progress independent researchers have made in the past decades, in my opinion, is to break free of the observationally disproved dogma of curved space-time, dark matter, Big Bang, no primary reference frame and no faster than light information." All of these things I agree with. If you get his book 'Seeing Red', he, in the final pages of the book ticks all the boxes for the Electric Universe. We arrived almost at the same place coming from slightly different directions. The Electric Universe story adopts successful plasma cosmology and this is one of the other aspects of specialization in science today. The IEEE recognizes plasma cosmology as a discipline and publishes papers on it, astronomers do not attend the meetings and they don't read the papers except for one, Gerrit Verschuur, the radio astronomer. He was at one of the meetings with Tony Peratt and we were there as well because I have had some papers published in the IEEE plasma journal and they were excited over the fact that Gerrit Verschuur had found the radio signatures that were expected from this image on the left of the screen. This is a picture of the Birkeland current filaments that flow between galaxies in deep space. They were in what's called dark mode so that you can't actually see them but the radio astronomers can pick them up with their radio telescopes. Now you will see, just down from the top of the slide, there's a small insert saying "Cross-section of Galactic 'Birkeland Current' Filament Pairs". When two of these Birkeland filaments come close together, they begin to interact. And draw closer together and early in the interaction you will see the two filmers draw in towards one another, there's a long-range attraction and a short-range repulsion going on. On the right is a picture of Markarian 739 and here we're looking down the barrel of two of those Birkeland current filaments coming together and beginning to form a spiral galaxy. Simple explanation. What does NASA say? "Galaxy Boasts Two Monster Black Holes" This is, just goes to show how disconnected and unpredictive and useless modern cosmology is. The EU story explains the mass and energy focus at galactic centers very simply. The current flowing along the spiral arms of a galaxy in, towards the center must go somewhere. And in the laboratory, when you pour electrical energy into a discharge which converges on a point, the result is what's called the plasmoid, a dense plasma focus. And that's the shape that it takes, it's like a doughnut where with complicated paths that the electric current flows in, but down the central core all of those filaments are closest together. So what happens is, as the energy is more and more concentrated, there comes a point when the particles there start colliding more and more. And at that point, you have neutrons being formed, which can escape, and these plasma focus plasmoids are the most copious source of neutrons known in the laboratory. And they also then decay into protons and electrons, of course. Now, the electrons tend to get trapped for longer than the heavier particles so the protons escape and the things that are formed along these huge jets are electron deficient. They are the quasars. Now, the fact that they're electron deficient means that their polarization will be lower than another galaxy or its parent and the result of that is that the masses of the subatomic particles involved lower, their redshift is higher and the energy involved is less so they're faint. All of this fits together in a simple electrical explanation, you do not need a black hole. The mass there is simply there because E = mc², if you keep pouring more and more 'E' in, you'll get more and more 'm' and these plasmoids are extremely small. I would say, in the center of our galaxy it's less than the size of the solar system which is unresolvable at that distance. There are no black holes as Steven has shown theoretically. The Electric Universe story explains the electrical formation of stars and planetary systems. In the laboratory in these intense discharges, what happens is that the discharge breaks up into blobs, often seven I think or nine, and after the discharge fades they scatter like buckshot, it was the term that Tony Peratt used. And what do we find in deep space? When you look through the dust, using an infrared telescope, you find the stars are arranged in these, along these filaments, they're the Birkeland current filaments. What's more, it's been discovered that these embryonic stars flicker. And they flicker far too rapidly for matter just falling in and causing radiation to outbursts. So that's a problem for any theory of stellar formation using gravity. But of course, electrical circuits often flicker. So these stars are flickering as electrically as they accumulate matter. Professor Don Scott and I are currently working on what is the exact circuit because this is fairly complicated. This is the circuit connecting a star to the galaxy. This one is lit up and is known as a planetary nebula and you can see the wonderful complexity in there but we're beginning to unravel it, we're also trying an experiment to test it. If it's confirmed, I think that's worth a Nobel Prize. Not for dark energy or the other, cosmic microwave background and all sort of thing. So this is the circuit that connects the star and this is what we're working on now. This is the reason why all of the models of the, what would be found at the boundary of the Sun's electrical influence, the Heliosphere, has not been met. None of the models worked. But the one that looks at it from this electrical circuit point of view, which I've tried to do, still matches what's being found. I think this is a great confirmation for the electrical model of stars. Here's Don and Dave did a great job yesterday of showing some of the technical aspects of Don's work. It shows the transistor, a style of interface between the Sun and what's above the Sun and it explains it all simply in electrical terms. Simplicity is the key. Now one of the most amazing parts of the story revolves around the Saturn myth, David's work, Ev Cochrane, Dwardu Cardona have all worked on this, it's been a life's work for them as well. The big problem was how on earth do you stack planets pole to pole in a line? There's no known stable orbital system that will do that. I thought about that for decades and finally, piece by piece, I managed to sort out the puzzle, I think... What I've shown here, coming down from the top left, is a red dwarf which has entered the Sun's electrical environment. Two heliospheres have touched and then, when that happens they see each other electrically. Now the Sun is treated in the Electric Universe as an anode, a positively charged body. A red dwarf is a much less positively charged body, it's glowing dimly. So when it enters the Sun's domain it becomes a comet, it switches from being an anode to a cathode and cometary appearance is characteristic of a comet. Also their electrical forces start to apply in the form of modification of the mass of the objects in that brown dwarf system. The change is such that it tends to capture the objects. It draws the star away from its satellites so they spiral down and trail behind the main object. It's a bit like comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 when it disintegrated. They didn't just form a cloud of particles; they formed a chain, a line. So what the very high energy discharges that we have examined and got confirmation from Tony Peratt, I feel, were when we were sitting in the tail of the comet that was one huge electrical discharge. And it wasn't just us that was in it but the other satellites of Proto-Saturn we call it, the brown dwarf. And it's interesting that in recent years astronomers themselves have come to the conclusion that the most likely place for life in the universe is as a satellite of a brown dwarf. There's much more to that in the Electric Universe model than there is in the Standard Model, which makes it even more likely. The other thing that you have to worry about is, when you've captured all of these bodies it must be total chaos in the solar system. All of the orbits have to be adjusted to achieve stability. And that's when I came up with this idea that all planets in the solar system act as secondary electrodes in the Sun's discharge. They are less positive than the Sun, they are therefore cathodes. They emit electrons. In the case where they're all drawn into the current sheet of the Sun, and we know that each of the planets has what's called a magneto-tail, a cometary-like tail behind it, and there are charged particles involved because of the magnetic fields. The charge transfer appears to work in such a way that when two bodies come towards one another, the inner one tends to move in towards the Sun and the outer one tends to move away from the Sun so they space themselves until the electrical interaction ceases or almost ceases. In the case of Mars, you still have the things like the ionospheric blue clearing occurring when Mars ends up in opposition to the Earth. You also get those global dust storms. They're all explained electrically, and it's this electrical transfer between the inner planet and the outer planet that spaces them and stabilizes the system. So that's my contribution - Electrically Modified Newtonian Dynamics - I call it. It's very simple, the equations are just involved high school physics. It explains the electrical capture, the avoidance and rapid orbit stabilization. It explains the transition of the captured system from a brown dwarf to a gas giant. It's no longer a star, and it has to adjust to its electrical environment, and that may involve flaring, violent outbursts just like comets, they tend to disintegrate to some extent. So some of the bodies in the solar system, one in particular, Venus, appears to have been a part of that electrical readjustment. Of course, a recent National Geographic has 'Our Wild Wild Solar System' and here we have an object colliding with the Earth to form the Moon. This kind of thing in the Electric Universe is most unlikely to happen because long before the two planets get anywhere near that kind of contact, they will separate electrically. Dwardu Cardona is one of the key authors of the Proto-Saturnian story and has traced back the history as far as, further than anyone else, I think. And his talk at the Electric Universe conference was 'Strangers in a Foreign Stellar System' and his books are a mine of information. The Electric Universe story, as Steve Smith very ably demonstrated yesterday, can explain the origin of these vast electrical scars on Mars because it was heavily involved in all of the activity. Mars, the God of War. He actually suffered worse than anyone else. The Electric Universe story pieces together the dramatic recent story of the Earth and its inhabitants, our catastrophic past and the fact that we have not yet come to terms with it. And our popular astronomy gives a distorted view of the universe, the modern vision evokes a sense of lonely bodies in space, isolated galaxies, self-immolating stars drifting like dust moats in the blackness and the clockwork solitude of planets. It's a hopeless cosmology. In challenging this idea, the Electric Universe emphasizes connectivity. The electric force influences matter at all levels, from subatomic particles to galactic clusters, leaving little room for the disconnected fragments of modern theory. So it's all about connectedness. The electric force operates in real time, all matter is connected resonantly by the electric force to produce quantum effects. As soon as you get rid of the speed of light delay you can begin to understand the weirdness of, or the so called, weird aspects of quantum theory. Nuclear forces, magnetism and gravity are all manifestations of a single force and these simple concepts are essential for coherence on all scales, from the galactic to the solar system to life on Earth and down to atoms themselves. It is based on inspiration, interdisciplinary inspiration, this is really interdisciplinary. A lot of people pay, sort of, lip service to it but this, the EU uses it as a basis, a foundation. It's not consensus in a specialized theoretical field that ignores, and I quote from the earlier advertisement for Lawrence Krauss, "unsubstantiated and bland myths pervaded by the ancients." The Electric Universe story was inspired initially by Velikovsky and the inspiration continues. No one assumes, in this group, that we have all the answers and we are keen for anyone else, who feels they can lead in some area because it's a huge picture that we're building, are welcome. I feel... One of my dreams is to see a reconstruction of the human story going back to the earliest times, the view of creation. What were these creation stories really about? Because obviously no one was around when the universe was created, these are stories about the creation of the world we see today from something that was different before. If we could just have an IMAX movie, I think people would get it. You wouldn't have to labor the point, the symbolism and everything comes down to today and that symbolism is striking, it's undeniable and I think people even at a subconscious level would connect with it. And once we've done that, Velikovsky felt that the most important message is that unless we understand our past we cannot heal from the wounds of facing doomsday. I can only, I can't even imagine what it must have been like in those days to feel that the world was just about to end. We suppress that memory and until we can learn what it was that the ancients were desperately trying to tell us with their monuments, their strange artwork and their strange stories of gods and things going on in the sky, until we understand that, we cannot heal. Velikovsky felt that was the most important message he had for mankind because otherwise, unless we can heal, we cannot begin to behave as perfectly rational denizens of the universe and our future on this planet is questionable. Thank you. [Applause] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info On January 24th 2016 NASA scientists celebrated the 12th anniversary of the arrival of the rover Opportunity on the planet Mars. The celebration was marked by scientists' continued expression of amazement over the Rover's astonishing long liveness. In 2004 the rovers Spirit and Opportunity were each given expected lifespans of about 90 days and were projected to drive a total of 600 metres. However, both Mars Exploration Rovers defied both expectation and explanation. The rover Spirit survived until 2010 when it became stuck in the rugged soil of Gusev Crater and today in 2016 Opportunity is still going strong with mission scientists still unable to offer real answers for the Rover's endurance. On February 5th 2016 the website planetary.org published a blog on the "unparalleled achievement" of the Mars Exploration Rover team. The article states: "12 years is a long time for Rovers designed and dispatched for 3-month tours... so far beyond the imagination, it's almost unbelievable. The fact that Opportunity is still roving is beyond remarkable even, truth told, for those who built her." One Scientist quoted in the article states: "While Opportunity is a bit worse for wear, I have to admit that once again our ability to understand the lifetime of our own designs is really poor. With their rather constant temperature environment and with fewer moving parts it makes some sense to me that the Voyager spacecraft would live for decades. It is harder for me to believe that a highly mechanical solar-powered Mars rover, that must suffer rather impressive daily and yearly temperature extremes and dust storms, will be capable of lasting more than a few years." Unfortunately the article does nothing to eliminate the mystery of how the Rover has been able to survive around 50 times longer than its projected lifespan. Rather, the Rover's quote "unbelievable endurance" is attributed to equally unbelievable factors namely that occasional gusts of wind cleared dust from the solar panels for some reason. To get a sense of just how profound the enigma is let us look back all the way to 2004, when the mysteries began to accumulate. The Rovers' original projected 90 day lifespans were largely based on the extreme dustiness of the martian environment as well as other weather and geological factors. Of course scientists knew at the time that Mars, whose tenuous atmosphere is less than 1% as dense as Earth's, has occasional winds and intense dust storms but since mechanical wind is obviously not a reliable means to remove dust from any vehicle it was believed that the rover solar panels would inevitably be buried in dust and eventually lose all power. Yet in 2004, mission scientists reported the first of a series of unexplained cleanings of the Rovers. According to a news scientists' report, the rover Opportunity, whose power had been steadily declining due to dust accumulation, experienced a dramatic increase in power after it "stumbled into something akin to a car wash". Jim Erickson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory stated at the time: "These exciting an unexplained cleaning events have kept Opportunity in really great shape." While the Rovers' cleanings and endurance remain unexplained by NASA a clue to the puzzle is provided by the Agency's own news release dated July 14 2005. "When humans visit Mars they'll have to watch out for towering electrified dust devils." With these words NASA gave official sanction to an idea that had already been percolating from separately funded research projects in recent years. This research has explored the electrical component to dust devils in the Arizona desert. Investigators were surprised to find that these vortices are electrically charged. According to a news item entitled: "Electrics sand findings could lead to better climate models", one investigator has speculated that: "Electric fields get so large on the Red Planet they produce ground-level sparks." In fact, in the Electric Universe, the martian wind is indeed connected to the cleaning of the Rovers' solar panels and thus its long liveness. In previous episodes we've discussed the astonishing global dust storms composed of giant towering vortices that have sometimes enveloped the entire Red Planet. Also mysterious are the vast fields of Martian sand dunes and other wind driven features. However, what if the electric fields associated with the dust devils are not generated by sand particles rubbing together? In the past we have suggested that the martian wind is analogous to an ionic wind, such as that seen here and repeatedly shown in Space News episodes, produced in laboratory experiments by Billy Yelverton. Mars, like a comet, is a charged body moving on an elliptical orbit through the Sun's weak electric field and like the planet Mars, the comet 67P has revealed sand dunes that could not have reasonably been formed by mechanical winds. The discovery of fast moving electrons and electric fields near the nucleus of comet 67 P explain both the filamentary comet jets and the configuration of surface dust in dune-like features. We suggest that it is not a coincidence that the largest dust storms on Mars tend to occur when the Sun, Earth and Mars are in alignment. Indeed when the greatest global dust storm, ever observed on Mars, began in 2001, Mars had reached opposition and was the closest it had been to Earth in about 12 years. This suggests that the electrical tickling of Mars by Earth's cometary plasma sheet or magneto tail may be responsible for much of the tornado activity on the Red Planet. Is the occasional electrostatic removal of dust from the Mars rover Opportunity responsible for its extraordinary long liveness? The irony is that scientists working with NASA have developed technology that may provide the answer to this question. Self-cleaning solar panels that rely on electrostatic cleaning have proven extremely effective at dust removal. As noted in a 2010 review, "The technology was developed for future rover missions to Mars, but it could work here on Earth to keep solar panels working at peak capacity. It uses electrostatic charge to repel dust and force it to the edges of the panels. It can remove 90% of the dust on a solar panel in a two-minute cycle..." For how many additional years will this mystery endure with NASA scientists continuing to acknowledge their amazement, yet failing to consider any new theoretical possibilities which all real mysteries demand.

Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info The question of the Sun's possible role in triggering large earthquakes is the subject of growing scientific interests. For decades, some have noted a parent correlations between dramatic solar phenomena and seismic activity. Yet definitive scientific proof of a connection has remained elusive. Recently, the founder of Suspicious Observers Ben Davidson and colleagues published a landmark scientific paper revealing compelling statistical evidence of a role of solar activity in triggering large earthquakes. We asked Ben to give us the latest developments in his research as well as a brief preview of its forthcoming talk at the Thunderbolts conference Elegant Simplicity taking place June 17th to 19th in Phoenix in Arizona. The foundations for investigating solar triggered earthquakes were really a number of coincidences that really just stood out among what seemed like otherwise random data and suggested that solar phenomenon could trigger earthquakes. Now to just look at sunspots solar flares or even its effects on Earth you look at the geomagnetic index, how many geomagnetic storms is it producing what level, things like that. Those are the main things people look at when they're looking at space weathering solar phenomena and that's where a lot of the odd coincidences can be found but that's not where, you know, that's not where you're going to find any patterns, it seems like sometimes you can use those things to predict earthquakes very well and correlate a, you know, find a relationship between the Earth and the Sun and then other times it appears not to be the case. And so there's that question of why does there appear to be this on off switch, sometimes weeks at a time, sometimes months at a time on and then off or, you know, weeks on or off. And so we started to look beyond solar flares and sunspots and things like that because we really see all of these things as symptoms really, of something else that's happening and that is a polar magnetic field cycle on the Sun. This would be the solar polar fields that come out of the polar regions of the Sun and wrap around, you know, towards the equator and pretty much encompass the entire solar system coming out of the Sun's poles just like Earth's magnetosphere comes out of Earth's poles. Well this solar polar field cycle, which is the 11 year cycle, when it reverses is when we get the sunspot maximum and all the flares and things like that. Well not only are sunspots and solar flares and the resulting geomagnetic activity at Earth a function of this 11 year solar polar field cycle but even things like the placement of coronal holes, sector boundaries in the heliosphere, current sheath, basically the the magnetic character of the solar wind, the size and the position of the solar prominences, often referred to as plasma filaments, all of these things are actually driven by this underlying 11 year solar polar field cycle that is often ascribed to being 11 year sun spots cycle but really it's it's the magnetic fields on the Sun that are really driving that. And when you look beyond the symptoms like sunspots and solar flares and geomagnetic activity to the underlying thing that is driving all of those things, the solar polar magnetic fields, you come to something that has never once been analyzed in terms of earthquakes until now and when it is analyzed you find that this is so perfect of a, of a place to start this the sort of new field of science that it really can't be ignored. Somewhere between 88 and 90% of the largest earthquakes in the world are shockingly close to these polar magnetic field cycle events and so basically what I mean by that is during the 11 years that the cycle takes place we get peaks in this magnetism, the high points in the magnetism about twice a year or about 6 months apart. We get reversals, positive to negative, negative to positive, about every 11 years. These things do not exactly happen all the time, they're spread far apart and yet most of the major earthquakes on the list are within just a handful of days of these events that happened 6 months to years and years apart and we have now completed our forth study on this material the first one was published last year that was between myself, Dr Kongpop U-Yen, who many in the EU community know already, and Dr. Chris Holloman, a statistics professor from The Ohio State University who actually, I was able to take the pattern that we all were pretty sure we saw, translated into mathematics and actually proved that it was real. Well since then we've done subsequent analyses on... on the Chile 8.3 in September of 2015 we did a more longer-term analysis of the solar polar fields just earlier, earlier this spring, and just in the last couple of days the data has updated enough to show us that the first great earthquake of 2016 the magnitude 7.8 that struck off the coast of Indonesia on March 2nd 2016 was indeed occurring at a negative peak in solar polar field magnetism and it was a peak that actually had not been matched on the Sun for 15 years so that's another way of saying that as the Sun, you know, presents these different levels of magnetism, the Sun had not presented Earth with this level of magnetism since 2001 at least in terms of the negative polarity. And it does appear, now that we've gotten a little bit past that mark's second event, that it was indeed a peak in the fields cause since then the the total magnetic field strength of the Sun has been weakening somewhat so that was a a long-term event and a short-term significant event as well. And it's looking like, based on the limited data we have thus far, this big one we just had in Ecuador about a week and a half ago, which was on the heels of that deadly earthquake in Japan, they happened just 24 hours apart, it's looking like we're gonna have another peak there as well so we also just had the word come in that that first paper, the foundational one with myself, Dr. U-Yen and the Dr. Hollomon got its first citation, it was cited in a paper that was published late in 2015 also talking about solar system phenomena and earthquakes. So what's, it really sort of came out of the coincidences that seemed to hint, that Sun creates earthquakes but guided by all of the very convincing research that says, hey you can't use sun spots you can't use solar flares you can't use geomagnetic activity over long periods of time, here is the data. Therefore we have to conclude that there is no solar induced earthquakes. Well, when you use that as your guide and you realize that all the things they're looking at are really just symptoms of the more driving, underlying force on the Sun, you begin to realize how this could have been missed over the last few decades and just how vital this can be when you see how, how well correlated the Sun is with these large oftentimes tsunami- inducing earthquakes. Once you've nailed down, using solar phenomena, the times when the Earth should get more active, you then need to be wondering where this activity is most likely to strike, where's this earthquake gonna happen and the single most promising thing we've ever seen came out of the Demeter satellite. I believe t'was a French satellite and it was detecting ionosphere disruptions that seem to occur before some of the largest earthquakes. Now some scientists have written these off, others have been using them to try to create an earthquake forecasting system. The problem is that for all the times that this Demeter data a couple, you know, at least a dozen for all the times it was used to publish papers on ionosphere disruptions before earthquakes, it was never once used to communicate such a disruption to the world as hey, watch out, an earthquake may happen here. A lot of this stems out of what happened in Italy with the earthquake scientists, a lot of folks are worried about, you know, liability with things like that and as of now there are some promising ideas in terms of looking at the ionosphere but they're in their infancy. What may be a better thing to do is what actually I'm trying to do right now. Many folks who are listening to this will know that we successfully completed our second Kickstarter campaign earlier this year, we've raised $120,000 to create the disaster prediction app, and that is going to do two things. One, it's going to be using those space weather phenomena we described earlier to warn of times when Earth is going to get more active but also we're going to be tracking the data that comes in on the GPS, the magnetometer and on the EMF monitor within most of these cell phones, iPhones have all those and many Androids do as well. And so what we're going to be able to do is, we're going to be able to see when there are multiple signals from different cell phones in a given area that are showing the same type of anomaly. Maybe there's ten different cell phones in Los Angeles and all of a sudden their GPS says they're in the Pacific ocean. What are the chances that all ten got catapulted thousand miles west at the same time. Or perhaps there is a magnetic field disruption of a certain micro-Tesla that's read by 20 cell phones in Seattle, what are the chances they're all standing next to the exact same microwave with the door open. There are things like this where you start to say okay, we can use some of these signals because it's more than just the ionosphere, we've seen everything from animal behavior going wild to positive ion emission prior to earthquakes but also radio frequencies emerging and, sort of, spiking in power. You've seen magnetic field disruptions as well and you've seen GPS disruptions, just about every phone has a GPS detector in it as well. So what we're hoping to do is not wait to install a bunch of very expensive machines all over the world that may have to be recalibrated if they get hit by lightning or something, we are going to actually have this at monitoring some of the electromagnetic conditions around the globe around these areas and hopefully there will be enough people with these things on their cell phones that will be able to get some concrete data and actually start to be able to predict locations. So looking at the different electromagnetic signals and that really is the only way to do this, electricity is the great snitch of the universe she's gonna tell us pretty much everything that's going to happen we just have to learn how to listen the right way. In June this year I'll be giving another talk, third year in a row, at the Electric Universe conference in Phoenix and this year it's going to be a little less specific and a little bit more macro view of a lot of the things that are going on in the community and a lot of the paths forward that seem to be most promising. We have, on the horizon, a period of great change as some of our leaders will be looking to others to carry this story forward as we look twenty, thirty years down the line and so what does the future of the Electric Universe look like, and hopefully I'll be able to convince everyone that it is a promising future from a vastly interdisciplinary field of view, talking about a very broad range of disciplines, a very broad range of interests that are going to end up being advanced and coming around to really embrace some of the electric ideas that have been tossed around in the community the last few years.

[Music] For over a hundred years, the cosmological story has been the story of the Big Bang, gravity and relativity. But  what if that story is wrong? And what if a new cosmological story and model is emerging? What then? How might a change in cosmology and the cosmological narrative, impact today's society and contemporary culture? To explore these questions we must first look at the concept of paradigm shift. Paradigm shift is one of these  terms that we hear a lot of lately. But what exactly is a paradigm shift? Well, to  begin, a paradigm is the dominant theory in any given discipline at any given time, and a paradigm shift happens when the dominant theory is replaced by another one. The term paradigm shift was coined by the physicist and philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn in his seminal work, “The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.” In his book, Kuhn challenged the common conception of science, which was that science was a steady progression of the accumulation of new ideas. In a series of reviews of past major scientific advances, such as those ushered in by Galileo, Newton and Einstein, Kuhn was able to show that this viewpoint was wrong. For Kuhn, ”...science advanced the most by occasional revolutionary explosions of new knowledge, each revolution triggered by introduction of new ways of thought that are so large and so different they must be called new paradigms.” In other words, a paradigm shift is scientific change that is forced to happen. For Kuhn, a paradigm shift happens over a process or a cycle, and it has very distinct stages. These stages are, Pre-science – This is a pre-stage, where the field or discipline has no workable paradigm to successfully guide its work. Then we have: 1. Normal Science – The normal step where the field has a scientifically- based model of understanding that works. Then: 2. Model Drift – Here the model of understanding begins to drift, due to the accumulation of anomalies  and phenomena that the model simply cannot explain. After model drift, we enter: 3. Model Crisis – At this stage, the model drift becomes so excessive that the model is essentially broken. It can no longer serve as a reliable  guide to problem solving. And any attempts to patch the model up and make it work, fail. At this stage, the field is in anguish. After model crisis comes: 4. Model Revolution – This begins when serious candidates for a new model emerge. It's a revolution because the new model is so radically different from the old. Finally, we arrive at 5. Paradigm Change – Here a single new paradigm emerges and the field changes from the old to the new paradigm. When this step ends the new paradigm becomes the new Normal Science and the Kuhn cycle is complete. Overall the cycle looks something like this: Pre-Science – Normal Science – Crisis - Revolution –  New Normal Science –  New crisis – New Revolution. And it continues. Can you guess what stage we are currently in? Well, looking at the present discourse on cosmology and at scientists’ own words, it is becoming apparent that we are in the midst of the Kuhn Paradigm Shift cycle, and appear to presently be well within the Model Crisis stage. Today the biggest topic in debate cosmology definitely seems to be cosmology itself. Mainstream science magazines and non-science magazines are full of headlines suggesting that cosmology is in deep trouble. While scientists have been aware of a crisis in cosmology since at least the 1990’s, in very recent years, that awareness has increased exponentially. As Eric Lerner has shown, in 1995 there was about one reference every year to the crisis. By the beginning of the 2000’s it went up to 5 references per year, and then 12 references by the middle of the 2000’s. By the second part of the present decade it was about two dozen references per year. But then in 2019, it shot up to 130 references per year. That is a drastic increase in just the last two years. This upward trend can be interpreted as a strong indication that we are at Kuhn’s crisis stage. While scientists do not agree on the nature of the crisis, there is definitely a growing general awareness, both in  cosmology and the mainstream media, that there is a crisis. I found that  many mainstream articles and videos deal with one or both of the following, as it relates to cosmology and the Big Bang model. 1. Anomaly - meaning something that deviates from what is standard, normal or expected, and/or 2. Contradiction - meaning new information, measurements, observations and/or findings, that undermine, contradict and/or oppose the major principles, assumptions, and expectations of the Big Bang theory in some way. In Kuhn's paradigm shift model, when there are a little bit of anomalies and contradictions, then the dominant model or normal science can be said to be in a state of drift. When too many anomalies and contradictions accumulate, which the model cannot adequately explain or fix, then the model is in a state of crisis. The over-abundance of mainstream material dealing with the ever-increasing anomalies and contradictions in contemporary cosmology, including from very well- known, non-scientific sources like Forbes and Business Insider, suggests  that we have definitely reached a crisis point. Drawing on Kuhn, this implies  that the Big Bang model is broken and cannot be fixed. I will leave it to the natural and physical scientists to discuss and debate the  nature of the cosmological crisis, but as a discourse analyst, I wish to make some observations about the articles and videos themselves. While many of the articles and video titles mention, quote “a crisis in Big Bang cosmology”, their content and conclusions do not question or problematize the  Big Bang as one might expect, though some do give lip service to the possible need for a new physics, when compared with the titles, the conclusions are disproportionate at best and apologist at worst. With a couple of sources, even concluding that contradictions in the Big Bang model are strengths, because they open the door for ”new and exciting areas of research within the Big Bang model.” Talk about doubling down on a broken theory. Now in critical discourse analysis, this can be identified as a  problematic discursive strategy, wherein the tone of the article's titles do not match the tone of the article's content and conclusion, thereby  misleading the reader. This is a sneaky rhetorical device, where the reader is led to assume one thing from the title, only to end up with an altogether different, and even contradictory conclusion at the article's end. Rather than really address the crisis of Big Bang cosmology in a meaningful way, many of these sources downplay it, or even double down on it, thereby shielding it. Some going as far as to characterize anomalies and contradictions that  undermine the Big Bang model, as strengths rather than flaws. Now as a side note, even if editors are just using the phrase, ”crisis in cosmology” as click bait with no intention of actually addressing it, the very fact that so many people, both within science and in the popular mainstream culture, want to know or read about a cosmological crisis, can be interpreted as more proof that the Big Bang may be losing credibility. Another bizarre claim made by mainstream sources about cosmology, is that the  universe is far more strange or weird than we originally thought, and that this is why there are so many anomalies and contradictions that the Big Bang cannot address. This type of deflection is especially interesting, because it blames the failures and inadequacies of standard cosmology on the cosmos, rather than the model or theory. An  internet search brings up numerous titles dealing with the ”strangeness or weirdness” of the universe. Quote “the universe is stranger than we thought”, ”our solar system is even stranger than we thought”, “the universe turns out to be much bigger and weirder than anyone thought”, ”unexplained phenomena keep suggesting the universe isn't what we thought”, etc. etc. etc. This rationalization, that the universe is stranger than we thought, is increasingly repeated in popular science magazines and websites. Repetition is another device that is used in dominant discourse and texts, one that can create a false sense of authority and truthfulness, because  when something is repeated often enough it takes on an air of truth that can mislead readers into agreeing with false conclusions. The repetition of a false or speculative reality, in this case that the universe just keeps getting weirder and weirder, prevents the reader from entertaining an alternative reality such as, the Big Bang is not adequately equipped to address the anomalies and contradictions of its field. The  emphasis on weirdness ultimately negates the crisis in Big Bang cosmology and prevents deeper discussions of the implications of the crisis. It's  interesting to point out that in the pre-Big Bang era of the enlightenment, any claim that the universe was just too weird to understand, would  have been considered laughable. After all, the prime mover in the age of reason, would never create a universe that was irrational. So why is it not only tolerated today, but exclaimed and celebrated? The universe's weirdness, or non-conformity, is accepted because of the attitudes that resulted from the cultural changes ushered in via the application of relativity to the non-scientists and broader culture in the first place. Because of these cultural changes and the acceptance and celebration of relativistic and paradoxical thinking, there appears to be an inability to consider weirdness and strangeness as critical warning signs of fundamental theoretical errors and problems. But under Kuhn's analysis, the acceptance and celebration of weirdness, or paradoxical thinking, are just further indications of a model in crisis. Within Kuhn's framework, doubling down on a broken model, or blaming the model’s inadequacies on the strange and wacky universe, are all things that we could  expect from a model that is dying. But no matter how they try to spin it, given everything we discussed, there is no denying that standard cosmology is a model in crisis. [Music]

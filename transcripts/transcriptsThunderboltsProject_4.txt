Welcome the Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project at Thunderbolts.info. The Electric Universe community consists of individuals who seem to share a common trait. That is the tendency to question ideas and beliefs that academia and society at large accept as true. It's easy to recognize the obstinacy or close mindedness in others but do we recognize these tendencies in ourselves? Today, thunderbolts colleague Chris Reeve discusses the lifelong challenge the human beings face, both individually and collectively, to develop the necessary skills and means to determine what is true. Although we don't normally experience it, people deal with fear and anxiety at every moment of our our lives. Fear that the Earth might become uninhabitable, fear of war, fears about our family and fear that we might lose our jobs. However we don't feel these fears a lot of times because we've created effective, partially subconscious, anxiety management systems. These subconscious systems provide us much comfort and room for more complex thought, insofar as they tirelessly work towards keeping us alive and out of harm's way. But they can also form a hidden barrier to the desire to adaptively change for our surroundings. The development of a more complex mental framework, a self transforming mindset, can help the individual to recognize the filtering effect and limitations of his or her round frame of reference. The late philosopher Stephen Toulmin once said: "A man demonstrates his rationality, not by a commitment to fixed ideas, stereotyped procedures or immutable concepts, but by the manner in which, and the occasions on which, he changes those ideas, procedures and concepts." Quoting Kierkergaard he added: "Concepts, like individuals, have their histories, and are just as incapable of withstanding the ravages of time as are individuals." I wanna talk in this video about the psychology of change and my intention is to show that changes to society's scientific worldview reflect in some key ways the process of change that occurs at the level of the individual. Both possess its inherent resistance to change which some psychologists have likened to an immune system. Understanding how this immunity to new ideas works, at both the individual and societal levels, is a necessary prerequisite for any intent to deeply understand how people engage scientific controversies. Most people who follow this business of change in the sciences will tend to point to the work of Thomas Kuhn whose ideas are just as relevant today as they were when he said them in the sixties. I wanna talk about his work but I wanna first diverge from the traditional treatment of this subject by also mixing in the more recent work of two Harvard psychologists, Robert Kegan and Lisa Laskow Lahey. Authors of the book, Immunity to Change, how to overcome it and unlock potential in yourself and your organization. Although Kegan and Lahey wrote Immunity to Change to help individuals and businesses, the framework is also an unintentional commentary on the role of worldviews in scientific discourse. There are some important fundamental takeaways from Kegan and Leahy which we can put to use towards improving scientific discourse. I want to run through some quotes from their book to demonstrate them. Quote: "Many if not most, of the change challenges you face today and will face tomorrow require something more than incorporating new technical skills into your current mindset. These are the 'adaptive challenges' and they can only be met by transforming your mindset, by advancing to a more sophisticated stage of mental development... Heifertz said the biggest error leaders make is when they apply technical means to solve adaptive challenges." The mere existence of an immune system, which protects us but also precludes change, suggests that our tendency in the face of some challenge will be to seek out technical solutions which abide by our pre-existing worldview. In certain circumstances this system of immunity can actually block our ability to implement changes which we actually desperately desire. Note that interesting similarity in approach to ad hoc modeling, this increasingly common modeling technique which seeks to fit scientific theory to observations through tweaks to the prior underperforming model. As I read these quotes about our personal immune systems, think about it how they might apply also to the larger scientific community as well. Change does not fail to occur because of insincerity, the heart patient is not insincere about his wish to keep living, even as he reaches for another cigarette. Change fails to occur because we mean both things, it fails to occur because we are a living contradiction. When we make a new year's resolution we look at the behaviors we seek to extinguish as bad, we look at the behaviours we want to amplify as good but until we understand the commitments that make the obstructive behaviors at the same time brilliantly effective, we haven't correctly formulated the problem. We have learned something that may be very hard for successful capable people to believe. More than we understand, most people deal constantly with fear. I'm not afraid! You know you are saying to yourself right now, "I feel fine". And you're right, you do not feel your fear. The reason you do not is because you are dealing with it. Though you're not aware of it, you have created a very effective anxiety management system and that system is what we call, "the immunity to change". But we run these systems, even highly successful anxiety management systems, at a cost. Inevitably they create blind spots, prevent new learning and constantly constrain action in some aspects of our living. These costs show up when we are unable to deliver on some genuinely desired change. The realization of which will bring us to a new higher level of functioning in ways we truly want to attain. Most self improvement efforts take place in too constricted a psychological space, blind to this bigger dynamics at play. However hard they work, however sincerely they seek to extinguish their obstructive behaviors, everything will go on within the existing mind set. No new learning can occur. When I read this book I was just stunned by the applicability of these ideas to the world of scientific research, science education and scientific discourse. Kegan and Lahey are not just describing the challenge of change within a personal context, which is their intended focus. Their analysis also applies just as well to the challenge of change in scientific theory. If they are right that leaders will tend to mistake adaptive change challenges for technical challenges then this mistake should be written all over our worst performing scientific theories. In scientists' attempts to solve a stubborn problem, we should expect to see our most brilliant leaders applying the most sophisticated tools available to them but restricted to the context of the accepted scientific framework. Re framing to an alternative framework will predictably reduce the available tool set but it should not be surprising if it also offers far simpler solutions. These less technical solutions should not be judged inferior, simply because they are less technical. Listen to Kegan and Lahey explaining immune system metaphor: "We use the medical metaphor of immunity quite mindfully to signify that, first of all, this phenomenon is not in itself a bad thing. On the contrary, an immune system is, most of the time, a beautiful thing, an extraordinarily intelligent force that elegantly acts to protect us, to save our lives. However, in some instances an immune system can threaten our continued good health. When it rejects the material, internal or external to the body, that the body needs to heal itself or to thrive, the immune system can put us in danger. In these instances the immune system is no less focused on protecting us. It is just making a mistake. It does not understand that it must alter its code. It does not understand that, ironically, in working to protect us, it is actually putting us at serious risk." And this brings us to the second significant implication of Kegan and Lahey's work. Kegan and Lahey's solution to the problem; The way to achieve change transcends all contexts. It is to seek to transform our subject object relationships. Where we are currently subject to a mindset, we must learn to look at that mindset as an object. If that sounds confusing, you just follow along and it will become clear. If necessary pause the video and study the diagram on the screen. Kegan and Lahey state; "The root of any way of knowing (what philosophers call an epistemology) is an abstract-sounding thing called the 'subject-object relationship'. Any way of knowing can be described with respect to that which it can look at (object) and that which it looks through (the filter or lens to which it is subject). Young children, for example, are still subject to their perceptions, so when something looks small to them (like cars and people viewed from the top of a tall building), they think it actually is small. 3- 4- and 5-year-olds will look down say; Look at the tiny people! Children of 8,9 and 10 can look at their perceptions. They will say; Look how tiny the people look! A way of knowing becomes more complex when it is able to look at what before it could only look through. In other words, our way of knowing becomes more complex when we create a bigger system that incorporates and expands on our previous system. This means that if we want to increase mental complexity, we need to move aspects of our meaning- making from subject to object, to alter our mindset so that a way of knowing or making meaning becomes a kind of 'tool' that we have (and can control or use) rather than something that has us (and therefore controls and uses us)" Now, within that context let's talk about Thomas Kuhn. Kuhn was famous for claiming that science is characterized more by the paradigms employed by scientists than by their methods of inquiry. What he seems to be arguing is that the scientific community is subject to certain fundamental ideas. Kuhn characterized the history of science as exhibiting two fundamentally distinct scientific activities; one whhat he calls "puzzle-solving" or "normal science" describes the majority of scientific work; conducting experiments, making observations, applying mathematical models.. The second, much less common, scientific activity is that of revolutionary science. This is the creation of new scientific paradigms. Many people are already familiar with Kuhn's basic claims but perhaps fewer are aware of philosopher Toulmin's interesting addition. He rebutted that paradigm change can occur during "normal science" too, through many minor conceptual shifts. Quote: "In the evolution of concepts as in biological evolution, Toulmin argues, changes occur in populations. Novel concepts come and go, but they influence thinking in a given discipline only when conditions are favorable; only when the new concepts have 'advantages' can they displace others." Joseph Novak is an education theorist and the creator of the concept map, "approach to science education". He points to Toulmin's claim that new ideas must find a niche in order to survive. What I would add to this is a warning to avoid constraining this notion of paradigm change to just conceptual bridges. I've, over the years, witnessed this conversation about, what a paradigm shift towards electrical cosmology might look like. What I've observed is that these conversations almost always ignore the role of our system of communication in facilitating such changes. Yet these communication systems were never intended to service this goal of empowering and elaborating the most deserving novel scientific ideas. If that is what we want our online discourse systems to do, then that is what we must design then to do. In the same way that we had to build the Internet to facilitate the nearly instantaneous transmission of imagery and videos across the globe, we must like way, likewise squarely address this issue of how to identify the best ideas at the fringes of mainstream science if our goal is to facilitate paradigm changes in scientific theory. Academia has thus far refused to address this problem, probably because they are subject to it. But maverick thinkers who can observe the academic approach from outside of the university system have an advantage in that they can witness the problems of academic research as an object. What I'm saying is that "outside our matrix" can play a critical role in the creation of discourse systems which facilitate a more rapid rate of innovation within the sciences. And if such systems can be created, then it is inevitable that they will in due time be adopted by the academic community. There are several points I'd like to conclude with. First, the importance of qualitative research. There's movement in academia to question a legitimacy of oftentimes qualitative research in disciplines like Psychology and Sociology. Simultaneously, the business community relies heavily upon this exact kind of research to make critical decisions about what products to create and sell. What I wanna warn against is approaching this problem of improving the way we talk about science in some sort of anti qualitative manner. As any employee of any modern software company will tell you, psychology and sociology are absolutely necessary to the design of modern software systems. Second: an importance of world view in scientific discourse. Modern science journalism has for the most part attempted to mirror academia's decision to largely ignore many ongoing scientific controversies. But what will predictably happen with this approach is this logical fallacy of assuming that all other explanations had been ruled out. A vital aspect of forming expertise on scientific controversies is running claims back and forth. We need a scientific social network which is designed to focus upon this clash of worldviews in science. Kegan and Leahy state the problem as follows: "If one is not to be forever captive of one's own theory, system, script, framework, or ideology, one needs to develop an even more complex way of knowing that permits one to look at, rather than choicelessly through, one's own framework. In such a case, that framework becomes more preliminary than ultimate, more in process than magnum opus. This breaks through to a bigger emotional and mental space that can seek out the framework's current limitations rather than merely defend the current draft as a finished product and regard all suggestions to the contrary as a blow to the self. These three qualitatively different levels of complexity -- the socialized mind, the self-authoring mind, and the self-transforming mind -- thus represent three distinct epistemologies. Each way of knowing maintains an equilibrium between what is subject and what is object. Growth in our way of knowing -- adapting -- involves disturbing this balance, and learning to look at what we were before looking through. These are not just words to live by, it's also a philosophy which we should design the next generation of social networks with.

Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info A new NASA report describes the potential dangers that the electrical environments of asteroids could pose to astronauts and future space missions. NASA scientists are now attempting to create computer models that will successfully predict dangerous electrical interactions between an approaching spacecraft and an asteroid. The report begins with a brief, surprising description of space, rarely seen in official NASA press releases, "Space may appear empty ― a soundless vacuum, but it's not an absolute void. It flows with electric activity that is not visible to our eyes." The Electric Universe theory, as developed by Wal Thornhill, has always stated that comets and asteroids are charged bodies that sometimes discharge as they interact with the Sun's weak electric field. However, while NASA's new investigation may seem like a concession of these points, a closer examination reveals that little has changed in their theoretical approach. It could be forgiven for thinking, after reading a report from NASA on June the 25th titled, 'New NASA model gives glimpse into the invisible world of electric asteroids'. that somehow or another, NASA was beginning to take heed of the Electric Universe. But when you read the article, you realize nothing could be further from the truth. The article begins with some promise. It says and I quote, "Space may appear empty ― a soundless vacuum, but it's not an absolute void. It flows with electric activity that is not visible to our eyes. NASA is developing plans to send humans to an asteroid, and wants to know more about the electrical environment explorers will encounter there." It seems that this concern really sprang from unexpected electrostatic effects when the astronauts first visited the Moon. It was found that the dust from the surface clung to everything and there were obvious electrical effects in the dust's behavior. This particular article goes on and talks about the solar wind "...which is blown from the surface of the Sun at about a million miles per hour and flows around all solar system objects, forming swirling eddies and vortices in its wake. Magnetic fields carried by the solar wind warp, twist, and snap as they slam into the magnetic fields around other objects in our solar system, blasting particles to millions of miles per hour and sending electric currents surging in magnetic storms that, around the Earth, can damage sensitive technology like satellites and power grids." So this electricity is really dangerous stuff, but here we see the usual false ideas. A solar wind blown from the surface of the Sun? It is not blown from the surface of the Sun, it accelerates away from the Sun. And what's more, the high speed winds come from the coolest parts of the Sun known as coronal holes. So it's not the heat of the Sun that accelerates these particles throughout the solar system. It is an electric field. And then this article goes on to talk about magnetic fields which do all the work, they twist and snap. Well, there is no way you can snap a magnetic field. The magnetic field line is a concept like a line of longitude or latitude which cannot snap. It is merely a concept. So, if the magnetic fields are not causing these energetic events, what is? Well, the Electric Universe turns it all around and says the very things that you're observing, these electric currents surging in magnetic storms, are that main drivers, they are the things that actually create the magnetic fields in the solar wind. So when you treat the Sun and the other objects in the solar system as charged bodies, and that the solar wind is actually a plasma which can transfer current from one object to another, you begin to see things in an entirely different light. Occasional cometary displays by asteroids is a long-standing puzzle for mainstream science. The puzzle became more complicated in late 2013 when astronomers observed an asteroid with an astonishing six comet-like tails. The asteroid has since been officially recategorized as a main belt comet. While NASA is now investigating the electrical environments of asteroids, the limited surface effects that mainstream theory describes, will never explain the observed phenomena. The article says, "On airless objects like moons and asteroids, sunlight rejects negatively charged electrons from matter, giving sunlit areas a strong positive electric charge." Now, this is taking a very simplistic view, rather like we see with comets, what happens on the surface of the moon or on an asteroid or on comets is all due to solar radiation and surface effects, photoelectric effects, that kind of thing. The Electric Universe says that an asteroid is a charged object, rather like a comet, and that the charge on its surface will be greater than anything imagined by scientists at NASA. It's merely common sense when sending astronauts to an asteroid, that you should make sure that they are earthed to the spacecraft or to the asteroid. It's the same kind of problem that electronics engineers face when messing around with transistorized circuits. They must also be earthed so that they don't discharge to the electronic circuits and blow the transistors. The last thing the astronauts want is for their electronics to fail on touchdown on an asteroid. In 2005, Wal Thornhill and The Thunderbolts Project published a series of successful predictions before NASA's Deep Impact mission to comet Tempel 1. Among these, Thornhill suggested that the copper projectile fired at the comet, would produce not one but two bright flashes including an advanced electrical flash before impact to the comet's surface. The Electric Universe makes a more significant warning. Based on the electrical model of comets and asteroids, I made the prediction before the Deep Impact mission that, when the probe approached the comet there would be a spark before it touched the comet. And this is what we're seeing. It's been explained a way, in various ways which are hardly sensible or feasible. But having predicted it, it was something that should have been investigated as a possibility. But it hasn't been. And this is one of the things which will dog the astronauts who try and land on an asteroid. That the charge on the asteroid may be greater than expected. But there is one saving grace with plasma. And that is that, if the approach is slow enough, the plasma itself will act as a conductor between the spacecraft and the asteroid and will equalize the charge. So that all that is required in my opinion, as the astronauts in their spacecraft approach the asteroid, is that some kind of lightning conductor is aimed at the asteroid from the spacecraft before the closest approach. The Electric Universe theory proposes that neither comets nor asteroids are primordial leftovers from the formation of the solar system. But rather, they are the products of recent planetary catastrophes. An opportunity to test this theory arrived in 2004, with NASA's Stardust mission to the comet Wild 2. A chemical analysis of a sample from the comet's dust tail astonish scientists around the world revealing a mineral composition vastly different from the expected aggregation of ices and primordial interstellar dust. Despite these findings, scientists continue to assume that both comets and asteroids are Rosetta stones providing insight into the early solar system. Like many of the space probes by NASA, the reason given for the actual experiments are that we are visiting asteroids because they are 'relatively pristine remnants from the formation of the solar system' quoting from the article. So, they give clues as to how the planets formed and life originated. Now, this is one of the areas where NASA is completely wrong because the story of the solar system and how it was formed, has never been shown to work. It is merely a story. The Electric Universe, on the other hand, has looked at the recent history of the solar system as recorded by our ancient forebears in various ways and it seems that the solar system has had a recent chaotic spasm during which material has been ripped from the surface of Mars, in particular, but also other bodies, and hurled into space. And asteroids and comets, in that scenario, are the remnants of planetary surfaces. Now, it's always been acknowledged that asteroids show some kind of processing. The minerals and so on from the asteroids, show that they have been on a planetary surface. But this is assumed to have been the result of collisions, early on in the formation of the solar system. We're saying these things are quite recent and that there is no real difference between comets and asteroids. And this particular claim has been borne out by almost every experiment done to determine the composition of comets. So it's important that we do try and find out more about asteroids because this will tell us about the recent history of the solar system and may actually give us the clues we need to be absolutely certain that the story of the chaotic history of the solar system and the destruction of the Martian surface is correct. It should be made clear that the magnetic field contained by the solar wind, is not explained. The magnetic fields on the Sun are not well explained either. The so-called convection zone beneath the surface of the Sun, that is supposed to generate the magnetic fields, has not been found! So, NASA keeps falling into this trap of using magnetism mysteriously generated, or magically generated, to explain everything that goes on in the solar system. And that even applies to the electric currents, which they acknowledge, between Jupiter and Saturn and their respective moons. Until we can see that the electric currents are primary causes and not merely effects, NASA will find more anomalies.

This week I received the news like many of you of Wal Thornhill's passing. I wish to pay tribute with this article. Wal was a mentor to us all in the most important field of all - the true nature of our  universe. Wal’s many theories and predictions succeeded because he sought the truth. Not for credentials, funding, accolades, or power; he sought the truth for the sake of knowing - as we all should. It's the true intent of science. It’s a true source of joy. I began this article weeks ago, to discuss the truth. It was never intended to be about Wal. It was, and still is, about truth seekers in the Electric Universe. The title “Shine on, you crazy diamond” is an ode to garage experimenters, theorists, scientists, and deep-thinkers everywhere who are grounded and harmonized with natural frequencies. But Wal was the epitome of such people. No BS got passed Wal - believe me, I tested him. So, the title now takes added meaning -  as things always do in a fractal universe. How do you know the truth when you see it? It's because you recognize a pattern. You trust yourself to know what you're seeing, hearing or feeling. You know because it resonates within you. A pattern from memory, like a mother's face, is a pattern that harmonizes heart and soul, and you know. There is no doubt the instant you recognize Mom's face, or whoever is your closest, “every bone in your body” knows it. It's something everyone does. But it isn't the work of a conscious mind. It's the work of an observant state of being. It involves every sense, conscious and unconscious, mind and body; the whole antenna resonates. Like riding a bicycle, your mind doesn't tell your body how to keep balance. It just does - as long as you stop thinking and just pay attention. When I first stumbled into the Thunderbolts project, I didn't have a clue what I was going to write about. I just knew I found the right place. In the first weeks I binged on Thunderbolts videos, especially Michael Steinbacher. I watched all of his. As an engineer with a smattering of geology experience, it made sense to look for electrical evidence on the Earth. After all, it's accessible, more so than telescopes, particle beams and buzzy, high voltage labs. Michael's videos led me to an addiction: Google Earth. I've always had a thing for maps. There are patterns, always patterns, whether looking at highways cities, airline routes, or topography - there is a wealth of information in the  patterns. Earth's Topography is patterned. I couldn't put a finger to how, or why, but I could see patterns that stretched for thousands of miles that had no ‘reasonable’  explanation. There were repeating patterns, geometric patterns. Some patterns were similar to other planets, yet others were unique. There had to be a reason. I had already dismissed conventional thinking at this point, of course, and reasoned these features must be electric. We see, plainly, electric scarring on planets and moons, and the electric atmospheres of the gas giants. So it must be on Earth - but why does Earth look so complex? I stumbled again, always stumbling, into evidence of shockwaves on hillsides. It came about because I searched “craters” and found a blog by a guy who was a demolitions expert. He was writing about shockwave features on hillsides near his home and proposing they were crater rims. He recognized harmonic tetrahedral patterning caused by sonic shock because he'd spent a career in the military analyzing the blast zones of heavy ordnance. He was a man who knew shockwaves when he saw them. As a mechanical engineer, I have a good amount of experience with such things myself. Shock waves – yes, but more importantly, I’d learned to listen to technicians like this guy. The operators, the mechanics, the people who are hands-on. If you want to know the process don't ask the people who manage it, ask the people who operate it. Beyond already knowing something about “shock diamonds”, I innately trusted this guy knew his patterns, even though he had no academic credentials. I began searching for these patterns. Lo and behold, they are everywhere. Not only did I find harmonic tetrahedrons, created by compression zones called “separation bubbles”, formed where a supersonic wave impinges on the surface. I found multiple features of fine detail distinct to shock waves embedded in rocks, mountains and entire mountain chains. Scalable, harmonic, self-similarity plastered across the globe landscape everywhere I looked could only be from one cause: sustained plasma storms. I finally had evidence, from personal investigation - from a position of knowing - what caused patterns, at least many that I saw on Earth and that we indeed live in an Electric Universe. Only a charged environment could develop supersonic winds that could freeze rock in-situ in the precise form of a shock wave. Coulomb force and recombination is the only process that makes physical sense. A dusty plasma environment would accelerate winds to supersonic speeds, rippling the landscape wherever shock waves reflected and segregating  winds by step voltage and ionic density. To produce what I witness on Earth's crust, Earth's atmosphere had to be a rainbow-banded chemical soup, like Jupiter's atmosphere. There had to be several global storms to produce the layers of geology and episodic fossil evidence of extinctions - a recurring nightmare. And since I've written several articles showing the shock features in detail, showing self-similarity between Jupiter's storms and landforms on Earth, and exploring many other geologic examples of electrical formation and scarring, I know what I'm showing you is the truth. The patterns speak for themselves. My explanations may suck. I may not describe the electric circuit properly, or organize my streams of conscience well, but the geology is there, Jupiter is there, winds, storms, rocks - it's all out there to go look at for yourself. The data I use is open source, available to anyone with an internet connection. One can research shockwave patterns, standing waves, separation bubbles and anything else I write about with a few clicks of a mouse. You can see the patterns for yourself. It's the only thing that will invoke faith, because that is what knowing the truth comes down to: faith. This brings me to the point. Faith is how you know the truth. Faith in yourself. Do you believe your lying eyes? I'm not speaking about faith in God, although that is the ultimate faith. I'm using a small “f” faith to mean conviction in any particular realm, such as the faith one has they can unerringly find their mother's face in a crowd, or ride a bike. It's a reliance on all your senses, conscious and unconscious. You recognize the pattern and your gut, heart and soul resonate. It feels right. It's common sense. When you know, you know. How else can one know they are objective unless they know and trust themselves? It's an internal thing, to be confident in oneself, and the only way to satisfy  that is to see, hear and feel for yourself. Relying on someone else's word makes one a  parrot. Now this brings to question how can I have faith I know what I'm seeing when pretty much the entire world of academia ’knows’ I'm wrong and that tectonic forces like subduction, expansion and uplift created mountains, plus billions and billions of years, blah, blah, blah. Because they don't show you anything but drawings and models. They can't explain or even try the fractal forms; the harmonic repetitions; the phase- angled vectors of frequency interference. Their explanations don't explain; they describe processes that no one has ever seen. The one thing they never talk  about is electricity in circuits, which is like explaining life without mentioning breathing. And if you dig down to their fundamental assumptions that underlie the whole house of cards, you'll find it's based on unfalsifiable billions and billions of years, dark energy-type dreamed up concepts force-fed by whatever humpty- dumps  were in charge. In other words, to believe them is to trust them rather than yourself. And, they're  idiots. I also know, because I worked in the energy industry, that much of science is political, not truthful. It's marketing - it's meant to persuade you, not inform you. This corruption is pervasive throughout quakademia. If you seek the truth without fear, or bias, you'll know when you find it because you'll find confirmation. It will  present itself - you just need to be aware. A week ago I camped on flat “alluvial” plane covered in gravel near the Colorado River. I knew the plane to be a windblown feature created in the arc-blast of a discharge event. It had nothing to do with an ancient riverbed as consensus theory would have you believe. So, I began examining the gravel. It was predominantly typical river rock, rounded by water erosion as consensus theory goes. But as I picked up rock after rock, a specific pattern became evident. Many, if not  most of the rocks I looked at had a flat side. One side was rounded and polished as if washed by sand and water, but the other side was flat. Which entirely confirmed my expectation, because I suspected such gravel to be the result of rock rain. These “river rocks” fell like rain after being blasted into the sky as molten glass and reconstituted as drops and hailstones. The ones that were still hot and molten inside but had a cooled crust, landed like pudding drops, making the flat bottom. And the top, exposed to winds, still screaming, made elongated and rounded streamlined tops to the drops. You know these rocks. They're the  best ones to skip across the lake. The flat bottom is the tell. Water erosion does not explain that. The rock rain was a pleasant surprise. I wasn't looking for it - it was just there where I camped. This happens almost continuously from things as mundane as gravel, because the entire planet is evidence. One will also find along the way people like the demolitions expert whose blog and identity is somewhere in the way-back machine. I'd like to thank and credit him. I just lost his identity. Obscure blogs and videos arrive in my streams weekly that either Inspire new insight, or confirm a prior postulation. Seek and you will find, because that's part of the pattern. I watch YouTube channels with less than 500 subscribers who know better than professors; people with no academic background but with curious minds who examine magnetism and electricity with products from eBay. I listen to people with spiritual connections whose faith comes from experiences scoffed at by consensus science. I read random articles in the news... find rocks  here and there. I live a continuous stream of synchronicities. Information specific to my questions arrives at my doorstep, as if asking the right question is all the invitation Nature needs. The universe wants to show itself to those who want the truth. The evidence is everywhere. Personal observations led us to know that the Universe is electric. We all recognize the obvious: plasma nebula, swirling galaxies and everywhere the blaze of electro-magnetic balls of discharge called stars. We can see what a crater really is, and therefore lose no sleep wondering why so many are hexagonal. We know, thanks to Halton Arp, that redshift isn’t a measuring stick and his evidence alone makes the whole Big Bang thing nonsense. We know weather  and climate is the Earth's circuitry in action, and therefore aren't shamed by our carbon footprint. What binds us all is truly electric. The ether flows through us, as the light and warmth that generates the hologram, so there must be a common carrier wave at its frequency  we all receive. Wouldn't any creature evolve the ability to ‘hear’ it, given its all-encompassing preeminence? Notwithstanding the uniquely human inability to listen, it seems a natural thing for life to feel that energy. Think of the mysterious animal behaviors, like foreknowledge of severe weather and earth- quakes. A pet knowing when a master is on the way home. Telepathic signals are real in my humble opinion and they have a physics. But one must acknowledge an ether  and look inward to find how to tune in. In this regard, we are all scientists, by my  definition. We each took a look and said that's electric, because it so obviously is. Recognizing the obvious is critical thinking. Manipulating math to invent invisible forces, energies and matter is, of course the ultimate woo. One  can make math simulate anything if you're the one making the rules. Truth  comes about due to intent. Truth is accessible to anyone with the unflinching intent to find it and speak it because it's out there waiting for you. As more people become tired of the BS, they will look for new answers. I expect many will  find us. I expressed this expectation to Wal late last year in a few brief email exchanges. He agreed the future will be amazing. He also said keep finding the patterns. Why I think this is a fitting testimony for Wal, is because he and Dave created this environment to explore truth. And that is Wal's Legacy. Cheers to anyone  who follows it. Shine on, you crazy diamond! [Music] 
here is a remarkable dilemma has occurred in all prior visits to comets no appreciable water ice was seen on the surface of the active comet Tempel 1 from the first disclosures of dry cometary surfaces theorists speculated that such surfaces simply hid the icy watery content beneath the surface they surmised that in response to solar warming pressurized pockets of subsurface water vapor formed exploding through the dry crust to create the observed Jets of active comets of course the envisioned rupture of the surface would expose the presumed ice below but has occurred in all visits to comets no detection of temple1 subsurface ice was ever reported nevertheless mission scientists tell us that infrared readings did detect substantial water ice in the ejecta cloud the Enigma deserves investigation what happened at the surface and below the surface at the moment of impact most NASA scientists interpreted the fast-moving cloud as vaporized silicates the cloud was self-luminous at an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 degrees Kelvin and the low angle of the impact and blast propelled the ejecta downrange the infrared readings of the ejecta occurred about three seconds after impact as the cloud came into the view of the infrared camera these readings show what NASA scientists described as a narrow beam of water this water column was easily distinguished from the rapidly moving dust cloud and was very close to vertical directly over the impact site that's a bizarre contrast to the trajectory of the dust cloud how did a vertical column of water get instantaneously separated from an explosion of dust heated to over 1,000 degrees and propelled downrange the electric comet model offers an answer the heated silicate cloud would be ionized a plasma a conductive pathway for an explosive electric discharge the evidence indicates the discharge occurred between a negatively charged nucleus and a surrounding region of positive charge an abundance of hydrogen ions gathered at or close to the surface of the nucleus would provide the necessary conditions for two things first an instantaneous electrical breakdown or discharge on impact and second and equally instantaneous electrochemical response to the discharge consider what is already known from laboratory experiments in a condition of electrical breakdown hydrogen ions from the solar wind combining with the oxygen and silicates can produce an abundance of hydroxyl and/or water this very process has been proposed to explain the enigmatic water on the planet Mercury the electric comet model suggests that the detected column of water directly over the impact site occurred along the path of an electric discharge and that always means roughly perpendicular to the surface water created explosively electrochemically in the ejecta even if no water lay beneath the dry surface of comet Tempel 1 this intriguing answer takes us deeper into the infrared readings the conventional model predicted that comet water ice would contain substantial quantities of dust this dust content would be expected to show up as refractory particles in the ice of the collimated ejecta plume but amazingly the ice particles themselves were free of dust it seems the instruments measured virgin water water freshly formed as one would expect from the instantaneous electrochemistry of water production from hydrated silicates this very point is emphasized in a recent analysis by dr. franklin anariba a specialist in electrochemistry at the singapore university of technology and design allow this possibility into discussions of Comet science in particular the unsolved mysteries of missing water and water creation by comets and the picture changes dramatically when we follow this possibility the missing water on the surface of temple 1 becomes an affirmation of the electric comet model 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info A new scientific study attempts to rewrite the conventional story of how planets formed. A team of scientists, using images from the Alma and VLA telescopes, are proposing that planetary formation is a process that happens exponentially faster than astronomers have ever thought possible. Space scientists have been puzzled by what appears to be an intractable shortage of planet-forming dust in the so-called ”mature disks” of stars in the Milky Way galaxy. As we reported in 2018, astronomers using Alma attempted to determine how much material is present in the disks around stars that are thought to be only one to three million years old. When they compared their estimates to the masses of star systems that have fully formed planets, they realized that the so-called “young star” systems, did not have enough matter in their discs to eventually form planets. According to the new paper, scheduled for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics, the answer to this puzzle is that planet formation is a much more rapid process than astronomers have ever believed. The scientists propose that a sufficient amount of dust to form planets around a parent star, arises surprisingly early in a star's life. As the lead author of the paper stated, "..we  need to look earlier instead of looking for missing mass.” The team concludes that around stars thought to be as young as 100,000 years old, planet formation has already begun. The co-author of the paper states, “The implication of this discovery is profound. For decades, we've thought that planet formation should happen during the proto-planetary disk phase, but by pushing the beginning stage of planet formation back, we have to rethink what the birthplace of planets actually look like.” In recent years, scientific discovery has forced a similar crisis on the question of how stars form. Consider these images of the stellar nursery in the aptly named Snake nebula, where a number of stars are forming along the filament and the stars themselves break up along the cylinder. This is in stark contrast to gravitational theory which predicts that a center of mass exists toward which all of the surrounding material in a nebular cloud tends to move, and to congregate to eventually form a star. What's more, scientists studying the Snake nebula, found that the material needed to be drawn in to form massive stars, is far less than gravitational models predict. In 2014, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics issued a press release which stated, ”Previous theories proposed that high- mass stars form within very massive isolated ‘cores’ weighing at least 100 times the mass of the Sun. These new results show that that is not the case. The data also demonstrate that massive stars aren't born alone but in groups...” ”The team also was surprised to find that these two nebular patches had fragmen- ted into individual star seeds so early in the star formation process. They detec- ted bipolar outflows and other signs of active, ongoing star formation.” The Economist Milton Friedman once said, “The only relevant test of the validity of a hypothesis is comparison of prediction with experience.” The prediction of the standard solar nebular hypothesis is that gravitational collapse and accretion are the processes that lead to the creation of stars and planets. And these formative processes occur over countless eons of time. In con- trast, the Electric Universe and plasma cosmology propose that the electromagnetic phenomenon called the Z-pinch, also known as the Bennett pinch, is a dominant organizational phenomenon in the cosmos. It was the father of plasma cosmology, Hannes Alfvén, who made the outrageous prediction that stars would form by cosmic Z-pinches along vast networks of filaments, with an electromagnetic scavenging effect in molecular clouds in each current filament. Alfvén wrote of the Bennett or Z-pinch in 1986, “That parallel currents attract each other was known already at the times of Ampere. It's easy to understand that in a plasma, currents should have a tendency to collect to filaments. In 1934, it was explicitly stated by Bennett that this should lead to the formation of a pinch.” Alfvén continues, “The problem which led him to the discovery was that the magnetic storm producing medium (the solar wind with present terminology) was not flowing out uniformly from the Sun. Hence, it was a problem in cosmic physics which led to the introduction of the pinch effect....” ”However, to most astrophysicists it is an unknown phenomenon. Indeed, important fields of research, for example, the treatment of the state in interstellar regions, including the formation of stars are still based on a neglect of Bennett's discovery more than half a century ago... present-day students in astrophysics hear nothing about it.” More than a decade ago, Alfvén’s prediction was confirmed when the ESA's Herschel Space Observatory imaged an “incredible network of filamentary structures seen in the constellation of the Southern Cross.” A 2009 ESA report stated, “That a dark, cool area such as this, would be bustling with activity was unexpected. But the images reveal a surprising amount of turmoil: the interstellar material is condensing into continuous and interconnected filaments glowing from the light emitted by new-born stars at various stages of development.” The conventional explanation for these filaments was the dissipation of some “large-scale turbulence”, involving exploding stars and sonic booms. However, such explosions, which are not evident, would be expected to impose some radial curvature on the filaments, which we simply do not see and the claim that the filaments are quote ”glowing” from the light emitted by new-born stars, cannot be tenable because the filaments glow steadily along their length, demonstrating that the light is intrinsic to the filaments, as one expects if the light output is provided by electric current. Moreover in 2011, even finer images from Herschel provided the conclusive evidence that cosmic scale electric currents flow along the filaments. An ESA report at the time states, “The filaments are huge, stretching for tens of light-years through space and Herschel has shown that newly born stars are often found in the densest parts of them... Such filaments in interstellar clouds have been glimpsed before by other infrared satellites, but they have never been seen clearly enough to have their widths measured. Now, Herschel has shown that, regardless of the length or density of a filament, the width is always roughly the same.” The lead author of the paper on the discovery stated, “This is a very big surprise..” The ESA report concludes, “This consistency of the widths demands an explanation.” Any attempt to explain the filaments constant width by explosions, is also untenable. Explosions would cause the filaments to vary markedly in brightness and width, depending on the density of the interstellar dust and the perspective from which they are viewed. However, physicists and Thunderbolts chief science adviser Wal Thornhill wrote of this discovery, “The constant width over vast distances is due to the current flowing along the Birkeland filaments, each filament constituting a part of a larger electric circuit. And in a circuit the current must be the same in the whole filament, although the current density can vary in the filament due to the electromagnetic pinch effect.” The absence of the expected amount of dust material to form both stars and planets gravitationally, is not surprising at all, if such objects are formed by the electromagnetic Z-pinch. As Alfvén noted, the electromagnetic force is exponentially greater than gravity and is scalable up to the cosmic magnitude. Wal Thornhill has proposed that planets also form electro- magnetically, often along the same current filaments on which stars form.And the weird zoo of exo- planetary systems discovered in recent decades, including the astonishing abundance of so called “hot Jupiters,” or gas giants, orbiting impossibly closely to their parent stars, has only affirmed the astounding failure of gravitational accretion theory to explain science discovery. Another important aspect of both star and planet formation, is the evidence for both such objects forming in pairs, the result of the electrical “doubling effect” of twin current filaments. As Thornhill explained in an earlier Space News, Birkeland currents are formed by two parallel current filaments which attract each other according to Ampere’s law. As they draw closer, the magnetic attraction between them is overcome by electrostatic repulsion caused by charge separation within those filaments. As a result, those filaments circle about each other to form a twisted pair, a configuration well known to electrical engineers. And it is this pairing that tends to concentrate matter in toroids and closely orbiting bodies. In this sense, plasma science explains a mystery that remains unresolved in standard cosmology. As Phys.org noted in a 2018 report, “The origin of binary stars has long been one of the central problems of astronomy.” The report noted that protostars and young stars have been found to be more likely to form in binary pairs as they are strung at intervals along the filament inside a molecular cloud. The report states of this scientific discovery, ”About half of the binaries are in elongated core structures, and they conclude that the initial cores were also elongated structures...One of their most significant major conclusions is that each dusty core of material is likely to be the birthplace of two stars, not the single star usually modeled.” And we now have evidence that a similar pairing can occur in the formation of planets. In 2018, the Keck Observatory published a report titled, “Planets around other stars are like peas in a pod.” It states, “...the team found that exoplanets tend to be the same sizes as their neighbors. If one planet is small, the next planet around that same star is very likely to be small as well, and if one planet is big, the next is likely to be big. They also found the planets orbiting the same star tend to have a regular orbital spacing.” We also note that in 2004, Thornhill and Dr. C.J. Ransom conducted indepen- dent plasma experiments on the rapid electrical formation of stone spherules. As seen in these remarkable images, Ransom and Thornhill successfully reproduced the unique forms of virtually every type of rocky body we see today. From the solid spheres we're familiar with representing a typical planet, to bodies with complex geological layering, to spherules with equatorial bands and equatorial bulges, to dramatic hemispheric dichotomies. And of course, we see the fused pair in the spherules, which is a common bi-lobate form we see among comets and asteroids. So, if prediction is the only meaningful test of the validity of a hypothesis, the question must be asked, why are space scientists today still not even entertaining the concepts of the Electric Universe and plasma cosmology? Consider institutionalized science’s response to the work of Hannes Alfvén which is described by history of science scholar Stephen G. Brush as follows.“...the continuing resistance to Alfvén’s work is based on a widely held opinion that his predictions are not derived from a plausible physical theory, that is a theory that conforms to the dominant paradigm. If a theory is not acceptable, it does not gain credit by making successful predictions. This would imply that the role of prediction as a means of evaluating scientific theories, has been exaggerated.” But one of the primary missions of this video series has been to document for posterity the actual predictive records of the Electric Universe and plasma cosmology. The only position we have taken is that the astounding successes of these predictions makes them worthy of sober scientific investigation at the level of institutionalized science. Well into the 21st century, this  invitation for scientific progress remains unanswered. [Music] 
the son is an enigma for 70 years we have believed its core to be a thermonuclear furnace yet all our attempts to reproduce the hypothesized fusion have failed with new technology we now see the Sun in spectacular detail and what we are seeing is not what we expected charged particles defy gravity exploding from the sun's surface at millions of miles per hour and then continuing to accelerate out past the inner planets the sun's temperature increases by millions of degrees as we move away from its surface polar Jets erupt along magnetic field lines this activity above the sun's surface requires something beyond a thermonuclear core but it is exactly what is to be expected from an external electric field acting on the Sun what will happen to the space sciences if we are able to reproduce the features of the Sun electrically in a laboratory the Thunderbolts project extends you an invitation to find it you 
welcome to space news from the electric universe brought to you by the thunderbolts project at Thunderbolts dot info in the last two space news episodes while Thornhill has reported on recent discoveries that provide stunning foundational affirmation of the electric universe theory we now turn our attention to the latest science reports from the ESA s Rosetta mission to comet 67p the comparative predictive success of the electric comet theory versus that the standard dirty snowball Theory cannot be more striking the electric universe states that comets are not icy fluff balls that formed billions of years ago in the solar system's infancy as conventional theory has proposed for several decades rather comets as well as asteroids and meteorites were electrically excavated from planets and moons this seemingly outrageous prediction accurately foretold the astonishing planetary features of 67p including its towering cliffs its rock and boulders strewn terrain it's extraordinary topographical variety and of course it's utterly desiccated and barren surface to smooth icy terrain long ago predicted by standard theory could not be more emphatically refuted today we see some indications of the beginnings of the inevitable paradigm shift in comet science a space.com report on June 2nd 2015 describes the comet as a quote space rock with a quote rocky surface most impressively nowhere in the short article did the author attempt to force fit the word ice into descriptions of the Comets desert like terrain a further hint can be found in the abstract of the recent paper the solar wind interaction with comet churyumov-gerasimenko discussing data on solar wind interaction with the comet the author's state as the comet moves closer to the Sun these effects should increase along with possibly other new an unexpected plasma and field phenomena the electric universe predicts that cometary activity is fundamentally electrical activity the comet acquires a negative charge with respect to its and in the outer reaches of the solar system as it approaches the inner limits of its orbit moving through the sun's weak electric field it will begin to discharge to the plasma surrounding it producing the comet's coma in tailed comet Jets our electrical discharge phenomena they are not the result of solar warming heating invisible theoretical subsurface ices this interpretation of comet Jets is supported by the images of Comet 67p to fill a mentor ejects which are often curved and occasionally divert in opposing directions behave nothing like gas and dust dispersed in a vacuum furthermore the Jets haven't seen emitting even when not exposed to sunlight harkening back to the completely unexpected discovery of jets at comet ville - which exploded from the dark unheated side of the comet spectroscopic readings had scientists interpret as evidence for invisible sublimating ices are the result of electrochemical processes these extremely controversial predictions have received stunning support from the Rosetta mission in late 2014 greatly enhanced electron fluxes and densities were found surprisingly close to the comet nucleus and today scientists are reporting that these electrons play a significant role in the breakup of molecules in the comet's coma a June 4th Universe Today article on this data states a NASA science instrument flying aboard the European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft has made a very surprising discovery namely that the molecular breakup mechanism of quote water and carbon dioxide molecule spewing from the Comets surface into the atmosphere of Comet 67p churyumov-gerasimenko is caused by quote electrons close to the surface the article also states that the combat discovery is quote causing scientists to completely rethink what we know about the wandering bodies principal investigator Alan Stern states the discovery we're reporting is quite unexpected however as wal Thornhill explains scientists interpretation of this data is based on the continued assumption of a quote ice Comet the third report comes from the Rosetta team comet 67p churyumov-gerasimenko quote has revealed an unexpected process at work causing the rapid breakup of water and carbon dioxide molecules spewing from the comet's surface end of quote note that it is simply assumed that water and carbon dioxide molecules are issuing from the comet the appearance of energized atoms is unexpected because scientists are wedded to the idea that comets are icy leftovers from the formation of the solar system and that neutral complete molecules of those ices are released in jets by solar heating as the comet swings nearer the Sun ultraviolet radiation from the Sun is then believed to be responsible for breaking those molecules apart at large distances from the comet but the Rosetta team was surprised to find oxygen and carbon atoms within tens to a hundred metres of the Comets surface much too close for solar UV to have been responsible what's more these atoms show evidence of having been dislodged from parent molecules by energetic electrons the only recourse given the conventional beliefs about comets is to suggest that the electrons come from UV dissociation of water molecules in November last year greatly enhanced electron fluxes and densities were found about the comet by another rosetta instrument which appeared to be associated with cometary ions created near the nucleus the problem is that solar ultraviolet radiation was thought to break down neutral molecules into charged atoms and ions over distances of hundreds or thousands of kilometres from the comet nucleus and not smack bang up against the nucleus in contrast the electric universe model predicted long ago the presence of energetic electrons and excited atoms right down to the Comets surface it is a cold cathode type discharge sputtering atoms from rock minerals on the Comets surface to form collimated cathode Jets of ultrafine dust excited atoms and electrons sublimating ices are not necessary clearly Comet 67p looks like rock with no sign of Isis recent reports have begun calling it a rock or rocky meanwhile the journal Nature on April 20 expressed surprise when the dark side of the comet suddenly sprouted a jet this too was predicted long ago by the electric universe model energetic electrons and excited atoms should be found in such dark jets in the absence of solar UV on the dark side of the comet these three recent reports signal that a paradigm shift must happen it will seem obvious in retrospect all matter in the universe is electrical in nature to have a cosmology that ignores electricity and relies on the force of gravity which is 39 orders of magnitude weaker than the electric force that's as close to zero as you can practically get will seem incredible in future the electric universe conference later this month is unique in its broad interdisciplinary scope which is another pointer to its future success be there it's a chance to see history in the making for continuous updates on space news from the electric universe stay tuned to Thunderbolts dot info 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe brought to you by the Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts. Info. In previous episodes, we have introduced the strange and special role of our planet’s parent star in ancient world traditions. In global myth, folklore, religion and rock art, the celestial body identified as the Sun, bears no resemblance at all to the Sun as it appears in our sky today. The recurring anomalous representations include an orb or star within a crescent and the many traditions which depict the Sun as a spectacular celestial wheel, sometimes with a warrior hero appearing as the axle of the wheel with no modern natural referent. Why do such depictions recur in ancient tradition, art and storytelling across the world? For over 40 years comparative mythologist Ev Cochran, along with colleague David Talbot, have exhaustively explored this question. Through decades of cross-cultural investigation, they have worked to reconstruct the historical phenomena recorded in the ancient record in prehistory. Today Ev continues in more detail on the linguistic aspects of his investigation, beginning with a provocative suggestion that the ancient Sun God and Thunder God may be one and the same celestial entity. That is indeed our position based upon the collective findings of day Talbot, Wal Thornhill and myself. As we have long noted, prehistoric paintings and petroglyphs depicting the Sun, bear zero resemblance to the current solar orb. So-called Sun petroglyphs commonly depicted for  8-spoke wheel-like structure. Other images depict a thunderbolt-like form set upon the face of the Sun. Properly understood, the second image is simply a variation on the first and represents an evolutionary phase in the history of the polar configuration, in which the rays of the primeval Sun become bent or twisted due to z-pinch forces. The logical conclusion to be drawn from such universal imagery is 1) that the prototypical Sun is not to be confused  with the present solar orb; 2) the prototypical Sun was the focus of intense electrical activity, marked by the discharge of heaven-spanning thunderbolts; and 3) the prototypical Sun had a dynamic history and presented a wide variety of different forms, all intimately related to each other. Consider the image depicted in figure 3: it depicts a swastika-like form in the center of the Sun disk. The resemblance between this form and that depicted in Figure 2 is evident at once. Is it any wonder then to find that the ancient Norse conceptualized Thor's Thunderbolt as a swastika? Elsewhere however, the Norse sky watchers represented the god’s thunderbolt as a fiery wheel. it's notable that in various ancient languages terms “the Sun” and “thunderstorm” are identical and/or cognate in nature. the Sumerian term “Ud” for example,  denotes both Sun and Storm. So too the Semitic term “Umu” denotes Sun as well as storm. Analogous linguistic structures are also evident in the Mayan languages of the new world. Yet, why should this be the case, given the current order of the solar system, where the Sun is never the source of lightning or storms. Striking contrast the current reality, ancient reports of the sunrise typically mention lightning and thunder among the effects accompanying the appearance of the Sun. Consider the following Sumerian hymn: “The  Lord [the Sun-God Utu] thunders over  the mountains like a storm.” Equally important is the fact that ancient words for solar radiance often mean “lightning” or “thunderbolt,” much as would be expected if the energetic discharges of the prototypical Sun and Thunder God were one and the same. The German word “strahlen,” rays or radiance of the Sun for example, is elsewhere employed to describe a flash  and lightning: “blitzstrahl.” The inherent relation between solar rays and lightning is shown by the fact that the cognate term “strala” denotes the lightning-like arrows shot by the Slavic Thunder God, Perun. The Latin word ”radius” is also of interest here. In addition to: ray, beam, sunbeam, radius also denotes “spoke,” much as we would expect if the original source of the reference was a wheel-like Sun whose radiating sunbeams presented the appearance of the spoke. Yet the same word elsewhere appears in words for lightning, witness the Spanish word “rayo” which means: ray, beam, Sun beam, but also thunderbolt. Consider also the Homeric  word “asterope,” denoting “lightning,” is reference to a celestial body in as much  as Greek “aster” denotes “star.” This etymology alone supports the conclusion that the Greek concept of lightning was quite literally a star-based phenomenon. The archaic phrase preserved in a  Orphic hymn: “asterobletos keraunon” (star- flung thunderbolt) points to the same conclusion, needless to say. In light of this linguistic evidence, it is relevant to note the ancient depictions of the Semitic Thunder God Hadad, depict  him holding the tri-formed thunderbolt while a star hovers over his head, as if to signal that the Thunder God was a star himself. Note further the specific structure of the Thunder God’s weapon forms a close match to the thunderbolt depicted in Figure 2 above, where it is set upon the faces of the Sun. In short, the evidence of prehistoric rock art, early literary traditions and early languages, is consistent in describing an ancient Sun God that was dramatically different in appearance and behavior than the present Sun, much as Dave Talbot and I have been arguing for 40-plus years now.

[Music] Awareness of plasma behavior changes everything. I've outlined in the previous episodes of this story arc how it expands explanatory opportunities into domains of greater size and power and intricacy  than is possible with ideas of gas and gravity. More and bigger events can happen faster and with discontinuous changes and emergent properties not present in individual elements. It changes how we think along with what we think. The change in thinking will affect not only the underlying metaphysical assumptions of the physical sciences, but also those of other areas of thought such as  history. It affects not only past thinking, but also modern thinking. In this episode we'll  be playing with the recent centuries’ thinking. One implication of faster is a shortening of history. Ancient history, which is stories we tell in the present, is based largely on our present interpretations of texts, which were written by and for the rulers. It's no secret that their purpose was not to produce an objective and dispassionate account of events, but to justify and to glorify the king. It's more accurate to call them propaganda than records. It's not surprising that they contain many paradoxes. Those paradoxes may be partly resolved with stratigraphy-based and cataclysm benchmark revisions. For example, the history - I should say histories, because there are several conflicting ones - of the roman empire seems to describe three episodes that are largely repeats of each other. Emperors with similar names, but in different locations, and assigned to different times, engaged in similar activities and succeeded each other in similar sequences. The stratigraphy of the ruins has always been confusing; it's as if strata also repeated themselves after an unknown dark age, the historian's equivalent of the astronomer’s dark matter. And the end of each episode was marked by catastrophic destruction and tales of comets, bloody auroras, plagues and earthquakes. Each episode was located in a different region. The Early Empire in the East collapsed in the 3rd century CE. The Middle Empire in Europe collapsed in the 6th century CE, and the Late Empire, around Italy, collapsed in the 10th century CE. One revision, to be found at Q-mag.org, proposes that the three episodes occurred simultaneously in the three regions and were recorded with the regional characteristics and customs. Afterward, historians stitched them together diachronically in a sequence. The benchmarks are collapses, which were  a single, regional if not global, cataclysm. Suggestively, tree ring and other physical anomalies have been associated with those dates, indicating that the collapse was environmental, as well as  civilizational. The revisionist proposal is that the first millennium of the common era actually had a duration of only three to four centuries. Other revisionists contend that something similar happened with the first three centuries of the second millennium. If all these revisions hold up, the  duration of the common era would be cut in half. Furthermore, other stratigraphic investigations with similar catastrophic benchmarks in mind, suggest the necessity of revising BCE history. There are many instances of similar events, and similar names, in different regions and assigned to different times. Many civilizations collapsed suddenly in all-consuming devastations of fire and earthquake and they left similar strata. Again, if all revisions hold up, the three millennia or so of that era would collapse into something on the order of one millennium. In total, the conventional five millennia of western history actually would have lasted only two millennia. Again, my point is not to argue for these shockingly extreme revisions, but to suggest the more extensive possibilities of the wider sensibilities implied by plasma behavior and a larger and faster world- view. If the energy distribution of space plasma phenomena follows a power law, lower-energy events would be more common than higher-energy ones, and the catastrophic episodes would be interspersed with more moderate disruptive events. For example, the Carrington event of 1859 has been attributed to a solar flare. The flare caused a magnetic storm that, among other effects, induced anomalous currents in the recently erected telegraph network. Sparks flew between the wires and supports; operators were shocked and some were able to send messages after disconnecting from the power sources. In 2012 a flare of similar magnitude missed the earth by nine days. If it had hit with the same intensity as the Carrington event, it would have knocked out power grids and distribution stations and perhaps have damaged many electronics. That would have been disruptive, but not empire-ending catastrophic. The Great Chicago Fire of 1871, if neglected reports are anywhere close to accurate, occurred at the same time to the hour as the Peshtigo Fire, farther to the north. Stories of widespread prairie fires at about the same time trickled back from trappers and homesteaders on the plains. Altogether, the reports suggest the occurrence of a conflagration that covered the northern plains from Wisconsin to the Rockies. A few reports of strange fires came from San Francisco. Some eyewitnesses claimed that tornadoes of fire descended from the sky, and that  wood and stone buildings alike were consumed. Some victims fell dead in unburned fields. And some bodies were unmarked, but had coins in their pockets that were melted. How much of this might be fire-induced fantasy, and how much might be the previously unrecognized effects of a region-wide plasma discharge from space? Setting willful belief and disbelief aside, how might these stories be tested? In 1871 such reports were entertainment, except in Chicago. Today, when much of the country has become Chicago, such an event would be catastrophic. A global catastrophic event would cause everyone to respond with typical trauma-induced behavior such as denial, amnesia and compulsive repetition or acting out. The psychological knot of fixation from the trauma would be unconscious and long- lasting. It would produce similar images and folklore around the globe, transmitted by traditions and culture. Perhaps also by some genetic mechanism. Carl Jung, among many psychologists, discovered that some of his patients reproduced images from antiquity or myth that they would not likely have seen in their  daily lives. The neurotic behavioral emergence of repressed global trauma from the age of myth would be masked by amnesia and denial, as well as by the absence of contrasting behavior. Everybody does it. But it would result in imitating the old gripping stories about a war of the gods. One should ask, why do they grip? Much of  humanity's present behavior that strikes us as crazy - wars, much of politics, much of religion, even much of science - may be the neurotic consequences of traumatic global catastrophes in a not so distant  past. One example may be the ubiquity of a mythic theme of centralization and hierarchy. The heavenly city of the gods, with power radiating from the center. The mythic compulsion is, ‘as above, so below’. We must imitate the gods. So people build centrally arranged cities with city centers dominated by towers and ringed with suburbs. They organize societies into centrally commanded states with a ruler - king, president, or even bureaucracy - at the top. They regiment themselves into military chains- of-command. Their family structures follow the pattern of patriarchy, father rule. The compulsion is contained in the suffix archy, rule, exerting power over others as the gods did over our ancestors, as  distinguished from intrinsic development or mutual cooperation or symbiosis. People say that's just natural; that other animal species do those things too. But that would be the meaning of global trauma. All species would be traumatized. Outside of hierarchy, strictly speaking, most organization in life is networking. Someone must be in charge, people say, but who commands the flowers to bloom? We want to attribute such events, if we even recognize them, to far-away places or to long-ago times. We want to believe that our world is stable, and that such cataclysms are impossible. But in a plasma universe they impinge on us. The traumatic events are more recent and more likely to repeat. Our PTSD is stronger and more pervasive than we would like to admit. The terror is closer to hand. The repressed memories leak out in anxieties of a looming doomsday. Climate change, pandemic, nuclear war, famine, civilizational collapse. At the same time, the shift from a gas- and gravity cosmology, unsettles our mistaken certainty in that understanding. The novel and bigger understanding in the makings of a plasma and electricity cosmology, is flooded with uncertainty. We're at the beginning, and what we think we know about plasma is surely little more than a glimpse at this time. Our world no longer makes as much sense as  it did. Having said that, that humanity may be neurotic, I must remind myself of what Thomas Szasz, a controversial psychiatrist wrote, ”To the psychiatrist the neurosis is the problem, but to the patient the neurosis is the solution.” A neurosis is a coping or adapting mechanism, however sub-optimal, that aids survival. You have to dig a lot deeper than superficial similarities to understand what humanity's problem is. In view of the global trauma that may have happened, we shouldn't be too hard on ourselves. We're doing pretty well. We crave answers, but at this time what we need are questions. What we need is to expand opportunity of thinking as we've expanded our observational ability. For example, the Palomar telescope, which accompanied Big Bang thinking, has been expanded into the James Webb  Telescope. But its images are still being interpreted with Big Bang thinking. We crave certainty, which can only be had with an act of will, and a leap into belief, with the consequent restriction of opportunity of thinking. What we need is doubt, especially with regard  to the belief-fortified dogmas of modern science. What we need is not to take any of this too  seriously. We need to be playing with thinking. [Music] 
The Catastrophic Termination of the Last Ice Age (excerpt) The Moai and you have all kinds of incredible mysteries their notice Moai with the hands and the elbow. Just as a side note, you get something very similar to Göbekli Tepe I think but... These are some of the petroglyphs notice the hands we were just hearing about the hand shape. And you have comparisons, these are just some comparisons between Easter in Petro and Göbekli Tepe, but what you have on Easter island which is really very strange and mysterious is this so-called indigenous, was indigenous script, indigenous something, this is a modern reconstruction, a monument outside the governor's office but the rongorongo script. Have people heard about that? It's on wooden tablets only about two dozen, 26 or so. People argue about the authenticity of some of them. Are known at this point they are inscribed on these wooden tablets and these have never been, to this moment unless we write about it, really been properly interpreted or deciphered. So, we're looking at these, we come back from Easter Island was surveyed like a little break tooth from thinking about other things we're looking at but I can't get my mind off, you know... Why do civilizations disappear, why did the Ice Age end? We watch 'Symbols of an Alien Sky' and Katie says to me Well, you know those rongorongo characters they certainly look like the plasma petroglyphs. And we starting to look at them, and look at them and I've gotta say I tend to be skeptical about things that first right thing or you know... I didn't want to watch it again, I mean, no no insult to you... but I mean, I'd seen a 'Symbols of an Alien Sky' before I found it really interesting but she insisted all we should watch it again, good to relax the brain. And here we're looking at this, and these are rongorongo glyphs. See them there? This is someone here, another one here and I believe, we believe that as you start looking at this, you get the same imagery, you get the same forms very consistently I gotta say that, you know, it's just been crazy the diverse interpretations did very very despair trying to interpret rongorongo if you look at the literature about it, which I've read, of the literature I try to get my hands on I'm not find an inc in even convincing but it does make sense to me that these glyphs record or were inspired by these plasma configurations. And I just throw this, I well, not throw it in this, and I think it has been suggested by Tony Peratt and his group that Nazca the Nasca Lines may record, well, he didn't really get into the glyphs, the huge glyphs on the surface that you have there, but you start looking at these, you were looking at rongorongo there's a petroglyph of the Easter arm with the hand symbol and I while you have that Nazca too, wondering, does this all start to tie together again as a unifying thing. You look at other aspects of this... And I realize what time it is, I'm paying attention on time. ...but you look at other aspects to this for instance, some of the legends and I come to this great detail but Easter Island. There's a legend I want read this, "In the days of Rokoroko He Tau the sky fell", whether they referring to by the sky falling that, "Fell from above onto the earth. The people cried out, 'The sky has fallen in the days of King Rokoroko He Tau.' He took hold: he waited a given time. The sky returned; it went away and it stayed up there". Again so, who could this be referring to? Plasma changes in the sky. So, we suggest Katie and I, that maybe the rongorongo tablets are reporting some kind of, if it's solar plasma outbursts or maybe in the context here, other types of plasma configurations, cataclysm, geomagnetic storms, could it be recording this. In fact, when you look at the glyphs they seem to, in many cases, morph from one form to another as if they're record in like a film different configurations in the sky. We suggest that maybe it's what we call scientific text, or you know, and this original ones, like anything some of this could have been lost later, it could have been reused, it could been tried to turn into some type of language later, but I'm suggesting for the origin of these glyphs. Could it be that they were recording some kind of plasma events? Whether it's a solar ejection, something like the Carrington event or something much more dramatic, and could this be the end of the last ice age? Could a plasma event like that, be what caused the end of the last ice age? It would come down, it would hit, it would incinerate the surface of the Earth, it would leave only large stone structures, which is what you have surviving. It's now been documented very recently within the last couple years that so many neolithic structures from around the end of the last ice age they are associated with underground tunnels and caves, artificial caves. Why would you did those? Why would you dig into... not dig, carve into rock? Spend tremendous amount of time, time and energy to do that. Well, if you're trying to survive a cataclysm from above, the early fire coming down. That would create deluges, huge floods, biblical floods, evaporating water, evaporating ice, you would have to precipitate out again, you rise, you are causing, ice sheets to melt, sea levels are rising earthquakes, volcanic activity increased, you find around the world and I just mention this couple of example for instances, Easter Island, this low, thick, stone "houses", they're almost like fallout shelters or protected shelters, also even Easter Island, their use of artificial caves to avoid give you just a example, you have things like Mesa Verde I don't know, where they just under cliffs for the fun or was that, in some cases are not say all this would go back that far but is it a collective memory? Is it a memory that you have to protect yourself for what may come in the future? Back to Göbekli Tepe, were they seeking to protect themselves? Was this plasma come in down, was literally burning and incinerating that they want to protect this structure? I throw it out there and could this be because of the great rains ultimately that eroded the Sphinx, could it pushes all back? The geology does not deny that it could be that all, it's compatible. And again Peratt and his group have questioned the date. Well, as I said, here I'm suggesting that maybe at least one of these major events, because there may be more than one, could have been at 9,700 BCE by conventional date, I realize not everyone accepts a conventional dating here and that this could have wiped everything out. And I've got two more slides, because I know I'm running out of time. Could it happen again? This is something that people ask me. This was published in astronomy and astrophysics similar things have been published in Nature for instance so, can this is a good conventional peer review. In this case we're looking at a reconstruction of solar activity this is the end the last Ice Age. You know so incredible mood swings if you would of the Sun and are very high solar activity and sort of decline since it was end of last Ice Age, 7,000 or so BC declines, we have low, notice that we're ramping up again in the last century or less there's a lot of indication, things are happening, things are going active again so, I would say be prepared although I'm not. Yeah, I don't want be overly dramatic, but who knows... If something hits tomorrow, you heard it here right? 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info The following presentation is an adaptation of the Mel Acheson picture of the day article, “Really?” The link to the article may be found in the description box of this video. What's reality? For science, for the past century or more it's “what's out there”, “the given”. And we get to know it by looking at it. I say ”looking” to mean all sensation. To get to know it better, we need only to look closer. To that end, we invent microscopes and telescopes to magnify it. We substitute electronic devices for our eyes in order to “see” reality in radio and X-ray wavelengths. Our technologically enhanced senses have put us more in touch with reality than at any other time in the history of our species. But we've known all along that's not how knowing works. And if that's not how we know, what we know probably isn't what we think it is. Reality may not be real. Looking only produces a tingling in the nerves. Sensation, as such, is meaningless. People learn to make sense of their sensations soon after birth, and by the time they can talk, they've forgotten how they learned and even that they did learn. But when cataract surgery was first perfected, it enabled many people who had been blind from birth to see for the first time. Marius von Senden wrote about their experiences in Space and Sight. The newly sighted people experienced patches of color or brightness without meaning. They had to learn to associate the patches with concepts previously associated with other sensations. This may be the only episode in the history of our species in which individuals capable of communicating their response experienced “pure observation”. Nor do nerves transmit anything. One nerve is stimulated to discharge its tiny electrical spark, and this may stimulate nearby nerves to discharge theirs. There's no variation in amplitude, no “gray tones”. It's either on or off. When the chain of discharges reaches the brain, the only way to distinguish one spark from another is the relationship with all other sparks. These relationships can form into groups, and the groups can become associated. Associations of associations can stimulate each other. Hierarchies of associations can develop, which can become “tangled” by associations among higher- and lower-level associations. In this way, a dynamic classification system arises. It creates the sensory order which is not so much a one-to-one mapping of the real world as a metaphor of it. For example, in the real world, colors are part of a linear arrangement of increasing wavelengths. Beyond red is infrared, and beyond violet is ultraviolet. But in the sensory order, red and violet join at purple to make a circle. There is no purple wavelength in the real world. So, looking can in no way be equated with knowing. We need an idea to make sense of sensation. That's what theories do. It's also what fantasies do, and they're not what we usually consider to be knowledge. We're missing something. What turns percepts and concepts, those associations of nervous sparks, into knowledge is judgment: answering the question, “Is it true?” Either answer - yes or no - does the trick. Douglas Allchin points out in The Epistemology of Error, “The key epistemological distinction ... is between empirically unresolved questions, or uncertainty, and resolved questions...” between determinate and ambiguous. But judgment, unlike diamonds, is seldom forever. There can be new sensations, new data, and new ideas, new theories. Old sensations and ideas can be rearranged. The question for judgment can be recalled. The determinate can become ambiguous again. The tangled hierarchies of associations of associations of nerve sparks are continually re-energizing themselves and shifting their patterns. Sometimes they reorganize themselves en masse: There can be paradigm shifts which shift reality. How can reality shift if it's “what's out there,” to be known by looking at it? Maybe we started our march down Epistemology Lane on the wrong foot. Notice that from the beginning, we've unconsciously assumed a dichotomy between a “real” “out there” and what must therefore be an ”unreal” “in here”. One of Piet Hein’s Grooks is pertinent: “lines we neatly drew and later neatly stumbled over.” A clue to catching our balance is to notice that, to me, your nerve sparks encompass each other and can't be dichotomies. Notice too that equating knowing with looking, also equates reality with the descriptions of that looking. This error underlies much of modern physics: Mathematical equations are symbolic representations of the descriptions of looking, so equating reality with the descriptions, reduces reality to a set of equations. A vicious circle results: The equations allow you to deduce reality and you no longer need even to look. What began as empiricism ends up as idealism. The objective and the subjective become confused. Cause and effect become meaningless. The arrow of time becomes an illusion, as in relativity, and existence depends on measurement, as in quantum mechanics. Our unconscious assumptions in the beginning, have come back around to bite us on the ankle. And in light of the nerve sparks and sensory metaphors and mutable judgments, an even more basic unconscious and untenable assumption comes to light: that reality is something we start with. For science, for the cognitive understanding of our experiences, reality is really what we end up with. [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts. info In recent days, NASA's New Horizons team has released what is the best closest up image to date of the Kuiper Belt object known as Ultima Thule. This was the subject of a recent Space News and Wal kind of introduced some of the differences between the mainstream interpretations and predictions for an object like Ultima Thule versus those of the Electric Universe. Now in this latest picture the first thing that stands out when looking at this picture is the number of features that look basically identical to features that we see on a lot of objects in the inner solar system such as asteroids and moons. And that is the number of highly circular craters and what one might call what appear to be chains of craters although it's not entirely evident because portions of the object are in shadow. And, on the smaller of the two lobes that compose Ultima Thule, we see one crater that is absolutely enormous. Now there's a reason why the New Horizons team is hesitant to talk about possible crater chains and an improbably huge crater on this Kuiper Belt object. Instead thus far, they are favoring terms like depressions and collapse pits and the reason for that is, you do not expect the kind of high- velocity explosions that Impact Theory would probably require to produce these features. And of course, the explanation that the New Horizons team has offered for Ultima Thule's double-lobed form is a low-speed collision between two objects in the so-called early solar system which this traditional story tells us was four and a half billion years ago. So I'm now going to bring up Wal Thornhill. Wal and I have been discussing this new image over the last couple of days and so Wal, I think it would be good if we could lay a little bit of groundwork just in case there are any newcomers who have come to this video. Why don't you begin by explaining what some of your thoughts were about Ultima Thule even before the New Horizons spacecraft arrived at the object and why don't you share what your initial thoughts have been as the images of Ultima Thule have gotten better and better? Okay, when the New Horizons newest and best yet view of Ultima Thule appeared on the web, I was struck by just how much it looks like comet nuclei in the inner solar system. Also, it has this neck joining two objects which is somewhat different from either of the adjoining lobes as they call them. It's brighter and if we remember Comet 67P, you saw a sand or some kind of material on that neck region between the two lobes. And it even had what appeared to be sand dunes. Well, the connection between the lobes appears to be something that happens after the lobes have generally been formed but during the same process. Now you know, in an earlier Space News or 'Seeing Double' it was called, I pointed out that, in the plasma cosmology view, stars are formed by interstellar Birkeland current filaments inside molecular clouds. In other words, it's a dusty plasma. And we know from research that's been done and published by Don Scott and others, that the dust is accumulated much more powerfully into central objects on that filament by the long-range electromagnetic forces involved with electric currents in, what you might call, lightning bolts inside molecular clouds. I went further a little later and pointed out that all solid objects, all solid bodies are formed in that same process. There is no need to call upon gravitational accretion which has never been shown to work. One of the big problems is, even if you have a circulating disk of dust and gas, you have the problem of getting rid of the angular momentum of that disk. There's no reason for the material at the outer edges to fall in towards the center once it achieves a certain velocity of rotation about that center. So I expected, on the basis of also the recent history of the solar system, that the bodies in the outer solar system would show all of the same features as those seen in the inner solar system. Because, to put it simply, the solar system is a blended family of objects that have been captured by the Sun after the formation of the Sun. It had nothing to do with leftovers from the Sun and this explains all of the mysteries about isotopic compositions and the differences between the planets because our solar system, if you look at it dispassionately without the gravitational theory as a lens, a distorting lens, it's a fruit salad of objects. They're all different. They have different axial tilts and their rotation rates are hard to explain, the angular momentum of the whole system is hard to explain in the gravitational theory and they exhibit behavior, magnetic fields, and weather patterns, which are still unexplained. Given all of these facts, and when you realize that you're looking through every space shot that's been sent up to tell us how the solar system was formed, is viewed through this distorting lens of gravitational accretion. So, Ultima Thule was a big test really, because I had already predicted that this would be the case that objects even in the outer solar system would tend to be formed in pairs, sometimes joined during the process of formation. It's interesting to look at the language of the reports of the closest up image yet of this object because the language has changed. It's an indication of cognitive dissonance. In other words, what they're seeing doesn't match what they expected. When I saw it, the first thing that struck me was the circular crater on the smaller lobe which is facing towards us. And one of the key aspects of electrical scarring is circular cratering. With no debris in the crater, it's looked as though, it's been machined and also there is a propensity for the discharge as it fades to switch to other high points near the central crater and of course the nearest high point on our crater is the rim and you'll notice there are at least three that I can see, smaller circular craters perched on the rim of that larger crater. Now, I'm calling it a crater but the language in the report says, 'the large circular feature about four miles or seven kilometers across on the smaller of the two lobes appears to be a deep depression'. Of course, the reason why they use the words 'deep depression' is that for a crater to have occurred it means that the collision must have been at high speed and as we've said the whole idea behind the standard model of trying to explain this object is low-speed collisions. You know, five kilometers an hour or less, the sort of bump in a parking lot. That just doesn't work with a crater that size. Right. Four miles across. 7 kilometers across. That requires an impact which should have shattered the object. Because remember, these are supposed to be ices and dust that have been accreted from a very thinly dispersed cloud of dust and gas. You do not expect an object to form that is solid enough to receive an impact like that and survive. And what's more, at that distance from the Sun the orbital speed is very low and any other objects that are following the same orbit will only have minor differences in speed and this is why they talk about a bump in a parking lot. Right. Because the analogy is fairly accurate based on the gravitational model. But what we see has nothing to do with low-speed collisions. And what's more, impact craters themselves are an assumption because in the gravitational theory the only way to form craters like that is with impacts. You're very limited in what you can actually explain with impacts. No one has actually observed the before-and-after of a celestial impact of sufficient size to create a crater that size. So this is all mere speculation or maybe just a story, a cover story, to hide our fundamental ignorance. Right. Well, we should mention that this crater, what we're calling a crater that we see on the smaller lobe of Ultima Thule. This is not the first instance when we've seen an object in our solar system with a crater that is so huge that it would have destroyed the body if it was caused by a kinetic impact. If you look at some of the moons of Saturn - Mimas and Tethys are the most dramatic examples. If you look at the Martian moon Phobos and Stickney crater, and if you look at the asteroid Vesta, in all of these instances you see craters which astronomers themselves admit should have shattered the body if they were caused by mechanical collisions and high-velocity explosions. That's correct. The other evidence for electrical scarring are the small regular circular pits on the larger lobe. At the top of the image that I'm looking at that was published, you can see there are three small circular pits in a row and in fact there's a couple of smaller ones heading up towards the top of the lobe. But then, in, almost in the shadowed regions at the top you see another chain of craters. There's at least four there and they may actually continue across the shadow to to meet up with another one on the far side. Now, crater chains are electrical formations. There's no other explanation for them. In the inner solar system, the story went that any incoming bolide fractured, more or less, in space before it hit. Under the gravitational influence of the body that it was impacting. And they, sort of, splattered across the face of that object, But this is not, that doesn't explain the circularity, the fact that one crater doesn't disturb the other. And there's no fill from one crater that happened after another. So, the electrical theory is, I submit, the only theory which can explain these features. And in fact, it's one explanation for all of the observations, not special dispensations for different bodies simply because they don't fit the pattern. Right. All of the strange features including the craters on the Moon and the ray-craters and all of that was explained by Ralph Juergens back in the 1970's in a brilliant series of articles on the electrical scarring of the Moon and Mars. You could then extend his work without making any other ad-hoc assumptions to all of the bodies we've seen since then. Well, I think this actually might be a good point to just take a moment and examine some of the recent discoveries that we've reported here on Space News, which relate very directly to this question of our solar system's history and origins. So obviously, as one expects, the New Horizons team is holding to this traditional idea of a solar system that formed from a gravitationally collapsing nebular cloud and this happened four and a half billion years ago. And the only process they can imagine forming an object like Ultima Thule is gravitational accretion. And yet the real question I have is why any of these assumptions continue to endure since, as we have reported, there are more problems and anomalies for the nebular hypothesis than there are successes and we report routinely on discoveries which planetary scientists admit, it's not us saying this, it's planetary scientists who say that these discoveries can't be reconciled with the solar system's conventional history and origins. So just very quickly bear with me, I'll give just a few examples. Last year we reported on the discovery of the so called Hypatia stone which is a meteorite fragment that was discovered in a glass field in Libya and which is composed of this "weird matrix" of minerals which planetary scientists admit they can't explain. And the reason they can't explain it is the meteorite is supposed to have originated from a homogeneous primordial dust cloud. And also late last year, planetary scientists discovered that there's a group of asteroids near Neptune which actually appear to be identical to asteroids that are close to Jupiter which are so-called sun-baked asteroids. So here's a quick excerpt from a Scientific American piece on that discovery. "...the Neptunian asteroids are so far from the Sun that their surfaces should have stayed almost pristine since birth, scarcely altered by our nearest star's warming rays... and yet they appear remarkably similar to a group of sunbaked asteroids near Jupiter. These puzzling observations... Asteroids that look nothing like their putative parents in the sedate solar hinterlands but strongly resembled their supposed relatives that have been toasted by the Sun... call into question scientists' best theories for the origin and evolution of the solar system..." Then, more recently, you did a brilliant presentation on the discovery that water in Saturn's rings and on its moons is apparently identical to water in Earth's oceans and as you reported, this was actually a confirmation of an outrageous prediction that Velikovsky made which was that Saturn was the source of our planet's water. So here's a quote from a Phys.org report. It says the results "...mean we need to change models of the formation of the solar system because the new results are in conflict with existing models." And finally, speaking of historic space missions to supposedly primordial objects in the solar system, scientists with the Rosetta mission to 67P, recently admitted that the comet cannot be billions of years old. Now in the early published findings on the mission, Rosetta scientists proposed than, like Ultima Thule, the double-lobed nucleus of 67P was formed by a low-speed collision of two objects in the early solar system. But based on the scientists' numerical calculations, it was determined that the nucleus would have crumbled or disintegrated countless eons ago and therefore it is only millions of years old rather than billions. So among the other problems the comet scientists have faced, they have to try to explain the "geological features" we see which includes complexly layered stratified rock which is absolutely everywhere on the comet nucleus. And further, there's the problem of how do you form a comet only millions of years ago rather than billions of years. Well, here's what they came up with. Two fully formed comet nuclei in the late solar system experienced a violent high-velocity collision and exploded. And then, after the comets exploded, as you can see in the computer animation the scientists created, even though the material would have been accelerated to tremendous velocities and in a near zero gravitational sphere of influence, we are told that rather than dispersing, a portion of the destroyed material recoalesced and kept recoalescing and kept recoalescing to form 67P as we see it today. And now I don't think I need to belabor why this particular conjecture is, and this is just my opinion, the closest thing to impossible. But here are two points to consider. Number one: we see two very different hypotheses being offered for the creation of the respective double-lobed forms of Ultima Thule and 67P. Even though they both involve collisions, with Ultima Thule it's a low-speed collision four and a half billion years ago and with 67P it's a violent explosion only millions of years ago and again the process that is actually forming the comet is a recoa- lescing of material that has been destroyed. But in the case of the Electric Universe, as Wal has already explained, we see a consistent coherent explanation for the "doubling effect at all scales throughout the entire cosmos." As you can see on screen, this is quite evident in the comparison of both 67P and Ultima Thule to a portion of hematite that was blasted with an electric arc. So the question I have to ask critics of the Electric Universe theory is, do you care that all of the discoveries I just described were either explicitly predicted by the Electric Universe or are exactly what one does expect if our solar system experienced the kind of recent upheaval the electric universe proposes? So Wal, what are your thoughts? Yes, it's system-wide this problem. It's rather ironic that Velikovsky was more or less a pilloried for suggesting that the solar system had changed within the memory of the earliest human beings. And now, the favored theory for a lot of these unexpected discoveries is that the planets, particularly the gas giants, must have migrated. In other words, their orbits have changed but of course it has to have happened billions of years ago. And that's one of the aspects that's never really addressed psychologically in cosmology, is that the theories appear to have to make us feel safe. In fact, the Australian philosopher David Stove wrote that Newton's theory was designed to make sure that nothing untoward happened in the solar system. This idea of a clockwork solar system that was wound up four-and-a-half billion years ago, and has functioned fairly undisturbed apart from a few showers of objects that are used to explain ad-hoc the fact that we have a moon and there are craters on objects. But all of this happened way in the distant past so we don't have to worry about that. Right. And of course, this continues today. So, there is a kind of almost a religious grip on the gravitational accretion over huge spans of time theory. Velikovsky really threw down a gauntlet which none of them, no astronomer has been willing to pick up. And that was of course the origin, really, of the Electric Universe because scholars could see that there was a case to be answered. And some remarkable people came forward and began picking up that challenge and piecing it together and I was very pleased to actually have joined them a little later in the process, as it turns out, but nevertheless I think it's been effective because the groundwork is very solid. And there's been no ad-hockery required to explain all of these weird discoveries in space. In fact, we've been able to predict a lot of them. 
Good afternoon everyone. Current scientific theories of the atom are hypothesizing that the nucleus is made up of a chaotic blob of protons  and neutrons. There is no known structure for the nucleus. Quantum mechanics states that it is impossible to show a true shape for the nucleus, but instead relies on mathematics to express the atom and its non- deterministic nature. Is it possible that there is a structure to the nucleus of the atom? In this presentation, I will make precisely that attempt and show you how this structure, with its particular rules and mechanics, are responsible for the periodicity and the grouping of the Periodic Table of the Elements. My goal today is to take you from this two-dimensional solar system model of the atom with no structuring whatsoever (as we can see on this side) and I want to take you to a logical threedimensional structure of the atom. The proton-electron model that was adhered to until the acceptance of the neutrons in about 1933 has been taken as a base  for that. Now, before I continue, I would like to draw everybody's attention to the disclaimer of this presentation: “We are all agreed that your theory is crazy. The question which divides us, is whether it's crazy enough to have a chance of being correct.” Niels Bohr. The presentation is made up of the following: 1 - Current understanding of the model. We'll take you through a short history lesson there, and then we will go  into 2. Proposal for the Structured Atom model. The third part will be to touch upon 3. implications  of this model, and [finally] 4. we will state our conclusions. Our journey begins in the early 1800s when John Dalton was doing his research. Dalton used relative atomic weights and published a table of relative atomic weights. So, we have the first rudimentary form of a Periodic Table of the  Elements. For example, Dalton found that 12 g of carbon could react with 16 g of oxygen to form the compound that we now call carbon monoxide. Or with 32 g of oxygen to form carbon dioxide. The ratio of oxygen masses - 32 to 16 – simplifies to 2:1. At some point, it was discovered that certain elements have common properties and that there was a periodicity to the elements. In 1864 John Newland described a law of octaves. He observed periodicity according to the relative atomic weight and identified some new elements such as germanium. His concept however was not recognized by the Society of Chemists until 1887. After becoming a teacher in 1867, Mendeleev wrote a definitive text book of his time, ”Principles of Chemistry” in two volumes, 1868 to 1870. It was written as he was preparing a textbook for his course. This is when he made his most important discovery. As he attempted to classify the elements according to their chemical properties, he noticed patterns that led him to postulate his periodic table. Mendeleev claims to have envisioned the complete arrangement of the elements in a dream, quote, “I saw in a dream a table where all the elements fell into place as required. Awakening, I immediately wrote it down on a piece of  paper. Only in one place did a correction later appear necessary.” I would like to point out here in his periodic table the purple elements like helium, neon, argon krypton etc. which were totally unknown. And here we see for example the germanium. By looking at these empty spots, we were able to pinpoint where the next element should be and that's how we found them. J.J. Thomson performed his cathode ray experiments in 1897. If a gas sample is introduced into the region between two charged plates, which we can see on the bottom here, a current flow can be observed, suggesting that the atoms have been broken down into charged constituents. The source of these charged particles is a heated cathode which causes the atoms of the sample to ionize. These were known as cathode rays at the time. In 1897 Thomson set out to prove the cathode rays produced from the cathode were a stream of negative negatively charged particles called electrons. From Maxwell's theory he knew that charged particles could be deflected in a magnetic field which is shown just about here. So, depending on the polarity, the electrons went up or down. Because of the bending of the path of the emitted electron in the cathode tube experiment, it became clear that it had to be a charged particle, negative in nature because it was pushed by the north south magnetic field that has been put into the electron beam path. Through his work science was introduced to a whole new discovery namely the electron. Through his work the result was a model for the atom that acknowledged electrons and the fact that they can be taken away from the atom, leaving a positively charged atom. The discovery of these subatomic corpuscules overturned the notion that atoms are indivisible. The best description at the time was that it would resemble a plum pudding, where the electrons resemble the distributed plum throughout the pudding which is depicted here. He was honored with the Nobel Prize in physics in 1906. When Chadwick famously discovered the neutron, it caused a debate that was finally more or less settled at the 7th Solvay Conference in Brussels, Belgium in 1933. The only alternative to neutrons was the existence of nuclear electrons which would counteract some of the proton charges of the nucleus. Since by then it was known that the nuclei had about twice the mass than could be accounted for if they were simply assembled from hydrogen nuclei, meaning protons. But how these nuclear electrons could be trapped in the nucleus was still a mystery. This is when and where it was decided, at the Solvay Conference, that a neutron is not a combination of a proton and electron, but rather a fundamental particle without an electrostatic charge, meaning it is neutral. Hence the name neutron. After the acceptance of the neutron, which was very much influenced by the need to make quantum mechanics work, we basically end up with our current understanding, in essence at least, of the atom. An atom has several key attributes that are observed: a positively charged nucleus (the nucleus is depicted here) - the nucleus is made up of positive protons and neutral neutrons - the red and the green if you will, red - green. The electrons do however not fall into the nucleus which is still a little bit of a mystery. And the ratio of the neutrons, protons, and the outer electrons, on average is one on one on one. Note that current nuclear physics explains the nucleus in quantum-mechanical terms. In a nucleus occupying a certain energetic state, each nucleon is set to occupy a range of locations. To refresh everybody's mind, here is what the current Periodic Table of the Elements looks like. We see there is a periodicity, in groupings, in the list of elements. The periodicity goes from the left to the right, and the groupings go from top to bottom. The term ‘element’ is used for atoms with a given number of protons regardless of whether or not they are ionized or chemically bonded. For example hydrogen  in water. In short, the number of protons and the outer electrons determine the element. When all this is taken into account, the current understanding of the atoms and the elements is very poor, to say the least. If this is all that is offered after a century of research and untold amounts of resources having been poured into technological projects based on this, then I would feel disappointed in fact. This is what  drove me to study the atom and the elements. The disappointment of in truth a highly disputable model that asks us to believe certain things in order to make it work, could simply not satisfy my  need to know. Throughout the years, my personal lesson was that the whole basics was wrong. This started for me around 2006 and ever since the model has been slowly growing and maturing. The strong force, which is seen at the first bullet point, is a postulated force. It simply was needed in order to explain how the protons would stick together in the nucleus. So, any good model should be based on observations and logic. Only after that comes the understanding of the whole, or the narrative if you will. The Structured Atom Model has the following key features. It shows  a logical construction of the atom in accordance with observations. It explains why the atom has a positive nucleus with negative electrons around it. It explains why the electrons do not fall into the positive nucleus. It explains in a logical manner how chemistry arises. It explains the periodicity of the Periodic Table of the Elements and, still an open question, why do electrons and protons not annihilate each other? Still unanswered. SAM is a new model. No, yes, take your pick. Let's see. This model is still very much in development and despite some efforts to the question as to why the proton and electron do not annihilate each other is still unanswered, the only thing I would like to add is that the observation would indicate that perhaps the proton and the electron are made up of smaller organizations. The model right now does not rule this out nor deny it. In fact, I think this is a beautiful example of how we can cooperate [coming] from different disciplines to find the answer to this question. For the model itself, it is not essential to have this question answered because it goes beyond the scope of the organization of the nucleus. The observation is still there regardless of the answer to the question. There has to be an organization to the nucleus of the atom. There's simply too many hints and leads that cannot be ignored that point to this to be true. When we try to find an answer to how the nucleus of the atom is organized, we can find no real answers at all. Only that the nucleus is made up of neutrons and protons. How these fit together is officially still a mystery. This presentation will offer evidence that the nucleus is structured, and we'll point out how this is the case, with its  regularities and rules, and what principles are in effect. At about 2008, I found a correlation of the geometry of the spheres; it's called spherical geometry. You'll be surprised how little can be found on that. When we reach the number seven, we reach lithium. It's called a pentagonal bipyramid with a fancy  word, and in 2010 I understood that carbon corresponded with the icosahedron, or rather 12 spheres. In 2012, I found basically an entire structure of the nucleus and how it functions. Ever since I have been a student myself of this model and I can find correlation after correlation. Some of these I hope to share with you here. The model in short comes down to this. We have a duality, which is depicted here on this slide that we call a proton-electron pair that has the electrostatic force acting between them and this force is the causal factor for the principle of the densest packing that creates geometric shapes. These geometric shapes are integrated in a specific order and number, and they create all the elements. During the next slides I will try to show you how that is the case. So, when we go into the structure of the atom model, I would like to point out these postulations/observations that the model is based upon. There's only one fundamental force: the electrostatic force. The atom must have a definitive organization which is responsible for all the attributes of a particular element. The neutron is not a fundamental particle, it's a  composite of a proton- electron, but is redefined as a connection between a nuclear electron and its surrounding protons. A stable element must have a stable nucleus. There can be no movement without any cause in the structure of the nucleus. A sphere, or a proton, must always be part of one of the three identified geometrical structures, namely the tetrahedron, the pentagonal bipyramid or the icosahedron. The depictions will come in a little bit. The inner structure of the atomic nucleus dictates the outer electron structure, or rather the orbitals. So, here we reach the “New” neutron. This is a schematic view of it. In the center we can see how the neutron is redefined. Instead of being a fundamental particle, we have an electron in the center, with two neighboring protons. This is a stable structure. The charge of the electron in the center is divided over the protons. This binds the protons into a rigid connection, if you will. It resembles the nucleus and is a stable configuration. The second electron, to make the whole neutral again, is simply booted out. It's placed in orbit which is about 100,000 times the radius of the nucleus. On the left we can see schematically how the free neutron decay occurs. At the bottom we can see an intimately connected proton and electron, meaning there is no more energy in that system. It does decay however, into the top depiction of basically a hydrogen atom - a proton and electron at a distance. On the bottom right, we can see what happens when we go into a triangular configuration which is depicted by helium-3. There's simply no room for more than one nuclear electron - they're too close to each other. The other two which are depicted in the green here are simply booted out again. But to balance the whole, being three protons and three electrons, above that we see how we end up with a helium-3 with only one nuclear electron taking its resting position in the center of the three protons, or at least it is seeking out that point. So, in classical terms we are left with only one neutron, two protons, and two outer electrons. I would like to point out a paper done by Carl Johnson (actually more than one paper) and it's called ”Statistical Analysis of Isotope Masses.” This analysis of the precise NIST data seems to indicate that there is no energy which exists within any atomic nuclei to account for the existence of any Pi mesons or the necessary binding energy of any neutrons, or of any ultra powerful strong force, or any neutrinos for that matter. This research has resulted in a far simpler and more logical description of atomic nuclei. It also entirely complies with the known laws of science. No unseen strong nuclear force - which allegedly works at an inverse fifth power of distance, except then it also reverses in effect at really short dimensions - is either necessary or represented by any energy source. I would like to invite everybody who is very interested in this topic to try and seek out those papers - quite profound. Here we see the building blocks of the model. From left to right we can identify them. First, we see the Platonic solids. On the bottom we see the spherical geometry. Spherical geometry is not like the so-called hard (?) geometry which uses points and lines in a two-dimensional depiction. Here we can see how the Platonic shapes are actually created by using spheres. In this case the protons, and as Plato already said, the atoms must be made up of geometrical shapes. This picture here was taken last year, sitting at a curb at the Grand Canyon, and I would like to point out this gentleman with the red hat, James Sorensen. Ever since we met, James has been participating in this model by creating software code that led to a threedimensional Atom Builder. We can actually recreate on the computer the several elements. The pictures you see during this presentation are taken from that particular Atom Builder. The model has already proven to be crucial for further  continuation. On the left we see the basic building blocks. The first one would be hydrogen, the second one would be deuterium, the third one would be helium-3, the fourth is helium-4. This one is the so-called pentagonal bipyramid which equates to lithium, the first true element that we have in the periodic table. Even the name implies this, because lith, lithium, meaning stone, stone-like and the last one represents carbon. Here we see some essential tools that we used to develop the model. Nothing fancy, nothing expensive. The magnets that we can see on the bottom here are used as a valuable tool because they mimic the central attraction force that is also there in the atomic nucleus. This beautifully mimics densest packing, or rather the electrostatic force. Treated properly, they will show you the correct structure of the elements. Everybody can do this. Here we see the platonic solids again, created using spheres for the so-called spherical geometry. Take note that the cube and the dodecahedron are not stable. They can easily be distorted, in contrast to the other three. So, the cube is not stable; the tetrahedron is stable; he icosahedron is stable; the dodecahedron is not stable; and the octahedron is stable. The proton geometrical structure cannot exist on its own, nor can an electron structure be on its own. They need each other. They need each other in order to be in equilibrium. Only one on its own cannot be, the other one on its own cannot be, together they can be. They are in equilibrium. All the protons that we have in this model must belong to [one of] three geometrical structures, as I said, the tetrahedron here, the pentagonal bipyramid represented by lithium, and the icosahedron represented by carbon. On the left we have the electron structures which is an octahedron and a dodecahedron. On the bottom here I show how they exactly fit together. The icosahedron is the most complete of the platonic solids, meaning there is no bigger geometrical shape that can fit into a sphere, i.e. there is no bigger geometrical structure. The combination of protons and electrons pull towards their shared common center of that icosahedron. This is the primary argument for the applicability of the densest packing principle. Carbon embodies the icosahedron with its 20 triangular facets. (Let me see if this is right, right). Carbon embodies this icosahedron with its 20 triangular facets. The 20 triangles correspond to the number of electrons necessary to reach the noble gaseous state. With carbon, as is depicted here, not all the triangular facets of the nucleus are occupied, meaning there are positive spots left on the nucleus that can still react. In the green, we can see where an electron would be, and where there is no green yet, like here, or here, there’s still positive charge left. So, on the left we see a carbon with only six inner electrons. On the right we have a carbon with the six inner electrons and the six outer  electrons. However, take note not all the spots are green, meaning there's still chemical reactivity left. This is basically the fundamental principle as to why chemistry is happening. When we take a look at the noble gas configuration, we have the same nucleus, however, there are (like shown on the right) extra protons. These extra protons also imply there are extra electrons, and in the case of neon, we get the first complete nucleus whereby all the spots are occupied. Hence, we reached the noble gaseous state. It's important to notice that this icosahedron of the carbon - which is still depicted here - has 20 triangular surfaces. So we get 10 inner electrons, and 10 outer electrons. Together they will occupy no more positive charge, no more negative charge, no more reactivity and again [we have] the noble gaseous state. The main structure of the atom, or the backbone of the nucleus, is made up of the icosahedron or, as determined in this model, a carbon nuclet, whereby nuclet refers to the identified geometrical shape of the protons. Each geometrical shape or nuclet has a center of attraction that is created and shared by the protons that are part of that nuclet. The geometrical structures are connected to each other by sharing no proton as shown on the first image. Here the main structure of the atom is therefore a collection of the connected carbon nuclets that adhere to a doubling mechanism. We tried to depict this in the rest of the pictures here. We go from one carbon nuclet, to two carbon nuclets, to four carbon nuclets, to eight carbon nuclets. This triangle, as you can see, is everywhere on the nucleus of the atom. This is most important: all the proton structures will always have only triangular surface areas. This is when it is stable. So, this triangular area is where an electron would find its resting spot or at least balance out and try to find that position. Here we see how the periodicity of the periodic table is a result of these geometrical shapes. What we see here highlighted is the carbon group in the periodic table. The carbon belongs there, silicon belongs there, germanium belongs there. When we go  to shapes, we get this picture. On the left we see carbon made up of 12 nucleons or protons. In the  center we see silicon which is 28 in total. However, on the left we see the same recurring carbon nuclet which is where all the reactivity or the chemistry is. On the right we see the green. Every time we see green, it resembles a neutralized spot, meaning that part of the atom or the nucleus does not participate anymore. When we reach germanium, which is made up of 70 nucleons or protons, we can see that basically the whole atom is neutralized. And again the same recurring carbon nuclet. The numbers still add up. So, when we see in this model these numbers here they correspond exactly to the element. Another example is the alkali metal group, lithium, sodium and potassium. When we try and take a look at those shapes, we get the following picture. On the left we see lithium with seven particles in the pentagonal bipyramid. In the center we get sodium - 23 particles. Again, the only active part of the atom is the red part here and to the left the neutralized part. On the right is potassium- 39. The whole atom is neutralized except for that lithium nuclet. A final example would be the noble gases. So, we've taken neon, argon, krypton. When we take a look at the shapes, we get the following picture. Everything is completely green - only neutral endings as I call them - and we see neon with 22 in this case. Neon has 20, 21, 22 as stable isotopes, chosen 22 here. Argon with 38 here, and krypton with 80 here. And this keeps on recurring, this keeps repeating. The cycle of eight. Here we see how the periodicity of the periodic table of the elements is the result of these geometrical shapes. So the valence factor, or rather how many connections we can make with a certain element, we can see that the carbon is usually taught to us as being a plus 4 or a minus 4. The nitrogen being a minus 3, the oxygen minus 2, the fluorine minus 1. We can see the number of green increasing. Meaning  every time a pair is added, that part of the atom is neutralized. And the valence factor is dropping by one. When we continue, we reach neon, completely neutral. Sodium however, is plus 1 represented by the lithium nuclet again, as we saw in the previous example. Magnesium simply has two of those. Aluminum is a little bit more complex, it has a lithium nuclet or geometrical shape and on the right side we see the yellow, which represents a beryllium nuclet, just a little bit heavier than the lithium. After that comes silicon. Silicon again is +4 or -4 and +2. But we see, just as above, the carbon nuclet. And here the active carbon nuclet, on the right side the atom again is neutralized. This keeps repeating and repeating and repeating - the periodicity of the Periodic Table of the Elements. Carbon 14. Most commonly known example I would say, carbon 14 is radioactive for approximately 5,000 years or something to that effect, and actually we see the densest packing at work. In the center is a general depiction found on Wikipedia for example, how an electron is booted out, or in this case over here, we see how a neutron decays into a proton and an electron. They also talk about neutrinos and anti-neutrinos, but we leave them out for the moment. On the right side here, according to the new model, we can see carbon-14. In the center we have the same carbon nuclet that was blue just a moment ago. We have on the top one extra neutron and at the bottom one extra neutron, meaning it's a proton plus an electron to bind them together. When they come close, they decay. Meaning the two are together now and there's only one electron needed, or rather actually there's only room for one electron. So this second electron is booted out, as we can see here. It takes its place in the orbit, therefore we reach the next element. So, you could say in classical terms, that the numbers are six protons, six electrons and eight neutrons becoming seven protons, seven electrons, and seven neutrons. That's the decay. If we talk the new model, we actually  have over here 14 protons with eight inner electrons (the six of the carbon plus the two of the loose neutrons) and the six outer electrons that have always been there and it decays to the bottom to again 14 protons, seven inner electrons and seven outer electrons. This is the so-called beta minus decay. Now, our current research still focuses very much on these structures and we're trying to create a corresponding periodic table of the elements. Not so much that the current one is wrong, but there are some improvements to be made. Half the elements still have to be created in the Atom Builder that was mentioned  before. We're not there yet, it's quite complex because of the number of possibilities that arise due to the doubling  factor. So, we are currently for example looking at the possibility of the existence of elements halfway the periodic table of the elements that have not yet been discovered. I'm not talking about the real heavy elements I'm talking about elements halfway the periodic table, close to iron, close to copper, close to silver, gold etc. Nature  tends to skip these steps not so much because it cannot be done, but because the combination of two to make the fusion happen usually we get a helium nucleus or an alpha particle which combine. An alpha particle consists of four of these protons, but to create that missing element in between, we need a deuterium to act on that. Just on chance-based and the abundancy of certain elements makes it almost impossible. Besides that, we are not even aware that there might be something missing. It is my belief that ultimately these elements will be either discovered or created and I hope, I think, might actually validate this model in the future. We can see here how it basically resembles a tree-like structure and where this doubling effect is coming on. So, this is like a stem, two branches which go into another two branches and another two branches, or rather four. Interesting to note over here there's a collision. The two branches basically touch each other and that happens just about where the stable elements lead and bismuth, which are the most stable last elements in the periodic table, from that point on all the elements are radioactive. I believe that due to that coming together of the branches is where it breaks. The bottom basically breaks up and the atom is split in two. I think we all know what that leads to. This theory is still far from complete - it provides actually opportunities for everybody to participate in this advancement. There are limitations to specific fields of science due to limited understanding of the atom I believe - in general and the elements specifically. The atoms affect just about everything. In fact, I would like to challenge the scientific community to either point out these flaws and provide the next answer, or a clue or an error, or validate a proposed model. This is something I think we should all agree on. All that is presented here today has been done without any professional support and represents a few creative minds working together. I can only imagine what we could achieve as a collective. We see here a screenshot basically of the Atom Builder that has been created. Again, James Sorensen has been most important in this. He has been able to convert the model that I have in this rudimentary form into this Atom Builder and we can see some of that here. Anybody who is interested in this and learning more about this, I would like to invite to the breakout room. We have a beautiful setup and we have lots of examples. We have magnets you can use and create and play with. I would like to summarize the new atomic model as follows. We have a duality that we call a proton-electron pair with the electrostatic force acting between them. This force is the causal mechanism for the principle of densest packing that creates geometrical shapes. These geometrical shapes in a specific order sequence and number create all the elements. The model shows to observe nature and properties of the atom and explains the reason why the nucleus of the atom is positively charged, why the outer electrons stay at range and do not fall into the nucleus and addresses a causal factor for chemistry. In fact, physics and chemistry are kind of separated, exactly where the atom is. In this case the physical model goes straight into chemistry and there are many, many more implications and consequences - too many to mention today. There are some potential implications and I named some here. We have plasma physics, astrophysics, cosmology. I think we can reach a far better understanding of the nuclear structure. Better understanding of chemistry, nuclear fusion and fission. Maybe even smaller nanotechnology. Radiometric dating - which is, to say the least, quite controversial - and transmutations and perhaps, as I mentioned, new elements. To conclude with the thanks. Many people to thank, but a few persons in particular: Susan Schirott, Mark Span, Jean Hafner for your EU support - unwavering I would say. James Sorensen – special. He made the Atom Builder and a website and that will become in the end I hope a tool that we can use for educational purposes. Jan Emming for the text editing and his unwavering support as well. Karen Elkins with graphical representations and feedback. And I would like to conclude there. Unfortunately, I cannot show you an animation, but again I would like to invite you to the breakout room where we have some lovely animations going and I would like to thank you for your attention. [Applause] [Music] 
You've just entered the theater of an alien sky. If the words and images seem strange to you there's a reason for this, our world was once a vastly different place. To experience this won't hurt you and there is nothing to fear. Twin Worlds- -Above and Below Egypt: The god Atum, remembered as the creator and primeval sun In our previous episode we considered the Egyptian stories of creation, an original unity named as the god Atum gave way to a separation, a division into regions above and below, but lacking any concrete referent most translators render the two regions vaguely as heaven and earth or Heaven resting on an ambiguous horizon or twin peaked mountain. A global archetype: "The separation of heaven and earth" Global variations on the ancient theme repeat this remarkable idea and in-numerable interpretations of the theme have been published in both popular and academic media. Under the common interpretation the ancient language itself is left permanently obscure whereas in the most ancient sources highly concrete forms and a spectacular shift in the cosmic environment are consistently emphasized. In this series of Discourses we follow a different line of interpretation, we can act ancient myths and global symbols to extraordinary formations in the sky. The so-called creation has long been misunderstood; creation was a remembered event when visible powers revered as gods, appeared to construct a vast habitation in the Heavens. In the language of the myths an emergence occurred, a differentiation and clarification of form where no form previously existed. The language for the original condition typically emphasizes chaos - not in the usual meaning of that term today but in the sense of dimness, fog or clouds, celestial waters, a pre-dawn glow. No implication of turbulence, no hint of conflict or wars of the gods all of which came later; the first meaning of the word chaos was formless. In the Egyptian stories, the creator Atumn was immersed in the boundless waters of the deep - originally inactive and lacking any distinctive form. Then in the acts of creation he acquired external limbs through the explosive ejection of visible outflow called words of power; the text say the God gave birth to himself through this acquisition of external form. Words of Atum: "I am alone in the night. Icreated my own creation, gave birth to my own beginning." More specifically, as we've noted in our reconstruction of these events, this form was provided by the God's lower limbs, his resting place, his perch - the cosmic pillar. The pillar is in fact a center piece of antique creation stories and it connects us to the archetypal sub-structure, a foundational human experience from which all of the ancient cultures arose. It's here that we encounter the so called separation of Heaven and Earth, the words are all too familiar but nothing close to an explanation or even an accurate use of words has ever appeared in scholarly studies of this theme. We've offered a testable explanation in our historical reconstruction - based on the earliest astronomical traditions. It begins with an ancient gathering of planets close to the Earth. We've called this planetary assembly the Polar Configuration and our claim is that the early cultures recorded its distinctive forms with every tool available to them - long before a language of stable planetary motions was even possible. Given the specificity of our visual reconstruction it can be readily tested against a vast cross-cultural consensus. The cosmic mountain or pillar consistently meant the resting place of a visible power remembered the world over as the Creator, the figure named also as a primeval Sun and identified in the early astronomical traditions as the planet Saturn. But in the prior historic context the monumental cultures knew these powers simply as the ruling Gods. So as we've seen, the Egyptian priests could declare - "The Great God Lives Fixed in the middle of the sky Upon his support." and this central power Atum could announce with perfect consistency - "I am raised aloft on my perch above yonder places of the Abyss". In the original mythic context the Abyss meant the cosmic waters, the primeval ocean of Nu, the very waters penetrated by the cosmic pillar to give Atum both his resting place and his external form. In our reconstruction it is the crescent arms of the pillar God, standing out in a critical phase of the Polar Configuration, that visually divided the great sphere of Saturn into upper and lower regions. By following that surprising conclusion the ancient sources will never disappoint us. And so we find in this archaic symbolism the origins of the Atlas theme; a theme coming down to us in many variations but here too conventional treatments of the subject lack any content and actual experience, that's why the ground we've covered in earlier Discourses is so essential. In the daily revolution of this crescent we see the original form of the cosmic twins. Just as the twins to the left and right signified contrasting positions of the crescent in the daily cycle, so did the symbolism of above and below in the same cycle of an archaic day and night. Archetypal crescent of the Polar Configuration in its "midnight" position, the supreme moment in the archaic "day" Here we discovered the archetypal meaning of the Egyptian words Neter Ta - the divine land, God's land - designated as two lands, more accurately - the twin lands, since as we should expect, this symbolism is inseparable from that of the cosmic twins - we've also discussed. In this case the emphasis is on the revolving crescent positions above and below in the daily cycle. In Egypt the meaning of these opposing crescent positions was localized in the symbolism of Upper and Lower Egypt; the original inspiration lay not in terrestrial context but in sacred cosmography symbolically projected onto geography, the cosmic map of the holy land in the sky was the prototype reflected in sacred temple cities and kingdoms on Earth - always directing our attention back to the twin powers of Heaven. The celestial model was by no means limited to Egypt, all mythic archetypes traced to a unified source; sometimes complex but always leaving an imprint, a signature, a fundamental and lasting contribution to human thought and religious practices the world over. Central star, axial pillar and revolving crescent in the Polar Configuration For the Sumerians and Babylonians the agent of the cosmic separation was the giant Enlil, in a fashion he was really similar to that of the Egyptian Shu, Enlil divided a primeval unity into two regions--one above, one below. The word for that unity was AnKi, a combination of the very words for above and below, An; The Above and Ki; The Below. As in the story of the pillar God Shu the Sumerian priest declared that it was the pillar God Enlil that separated An and Ki. This curious theme is well worth following; how did it happen that in so many creation accounts the world over, a fabulous pillar arises to separate an original unity into upper and lower divisions. Such memories coming down to us from every corner of the ancient world can only reinforce our conclusion that the mythic archetypes originated in an unfamiliar world, virtually no connection whatsoever to the celestial environment we experience today. In all of this a key consideration must be driven home; the ancient star worshippers did not just see a giant sphere in the Heavens above them, they did not just see a Heaven reaching column appearing to hold that sphere aloft; the polar configuration had a central definition including the vertical column's universal link to a revolving crescent. Follow today's common assumptions and the entire idea of such a concrete global theme is preposterous and yet as we explore the ancient context letting words mean what they say, the implications become ever more clear. Always look for the underlying form! 
[Music] Ears ring, windows rattle, the dog hides under the bed. You've heard it before. Thunder from an arc of electric discharge, or from a passing supersonic jet. One doesn't hear jets much anymore, but in the good old days, I used to, when F-100 afterburners lit over the desert. Booms from 20 miles away. When you rub feet on the carpet and touch a doorknob, you get a spark and hear a snap. That's the same thing on a tiny scale. Think about the power it takes to make a boom that travels miles with the energy to rattle windows. If you're really close, in the mountains on some high windswept ridge, lightning is terrifying. Lightning’s  shockwave will blow trees and rocks apart like dynamite. On  rocky peaks, especially granite boulders, you can find the scars. If you know what you're looking for they're easy to spot, but if not, a magnetometer betrays their  signature. Where I live, I find rocks the size of buildings split apart, chunks  the size of houses tossed away. It's quite obvious past lightning was more powerful than we see today. It's the explosive blast - the Arc Blast - a sonic wave that blasts outwards in all directions at the speed of  sound like a wall of heavy air. It does not move the air with it but rolls through it just the way an ocean swell rolls through the ocean. It  compresses and decompresses the air it moves through, instantly raising its temperature and pressure, then dropping it in the next instant. There's another effect in the shock wave, called ionization. It's the inevitable result of higher temperature and pressure, because, to put it in conventional terms, it means more atoms colliding, knocking electrons free. But it's really more than that. A shock wave generates current. The condensate in a cloud is an electric conductor. The dipolar molecule of water aligns with electric fields. Dipoles attract and drops form. Charge  moves when this happens, meaning current. Current in a cloud is called “bound” current. If you don't believe me, question this: why do governments use electricity to modify weather? And how could they unless there is something in the cloud to carry current? Watch this Fox 13 show from Tampa Bay which discusses how Dubai uses electricity to make rain. In other words, a shock wave is a plasma. It may be a weak plasma, like the sonic wave produced by a fighter jet that condenses water vapor, or it may be a sheet of electric current that spits lightning of its own, like the shock wave of a hydrogen bomb. If you are fortunate enough to see a rocket launch or a re-entry, you may witness shockwaves that are sufficiently ionized to glow in the upper atmosphere. For perspective, realize there are no shining ions traveling with the shock wave  bubble. The bubble is moving through the air, ionizing and exciting atoms as it goes, generating a current in the shock wave. Shock waves are electric. The sight of glowing shock waves in the black of space is surreal. It gives you an idea of what the ancients saw in the sky. Meteors also generate shockwaves. The Chelyabinsk event produced a shockwave that injured many people. The  Tunguska blast reportedly knocked people off their feet several miles away. Now imagine a world in chaos, where winds shrieked at supersonic speeds. One need not ascribe to Velikovsky to imagine such a thing, because every mainstream theory of impact and accretion or whatever is in favor today, would  necessitate periods of chaotic atmosphere. Supersonic winds would have happened at times regardless of what science-based creation theory you ascribe to. Any  big meteor impact would do it. Even the creationist’s seven days must have entailed some wind. Besides that, we have planets in our solar system with supersonic winds right now: Jupiter is one. To assume supersonic winds and shockwaves occurred, and should therefore have left their mark on Earth, is perfectly  sound logic in any cosmology. Yet you don't hear shock waves mentioned much by geologists. They make theories and wave their hands about tectonic forces without finding what does the pushing, but they don't say much about sonic shock  waves. They use sonic waves as a tool, and they recognize micro-fractures in quartz, and shock cones in rocks due to meteor impacts, but virtually nothing about the winds that would result, or the effect of the sonic waves. Previous articles have shown that shock waves produced by supersonic winds left tetrahedral-shaped mountains with  flat triangular-faced mountain flanks. The evidence shows that Earth was embroiled at times in a maelstrom of winds that actually shaped the surface of the planet. The primary mechanism for triangles you see so ubiquitously in mountains is a region of the shock wave called the ”separation bubble”. When a  supersonic wind shears across a surface and meets an obstruction, it lifts to ride over the obstruction like a wing, because a high pressure zone forms in front of the obstruction. This high pressure zone is called the separation bubble, because it separates the supersonic flow from the ground, forcing it to change direction. Wind flow in the following diagrams is left to right unless it's shown otherwise. It's called a bubble because in ideal conditions it forms an actual tetrahedron-shaped bubble of high pressure, low-velocity air surrounded by low pressure, high-velocity air. The  bubble wall or "membrane” is made of shearing and reflected shock waves. They are a predictable, inevitable, measurable boundary layer effect caused by the drag of supersonic wind over a surface. If you've read my past articles on  this subject, you'll note I call the separation bubble a low-pressure low- velocity  zone. That was a mistake. So, this is meant to correct the record and give some more detail on them because they are the most tangible, accessible, reproducible, and compelling evidence for Velikovsky's theories in existence. I don't  say that lightly, but it's true. Shock wave tetrahedrons are more abundant than rock art that can be compared to plasma instabilities. Comparisons  of petroglyphs to simulated instabilities are simply shrugged off as pareidolia, anyway. They also don't depend on interpretation of tiny points of light from a zillion miles  away or guessing about the nuclear process inside stars, or atoms. They don't depend on reinterpreting mythology, equations, or the validity of anyone's physics. Shock waves are well known by classical physics and applied science. Shock  wave tetrahedrons cover our planet. In fact, some aspects of plasma instabilities and astronomical “Z-pinch” nebula are due to shock waves. Some petroglyphs depict atmospheric shock waves too. Sonic shock is essential science in the Electric Universe and I'm confident Hannes Alfven would agree. In a plasma, shock waves  and currents are coherent. Shock waves generated during past cosmic upheaval on Earth interacted with solid ground in whatever matter they touched. They echoed from solid surfaces and shear zones. They vibrated and wobbled and crawled across the earth, making piles of debris we call mountains. They interacted in patterns of constructive and destructive interference and resonated in harmonic frequencies. They left those patterns in the mountains for us to see. Shock waves are, after all, plasma sound  waves. They are tangible, falsifiable, and accessible. They can be reproduced. I've been noodling how to make a solid tetrahedron in a wind tunnel. The problem is getting adherence. If dry powders or sands are used, they  won't stick. If wet anything is used it'll make a mess. Nature doesn't care about messes and splatters stuff everywhere. But a wind tunnel is an expensive piece of equipment that doesn't stand well to supersonic sandblasting. Magnetic dust and magnet won't work to adhere a tetrahedron, because the dust would take the shape of the magnet. I can't get an ionized supersonic wind generator without a Chinese electric turbine and so far the Chinese aren't answering my calls. Neither is NASA. Funny, it's the same phone number. I think maybe a big drop of glue or epoxy could be used as the obstruction in a wind tunnel if it were performed while tacky. It should mold to the shock wave separation bubble without flying away. Anyway, it's not an easy problem. But wait,  nature provides proof. We don't need a wind tunnel, the atmosphere itself is our laboratory. Iron meteors enter Earth's atmosphere at supersonic speeds. Friction with the atmosphere melts and ablates the iron. Ablation patterns provide the proof of shock wave tetrahedrons. Look at figure 10 and the several other images to follow which show molded iron shock tetrahedrons at the tips of flow patterns made by separation bubbles. This is tangible proof made in conditions similar to theory. This piece of data is a start to prove science as we know it is mostly wrong. Well, okay, hugely wrong. Massively  wrong. These meteorites should be prima facie evidence of Electric Earth Theory. This is a meteor of iron with an ablated face caused by its supersonic entry into the atmosphere. Heat, pressure, and supersonic shock  waves molded this face. The supersonic wind, impacting the meteor head-on, segregated into bubble-like pressure regimes. Low- pressure zones where wind velocity  was greatest created scoops and divots. High-pressure zones segregated these air flows, leaving sharp dividing ridges and triangular separation bubbles where the airflow separated from the meteor. The smooth divots are impressions of flow streams, and the triangles appear at their tips. The change in direction  as airflow separated from the object, created separation bubbles which molded the fluid iron. Molten iron was pushed from the divot like pudding, and held in the high-pressure separation bubble, molding it to form, in the form of the bubble. Look closely and you'll find where some tips broke off. The entire  divot is, in effect, the separation bubble. It is literally bubbles formed with skin effect from shock waves that hold tension like a bubble’s film. It creates  Y-shaped structures around a ”triple point” where shock waves and bubbles meet, sometimes called the “Lambda Structure.” In the case of mountain building, winds laden with dust passed into the bubble, and were heated, compressed and slowed  to a stop passing through the shock wave. The ground was statically charged and adhered the dust, mud, sand, stuff falling from outer space or whatever the wind carried. Hence the dust piled in the shape of a bubble - a tetrahedron. Take  a look at the similarity in these tetrahedrons formed by a hot  blast of air in South America to the ones along the edge of the meteorites. Really, it can't be more obvious. It's visually apparent how a non-rotating, down-burst wind layered the dust in a consistent pattern of tetrahedrons formed by separation bubbles where the wind impacted and deflected from the land. This was made by a blow-torch aimed at the ground - the hot exhaust of a mesocyclone that churned in a plasma storm of Jovian proportions. The side of the tetrahedron facing the wind will be a perfect isosceles triangle if the wind strikes normal to the object. If the wind hits obliquely, is interfered with by adjacent shockwaves, is sub- sonic, or transient in its velocity or if the dust load deposited doesn't fill the entire separation bubble, it will deform the tetrahedron. You are not suffering from pareidolia. A triangle is a triangle, and that is what you're seeing. We could be scientific and take measurements to prove these are triangles, but I think we can use common sense. Here are more examples of tetrahedrons formed on iron meteorites. The size  of the separation bubble depends on the size of the object because that determines the area of wind moving past the object and  therefore the size of the shock wave. So, the bigger the meteor, the bigger the tetrahedrons. The constituency of the rock also affects the roughness of the surface, whether it's chunky or smooth, as they say. Regardless of many variables, the triangular face of separation bubbles are distinct and appear exactly where they should if one traces the wind patterns Jeez, somebody out there  must have noticed this before. I'll bet there's some obscure, mustachioed PhD at the Upper-Siberian Institute of Aerodynamic Widgets who knows all about this. Please call me. In a completely different circumstance, lightning-generated shockwaves also produce tetrahedrons. The next  four figures are photos of an iron-bearing rock that has been struck by lightning, partly melted and vitrified, with raised triangular layers where fluid metal was trapped by separation bubbles. The lightning left a yellowed, chemically altered trail where it surface- conducted to a shoe-shaped pool where the rock melted. The arc likely met some discontinuity, or crack in the rock where it burrowed in, creating a hot spot. Cutting beneath the skin of the rock created an arc flash that trapped triangular sheets of molten rock in the separation bubbles, pointing outward from the center of the blast, shown in the following images. The final image shows a track of very small triangles marching out of the molten puddle. The amplitude of the triangle is related to the cross-section of the wind that created it. What this little trail of arrowheads means is that a very narrow supersonic jet stream blasted from the lightning bolt and made this channel in the rock, and you can see exactly the path it took. Can you find any other tetrahedrons surrounding the track outlined? They are aimed perpendicular to the narrow track and larger amplitude. I counted six good-sized ones, but  there are a bunch of small ones, too. The arc channeled a narrow, focused jet, while at the same time, shock waves blasted outwards in a diffuse wave that produced larger amplitudes. There is also a second lightning track from the bottom right corner. There are shock patterns that correlate with a blast from each lightning track. For global-scale winds, separation bubbles become quite large. Figure 17 gives you some idea of scale. The separation bubble that creates a mountain is just the very foot of a shock wave structure much more complex than a simple tetrahedron. There are flow paths in, around, and behind the separation bubble that all leave their mark on the ground. If the wind keeps blowing dust at supersonic speed, the tetrahedron formed in the separation bubble blocks the air, forming a new obstruction to the wind, and a new separation bubble forms in front of it, trapping more dust that layers in the triangular shape of its windward face. This blankets the tetrahedron face with layer after layer of deposit with each pulse of the wind. Each pulse of the wind may carry different constituents of dust and charge, so each layer deposited  has its own characteristic chemistry. It is exactly the same way wind makes sand dunes, except supersonic shock waves are rigid and straight and make sharp angles instead of soft curves. Sand dunes are formed in the high pressure low-speed zones beneath an undulating wind, and the troughs are low pressure high- speed zones. The high-speed winds carry the sand to the low-speed zones, and that's why they appear in waves. Static electricity plays a role in sand dunes, too, lofting and adhering the sand, and so it does with shock waves. Each layer's chemistry reacted with adjacent layers. The matter laid down still swam with free charge. Migrations and recombinations focused at the layer interfaces, still hissing and  vibrating with shock wave echoes, where dissimilar matter made reactions, drawing ions from the surroundings. Charge built an electric field across these interfaces in the way a capacitor makes an electric field. Seams  became hardened and mineralized, and sometimes evacuated by gases evolved from reactions that channeled caverns as they expanded. The electric field, transverse to the seam, is why most quartz veins grow transverse across rock seams. They  are the electrical expressions left by shock waves and electric fields. The consensus theory of hydrolyzed silica migrating into rock seams by hydrothermal action isn't entirely wrong, but it misses the role of electricity and how it would accelerate the pace of crystal formation. It also misses the role electricity plays in the migration of conductive metals into quartz veins and a number of other things. Shock waves took different polarities. They generated lightning. They connected ground to cloud in a sheet of plasma current. They ionized air, water vapor, and dust. They melted metals. They vibrated and electrified the ground. They segregated airborne matter with electrostatic filtration. They compressed matter in geometric shapes and charged it with current to fuse it together. They formed plasma networks of active circuitry. They patterned the wind in diamonds that  glowed, with sparks shooting through. They turn biological beings to jelly. Shock  waves are a pathway for discharge, a current generator, and a capacitor across the walls of shock “membranes.” They are a big piece of Earth’s circuitry and a principal action of nature. They are the most obvious, prolific, and easily defined proof that Earth was formed, and still performs as an electrical body. And they are one of the most beautiful. After all they produce these mountains. I want to give special thanks to Stefan Ahmala, who took the photos of the rocks in Finland. Stefan discovered Thunderbolts recently, and like most of us, arrived here because he knew the rest of the world is crazy. Stefan is very enthusiastic, and immediately recognized these rocks  for what they are and contacted us. Wouldn’t you know I was writing an article on tetrahedrons when his photos arrived? Well, that is how things resonate in the Electric Universe, isn't it? We are all the same ether. It is what is. We  can either resonate in harmony, or make destructive interference. That's our free will. [Music] 
You've just entered the theater of an alien sky. If the words and images seem strange to you, there's a reason for this. Our world was once a vastly different place. To experience this won't hurt you, and there is nothing to fear. The Archetypes Reconsidering the origins of world mythology It was perhaps 15 years ago that we first used the phrase of "meeting of myth and science" to describe The Thunderbolts Project. But now, as we're continuing to attract a crowd of newcomers, it seems that a little background could be useful. My original inspiration for this work came from the controversial theorist Immanuel Velikovsky and his 1950 bestseller 'Worlds In Collision.' It was that inspiration that provoked my own lifelong investigation, which is focused on the origins of ancient myths and symbols bringing to light hundreds of mythic archetypes and connecting these patterns to extraordinary planetary events in ancient times. In 1972, my brother Stephen and I had published a special issue of the student journal Pensee titled Immanuel Velikovsky Reconsidered. To our surprise, the issue became a best-seller at local campus bookstores encouraging us to advertise the publication internationally and commit to a full series on Velikovsky. In the course of this series, in 1974, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the AAAS, held a symposium on Velikovsky at its annual meeting in San Francisco. Shortly thereafter, I submitted a proposal to Doubleday, the world's largest publisher at the time, for a book growing out of my own research, the book to be called The Saturn Myth. My proposal included an article I'd written, titled 'Saturn the Polar Night Sun' and I included an outline of a comprehensive interpretation of ancient myths and symbols. Starting with the Velikovskian perspective, the article claimed that in ancient times Earth and Saturn were joined in a unique planetary system unlike anything known today; and it suggested that the vast world of ancient myths and symbols had its direct inspiration in this human experience. To prepare for the task, I had learned French and German enabling me to translate key sources not available in English. I also acquired a ground-floor knowledge of the Egyptian hieroglyphic system without which no satisfactory interpretation of Egyptian mythic and symbolic content would be possible, since my work would challenge virtually all common understanding on this subject. Happily, the communication with Doubleday led the company to offer me the largest advance they had ever given to a previously unknown author. As for the rest of the story, completing the book proved to be an endurance test beyond anything originally anticipated, and yet, when Doubleday published The Saturn Myth in late spring of 1980, I'd really only opened the door to the four decades of study that followed. The Saturn Myth set forth a radical idea. It claimed that every ancient culture memorialized an extraordinary phase of human history called 'the age of the gods.' Though the words could have a familiar ring today, the historic meaning was lost many centuries ago and that meaning is precisely what we've claimed to recover. For many years now, I've used the image seen here as a ground floor referent in an uncompromising analysis of global patterns, and I've claimed that every mythic theme since the emergence of the great civilizations can be explained by what happened to these bodies. To which I've added, just as surely, the observation that no archetype ever named has the slightest connection to any natural experience today. The archetypes closest to the heart of the reconstruction would include: memories of a primeval Sun before the present Sun, remembered also as the father of creation, the ancient celebration of this power as the celestial prototype of kings, the enigmatic location of the primeval Sun at the celestial pole, the center of the sky around which the heavens visually turned, the unexplained identity of this primeval Sun as the planet Saturn in the early astronomies, identity of this supreme god as a fallen or displaced power. In fact, no description of that earlier condition is more to the point than that given by the Babylonian astronomer priest Berosus, in the 3rd century BC. Berosus observed that in an earlier time the planets were, quoting here, "so arranged in one row that a straight line may pass through their spheres." What a remarkable and preposterous idea, a perfect and sustained planetary conjunction, something never seen in our time. And yet a stunningly accurate description of the ancient polar configuration, to which we've devoted priority attention for more than 40 years. In the months ahead, we intend to show that there was indeed a myth-making phase of human history from which the full spectrum of ancient ideas including hundreds of mythic and symbolic archetypes arose, no coincidence involved. Our goal will be to expose the unified substructure to show that one ancient experience recorded through a diversity of mythic interpretations reached across every domain of commemorative activity. There's a reason why we state our conclusions with such confidence. Simply grant the reconstructed events, and all well documented archetypes become predictable. As strange as this may seem, after the myth-making epoch no new archetypes arose, not a single one. Now, that is a critical fact. One that can force an investigator to ask what set the myth-making epoch apart from the era that followed? But now of course the implications should be clear, the archetypes arose in response to extraordinary celestial provocations, and nothing in today's natural world would lead one to expect a single archetype that has been named. For us, no prior cause other than the dynamic and evolving polar configuration will ever meet that test. In retrospect, it's not surprising that, month by month, new information has continually expanded the picture. I say not surprising because every ancient culture on Earth memorialized a prior rule of towering gods. So as the underlying cross-cultural agreement stands out, the radical contrast to today's natural experience becomes progressively more obvious and persuasive, including: the ancient identification of the Mother Goddess as the planet Venus, the corresponding identity of the Venus goddess as the luminous eye, heart and soul of the sovereign power, the hub of the Cosmic Wheel and the animating outflow or radiance itself. Worldwide myths of a legendary Warrior and Hero born from the Mother Goddess to vanquish chaos monsters, global myths and symbols of the ancient conjunction or marriage of the Mother Goddess and Warrior Hero, meaning of course Mars and Venus, and finally the ancient memory that unifies the planetary traditions, the memory so powerfully expressed by Berosus, of planets previously gathered along a single axis. For several decades, I've described a system episodically punctuated by planetary instability and world altering disruptions, all occurring in an environment unlike anything  we experience today. It's that contrast that led me to encourage investigation by others, under the obvious acid tests. For an independent researcher, the tangible and concrete nature of the reconstruction will  leave no ambiguity as to implications. If the claimed events occurred, what would you expect to find? And most critically, does the reconstruction leave any recognized archetypes of world myth  and symbol unexplained?  No other test than  this should be needed. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info In Part 1 of this two-part presentation, Dr. Raymond Gallucci began his independent mathematical analysis of cosmological alternatives to the standard interpretations of cosmic redshift. For many decades, astronomers have believed that cosmological redshift indicates “stretching” of light in an  expanding universe. The higher an object’s redshift, the farther away it is from our perspective on Earth. However, as we've reported exhaustively on this series, an imposing body of scientific research contradicts that perspective. Today, Dr. Gallucci concludes his analysis on the mathematical plausibility of the respective alternative redshift explanations by scientists Halton ARP and C-C Su. Now, let me switch over to the quantization concept and I'll now read from quotations from Halton ARP’s talk given to the Kronia group at the conference in Portland in Oregon 2000. He was talking about his theory on intrinsic redshift. “in the early 1950s, they saw thin connections between galaxies and radio lobes, going from the central galaxy out to the radio lobes on either side. This material is actually being ejected; that's about the only way you could get this configuration. if the galaxy is going to eject something, it's going to eject along the path of least resistance, which is out the poles of the galaxy. You have this nice relationship that, as the quasars proceed out as time goes past, they age and drop, in preferred quantized redshifts. What I, Halton Arp, have interpreted this to mean, is that these quasars move out, evolving to low redshift.” And if you look at the various videos or some of the websites, or even the books that Halton Arp has published, he has some very nice pictures that show galaxies, apparent galaxies with a series of smaller galaxies at various distances from the galaxy, with these quantized redshifts. So, if we look at the regression fits that I had back in slide 10, again there were five regression fits of which three I selected as being possible contenders for calculation for quantization. What I have here, I have the five observed redshift peaks, their time increments. Again, the redshift drops as the time, or the distance, increases. So, you'll see that the time increments go from 5 down to 1, while the Z-peaks go from 0.3 up to 1.96. I then took the three best regression fits; the first was a function of the square root of the mass ratio again, the mass of the quasar or QSO, to the mass of the Sun. The second fit was based on the natural log of the ratio; and the third was based on the ratio to the two-thirds power. And I calculated the mass ratios that would come from these formulas. And their average is shown in the rightmost column. So, those are the QSO mass ratios for the various Z-peaks and the text there reads, “From the three best regression fits, estimate the QSO mass at each of the main five redshift peaks. If there is a quantization phenomenon as the QSO is ejected and travels outward, with redshift decreasing in specific increments (these are increments of time or distance), we expect some relationship between redshift, and therefore mass, of the QSO with time and/or distance. With time or distance increment 1 being associated with the newly ejected QSO (that's shown as time increment 1), it has a redshift of 1.96, a scaled mass, mass ratio of about 2E+9 It's the largest redshift and it's also the largest mass, and increment 5 associated with the oldest QSO; that's shown in the first row, that's the redshift of 0.3, the scaled mass of 1.65E+8, about a factor of 10 lower. So again, Arp's theory is that as the QSOs are ejected, they travel outward from the parent galaxy and their redshifts drop with time, which is the same as with distance, as their mass decreases. Now again, going back to the previous slide, I'm going to do another regression, using the average mass ratio in the rightmost column, at the various time increments 5-4-3-2-1, which are analogous to distance increments. You can see the results there, on the graph we have the mass as it’s scaled to the mass of the Sun, versus time or distance increment. And again, I had five regression fits; the exponential in purple fits the data best, passing through all the quantized values. The natural log in blue as nearly as good; the inverse time shown in green is slightly weaker, but it's still acceptable. If you look at these you'll see that all three of these, the ones highlighted in yellow, stay above zero through the fifth increment. The other two that are still decent fits, hit down to zero around 5, so I didn't work with those any further. The question asked is, do any of these in yellow highlights, suggest the quantization mechanism? Again let's return to Halton Arp’s talk at the Kronia conference group in Portland, and I'll quote from him again. Here he's now talking about particle mass being variable with time, and to quote Halton, “Einstein’s solution in 1922, made an approximation which I, Halton Arp, think was wrong. The particle masses were constant everywhere in the universe - that was the approximation by Einstein. With this approximation, they got the Big Bang solution and they predict expanding coordinates, singularities at time equals zero, and this demands that all the redshifts are velocities of recession. Jack Narlikar and Fred Hoyle did not assume that particle masses were constant in time, and they got a very simple solution that the masses varied with the time squared. That is, as time went on, they communicated with more and more of the universe, and their mass grew. This is a Machian theory: if the electron mass- when it makes its transition in the atom and emits the photon- is small, the photon is weak and it's red shifted. As the electron grows in mass, the photon which is emitted, is stronger and it drops in redshift. So, this is a perfect explanation for what we've been seeing, that younger objects are highly redshifted and the sacred Hubble constant is just the inverse age of our galaxy. Continuing with the Halton Arp’s talk at that conference, if you start in the galaxy nucleus, you get a high density in the center of this active nucleus, this mysterious engine where the stuff is created. The new particles are in that environment and they're gaining mass from their environment very rapidly. When they step out of the nucleus, they go into a different, much lower density, environment into the bulge of the galaxy, and then, if they come out in the plane of the galaxy or along the axis, they drop here into the local group. These are enormous drops in density and finally when they drop out of the local group of galaxies, they take another step down into the local supercluster of galaxies, and out the local supercluster they take yet another step down. These particles will be gaining mass very rapidly and the redshift will be dropping very rapidly and then it finally levels off. And there goes another step in the drop, and there are just about six drops and there are six major quantization levels, and he quotes the values of 1.96, 1.41, 0.96, 0.6, 0.3 and the one that was postulated at a very low 0.061. And the following slide, this is taken again from Halton Arp’s talk at the Kronia group. He presented a series of slides that show these drops in density and I made a composite schematic from his presentation; and there's incremental increases in particle mass and corresponding quantized drops in redshift. If we start from zero, which is at the top, that shows the galactic nucleus and the leftmost axis there shows drops in density, while the left axis, the vertical axis and the y-axis, the x-axis is time/distance as the QSO moves outward. So, we start from zero which is the galactic nucleus, then proceed to the first step, which is the drop to the galactic bulge, which is step 1. Following that, we go to the galactic plane or axial ejection which is shown as step 2. That then proceeds to the local galactic group, which is step 3. Next goes to the galactic super cluster, which is step 4 and finally then there's a step 5, which is postulating, he does not specify what that is, but again, the key here is that Halton Arp sees the stepwise incremental increases in particle mass corresponding to the quantized drops in redshift. So this is his explanation for the quantization of redshift. Now I'd like to talk a little bit about the theory of C-C Su, from whom I use the redshift data. This is from an article taken from the arXiv website in physics in 2006. According to Su is the following. According to the ejection model, quasars are formed from the gas of atoms, plasma and dust ejected from the parent active galaxy. Suppose that the material of the gas cloud together forms a local ether. The gravitational potential on the surface of the quasar is extraordinarily strong. The wide variation in redshift can be ascribed to a variation in density and size of the gas cloud, which can be due to the strength of the initial ejection from the parent galaxy. The speed at which the cloud moves away, to the gas expansion, to the fragmentation of glass clouds, and to star formation. So, he has multiple explanations for the wide variation in redshift. Due to the non-uniformity in particle velocity and density, or to some internal disturbance, the quasar may break into pieces of identical or similar sizes. Suppose the fragments are also spherical and the density remains unchanged. Thereby their radius is shorter than the previous one by a factor of 2^-1/3 power; and the gravitational potential on the surface of either fragment will decrease by a factor of 2^-2/3 power. And after the nth splitting in half, the gravitationally induced intrinsic redshift is given by the formula shown there, 1+zn equals the square root of those terms there. Continuing with gravity induced quantization from C-C Su, what are the terms inside the square root on the previous formula? The 1 plus z0 squared minus 1, denotes 2 times the normalized gravitational potential, corresponding to the 0th redshift, z sub 0. For the cases of very high redshift, this can be approximated as 1 plus Z to the n equal to 1.26 to the minus n times 1 plus Z sub 0. By adopting the preferred redshift value of 1.956 as the 0th redshift once again, this formula leads to the prediction that the preferred intrinsic redshifts are a series starting at z equal to 6.08, and shown there are the series down to 0.06, with n ranging from -4 to +9  by integers. And the ones highlighted in red, are the ones that have been observed. You notice that the 0.06 isn't shown there. But what see C-C Su observes is that a redshift distribution around 0.6 may actually be a merger of two close distributions around 0.71 and 0.49 which are two that he predicts, and that just happens to be the average of the two, 0.6. So, he does get the 6 key redshift peaks from his formula. Low redshift peaks are expected to be smeared, since other affecting factors of uneven splitting, gas expansion and star formation, will accumulate with time. Now, my observation is that unlike Arp’s theory, Su’s does not postulate the series of quantized redshifts represents QSO evolution with time and/or distance, although he does agree that QSOs are formed by injection from a parent galaxy. His quantizations are static for each QSO and dependent upon various initial conditions and interactions until the QSO ”stabilizes” and exhibits one of the characteristic, preferred redshift values. So, whereas Arp believes that QSOs are ejected and they evolve with time, as they move outward from the parent galaxies and the redshifts drop in quantized amounts with variable particle mass, Su’s belief is that they're all ejected at the given redshifts that are already quantized due to other factors. It's not a case of each QSO going through an evolution and a change in its quantization of redshift. Now I’m going to offer some speculation on my part. From Halton Arp’s theories, the QSO quantized redshift values with QSO distance, or time from the parent galaxy, which could be either or both a time or distance phenomenon. QSOs are ejected with high redshift, which seems to correlate well with high mass, therefore high density, provided the “emitting nucleus” remains relatively constant in size. Arp bases the observed quantization on variable particle mass, which increases with time and correspondingly with distance, as the particles evolve and travel outward from higher to lower density regions, in a piecewise, not continuous manner. If you accept Arp’s variable mass postulate, this appears reasonable. For C-C Su, the quantized QSO redshift and mass results from initial conditions and subsequent interactions. Presumably, the spatial distribution around the parent galaxy, whereby the higher redshifted QSOs are closest and the lower one's farthest, is the result of the initial energy of the QSO’s ejection, its initial size and various interactions with surrounding material. The more energetic ones travel outward farther and interact more with material, thereby losing more mass and showing lower redshift with distance. Regarding Su's theory, although he predicts at least some of the quantized values, he does not offer a definitive reason for the quantization as Arp does, which is variable particle mass. Therefore, in my opinion, his theory appears less plausible than Halton Arp’s. Continuing with my speculation, I'm going to offer another possible mathematical observation for quantization that could have a yet to be identified physical basis. My simplest equations that reproduce well the quantized decreasing QSO redshifts as a function of uniformly increasing time or distance intervals, suggest an exponential decay, or roughly a decay as a function of inverse time, or distance. I'll just go back a bit to that earlier slide for familiarity. I'm referring to the slide here where I show the mass, the scaled mass relative to the Sun's mass, as a function of equal time or distance increments. And the one in purple was the one that showed an exponential dependence: e to the minus 0.6. So, what I said is the exponential decay is a fairly common physical phenomenon. For example it's typical of radioactive decay, but the discrete aspect appears to be unique to QSO redshifts. It's not a continuous decay; it is again in a stepwise fashion; at least from what's been observed. An inverse distance dependence, which was also shown on the earlier slide, the inverse distance one is the one in green, where we have distance or time to the -1.2 which is basically inverse time or inverse distance dependence. An inverse distance dependence is characteristic of a magnetic or electric field around an infinitely long string of charges, or current-carrying wire, and this suggests Electric Universe theory, where we have intergalactic Birkeland currents pervading the universe. Galaxies form where these currents flow and could exhibit surrounding magnetic or electric fields with the inverse distance dependence. What is more difficult to ascertain is the quantization aspect. I do make the following mathemetical observation, that the quantization of both QSO mass and redshift can be represented very well by a sine curve with decreasing amplitude of the same decaying exponential form as my previous equation. And that's shown on this next slide here. This is my own speculation; what I've plotted here is the scaled mass which is the scaled mass, or the quantized redshift because they're related, as a function of the time or distance increment. The formula at the bottom M/M0 equals..... The equation on the right is actually an absolute value, and that's shown by the bars, and that indicates absolute value. I have a scaling factor of 2.73E+9, it's a scaling factor which is corresponding to the quantized masses. I have a shift factor for the sinusoidal variation, -0.55 and that enables me to set the peaks at the integer values. Therefore the peaks for each of the sine curves come out at integer values of 1 through 5. You'll notice that the peaks occur at scaled masses of 2.05E+9 etc., for increments 1 through 5, and what I reproduced there is the table earlier, where I showed the average scaled mass ratios as a function of the Z peaks, the redshift peaks and the increments. And the arrows there show how well the sinusoidal curve, the peaks correspond to those values. They all align very well with them. In fact, the comparison with the observed value shows agreement to within ten percent. Now I don't know what phenomenon might exhibit a sinusoidal behavior with exponentially decaying amplitude. Could it be some form of harmonic dependence? I'm only offering this as food for thought. I just thought it was rather..., I know if it's pure coincidence or what, that I was able to come up with a sinusoidal function that matched the Z peaks, or the mass ratios that result from the Z peaks. The Z peaks are shown in red, decreasing trend, the mass ratios are shown in the dotted curves here, and the predicted values as shown, the five here at the tops of the peaks, align very well with the ratios that were derived from the regression analysis using the much earlier data from C-C Su. So, finally in summary, my approach to the topic of quantization of intrinsic QSO redshifts, especially based on the lifetime work of Halton Arp, was purely mathematical - developing a theory for intrinsic quantized QSO redshift is beyond my experience. I postulated a geometric explanation of intrinsic redshift possibly dependent on mass to the two-thirds power, related to possible attenuation of light energy (and therefore frequency) within the emitting nucleus of a QSO, compounded by a further dilution (and therefore energy and frequency) decrease due to spread over the surface area. To do the quantization aspect justice, I summarized two theories by other experts and examined their plausibility within my realm of knowledge. Finally, I offered at least a mathematical representation of the quantization aspect as food for thought. That concludes this presentation.   00:21:05,100 --> 00:00:00,000 [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts. info What do astronomers see  when they gaze at the cosmos? Thanks to incredible technological leaps the universe is now ”visible” to a greater extent and in finer clarity than ever before. However, the detection and measurement of the remotest celestial phenomena is not as straightforward as it might seem. Like all scientific investigations, space exploration is a subjective human endeavor and it stands to reason that the more remote the phenomena, the  more open it is to interpretation. The evidence for the theoretical mechanisms that are thought to cause the largest scale cosmological phenomena, including unfathomable emissions of electromagnetic energy, are gleaned through inference by necessity and what scientists infer is governed by what they believe. The fundamental belief behind more than a century of space science, is that the predominant force in the cosmos is gravity. And even well into the space age, astronomers continued to model a universe in which plasma and both electric and magnetic fields played no significant role. In more recent years, astronomers have acknowledged that magnetic fields exist in space and may even play an organizational role at all scales in the cosmos. However, this revelation of the so-called ”Magnetic Universe” has presented both intractable problems and paradoxically, opportunities for scientists to try to preserve ad hoc the traditional Big Bang gravity-centric cosmology. A demonstration of these efforts can be seen in the recent Quanta Magazine piece titled, The Hidden Magnetic Universe Begins To come Into View. The article describes scientists’ attempt to date cosmic magnetic fields back to the primordial era after the hypothetical Big Bang, an effort which they hope, might resolve the so-called Hubble tension, or the apparent accelerating expansion rate of the universe. The article  states, “Anytime astronomers figure out a new way of looking for magnetic fields in ever more remote regions of the cosmos, inexplicably they find them...The question is: Where did these enormous magnetic fields come from?” Astrophysicist Franco Vazza states the  problem, ”It clearly cannot be related to the activity of single galaxies or single explosions or, I don't know, winds from supernovae. This goes  much beyond that.” Of course, as we've explained many times, the real reason cosmic magnetism is considered so ”inexplicable” is because of most space scientists ongoing, a priori dismissal of electric currents in the cosmos. This posture is described in the Quanta piece as follows, ”...magnetism is the only force apart from gravity, that can shape the large-scale structure of the cosmos, because  only magnetism and gravity can reach out to you across vast  distances. Electricity, by contrast, is local and short-lived, since the positive and negative charge in any region will neutralize overall. But  you can't cancel out magnetic fields; they tend to add up and survive.” And here, we see emphasized institutionalized sciences’ refusal to explore the well-developed concepts of plasma cosmology. For many  decades, astronomers have assumed that plasma is a superconductor, which leads to a further assumption of so-called “frozen-in magnetic fields” in space. However, plasma physicists have known for many decades that when “clouds of plasma” move relative to each other, they generate electric currents in each other, as shown experimentally in plasma laboratories. Electric currents in plasma take the form of twisted filament pairs, and  these follow the direction of the ambient magnetic field. The  filamentary current is electrically insulated from its surroundings. Experimental plasma physics has shown that charged bodies, embedded  in plasma, produce around themselves a double layer, or  what is also known as a Langmuir plasma sheath. This  protective cocoon of plasma contains most of the voltage differ- ence between a charged body and its surrounding plasma. As Nobel prize winner Hannes Alfvén wrote in his 1987 paper, Cosmology  in the Plasma Universe, “Space is filled with a network of currents, which transfer energy and momentum over large or very large  distances. The currents often pinch to filamentary or surface currents. The latter are likely to give space, also interstellar and intergalactic space, a cellular structure.” Of course, both  the vast networks of interstellar and intergalactic filaments, as  well as the lifelike cellular structures seen in celestial objects such as nebulae, are seen in greater detail with each passing year. And  as we outlined in a recent episode, Alfvén also emphasized the extraordinary cosmic significance of the well-known electromagnetic mechanism, called  the Bennett pinch, or the Z-pinch, the process by which stars form, rather than gravitational collapse and accretion. Alfvén's outrageous prediction that stars form like ”beads on a string” along vast networks of filaments, is one of many such predictions confirmed by space discovery. The evidence for cosmic electric currents on an even much vaster scale has grown increasingly undeniable. As we reported last year, in 2019  a team of scientists published their analysis of a vast radio emitting filament of plasma which stretches across 10 million light years, connecting two clusters of galaxies called Abell 399 and Abell 401. The filament which the scientists discovered using a low frequency radio telescope called LOFAR, also marked the first time scientists have found a magnetic field connecting two galactic clusters. The radio emission from the filament is called synchrotron radiation which is produced by the tremendous acceleration of electrons along the filament at relativistic velocities. As stated  by astronomer Matteo Murgia, ”We typically observe this emission mechanism in action in individual galaxies and even in galaxy clusters, but never before has a radio emission been observed connecting two of these systems.” A sciencealert.com report on the discovery states, ”...the electrons are covering way more distance than is expected - which means there has to be another element at play.” In the aforementioned Quanta Magazine piece the description of the radio- emitting magnetic filament inadvertently confirms the electrical interpretation. The article  states that the scientists ”... inferred the presence of a magnetic field in the filament between galaxy clusters Abell 399 and Abell 401 from the way the field redirects high-speed electrons and other charged particles passing through it. As their paths twist in the field, these charged particles release faint synchrotron radiation.” However, the scientists seem not to recognize what this must mean. The release of “faint synchrotron radiation”, means the charged particles are losing energy and thus they cannot continue to radiate over cosmic distances, unless  they are continually receiving electrical energy, which constitutes an electric current. We note that as far back as 1992, Dr. Anthony Peratt of Los Alamos laboratories, himself a student of Hannes Alfvén, discussed the evidence for ”supercluster scale” electric currents in his textbook, Physics of the Plasma Universe. In the chapter titled, “Currents in the Intergalactic Medium” Perratt writes, “One of the most compelling pieces of evidence for the existence of supercluster-sized currents comes from the discovery of faint supercluster-scale radio emissions at 326 MHz between the Coma cluster of galaxies and the Abell 1367 cluster.” In Peratt's view, these intergalactic currents are spiraling Birkeland cur- rents which will accelerate charged particles in circles, which is to say orthogonal to the current's direction, which must then generate synchrotron radiation. Unfortunately, the scientists cited  in the Quanta Magazine piece are exclusively seeking answers in the so-called “primordial universe” after the hypothetical Big Bang. The hope for believers in Big Bang cosmology is that these answers could resolve the problem of the apparent accelerating expansion rate of the universe. The scientists cited in the Quanta article examined computer simulations which attempt to demonstrate the effects of hypothetical primordial magnetic fields if they were present before an epoch called Cosmic Recombination, a hypothetical period a few hundreds of thousands of years after the Big Bang in which charged electrons and protons first became bound to form electrically neutral hydrogen atoms. Their efforts to resolve the so-called Hubble tension are described as follows, “Cosmologists calculate how fast space should be expanding today by observing ancient light emitted during recombination. The light shows a young universe studded with blobs that formed from sound waves sloshing around in  the primordial plasma.” ”If recombination happened earlier than supposed due to the clumping effect of magnetic fields, then sound waves couldn't have propagated as far beforehand, and the result- ing blobs would be smaller...” ”The upshot is that smaller blobs mean a higher inferred cosmic expansion rate - bringing the inferred rate much closer to measurements of how fast supernovas and other astronomical objects actually seem to be flying apart.” The question we began this Space News with, what do scientists actually see when they gaze into the cosmos? is especially pertinent here. Of course, the first assumption the scientists make is that the Big Bang actually happened. As we've discussed since the inception of this series, it was decades ago that  the renowned astronomer Halton Arp showed that faint, highly  redshifted objects like quasars, are intrinsically faint because of their youth and not their distance. Arp and others such as Jeffrey and Margaret Burbidge categorized numerous so-called anomalous objects of very different redshifts in impossibly close association with one another. Redshift is an intrinsic property of distinct galaxies and quasars and is not due to some modification of the light on its journey to Earth. In  other words, cosmic redshift is not a reliable indicator of an object's distance and velocity of movement away from an observer on Earth. This view is compatible with the Electric Universe antidote to the so-called “accelerating expanding universe,” which does not rely on the invention of dark energy. As Thunderbolt's  chief science advisor Wal Thornhill explains in his analysis of type 1a supernovae, ”...the ‘discovery’ of the acceleration of the expanding universe, is an interpretation based on total ignorance of the real nature of stars and the ‘standard candle,’ the supernova type 1a. A supernova type 1a is supposed to be due to a hypothetical series of incredible events involving a white dwarf star. But as I have shown, a supernova is simply an electrical explosion of a star that draws its energy from a galactic circuit....The ‘standard candle’ effect and the light curve is simply due to the circuit parameters of galactic transmission lines which power all stars.” In plasma cosmology in the Electric Universe, the universe is of unknown extent and origin and the electrical nature of both stars and galaxies along networks of Birkeland current filaments does resolve so-called inexplicable cosmic magnetism. It was many decades ago that plasma scientists began reproducing the evolution and form of galaxies through simple experiments with electrical discharge. The aforementioned Anthony Peratt recreated barred spiral galaxies in simulations with interacting twin current filaments as seen on your screen. Unfortunately, long ago the belief in the Big Bang solidified into a quasi-religious dogma and today institutionalized science continues to devote massive resources to promoting and affirming Big Bang cosmology, while ignoring the well-developed and experimentally verified concepts of plasma cosmology whose predictive success only grows with each year. It is ironic that proponents of the Big Bang look to mysterious magnetism to save the untenable hypothesis, since it is magnetism that is the clearest indication of the electrical circuitry pervading the cosmos. Electric currents generate magnetic fields and it is only electric currents that can create the impossibly well-ordered cosmic-scale magnetic fields that astrophysicists detect with increasing regularity, a  phenomenon never predicted by proponents of gravity-centric cosmology. However, we do see some glimmer of hope among scientists studying the local picture in our own solar system who are willing to infer the electric currents required for the magnetic fields in the environment near Earth. The electric current systems near our planet are the subject of the 2018 book, Electric Currents in Geospace and Beyond. The American Geophysical Union's Earth and Space Science News published a summary of the book titled Electric Currents in Outer Space Run the Show. The summary states bluntly “It is now understood that outer space is fundamentally electrical in nature.” On the challenging task of measuring electric currents in space, the authors write, “Since electric currents are comprised of moving charged particles, such as ions and electrons, the most direct way to measure currents is by probing and counting the individual particles. Highly  tuned instruments that fly on board satellites do exactly that.” ”While particle counting is quite challenging, as one might expect, one can also make use of the fact that electric currents generate a magnetic field around them, which in turn can be measured, more easily, by instruments called magnetometers. From these magnetic fields one can then infer using Maxwell's equations the underlying currents.” And yet scientists cannot infer what they are not prepared to look for. As the early 20th century evangelist Oswald Chambers stated, ”Seeing is never believing; we interpret what we see in the light of what we believe.” But no belief is required to recognize the electrical nature of the cosmos, but  rather only a willingness to follow the line of discovery, wherever it may lead.

[Music] [Music] Gravity versus Electricity, in the terms of how a star works. What's great about being here for a conference that's focusing on energy and energy production, the Sun, every star is a perfect example of something that puts out an enormous amount of energy. And so, we can learn from that; we can study how a Sun does it and then maybe there's aspects of that that we can learn from. Since the time of Newton, we have talked about forces as what changes the world. This is a very simple, elegant formulation which has fueled a lot of mechanistic science for hundreds of years. It's a very useful way to look at the world if you're a scientist; forces cause change. It would be a much longer lecture to tell the story of how this chart came to be. Those are the forces that are considered in modern astrophysics: the first, gravity is considered the king; gravity is considered to cause everything else to come about. We then take into account the effect of magnetic fields, nuclear forces, the weak force - why is the electric force then left out? I won't go into the why, but it has been: electric fields, electric currents - not allowed. If you imagine the gravity model. I'll talk us through now the causation, through the gravity model. We imagine space with dust, debris and a lot of emptiness. But gravity is considered to be acting; it pulls together matter. That pulling together, creates great pressure, great temperature and eventually, boom! You get a star – a star is created. Some key aspects of this to highlight. One is the star is all alone in the gravity model. it is separate from the rest of the universe; it's on its own, burning its own fuel. It only came about because of some accident, that there just happened to be enough matter, that just happened to come together. That's it. The star in this model gets all of its energy from itself. Another drawback of this model though, is that it has never been observed, to actually happen in nature, and has never been replicated in the laboratory. Another aspect of the problem here is that it violates the laws of thermodynamics, this model. So those are some pretty big strikes against it. What then would happen if we included the idea of electricity, electric fields, electric currents into the picture? It definitely changes the story. What do you call it when you include electricity? You can call it plasma cosmology. Some people refer to it as an Electric Universe - I don't know what term is better or not. It is important to know that the SAFIRE team were not associated with the Electric Universe group. We're a separate organization, which is fine. They do a lot of really good work; we do a lot of really good work. Let's talk through then what the story would be if we include electricity. What story could we tell about the origin of stars? Again, we have space but now it's no longer empty. There is no such thing as empty space. Matter is permeated by electric fields and electric currents. Plasma is perfect at conducting electricity; it’s the best conductor that we have. It naturally forms into rivers of current. It also naturally supports strong electric fields. These electric fields and currents naturally organize themselves, and the matter that they go through, and there is no violation of any laws of thermodynamics. The matter condensed into a variety of localized structures, some of which we know about in the laboratory, such as plasmoids. Others we are learning about by studying the interstellar medium and the picture is that then stars live along these currents, electric currents. The Stars then receive their energy from the space around them, or better to say, from their relationship with the space around them. We still envision a center core which is made up of variety of elements, depending upon the star, the history of the star, or what the star’s purpose is in the galaxy. In the model that's a positive pole - think of an anode - and that's in an environment that is relatively negative, compared to the positive. As was said yesterday, we often run into discussion problems when people fight over the word ‘positive’ and ‘negative’. Maybe they're not the best choice of words; maybe we don't understand electricity, but we can do some good physics by talking about it this way. So the surrounding medium is the cathode in this model. The star lives, again, inside of a larger electrical structure. The plasma will seek equilibrium: there's that separation between the plus and the minus, that creates a lot of motion, a lot of activity. Things try to come to equilibrium, but they don't; they can't. Just like you and me, living here, you could argue, we're trying to come to equilibrium, but we never do - right until we die and then we're in equilibrium. That striving to come to some equilibrium...the byproduct of that is this immense amount of energy and light that comes from that struggle. To highlight again what I said before. In this model, the star is not creating its own energy; the star is, better to say, transforming energy. And that energy comes about through the star’s relationship to the space around it; its relationship to other stars; its relationship to the galactic medium, is the source of the energy. Planets get their energy from the Sun; the Sun gets its energy from its larger world. We live in a hierarchical universe. There's some blueprint that's being manifested over and over and over, that has to do with energy transformation. How do you transform energy from a star to a planet. Stellar energy is way too intense for a planet; direct stellar energy would fry a planet - it would be gone. So how do you step it down; how do you bring that energy, its solar energy, down to a level that a planet can use. Same is true with you and me: if you put us up into the magnetosphere, we would die. Too intense. How do you step that energy then down to a level that you and I can live in; so we can have things like broccoli and hamburger, and we can eat and we can get on. Help me I'm going off-script. That's fine – you’re doing fine. it's wonderfully entertaining. Yes, it was the broccoli part. Can you take over? Sure. Okay, there you go. This is how it works in the lab. Well I've got a pointer. Thank you, Michael. [Music] [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info In the previous episode, physicist Eugene Bagashov began his four-part presentation on the latest discoveries from NASA's New Horizons mission to the dwarf planet Pluto. The mission is one of many recent opportunities to test the predictions of the standard story of our solar system's history and origins. In this story, called the Nebular Hypothesis, the solar system formed through gravitational collapse in a cloud of gas and dust. Proponents of this theory proposed that water ice was a primary building block for Pluto and its moons. But countless discoveries in recent years have proved highly problematic for the standard theory of our solar system's formation and history. Today, Eugene Bagashov explores the question of Pluto's composition and origins and contrast the predictions of the standard theory versus those of the Electric Universe. Eugene Bagashov: It is interesting that, while describing the Pluto and Charon geological features, the New Horizons' mission scientists have often referred to the "water-ice bedrock." Indeed, it seems they consider the water ice is a primary building block for both of those bodies and probably the smaller satellites, too, which to me seemed quite unusual. As far as I understood, the only reason for such an assumption is the Nebular Hypothesis of planetary formation, plus maybe a few other popular theories, which in their interpretation doesn't allow anything else to be present in those faraway regions of the solar system. It is then supposed that water-ice might be as strong as rock in these harsh conditions and is capable of maintaining form long enough to allow for the existence of these high mountains and deep valleys that we see on Pluto and Charon. Well that might be the case, who knows. But why wouldn't we just suppose that it is just made of regular rock? I'd like to reiterate the thought from previous video that if Pluto was formed in some other conditions, for example being a moon of a giant planet or simply being closer to the Sun or maybe some other star, then it might have different properties and represent something different than what is expected. One of the possible points in favor of big water-ice abundance on Pluto and Charon is their density, which is around 1.8 g/cm³ or roughly twice the water-ice's density. This is two to three times smaller than the density of terrestrial planets and comparable to the density of the other well studied dwarf planet Ceres. It is supposed to mean there's less rock and heavier things like metals and more ice inside. But we know that in our system there are other bodies made of rock that also exhibit quite a low bulk density, comets for example. Philae lander data has shown that it's the internal structure, namely the porosity of the material that makes the Comet 67P so light, not the high ice content. Basically, it's something like pumice, and it completely agrees with the results of previous missions to comets, such as Stardust, that have shown that the comet nuclei exhibit materials that are formed in high temperature conditions. Same thing might be applicable to Pluto. In fact, the surface of Pluto shows only local patches of water-ice spectral signature but the surface of Charon has shown signs of it almost everywhere. I think this ice that we see on Charon might actually be only a thin veneer that was created under the influence of solar wind when its protons have joined with the oxygen atoms taken from the surface rocks, or maybe regolith, as it's supposed in the Electric Comet Hypothesis popular in the EU community. On Pluto such process might be somewhat damped because of the presence of its atmosphere and also other contaminants so to speak, by which I mean nitrogen, CO, CH4 ices and also more complex organic molecules, the so-called tholins. All of those substances might mask the water-ice layer on the surface of Pluto, if there is any. Now that I've mentioned tholins, let's look at what that is. They are the complex hydrocarbons that are supposed to be produced in the atmosphere of Pluto under the influence of solar radiation from more simple molecules, such as methane and nitrogen. Tholins have quite a distinct brownish red color that is readily recognized on the surface of Pluto. Basically all the surface of the planet is slightly red and supposed to bare some tholin layering. But aside of that, we might see a very distinct dark equatorial band which supposedly has a very rich tholin abundance. It might be that the equatorial position makes it easier for those materials to be formed under the more pronounced insolation, and I'd like to mention the very specific contrast of this equatorial band with bright Tombaugh Regio, also situated on the equator. As I've mentioned in the previous part of this review, such a prominent anomaly probably should have a very special origins. What also caught my eye, concerning this equatorial band and the map of Pluto in general, is its striking similarity with the map of Saturn's moon Titan. It is interesting that not only does this body have the similar nitrogen atmosphere but it also exhibits the rich tholin abundance and other hydrocarbons right in this dark band. Maybe there're organic molecules on Pluto and Titan and, who knows, maybe even Earth shares similar origins. We also have a nitrogen atmosphere of all of other things. And from the Electric Universe perspective, it is important to notice that scientists, who were trying to recreate Titan like tholins in the laboratory, have actually succeeded in this endeavor by using electric discharges. Could it be that the atmosphere of Pluto as well as Titan is filled with electrical activity today, giving rise to those substances? Or maybe it is a sign of such an activity in the past? Let us look again at the encounter hemispheres of Pluto and Charon. Those are available in fairly good resolution and allow us to see a significant amount of very sharp valleys or rills, especially in the left side of Pluto image and almost throughout the whole visible part of Charon. In fact, earlier images of Charon's other side have shown that these channels almost encircle the whole body. Of course, we know this line of reasoning. When people see dendritic channel figures on Mars for example, they might say that they were created by flowing water, though the current atmosphere cannot support it. Maybe the atmosphere was a bit thicker before, and so water could exist in large amounts in liquid state etc etc. But what did they say when they see dendritic channels on Pluto and Charon? What are the reasonable alternatives for electric excavation and deposition we have here? It seems that, at this point, the only plausible explanation that New Horizons Team have come up with is plate tectonics. So, as far as I understand, it is thought that those valleys might represent some sort of cracks in the outer shells of those bodies. I'm not a specialist in EDM so I probably cannot comment on this much. But I just hope that one day we're going to get images of those regions with better resolution and that would start a discussion on their possible electric origin.

Welcome to the Electricity of Life, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info In part 1 of this presentation, Dr. Jerry Tennant introduced us to his extraordinary research into the complex electrical circuitry of the human body. Since his own remarkable battle with debilitating illness, Dr. Tennant has worked to develop a kind of map of this circuitry, illuminating its essential connection to physical well-being. In the previous episode, Dr.Tennant discussed the particular significance of the circuitry connecting teeth to other regions of the body. The concept of illness arising from electrical imbalances is, of course, unconventional in modern Western medicine. However, the application of electromagnetic therapies in healing is not new. In this conclusion, we asked Dr. Tennant to begin by discussing some of the earliest examples of the use of electromagnetism as a physical remedy. Well, interesting question. If you go back in time, in the 1800's and early 1900's, electromagnetic therapies of a variety of forms were commonplace. But that changed in about 1910 when Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller decided to become the major investors in the pharmaceutical industry. And so they had a report written called the 'Flexner Report' which they then took to Congress. At that time there were, I think, 13 homeopathic medical schools in this country and again, most physicians were using some sort of electromagnetic therapies. Well, the Flexner Report got Congress to forbid the use of any federal money for anyone who said there was energy in the body, so that that closed the thirteen homeopathic medical schools and then, any physician who was using an electronic device to treat patients got put in jail. Well, that set up pretty much of a chilling effect and that's how our country stopped looking at energy in the body and that was the case until Nixon went to China, saw some of the people in his entourage undergo surgery with acupuncture and came back and told the NIH he wanted acupuncture to be part of traditional medicine. But even though that was what the NIH was instructed to do, the people who control medicine in this country basically continued to ignore it. So, for example, many states including my state of Texas forbids the use of anything that's not standard of care medicine. So what is standard of care medicine? Well, a group of physicians and insurance people and so forth sat around a table and said okay, if you make this diagnosis you must treat it this way. And originally they said, these are going to be suggestions in order to improve the quality of care. But of course, that wasn't the plan. The plan was to make those the law and so it has de facto become that so if you go to a physician and the physician says you have this diagnosis and this diagnosis code then the physician must treat you according to those guidelines. If he doesn't, he loses his license and he's considered guilty of malpractice de facto. So even if a physician knows that that's not going to harm you, there's nothing to do about it. Even if the physician knows there's a better way to treat you there's nothing to do about it. Even if 10 universities and medical schools have proven there's a better treatment, the physicians can't use that until that committee says that it's become standard of care. Most people don't know that but what that does then is, it puts the control of how medical care is delivered in this country in the hands of the small group of people who make up the rules of standard of care and those are all slanted toward pharmaceutical surgical medicine, you see. So that's why people like me have to say well, everything that I say is using my Arizona MDH license and not my Texas license. Because I'm not allowed in the state of Texas to tell you what I'm telling you, I have to use my Arizona license to do so. You know, medicine in this country is the most controlled, most supervised, most controlled business if you please, of anything in the country. No other industry is more controlled than the practice of medicine. The effort to push it into things that work is constantly being suppressed even to the place of physicians losing their livelihood in order to prevent that. Now, even though medical schools, most medical schools now have a division of Integrative Medicine where they teach this, it puts the physician in a very difficult position because the physician comes out of medical school knowing that that's a useful thing to do but the state medical boards won't allow it. It's a very difficult thing so what I have to do is, I practice as a private expressive association. So the Supreme Court has had 72 different opinions given that says that legislators make laws to protect the public but the people in a private group like a church group, a sports group and so forth are not the public. And that any private group may do anything they want to do as long as what they do is not a clear and present danger that rises to the level of a substantive evil. You may not have ever wondered why don't the police arrest boxers because it's against the law to go around slugging each other? Well, it's because boxing clubs are private expressive associations as defined by the US Supreme Court and so even though boxing is a clear and present danger, it does not rise to the level of a substantive evil and so they don't get arrested. However, if religious people sexually assault their parishioners, that does rise to the level of a substantive evil, and therefore the police can go and arrest a priest, a rabbi or whatever for sexual abuse, you see. So for example that's the way I practice. I don't practice, my practice isn't open to the public in the sense that if you want to come see me you must join my private expressive association to become a member of my group and then I can tell you what's in the medical literature rather than have to treat you with the standard care. If the health of living cells is governed by voltage then an obvious concern in modern society is the rapidly growing pervasiveness of wireless technologies. We asked Dr. Tennant to identify some of the greatest obstacles we should be aware of today. Well, there's no doubt that we have all sorts of things that affect us. You know, for example, if I had you hold your arm straight out and check the push down on it, you would be strong, and then if I had you take a wristwatch with a battery in it and hold it right up against your chest and I pushed on your arm, you would go weak. So again, when we put electromagnetic energy within our personal magnetic field, it weakens us, our particular frequencies weaken us. And so we're being bombarded with that sort of thing all the time. Here's the bottom line of the whole thing. We are constantly wearing ourselves out, so you get new cells in the macula of your eye every 48 hours, the lining of your guts replaced every three days, the skin you're sitting in today is six weeks old, your liver is eight weeks old, and your nervous system eight months old, so as cells wear out you have to make new ones. Or if the cells get damaged some way, you have to make new ones so chronic disease only occurs when you lose the ability to make new cells that work. Let me say that one more time, chronic disease only occurs when you lose the ability to make new cells that work, which leads one to the question of, well, what's it take to make new cells that work? Well, first of all, where cells run at minus 25 millivolts of energy it takes minus 50 millivolts to make a new cell, so you have to have the voltage, then you have to have all the parts it takes to make a cell. You know, if tornado blows your house down, you can't build a house back with door knobs and bathroom tiles. You have to have everything it takes to make a house and that's one of the big mistakes people make when they say, I'm trying to get well, and you say well, take this stuff! They come back later and you say well, are you still taking all this stuff? No, I just wanted to know what thing, what one thing works so I've just been taking one thing at a time. Well nothing works, you see what I'm saying, again, that concept of I want to know what works, won't work because you have to have everything it takes to make a cell and that's the nutrition piece of course. So we have to have 50 millivolts of energy, we have to have all the parts it takes to make a cell, and we have to get rid of any toxins that damage cells as fast as you make them. So if you don't do all three of those things, you won't get well. One then goes in and looks at each of those so for example, the voltage piece; we're able to measure the voltages in the circuits using something similar to Nakatani et al. methodology, but one of the important things to understand is that it's well known in battery technology that if you take a rechargeable battery and you drain it all the way to zero, it'll flip itself upside down, it flips the polarity. So if you take a battery upside down put it in a battery charger, it won't take a charge of course. So what we do is we go through and we can measure the polarity of every circuit in your body and figure out which ones are upside-down and those are the ones where you're going to be sick. Because you don't have juice and they are low circuits that are trying to borrow voltage from the next-door neighbors. But I like to say, the neighbors will give you a cup of sugar now and then but they won't give you three meals a day. There are two kinds of energy in the universe that I'm aware of, electromagnetic and then scalar, and of course scalar has the ability to reverse the polarity back to normal. So we have a device that will do that, called a bio transducer, and we simply can put it on one of the acupuncture spots in the body and all your batteries get turned back up. Of course, they're still discharged. Then we take the bio modulator which puts out a specific waveform and recharge your batteries back up. Now your battery has power again and then the body never forgets how to repair itself, just that it has to have the power to do it, has to have the materials to do it. So no matter what's wrong with you, again, you asked me about neurology, nephrology, cardiology, any of the -ologies. You treat them all the same way, because they're all sick for the same reason, they lost the ability to make new cells that work and/or they lost the power to run. You can't have a heart that works if it's trying to run on five millivolts instead of 25 millivolts, right? You can't have a macula in your eye that works. All macular degeneration is because you've lost power in the stomach circuit which is the power, the stomach circuit, acupuncture circuit, is the power supply to the macula. So anytime somebody has macular degeneration and you measure it, you always find there's inadequate power and it's reversed the polarity in the stomach circuit whereas glaucoma, the optic nerves are on a different circuit, it's on the liver circuit and so every time you see a glaucoma patient and measure it, the liver circuit will have flipped its polarity. So how do you treat it, you flip the polarity back, charge the battery back up and then you figure out why did the battery lose its charge in the first place. Well, there are five basic reasons. One is that you have to look at the thyroid hormone, because thyroid controls the voltage of every cell membrane in the body, T3 controls the voltage of the cell membranes and the number of mitochondria, T2 controls the function of the mitochondria. So you always, let's say you don't have a thyroid hormon, your battery discharges to here. Now, if you put a scar across one of your circuits and it touches the fascia, it shorts it out like any other electronic short, so wherever you have scars, that's gonna short out that circuit. So many women have a C-section scar which goes right across the stomach circuit. The spleen stomach circuit is the entire reproductive system, the entire endocrine system, the thinking part of the brain, the macula of the eye. OK, so thyroid takes us down to here, scars take us down to here. Dental infections; since every circuit goes through specific teeth if you have an infection in a tooth that acts like a resistor and drops the voltage. All right, dental infections takes you down to here. Emotions are stored in the body's magnetic fields as I discussed in my lecture to the Electric Universe and all of us have emotions, but if you have a wire and you put a magnetic field around, it blocks the full voltage, that's how emotions drop our voltage and make us sick. Thyroid, scars, dental infections, emotions, and finally toxins and now your batteries drain to zero and flip upside down and there you go, you're sick. One of the problems with American medicine is that the scientists say, we have to isolate everything else and look at just this one thing to see if it's the cause of the disease. It almost never is. Almost all diseases are multifactorial. That's why we're having such a hard time in American medicine, finding the cause because it's almost always several causes that flip the voltage. Then, when you don't have voltage, as voltage drops, oxygen drops because the amount of oxygen that will dissolve in a liquid is dictated by the voltage of the liquid. When you lose voltage, you lose oxygen. When you lose oxygen, your metabolism becomes inefficient, infections show up, and when you get to plus 30 millivolts you have cancer, as simple as that. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info Of all the planets in the inner solar system, the planet Mars may pose the most tantalizing mysteries. In the early 1970s when the Mariner 9 spacecraft captured the most detailed images of the planet to that time, scientists' ideas about Mars have needed constant revision. A planet that was thought to be long geologically dead was engulfed in massive dust storms and its surface revealed dramatic and unexpected scarring which remains mysterious to this day. For decades, the chief principals of The Thunderbolts Project have proposed that extraordinary events shaped the Martian surface. Events which they contend were recorded in the myths and legends of ancient man. In part one of this two-part presentation, physicist Eugene Bagashov reopens the Martian mysteries. In the following material, I'd like to discuss some of the papers about Mars that has been released in recent years in order to see if their results might be reinterpreted in the light of the electric universe paradigm. So the first paper that I want to mention discusses the peculiar structure in the Martian equatorial region, called the Medusae Fossae Formation or MFF. The purpose of the paper essentially is to report on the density measurements of this structure. To measure it, the team of researchers utilizes the altimetry data from Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter experiment, or MOLA, on board of the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft and also some of the most recent models of the Martian gravitational field used by NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The results that they get in the end are pretty interesting. In particular, they report that the density of MFF region should be quite low, only about 1,700 kilograms per cubic meter. It is possible, they state, that such an unusually low density is the result of mixing of the rock with large amounts of ice, more than 1/2 in volume. However, the problem with that assumption is that the previous radar scanning of the area, performed by MARSIS experiment on board of the European Mars Express orbiter, rules out any significant concentration of ice in the area. And it would also be hard to expect much ice in the equatorial region which on average receives the most heating from the Sun. So the conclusion that the authors arrived at is that the low density of Medusae Fossae Formation should be the consequence of it being made of a highly porous rock. When compared to some of the minerals on Earth, it seems that the porosity of rock in MFF might range from about 18 to about 51 percent and it is not entirely clear how such a peculiar formation might have appeared in the first place. The authors suggest that "the MFF was deposited by pyroclastic eruptions." But at the same time they are baffled by its huge extent and total mass, noting that it is two orders of magnitude greater than the largest pyroclastic deposits on earth which would make it the largest in the whole solar system. I should add here that this area doesn't seem to have any indications of volcanic activity even in the past in the first place. It's quite removed from the hypothetical volcanically active Tharsis region and even the hypothetical volcano Olympus Mons. But of course, in the Electric Universe not only volcanism might affect the geological processes but also the external electromagnetic influences. So perhaps the very appearance of the MFF and its low density and high porosity is somehow related to the possible planetary wide catastrophes in the Martian past. For now, let's remember that thought and take a look at some other recent papers. In particular, let's examine the paper released in February of 2019 in the journal Science. Here the authors report the results of quite a clever application of Curiosity rover telemetry data to measure the surface gravity in the Gale Crater where the rover is situated. Curiosity is equipped with accelerometers and gyroscopes that are normally used for navigation and attitude determination but the researchers have been able to use the data from these instruments for the extraction of the gravitational acceleration. More than 700 data samples were used, corrected for the possible interference from planetary rotation, altitude and pressure and such. What they got in the end was the gravitational gradient, that is the change of acceleration with height, that was smaller than expected and they've been able to infer from that data the most probable density of rock that Curiosity was traveling on top of. Now the most interesting part is that the density of this rock was almost exactly the same as the one reported for the MFF in previous paper, namely 1,680 kilograms per cubic meter. And in the very same way they conclude that the reason for such a low density should be very high porosity of the rock in Gale Crater, most likely around 40%. Even more so, they hypothesized that the initial porosity might have been higher at the time of the formation of Gale Crater and could have been as high as 55 to 70 percent. Now here I wish to mention that the Gale Crater is supposed to be an impact feature but what if it has a different origin? Electric Universe paradigm brings into light the possibility that such formations might occur during extremely powerful plasma discharges to the surfaces of planets during hypothetical cataclysmic events such as extreme solar flares and CMEs and/or close planetary encounters. So in my opinion, it might be the case that both Medusae Fossae formation and Gale Crater appeared on the surface of Mars because of some sort of electric erosion processes. The fact that the density of rock in both of these formations is almost exactly the same, indicates on possible similarity of their origin. Yet the MFF is thought to be a result of some volcanic activity where the stuff essentially emerges from down below and Gale Crater is thought to be the result of an impact event where the stuff should have fallen down from above and it should be evident that the result wouldn't look the same. Plus we have the 5.5 kilometer tall Mount Sharp sitting right in the center of Gale Crater, the origins of which are still the subject of debate. Both the MFF and Gale Crater are located near the equator which is quite peculiar as this seems to be a special area on most occasions and might be significant in any type of plasma discharging events. In this regard, I keep thinking of similar equatorial anomalies on other bodies such as the Earth's equatorial plasma fountain, Jupiter's equatorial ionic ribbon, dark equatorial regions on Titan and Pluto, Iapetus’ equatorial ridge and others. On Mars, this area is doubly interesting as it separates the low and flat northern hemisphere from the high and bumpy southern. And here I should mention the other paper that has been released in July of 2018. Here the authors compared data from various spacecraft and Rovers to study the chemistry of Martian dust with respect to the chemistry of the underlying soil. What they found was that the elemental composition of Martian dust is somewhat different from the composition of the soil, at least on average. In particular, the dust seems to have a significantly higher content of chlorine and sulfur and not only that but their relative ratio on the dust all over the planet is also relatively constant. In terms of molar content, the ratio of sulfur to chlorine seems to be around 3.7 globally. What's more important is that the researchers identified an area on Mars where the soil itself has the same sulfur and chlorine content and that area is--Medusa Fossae Formation. So their conclusion is that it is the erosion of this formation that has filled the Martian atmosphere with most of its dust and eventually covered most of the planet with it. Given what I've noted above on the potential importance of equatorial area during any kind of plasma discharging, in my opinion it is not impossible that this erosion might have occurred electrically. I should note here that Valles Marineris structure is also located in the equatorial region right to the east of Medusae Fossae Formation. Although I also have a suspicion that the erosion of Medusae Fossae formation might continue to this day in the form of much weaker discharge but so far I have no evidence to present in support of this idea. I believe, now it's a good time to remember another item from the electric universe pool of ideas, namely the statement that asteroids and comets might be the fragments of planets torn away by electrical activity during catastrophic events in the past of the solar system. It has been known for some time that pieces of Mars might even land on Earth. At the moment, there are at least 227 meteorites identified as originating from Mars. It is supposed that these rocks received their initial velocity from another impactor that lands on Mars and throws them into interplanetary space, but what if the process of initial removal of the material is electric? In fact, some of the asteroids themselves in the solar system have recently been identified as originating from Mars, well in line with the scenarios proposed by the EU catastrophism. There is even strong evidence in favor of the hypothesis that Martian moons Phobos and Deimos originate from Mars itself. Remembering the discussion above about the low density of Gale Crater and Medusae Fossae rocks, I cannot miss the opportunity to speak about the densities of small bodies in the solar system. It is generally assumed that the average density of asteroids should be about 2,000 kilograms per cubic meter which is noticeably lower than the density of both Earth's and Mars’ crust and closer to the density of MFF and Gale Crater. The density of comets however, is even couple of times lower than that, about 800 kilograms per cubic meter. What is interesting however, is that the Rosetta mission with its brave Philae lander have been able to determine that the dust-to-ice ratio in the comet 67P nucleus, is much higher than was expected and the low density is the consequence of very high porosity. This, kind of, reminds of something else, right? My hypothesis with regards to that would be that perhaps comets are the result of more violent types of discharges so that the rock starts to partly boil or being transformed in some other way and becomes more porous in the end. And such more energetic events would also result in a more irregular orbits with higher semi-major axis distance, whereas asteroids might be the result of milder type of discharges and therefore don't demonstrate such a high deviation from the planetary crust in terms of density and also don't move in such eccentric orbits as comets do. So, taking into account the considerations given above, I would suggest to any experimenters trying to reproduce geological formations in the plasma lab to pay more attention to the density of the acquired structures and formations. Perhaps it might be possible to reproduce some of the more porous formations such as rock of the Medusae Fossae formation, or even the more highly porous cometary rock. At the same time, I think that the results of the ongoing sample return missions from asteroids such as Hayabusa2 and OSIRIS-REX, would show more evidence that the asteroidal rock bears a striking resemblance to the typical planetary crust composition. 
an electronic circuit on the other end usually incorporates some device that is enables the circuit to amplify that is to say a very small change in one variable over here creates a very large change in a variable over there and one of the typical things that we add to an electric circuit in order to make it into an electronic circuit is a transistor I maintain the surface of the Sun exhibits the properties of a transistor is it a transistor no of course not but this presentation of mine that I'd like to show you this morning it came to me when I saw an analogy at least I think I saw an analogy between two things and I firmly believe that important discoveries breakthroughs in science are made by somebody who can look at an area over here and an area over there and recognize recognize similarities between those two disparate areas of science and if you can recognize a similarity between a problem that's been solved over here and one that hasn't been solved will be there maybe you can use those techniques over here and get some progress I hope I know that for example Hannes Alfven did that he was a Swedish engineer and they were having all sorts of problems on the on the high voltage DC transmission lines in Sweden and this is an example of one of those disasters one pole to switch over here one pole of the switch over there the switch is wide open but the current says I ain't stopping and so you got this arc and it's a sort of self-sustaining arc eventually it'll blow itself out and when it does it will probably create an explosion which in many instances killed people blew up buildings and was a major disaster Alf Ian was able to find out what the cause was the cause was energy stored in the magnetic field around the transmission line and one when the circuit refused to to open that inductive sort of like a a water hammer in a hydraulic system there was an explosion and the disaster occurred Althea said well that kind of arcing there is sort of similar to the prominence arcing and that we see on the Sun and when that prominence expands like that arc and breaks we have a mission of stuff which is called a CME a coronal mass ejection as long as it's up there by the Sun we don't worry about it too much if it happens in Sweden near Eric village we do so but nevertheless the the response of the the causes of this it was Alfie Enfield the same cause magnetic field energy that caused the the problems with the transmission line well I'm trying to convince you that an analogy exists between our Sun which is our local star which we all know pretty much looks like this if you look at it through a backyard telescope you see that that's the photosphere occasionally you see some some sunspots if you've got a good enough telescope you can see some structure around the usually around the limbs but you can't see anything else and so you conclude well that's the surface of the Sun well it's not the surface of the Sun because there are other things above that layer and this is what we typically see in photos here it gives us all the light and the electromagnetic radiation we receive but it's not the top surface the Sun surface really has three main layers and there they are this is a sketch you can see the curved surface of the Sun is the yellow the earth is in here to scale by the way it shows how small the earth is in comparison to the Sun there's the photosphere that's that layer that we that surface that we see and by the way and I'm not going to continually bug you with this but at every step along the line of my talk here there should be a question in the back of your mind how does the standard model explain that and I'm not gonna continually poke at them but I think you should keep that in mind the standard model I'll say it once that I will do it again has no explanation for why the chromosphere exists the chromosphere is this set of spicules or spikes and stick up we can see them during a total eclipse of the Sun and of course above that is the vast corona that we all know about this photosphere has sun spots the chromosphere has spicules and the corona has these the shape has caps and striations and filaments if we look at the photosphere close up to a really good telescope we see that it has a granularity to it the astronomers call those granules well my hero Ralf jürgens took a look at that and he said that to me looks like a plasma plasma cells and so he then investigated what a real plasma discharge looks like in the laboratory and what the structure of it was he concluded that these cells were really what we'll talk about is anode Tufts it's a tough thing that's seen in the laboratory if you have a good enough microscope and you can look at the anode very closely if you look closely at this picture you'll see that between the the anode Tufts between the granules there's our black channels that permeate and run and separate the Tufts and within those channels can you see the tiny little white dots I don't know if they if you can see it or not those are the spicules so the question arises well what are wire why is that stuff there what is what are the spicules do do they how do they contribute to the action the Tufts come and go over periods of like a min minutes hours perhaps a day but more than that these toughs they are plasma and they are in the arc mode you know there's three modes of plasma arc glow and dark current this is the powerful arc mode and that's why all of the heat and light could radiator from this area the temperature though is about 6,000 Kelvin which is it's pretty hot I wouldn't want to be there but it's as far as temperatures of plasma is concerned and certainly temperatures of the Sun's corona are concerned it's very cool there's the plasma discharge that out that Jurgens looked at in the in the day so in the beginning of the 20th century even in it back in the 19th century people were very concerned about the the cathode and what was the structure of the charge layers and and voltages and forces at the cathode they did they paid relatively little attention to the anode the the Tufts are represented by this anode globe which we see notice that the thing is this structure this plasma cell the anode blow is separated by a small distance from the anode itself in the electric star the ectric sky excuse me the electric Sun model the anode itself is the body of the Sun here are the the Tufts and then right connected to and emanating at a further distance from the Sun itself is this positive column the positive column is another cell of plasma it's in the glow mode and has certain properties that we'll discuss but the typical sunspot there is a typical sunspot you can see the the Tufts around here in the penumbra of the Sun sunspot the Tufts look elongated and in the middle of the the Umbra the dark part of the sunspot there are no Tufts so bear that in mind a sunspot is a place where there are no tufts there is no tufting so what well we'll see the chromosphere is that a bunch of spicules here's an example it looks like a prominence beginning here that's about 2000 3000 5000 kilometers high the Sun of course is like eight hundred thousand kilometers across so it's a relatively thin zone the chromosphere it's generally h-alpha if you have that's H alpha is a spectral line right in the middle of the visual it's a in the red red the deep red color there's the spicule is about that that high it's usually full of entry you can see the streaks it's not just a uniform glowing as fingers and there's a reason for that and it's well known plasma a property of global plasma that they usually filament seen only during eclipses again I ask the question why is it there it changes shape depending on the weather it's a time of active Sun or or quiet Sun this is what it looks like during the quiet Sun this is what it looks like during the active Sun the active Sun is a time when there are a lot of sunspots the quiet Sun there are much fewer sunspots you can see here one thing not really germane to what I'm saying but you can see the magnetic fields that are are also filamentous what you're not looking at the magnetic fields by the way astronomers say that all the time that's not true magnetic fields are invisible what you see like here is plasma which is surrounding currents in in that follow the magnetic field so it's the magnetic fields they're a current follows the magnetic field and lights up the plasma so we can see it here's the big one of the biggest problems facing modernist solar astronomy and that's this Sun temperature profile this the if the Sun is a just a furnace that burns hydrogen it turns it into helium much like a wood furnace turns wood and carbon and oxygen you know as you get farther away from that furnace you should get less radiation you should so the temperature should go down and as you begin to go away right here that's exactly what does happen but all of a sudden there's an anomaly and the farther you get away from this stove the hotter it gets temperature goes up until finally when you get out here at the top of the spicules the temperature shoots up to like a million Kelvin now that is not how how can you get a high temperature like that I would I was here when the the temperature of the photosphere is only about six or seven thousand Kelvin good question and I will endeavour to say why 
Central to this series has been the argument that cosmology is presently at a crisis point and headed towards an inevitable paradigm shift, or revolution. And secondly, that the Electric Universe model has an important role to play in the cosmology of the future. The term ‘paradigm shift’ underlines  much of the series. It was made popular through Thomas Kuhn’s seminal work  “The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.” Since the publication of this book in 1962, there has been much misunderstanding and/or misrepresentation of its overall thesis. Let's revisit Kuhn's work and clarify its meaning and give some examples of why cosmology is still in crisis in 2023. It is important to note that Kuhn did not set out to write the book that he eventually ended up with. He originally set out to write a book about the history of science, and discovered something unexpected about how science is done along the way. In the process of exploring the history of scientific change, Kuhn discovered that predominant or institutionalized science operates much differently than how we've been led to believe it does. The larger and deeper thesis of ”Structure” is that predominant science ultimately does not do science the way it claims to-meaning that it is not absolutely  empirical. Through historical study of science, Kuhn discovered that once a paradigm becomes deeply entrenched and institutionalized, it often becomes dogmatic, hegemonic, and unyielding to falsification and change. Almost by accident, Kuhn's work became an interrogation of science in and of itself, and it paints an unflattering but arguably more realistic picture of science than the idealized or utopian image of science as presented by for instance, one of Kuhn's biggest critics, Karl Popper. Popper was an Austrian-born philosopher with a doctorate in psychology.“ For Popper quote "...the ‘core scientific ethic’ was falsifiability-meaning that all knowledge, at all times, should be exposed to constant and deliberate criticism.” End quote. This is what distinguishes science from non-science, according to Popper. Kuhn would wholeheartedly agree with Popper. Falsifiability should be the core scientific ethic or principle. The problem is, that in reality, or in practice,  it is not. And this is what Kuhn's work reveals. Another critic of Kuhn’s was Austrian-born philosopher of science Paul Feyerabend. Feyerabend is most known for his book ”Against Method”, wherein he argues that there are no universally valid methodological rules for scientific inquiry, and instead  champions theoretical pluralism. Both Feyerabend and Popper accuse Kuhn of glorifying normal science and hiding behind it. Kuhn argued that science does not progress gradually, organically, but is actually forced to change due to crisis and model breakdown. This happens through a paradigm shift process with distinct stages. Normal science is the stage where a field or discipline has a scientifically based model of understanding that works, and can properly guide  the field. Because Kuhn uses the word ‘crisis’ to describe later stages, Feyerabend and Popper accused Kuhn of wanting science to always stay at the stage of normal science and therefore of resisting paradigm criticism and change. This is a blatant misreading and misrepresentation of Kuhn. Kuhn did not insist that science should not progress beyond the non-problematic stage of normal science. On the contrary, he revealed and lamented that scientists tend to insist that they are doing normal science, meaning that their model and paradigm has no holes or problems, long  after the model has started to drift and fail. His book “Structure” problematizes the fact that in practice, predominant science attempts to force a model to stay at the normal stage-meaning ’business as usual’, despite mounting anomalies and contradictions that the model cannot adequately address. This is  especially true in the field of cosmology. As the esteemed philosopher of science Ian hacking points out in his introductory essay to the 2012 edition of Kuhn's book, Big Bang cosmology is quote “...full of outstanding problems pursued as normal science.” End quote. This is the crux of the problem and this is why Kuhn's work is indispensable for any critical analysis of the present state of  cosmology. For Kuhn, after ‘normal science’ the predominant model of understanding starts to drift due to the accumulation of anomalies and phenomena that the model cannot explain. This is the ‘model drift’ stage. At this stage, rather than address the problems directly and re-examine their premises and assumptions, Kuhn found that scientists working within a predominant model, focus on patching the model up and attempting to manage the problem. This process of perpetual patchwork actually creates more problems and more contradictions, and eventually leads to crisis and model  breakdown. This is where standard cosmology presently finds itself - at the stage of ’model crisis’ and ‘model breakdown’. Contemporary cosmology is still in deep crisis and the awareness of this crisis is increasing every day. Mainstream cosmologists even openly use the word ’crisis’ to describe their present reality. And mainstream media is full of headlines that suggest that cosmology is in  deep trouble. As physicist and science writer Eric Lerner points out, in 2019 there were 130 media references to the crisis in cosmology, which marks an exponential increase from the mid- 2000s where there were only 12 references a year. We first explored the crisis in 2021 and it has only gotten worse since then. In 2023, there have already been numerous expert panels and symposiums that discussed the growing crisis in cosmology and astrophysics. The crisis in cosmology centers around new information, measurements, and/or findings that undermine or contradict the major principles, assumptions and/or expectations of the Big Bang Theory in some way. These include, new information or measurements that suggest that the universe is not expanding as we thought or at all, known as the Hubble tension; that the universe is older or younger than the standard model claims; and that the universe is more or less homogenous than we  thought. There are also numerous foundational predictions of the Big Bang Theory that have been contradicted by abundant observations, including various observations and accurate predictions made by Electric Universe proponents such as the late Wal Thornhill. The most recent problems have been sparked by even more contradictory measurements and observations that are coming back every day from the James Webb Space Telescope. In a recent video Michio Kaku states that “The James Webb Telescope is upsetting the apple cart. All of a sudden, we realize that we may have to rewrite all of the textbooks about the beginning of the universe.” Kaku: “Well that's the problem, the James Webb Space Telescope is upsetting the apple cart. All of a sudden, we realize that we may have to rewrite all the textbooks about the beginning of the universe. Now, it takes many billions of years to create a galaxy, like the Milky Way galaxy with a hundred billion stars, many billions of years old. But the James Webb Telescope has identified six galaxies that exist half a billion years after the Big Bang that are up to 10 times bigger than the Milky Way galaxy. That shouldn't happen. There should not be primordial galaxies that are bigger than the Milky Way galaxy that are only half a billion years old. Something is wrong. We may have to revise our theory of the creation of the universe.” In another recent video, Science Time 24 magazine reports that the James Webb Telescope has discovered six ancient galaxies that shatter our understanding of the universe. Beyond these individual contradictions or discrepancies, the larger and deeper crisis has to do with Standard Cosmology's underlying narrative and its very approach to cosmology in the first place. As theoretical physicists Sabine Hossenfelder aptly pointed out at a recent symposium entitled: ‘What is wrong with current physics’, a good scientific explanation should quote “...be as simple as possible and you shouldn't add any unnecessary assumptions, no matter how much you need them to justify your hypothesis.”  End quote. It's interesting to note that simplicity is actually one of Thomas Kuhn's main criteria for model revolution and paradigm change. Hossenfelder maintains that the stories and assumptions of current physics are all quote “...creation myths written in the  language of mathematics.” End quote. She concludes that while we don't know if Big Bang creationists are wrong, we also cannot say that they are right, because quote “...they just add this unnecessary structure at a time where we don't have any data.” End quote. At the same symposium, Eric Lerner argued that the Big Bang is a theory that quote ”...requires imaginary entities that are made up after the fact.” End quote. He explains that without imaginary concepts and entities like inflation, dark matter, and dark energy, the theory basically collapses. These concepts were introduced to quote ”...prevent or overcome severe conflicts with observation.” End quote. For instance, as Lerner explains, without dark energy under the Big Bang, the universe would be younger than the Milky Way galaxy. And without dark matter, the universe wouldn't form any clusters or galaxies at all. He maintains that quote “...you can't say that you want a pure Big Bang without all this fairy dust.” End quote. Lerner concludes that we should look to alternative theories that rely on verified laboratory evidence and points to his own work on plasma phenomena as an  example. In a very recent Symposium entitled ’Beyond the Darkness, Dark Matter, a Baseless Hypothesis?’ scientist and professor John Joe McFadden points out quote “...decades of searching have so far revealed exactly zero dark matter particles, and now some cosmologists are starting to look for alternative models of the universe that don't posit dark matter.” End quote. For Eric Lerner, the real crisis in cosmology is that the Big Bang never happened a sentiment that is echoed by Electric Universe proponents. Whatever alternative one chooses to explore, it is becoming increasingly apparent that current cosmology and astrophysics are in deep trouble, or to use Kuhns language, are presently at the ‘crisis stage’. At the crisis stage, scientists continue to attempt to patch up the model, but also go beyond this, inventing convoluted ad hoc revisions in an effort to deflect or mask the mounting contradictions and inconsistencies. Now, with respect to the current crisis in standard cosmology, scientists are doing this and so much more. Many working within the Standard Model actually double down and triple down on the model's contradictions and inconsistencies, and have even gone as far as to celebrate them and characterize them as exciting opportunities for future research. One example is a claim made in a PBS space-time video entitled ‘The New Crisis in Cosmology’. In this video, the host argues that, while contradictory measurements on how fast the universe is expanding, or the Hubble tension, are getting worse, this is actually exciting because the growing contradiction and crisis opens up new avenues for research. One can imagine that if and when the James Webb Telescope brings back even more contradictory measurements and observation-let's say that the Big Bang happened much, much earlier than they originally thought-that Big Bang scientists will again move the goal posts, giving them enough patchwork to keep  them busy and in business for generations to come. This die-hard reluctance to question a failing model flies in the face of falsifiability which, as we recall, is the underlying ethic of science according to Karl Popper. The fact that science shuns falsifiability, which is supposed to be its fundamental principle when it is most urgently needed, begs the question why? Either science is not what Popper claims it to be, or there's something else at play, or both. When viewed from a socio-cultural perspective, one begins to see power and hegemony at play and this is what Kuhn’s work strongly implies. What begins to emerge at the crisis stage, is the idea that institutionalized and entrenched scientific models, and those working within them, tend to become more concerned with not relinquishing power and self-preservation than empirical observation and problem solving, or the pursuit of truth and new knowledge. The main takeaway from Kuhn's work and from the present state of cosmology, is that entrenched, or institutionalized science does not do, or is not willing  to do, what it claims to do-test the theories and hypotheses empirically and change course when needed. If that is the case then can we still call it science? Popper and others were infuriated by such findings and implications, not least because it tarnished the idealized and noble image of science that had been espoused up until the publication of Kuhn's book. It is worth restating that Kuhn also held science to a higher standard, and he hoped for it to conduct itself empirically. Kuhn did not set out to tarnish the image of science. He was a trained physicist after all. But as any truly empirical scientist can attest to, scientists often end up with unexpected results once they enter the lab and conduct their experiments and analyses. In the case of Kuhn, his lab was history itself, and as a true empiricist, he was not willing to deny or skew his findings, no matter how unpleasant or inconvenient they may be to the status quo. And he suffered tremendously for his integrity. Since the publication of his groundbreaking book Kuhn has been attacked, both personally and professionally, for shining an unflattering light on the true nature of institutionalized science. For his opponents, one of Kuhn's biggest crimes was making conclusions in what they perceive as predictions about how science operates based on history. In other  words, they condemned him for being historical. We should point out that historicism is defined as quote “...an approach to explaining the existence of phenomena, especially social and cultural practices (including ideas and beliefs), by studying their history, that is by studying the process by which they came about.” End quote. Now it seems strange, if not duplicitous, to condemn the author of a book on the history of science for using history in his analysis. This criticism of Kuhn is in fact an Orwellian act that condemns historicism for philosophical reasons that date all the way back to philosophical disagreements from antiquity, when Kuhn is merely using history as a method. And it begs the question, why not just refute or attempt to disprove Kuhn's findings? But rather than refute Kuhn's findings, his critics condemn him for arriving at them in the first place. In what appears to be an obvious case of ‘shoot the messenger’. For instance, in his critique of Kuhn, American social philosopher and hardcore proponent of transhumanism, Steve Fuller, accuses him of presenting an image of predominant or institutionalized science and science education that resembles a quote “mini- Vatican”, a “Royal Dynasty”, and even “the Mafia”, end quote. For opponents like Fuller, Kuhn is guilty of presenting a predominant paradigm as quote “...an irrefutable theory that becomes the basis for an irreversible policy” end  quote. It is interesting to note that Kuhn's detractors never attempt to disprove this particular view of dominant science. They simply complain and condemn Kuhn for having the nerve to come to such a conclusion in the first place and for using historical analysis to get there. While Fuller and others may be outraged by Kuhn's depiction of institutional science, evidence of his findings is not hard to find, especially in cosmology. For instance, for an example of the circular and self-preserving nature of predominant science, one need only look at an article in Discover magazine entitled “Could the Big Bang be Wrong?”, author Corey S. Powell states that quote ”...we have a lot to learn about our place in nature's grand scheme. But we can be quite confident that, wherever future theories and discoveries take us, the Big Bang will be part of the picture.” End quote. Given Powell's statement, we can assume that the answer to the article's title ”Could the Big Bang be Wrong?” is a resounding no. The article more or less implies that there  can be no advancement from the Big Bang to any alternative theory, since the Big Bang is the best one to ever exist. Now, if this is not an example of an irrefutable theory that becomes the basis for an irreversible policy, then I don't  know what is. Given the current state of institutionalized science and the current crisis in Standard Cosmology, I think it is fair to say that Kuhn's findings still  hold and are presently more valid than ever. Sorry Popper and Company, but if it looks, sounds  and acts like a duck, then Kuhn must be right. Kuhn's work is a paradigm shift in  and of itself in so far as it radically changed the way we view and understand  science. This is why it angered, and continues to anger, so many mainstream scientists and philosophers. Its larger thesis is a commentary on how science is done and how we as humans carry it out. Essentially, Kuhn's work reveals that, at the institutional level, science often ceases to be empirical and becomes unyielding, preventing its own progress. Kuhn’s paradigm shift cycle is presently unfolding right before our eyes. The current crisis in cosmology proves this and has vindicated Kuhn from beyond the grave. Mainstream cosmology even uses the word ‘crisis’ which is one of Kuhn’s definitive stages to describe its present reality. At the same time, Standard Cosmology has been unwilling to address the crisis in any meaningful way and is not open to new ideas or falsification. These are telltale signs of the unyielding dogmatic and self-preserving nature of institutionalized science. For this reason, Kuhn's work is even more relevant today and is indispensable for understanding the true nature of predominant science, and the present state of cosmology in particular. One cannot ignore the similarities between Thornhill and Kuhn. Both of these great thinkers were unwaveringly empirical in their search for truth, and both dared to report their findings with honesty and integrity, no matter how controversial it made them. In light of Wal’s passing, it is more important than ever to highlight the implications of Kuhn's work and what it reveals about the true nature of predominant science, and allows us to appreciate just how important, and how courageous, Wal’s work and legacy are.

When I concocted this title I kind of realized that what makes the world go round but what's the world? What I really meant is the Earth. And that's something that we don't often think about, the driving force that makes the Earth rotate and in fact all of this came from the book that David mentioned, The Fourth Phase of Water. I think some of you have heard the presentations on the fourth phase of water. We all know three phases of water, we know solid, liquid and vapor. The book presented evidence that there's actually a fourth phase of water and there are few properties of that phase that actually gave rise to what I want to talk about today. Let me just begin by mentioning some of those properties. The first one is that when water, and you can see the water, I think there is a, let's see.. So this is water that you see here and next to the water is some kind of hydrophilic surface and what we found is that when water meets the hydrophilic surface it builds this huge zone, this is not one or two molecular layers, but up to millions of molecular layers of water that actually changes its properties amazingly. And we call this, because the properties are so different, we call it the fourth phase of water. And one of the features that it has is that it's got negative charge and the region beyond that has positive charge. We call it the fourth phase and sometimes we call that the exclusion zone because we found that this zone excludes practically everything from it, just like ice. It moves out into the region of ordinary bulk water. So because this region is negatively charged and this region is positively charged you can actually put on electrode in here and electrode in here and extract current from it. So that's one of the interesting features of this. Another interesting feature is where the energy comes from, to build this zone of water and to separate the charge. It comes from light. This was rather a surprise to us but we found that if you expose the water to light, what happens is this exclusion zone, EZ, exclusion zone, fourth phase of water builds and the charges separate so we found it really interesting that light, sunlight for example, is the energy that drives the buildup of this phase of water. Now, when you think about it, this has led to a lot of thinking about the consequences of this. And what are the consequences that I'm going to be talking about is the rotation of the earth. I know it's impossible to think of any linkage between what I showed you a moment ago and the Earth's rotation but I bet that a lot of people here don't really think about what makes the earth turn. Maybe you do, I'm not sure. Most of my colleagues don't think about, oh you know, it just turns it spins, right, it started spinning from day one and it just keeps spinning. But when you think about it, you know, most things that spinned runned down. There are energy losses and it just doesn't keep going forever and when we think of the Eartth, you know, something may have set it spinning five billion years ago or something. You can imagine something spinning for maybe a few times or a few years or even a few hundred years but a thousand years, a million years, a billion years.. Can it really keep going on that initial energy? Is inertia enough to keep it going? So we started thinking about that, or I started thinking about that and so where I wanna get to toward the end of this talk, and I'll give you a punch line, is that I'm going to suggest to you that the wind, blowing over the earth, is actually what's responsible, at least hypothetically as speculation, for keeping the earth rotating. In that of course the question arises, well okay so I'm suggesting that the wind is responsible but what gives rise to the wind? That's another topic that I had bet not too many people have thought about and I'm going to be suggesting to you that the wind actually comes from charge gradients, lateral gradients of charge- particularly positive charge in the atmosphere. So that's where I'm going. And the way I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna answer a series of questions and the list is here. First of all when we think of charges, charges can exert force, repulsions and attractions and I think most of us, maybe with the exception of the people here in this audience, don't really think of charges as having really powerful forces. We think you know, we touch something, we get a shock and ok but we don't think of really strong forces so the first question is well ok well, how strong are charged forces if you got a plus and a plus near one another. Is it weak, is it strong? Next question. Where on earth do charges, where on the earth do charges hang out? OK and I want to talk about the earth itself and the atmosphere and the charges that we find there and the next question which you could have surmised is, are there really gradients of charge that we can identify and and then, can charge gradients really drive the prevailing winds and if so, can the prevailing winds spins the earth? OK so first question, how powerful are charged forces? Well one of the phenomena that got me started is something shown by our previous speaker Don Scott in one of his books and and that is, if you put a proton next to an electron, let's say at a distance d between them, there are actually 2 forces that you can think of. The first one is the obvious one which is the attraction- the electrostatic force but also, since the two have mass, there's a gravitational force and the question is ok, which one is stronger and by how much. I'm sure most of you will of course guess that the electrostatic force is larger than the gravitational force but by how much? So that's a question and the answer turns out to be, ten to the 38th. It's not trivial it's a huge amount but I think most of us don't really understand what ten to the 38 really means. We can understand 10 times or a hundred times or a million times but ten to the 38th.. Ten to the 38th is something like this schematic shown here. If you take a proton on the upper left and consider that diameter of the proton, okay, and then consider another distance if you look at, next to the last panel there, you see the solar system and if you take the distance from the Sun to the edge of the solar system, take the ratio of that distance to the diameter of a proton, that's only a mere ten to the nineteenth. We need ten to the 38th! So you know, we're talking about the ratio of the size of a proton to the distance between, between us and some distant galaxy. That's ten to the 38th. To give you some idea about how strong the forces are, the electrostatic forces compared to gravitational forces. OK here's another example, you take two copper balls sitting on top of one another and you start removing electrons from each one of them. That of course leaves the two copper balls positively charged. And so the question is well, how many electrons do you need to remove so that the top 1 levitates? OK and I dunno maybe you know the answer to that, it turns out the answer is, one in 10 to the seventh. In other words only one in ten million approximately, electrons need to be removed so that this ball, because of repulsion, starts levitating. A really small force. Another example. You take a light bulb, take one of the old fashioned hundred twenty watt light bulbs and you know the current goes through the filament, right, and if you could suppose you could capture electrons and capture, let's say, one seconds worth of electrons running through that filament. And suppose you could take that and compress it into just like a sort of a nucleus of positive charges, you compress it into a dot and you put one one of those dots down at the bottom resting on the ground and the other one one metre higher. And so question is, in order to prevent the levitation to keep it where it is, how much weight would you have to put on that? Anybody want to take a guess? Lots. OK, thank you! The answer is 50,000 fully-loaded garbage trucks! I would have shown jumbo jets, 20 actually, there are 5,000 fully loaded seven forty sevens but my son, the artist, couldn't draw them. OK and here is finally not to belabor the point but it's an important point, consider this. Suppose you, you're lying down and somebody is lying suspended let's say 1 meter above you okay, and you remove one percent of her electrons, she's got a lot of electrons and protons, you remove one percent of her electrons and 1% of the electrons of the person below, they're one metre apart and of course both of them become positively charged so instead of coming together which they might like they're actually coming apart and the same question, how much weight would you need to put on top of the upper person in order to prevent the levitation? A guess, lots! OK how much is lots? Right, the Earth. The weight of the Earth. And this is not my calculation, you'll see it in Feynman's lectures. He calculated it, I guess he knows how to calculate. So, in other words the point of these somewhat repetitious slides is that charge forces can be astonishing and if we don't take into account the force exerted by those charges we're missing something and probably we're missing something really important. OK so one question is well okay, so charged forces can be astonishing but to do that you need to separate, you need to have separated charges and the question is, can substances really bear net charge? OK and the answer I'm gonna say is yes, although chemist will generally say that no, they can't bear net charge because everything tends toward neutrality but here's an experiment from last week. Here's an electrolyzer and some of you may know this electrolyzer, it produces so-called health promoting water. If you drink, it separates the water into negatively charged and positively charged, but they don't tell you it's negatively or positively charged. It's high pH or low pH and if you would have drink a low pH water you'd spit it out because it's awful, kills bacteria. But if you drink the high pH water, pH 10.5, 11.5, something like that, it tastes delicious and there is a lot of evidence that it actually is, is good for your health. And you find in Japan for example, this kind of water is, if you have any kind of gastrointestinal problem you go into a clinic and I am told by my colleague in Japan that first thing they do is they put you on this alkaline water and the government pays for it. So it's got something. Anyway this has nothing to do with the health benefits of this water but you can take the water and you can as you see on the left side, you can fill a couple of beakers with it and what we did is, we took a simple voltmeter and we put one probe in the high pH and one probe in the low pH and voila! Half a volt between those and a half of volt sustained easily for an hour. That's as far as we we went. So yes, you can have sustained charge in vessels of something. This is water. Here's another example. This one is kind of cool if you if you've seen it, this is.. well you start start with some beaker of water sitting on the top and so here is the.. so you start with the water and then what happens is that the water goes in, divides into two columns and the water drips into both, it passes through this ring and it passes through this ring, by the way this is called the Kelvin water dropper experiment done by Lord Kelvin, okay. And the drips go through these and these collect in this container and these collect in this container and what happens is that, well you know, they they drop into there and after a while the charge seems to build up in some way and and then you get a zap you get a discharge between those two electrodes. It's audible, you can see it, it's really astonishing and if you look, I mean, and even before the zap, if you stop the flow, these two containers will sustain charges and one's got negative and one's got positive and these charges can be amazing if you look at the drops falling into the beaker after a lot of water has got, not enough to discharge but quite a bit and it looks like this. So at the bottom is the cup and you can see these traces, these traces are actually falling droplets of water, they should fall into the cup but the cup has so much charge and the following droplet is the same charge that they get repelled, you can see these traces going upward. So it means that the charge forces can easily defy gravity. So we're talking about really strong forces. Now the point is, substances can bear charge and charge forces can be huge. So I've answered the first question- how powerful are charged forces and the answer is much more than most of us think, extreme! Next question is ok, where on the earth do charges hang out? And it's known, it's well known that there is an electric field. I remember when I was told that there is, and I come from a different field I don't know what most of you people have known since childhood and a Russian colleague of mine who was working in my laboratory one day just happens to ask me if I knew anything about the earth's electric field and I said, what are you talking about, you mean magnetic field? No, electric field and he said, you don't know about it? And it was kind of amazing, he said he grew up in Russia, of contemporary age and he said, every middle school student knew about the electric field of the earth and and and the negative charge on the face of the earth and I guess in this country we we don't learn that or at least these we didn't learn that. But anyway it's well known, in the text books, especially the text books from fifty to hundred years ago, the electric field is about a hundred volts pro meter at the surface of the earth and there must be therefore some negative charge on the earth and positive charge somewhere up there. So essentially the point is that the earth somehow bears negative charge and again back to the health issue, some of you may know that it's now advocated by people in alternative health or any kind of health to just walk barefoot on the beach. If you walk barefoot on the beach you're basically soaking up the electric charge, negative electric charge from the earth and you need that charge, the body needs negative electric charge to thrive. That's a different issue, I don't wanna go into it. So it's called earthing or grounding, depending on where you come from and in, in Japan and some of the other Asian countries mud baths are pretty common and mud baths are said to have healing properties and and I think the the reason for this has to do with connecting to the negative earth. OK, so question is now where does this negative charge come from? The standard interpretation, again if you read Feynman's lectures, volume 2 chapter 9, lightning. This is commonly thought to give rise to the negative charge on the earth. We don't get that much lightning at least in Seattle, maybe here in Phoenix there there's more but around the earth there are huge numbers of discharges and so it's possible that the lightning comb strikes the earth, brings negative charge and the earth can't rid itself of that negative charge rapidly enough and therefore it accumulates a negative, net negative charge. That's one idea. Another idea is that it may come from the Earth's water and this, as you can see, came from the work that we had done to produce the book that I mention. If you have EZ water down, the earth is of course filled with water and if much of that is the fourth phase or EZ water, it bears negative charge, you see. That could be another source of this negative charge and interestingly the Sun builds this EZ and negative charge so, so we have some sort of relationship with with the Sun. Essentially we have the Sun beating on the earth and we have negative charge that, that builds and if the Earth is highly conductive, as many investigators think, then these charges would be all around and fill the subsurface of the earth with net negative charge. So ok, there's the negative charge and you might say well, where do the corresponding positive charges lodge? They're initially together with water but many of these protons evaporate into the air, so we have a negative and the positive. And the positive ones, along with negatives which actually form clouds, the positive ones are rising up into the air and as they rise up into the air we have a situation that looks like this. The earth is negative and then you have positive charges that begin rising up as you see here. Close to the earth there's a high concentration of positive charges because those charges are attracted to the negativity of the earth but as you get higher up, the protons, or hydroium ions, tend to repel one another and they rise vertically and begin to spread out. You have positive charges in the atmosphere and negative charges on the Earth. If you think about that plus and minus, you have situation like this and you know, basic electrostatics tells you that the positive charges are clinging to the negative charges and so the atmosphere clings to the Earth and question that arises well, you know, if the atmosphere clings to the earth it exerts pressure on the earth, does this explain atmospheric pressure? The prevailing pressure mechanism is fraught with several paradoxes. You know, we think of pressure arising from the weight of the air, you know, so the weight of the air is pressing down on us and if you are on top of Mount Everest there's less air and it's pressing less on you.. But if you think about that, if you think about, we have a gas up there and question is, well we define a gas as, you have molecules and they don't stick together, they actually bounce around and hardly interact with one another and so. If they don't interact except very rarely then is it, can we easily imagine how they press on the earth? Or why, when you are higher up you have less pressure? It's possible but it, kind of, when you think about it, those isolated air molecules not clinging to the earth the way I suggested to you by just sort of hanging out there, it leads to the spectacle of you know, there's a lot of winds up there and why doesn't the atmosphere just blow away? Don't know if you ever thought about that. Okay here's another paradox about the atmosphere and the way we think about the atmosphere and we are ignoring the positive charges that I told you about. Well you know, the atmosphere is a mixture of gases, it's not just nitrogen and oxygen, a whole bunch of other other gases. So among them argon is about 1 percent, it's actually quite a lot of argon that we have in the air and co2 of course causing apparently, maybe if you, depending on your belief system, a lot of problems. Now but argon is the densest of all and so if argon is the densest of all you think after all these years that you might have a situation like this. So you know, if density really matters we're fraught with a serious problem. OK, so we got positive charges in the atmosphere and negative charges on the earth and so it's possible I think, that atmospheric pressure may arise from the positive charges attracting to the negative earth and pressing down. Quite, quite simple. OK, where do these charges hang out in the earth and in the atmosphere. Next question, do you, are there are substantial charge gradients, differences of charge that we can imagine? And the answer I suggest you is yes, they're both vertical gradients and lateral gradients, the lateral ones being the ones going to be focused on at the moment but the first is, you know, I mentioned to you that the protons diminish with increasing altitude. That's, that's shown on the two panels there now, suppose you put a test charge, the red one, down near the surface of the earth, a lot of positive charges there. And you'll detect the high electric field and if you put the test charge higher up, there are fewer positive charges there and the electric field will diminish. So, the field strength diminishes with increasing altitude and that's well known. Well reported, this is nothing controversial. The field strength also increases with sunshine. This is the interesting part that maybe some people are unaware but there is enough evidence for this, so if the positive charges are caused by evaporation from the Earth's water then nighttime there's not much evaporation. The charges should be fairly low in altitude and during the daytime when you have ample sunshine creating evaporation, those positive charges should rise way up, right. So there should be a big difference between daytime and nighttime and so therefore the electric field, which depends on all that charge, should vary with the time of day. So if you have for example in the middle of the day you are to see a lot of electric field when you're measuring up, well up above the earth and at night time it wanes so it waxes and wanes. And the evidence for that is right here. So this is a plot, a bit complicated but on the apscise you have time and if you look right in the middle at twelve o'clock that's noontime GMT that would be Greenwich ok, in England, and the electric field that was measured, up in the air. Look at the oscilation, so first look at the middle one, Africa and Europe and you can see that the peak occurs roughly 2-3 p.m. around around Europe, just when the Sun is kind of, has been around for a while high in the sky, maximum evaporation, all those positive charges high so you can see that the electric field there is very high. Now look to the right and you can see the US- that occurs six or so hours later during our afternoon so you can see that during, it doesn't matter where you are, during the nighttime the electric field is low and during the daytime it's high. And look at the differences between them, look at the Americas- the blue one. You can see that during the daytime the electric field is ten times, ten times higher than it is at night, it's a huge difference that, I think, many people are unaware of. So there's a great big difference between day and night and you can see that there is a gradient, when night meets day there's a gradient, and also on the other side, the upper right of the figure there's another gradient, there is a morning gradient and there is an evening gradient. Big, huge lateral gradient of positive charge. So do substantial charge gradients exist? Both vertically and horizontally. OK now, can those charge gradients drive the prevailing wind? So think about it. Seattle, on the left you know, we're snoozing and snoring and, you know, we haven't really gotten there yet and New York is beginning to be bathed in sunshine and if it's bathed in sunshine those positive charges are rising up into the atmosphere. But at night time there are very few of those, so there's a lateral gradient, those charges repel one another, they want to get away from one another, where do they go? Well they're gonna go to the left in this and if the charges are moving, the charges are at least dragging the air with them because these charges are either protons or more likely hydronium ions and they're either dragging the air or they may be attached to the air, bound for example to electronegative oxygens or nitrogens. So the air is going to move also and if the air are moves basically we have wind. So I believe that charge gradients can create wind, especially the large gradients with powerful forces that we're talking about. So there's the morning boundary and the evening boundary and I think those give rise to something interesting and characteristic. Here's the morning boundary ok again, New York has received its sunshine and Seattle, with the space near, is still dark and we have this charge gradient, charges in the morning, the charges are beginning to rise up and there's going to be a wind that goes across that gradient toward Seattle. OK now, it's also, this is also shown on the next slide. Now sorry, this one's a little complicated too so let me explain. So, this is the surface of the earth spread out so we have night time in the center and we have morning on the right side and evening on the left side. Now start on the right side and morning and remember that's just what I was talking about the wind is blowing from the east toward the west and it's not a strong wind because the charges on the right side are just beginning to rise up, there are not so many and it causes a wind, you might call it the morning wind and the wind blows from east to west and that's known as the trade wind. Trade wind blows gently that's what got Columbus to the, to the New World. Now look at the other side, look at, this is, the left side is the evening, ok, and by the evening, mid-afternoon, late afternoon the charges are way up high and the gradient is in the opposite direction, it blows from late afternoon toward the evening so it blows from west to east and anybody who's flown knows that there is a wind that blows continuously up high, it's called the jet stream that flows from west to east and it's pretty strong, a hundred, 200 miles per hour so if you fly to New York it's quicker than if you fly from New York to Seattle or Los Angeles. So, I think we can understand, this high wind is going to be stronger, this high westerly wind is gonna be stronger than the low easterly wind because there are many many more charges by late afternoon, by mid-afternoon to late afternoon. So I think those two gradients, from morning, the morning gradient and the evening gradient could perhaps adequately explain why we have trade winds and jetstream. Question was, can charge gradients drive the prevailing wind and I've shown you some evidence suggesting that maybe that could be the case. OK now, can the prevailing wind spin the Earth? Well if you think about it you really don't need a whole lot to, you have a wind that's blowing at 100 or a two hundred miles an hour, actually you know the earth is spinning itself right, it's spinning at, sorry what is it roughly, I think 1,200 miles miles per hour compared to the reference frame of the cosmos and the wind is going, the jet stream is going a hundred or two hundred miles per hour faster. So it's like the jet stream is blowing and it could be blowing the earth and the earth can't quite keep up so it's a little bit slower and that's why we have a jetstream relative to the earth that's a hundred or two hundred miles per hour faster. So I think it's possible that, we don't need this tall piece, this is obviously just illustrative but all you need is a gradience and something rubbing on the earth or rubbing on some protrusions. The advantage of this kind of wind mechanism is that so, the rotation of the earth now no longer depends on the inertia. As I said, maybe you think differently but it's difficult for me to imagine that inertia could keep us going for 5 billion years. It's a, it's a lot of time. And also the sun's energy is the ultimate driver because remember, the sun's energy is what splits the charge in the water which gives rise to the positive charge and so it all comes back to the energy from the Sun and so the conclusion from this is that the reason the Sun, the reason the Earth keeps spinning is, it gets energy from the Sun to make it spin. It just doesn't do it. It's known that the rotation speed of the earth is not constant. It fluctuates even by the day. If the earth turned by inertia, there shouldn't be fluctuations. There are fluctuations and so this can explain it. So the question is, can the prevailing winds spin the earth and I think the answer is possibly, perhaps that could be. Finally the last few slides as a sort of extra. So I'm suggesting to you that there's charge flow around the earth, right. Charge flow, wind and I want to touch on magnetic fields because charge flow, current, magnetic fields, they're kind of tied together and with those charges constantly, like jet stream, constantly flowing around the Earth, basically, oops sorry, basically we have a current that's flowing around the earth. So think of a current now flowing around the Earth from west to east and think about what we know from basic electrostatics and dynamics- if we have a current flow going this way we have a magnetic field using the right hand rule as shown here. Now think about applying this rule to the Earth. So, the horizontal arrows- that's the wind, that's the jet stream that blows constantly around the earth, it's a current, the current is flowing around the earth and if you have a current flowing that way then those thicker lines show the magnetic field. So it's possible that you can actually get magnetic field occurring just from those charged gradients creating current that flows around the earth. So it's possible, I mean we like to think that the Earth's magnetic field comes somewhere from the core of the earth but you know, nobody's ever been there to make that measurement and it's kind of odd that, you know, you got a magnet sitting there but the angle of the magnet keeps changing, which it does, sometimes even flips.. That's that's not, so I mean we're really not sure that the magnetic field arises from the core of the earth and I'm suggesting to you that it's possible that the Earth's magnetic field arises externally and not internally. So, I draw some conclusions and I don't really mean that they're conclusions, I mean they are speculations. I've shown you very little evidence, I have shown you just a few ideas that have stemmed largely from the book that I've produced and the ideas that went into it and a bit of evidence but mostly just logical sequences. The first, the first one is not a, is well known and we all should know that charges can exert enormous forces. Sometimes we attribute phenomena to gravitational forces, for example settling in a beaker of water with some particles, we think of gravitation but that beaker of water contains enormous numbers of charges. The charge forces outweigh the gravitational forces enormously, remember ten to the 38th. The earth bears negative charge, again, there's a lot of evidence for that, evidence starting more than a hundred years ago and continuing, it's just that, it's not really well known. The atmospheric scientists know that the atmosphere is full of positive charge. Oddly it doesn't seem to me, I've never seen anybody make the suggestion that plus attracts minus, that atmosphere attracts earth. It seems almost a no-brainer, one has to calculate how much force but seems like a really simple and easy interpretation of atmospheric pressure that the atmosphere clings to the earth because plus and minus attract. It's the sun's energy that builds that atmospheric positivity through evaporation. At night there's not much evaporation, not much atmospheric positivity and because of the regions between sunshine and darkness you have lateral charge gradients and remember how strong the force of those charges can be and so that inevitably drives winds and winds create friction and the question is whether that friction is sufficient to create the earth's, and keep it, spinning and giving us day and night. And it's possible that those charges may actually create the Earth's magnetic field. So I guess I would like to conclude with the fact that the universe or at least the Earth around us is indeed Electric as I know many of the people here would like to think and also the point is that, you know, alternative theories can sometimes make sense and I, I am with one example of an alternative theory, this, this is an alternative theory for global warming and the rise of the sea suggesting alternative mechanism and thank you for listening! 
You've just entered the theater of an alien sky. If the words and images seem strange to you, there's a reason for this. Our world was once a vastly different place. To experience this won't hurt you and there is nothing to fear. Sekhmet: The Ranging Eye of Ra Throughout this video series we've claimed that the origins of world mythology, ancient symbolism and magical rites lie in human memories of extraordinary natural events. It was from the emerging commemorative practices that the ancient civilizations themselves arose. And so we've repeatedly emphasized that the reconstruction offered here is far too specific to allow us to make up stories or to make up explanations. The evidence will either be there in unique detail that the reconstruction demands or it will not be there. Our explanation lies in a congregation of planets gathered close to the earth long before the rise of observational astronomy. And that means before any of these bodies were even named as planets. We've called this celestial formation The Polar Configuration and we've identified many of its varying forms as electric discharge activity between these bodies. Extraordinary events in the sky provoked an explosion of human imagination, now discoverable as story content within every ancient culture. In the course of these presentations it should also become clear that no archetype, no global theme could ever be explained by natural events in our own time. Things occurring today provide no referent whatsoever. The impact of this human experience requires that we follow the instincts of a detective, noting things too consistently out of place. And we must never forget that the more unusual the detail, the more compelling is the improbable convergence of testimony. Our claim is that the link of the mythic archetypes to the evolution of the polar configuration requires that we uncover the concrete reference beneath the imaginative symbols. Amongst the cross-cultural points of agreement is the repeated identity of the mother goddess as the planet Venus. This identity is not just worth following, it is a window to a mind-altering human experience, a story that reverberated through history for thousands of years. The paradoxical identity of the mother goddess with life itself, her role as the great protectress, but also as a world destroyer, can only be explained at the level of concrete origins beneath that symbolism. The discharge streamers of Venus and effusion of mythic power and glory were the animating life of heaven seen in mythic terms as the luminous heart and soul of the universal power we've identified as Saturn. But the connection runs in two directions since the discharging sphere of Venus was also interpreted as the protective shield of the warrior God, named as Mars, who occupied the impenetrable spot as if protected from the sky darkening clouds or celestial armies of chaos. When the heavens fell into disorder, the sky itself became a mythic battlefield. Swarms of debris, seen as rebelling hordes, appeared to overtake the world. It was in this context that the most active and spectacular form of the goddess emerged, affecting every ancient culture's ideas about the meaning of war, conquest and magical defense. Star of chaos: California rock art But was the goddess a divine weapon launched against rebelling powers or was she herself the provocation, the feared destroyer of cosmic order? Human imagination would stand in competition for millennia but more fundamental than the interpretation was the underlying event and our purpose here is to see the events through the lens of global patterns. Ironically, it is the competing interpretations that confirm both the patterns and the events that provoked them. Confirmation comes wherever, without the underlying event, the global patterns would not be conceivable, not even be possible. Egypt: "The Destruction of Mankind" In the presence of the goddess' visible power, enemies were scattered. Dark clouds of chaos gave way to a blast of fire and light. The rebelling hordes of heaven fled from its onslaught. One of the most dramatic illustrations of this archetypal theme is the Egyptian legend called The Destruction of Mankind. The myth says that the primeval sun god Ra had grown aged and perhaps a bit weary of humanity. It recounts how, in that remote time, the children of Ra had rebelled against the god. In response to the rebellion, Ra sent out his powerful eye to take vengeance on a disrespectful world. The agent of the conflagration that followed was the goddess Sekhmet. Not just a goddess, Sekhmet was the far-famed eye of Ra, the Utchat, the giver of life and the great protectress, the very heart and soul of the primeval sun himself. Egypt: The Eye of Ra (Utchat) as the goddess Sekhmet Enigmatically, Sekhmet also possessed both a leonine and a serpentine form, a remarkable parallel to the Sumerian Venus goddess Inanna, who displayed the same forms in her role as the terrifying radiance in the center of the god An, the overarching ruler of the sky. This is no coincidence, these mythic forms reveal no relationship whatsoever to today's sky but they are not accidental, not random and they direct our attention to the archetype of the great comet, the human experience from which the female comet archetype descended. The comet as the eye, heart and soul of a great king. Comet as a star with disordered hair or leonine mane. Comet as a cosmic serpent and the comet as a sign or an agent of world destruction. And so we find a remarkable juxtaposition of comet attributes in the titles of the Egyptian goddess Sekhmet, called the Beautiful Eye of the primeval sun. She was the Great Flame or Flaming One, the Destroyer by Fire, the Destroyer of Rebellions, the Rulerof Serpents and the Ruler of Lions. Strangely, all of the well documented goddesses in Egypt were like Sekhmet, called the eye of Ra, suggesting an underlying identity entirely outside natural experience today. And no goddess figure in ancient Egypt tells this story of the sun god's eye more vividly than Sekhmet whose very name derives from the root Khem signifying a blast of glory or majesty, the essential character of the eye-goddess. Sekhmet entered the conflagration displaying a trail of fire. The texts say, "Behold me, men and gods! I have come into being as the Lady of Glorious Appearings.... my flame is behind me. It is a flame which drives away on its account. The tip of its flame crosses the land from the sky...: No one at all can approach her, the streams behind her are flames of fire." In fact, the Egyptian traditions constitute a remarkable parallel to Sumerian descriptions of a world in fear and trembling at the tempestuous radiance of Inanna, identified as Venus. Sumerian Inanna (Venus) with her foot on her alter ego, the lion Precisely the same way, Sekhmet appeared as a flame of fire in her tempest, instilling terror on Earth and threatening to destroy the world. "I am mistress of the flame", the goddess announces,... "The fear of me is in their hearts and the awe of me is in their hearts. The flame makes his enemies fall. It is a flame moving before the wind of the sky to the end of the earth." Surely it is no coincidence that the great flame in heaven, taking the form of a fiery serpent, found its symbolic place on the crown of kings in Egypt, exactly as we've seen in ancient Mesopotamia. It was the headgear of the king that reflected the protective role of the explosive majesty most dramatically. In later times, when Egyptian armies confronted foreign nations, these peoples were seen as barbarians outside the gate, they were the terrestrial counterparts of the primeval chaos themes and so the king invariably called upon the shining majesty of Ra, remembering how the eye- goddess, in her rage, had destroyed rebelling powers in the sky in former times. In considering this theme, the critical steps will require comparative analysis of an incontrovertible historical pattern. The ancient story of the goddess says the explosive glory of heaven was the story of the great comet. In this experience we find the origins of the astronomical language and symbolism of comets around the world, there is no other explanation. And so too, the attributes of the celestial glory are the defining attributes of the planet Venus as mother goddess. And as we continue our series, this truth can be verified in the astronomical lexicon of every well-documented culture in ancient times. In their essential details, the global story of the great comet is the story of the planet Venus. Always look for the underlying form! 
Could it really be that we live in an Electric Universe? That claim challenges some of the most popular and long held ideas in the sciences and it's provoked a lot of banter amongst journalists and internet bloggers. As public interest grows, so do the reflexes on behalf of more traditional, more acceptable ideas. Earlier this year, we invited the popular skeptic Michael Shermer to our EU2015 Conference Paths of Discovery. The event was held in Phoenix, Arizona in late June. Shermer spoke at the event and participated in a panel discussion on the ground rules for evaluating extraordinary challenges to long held theoretical assumptions. We envisioned the adventure as a cautious experiment - is it possible to communicate, even if imperfectly, across a gap that has never been bridged since the birth of the Electric Universe movement some 15-20 years ago? I participated on the panel as well, along with Dr. Gary Schwartz of the University of Arizona and Wal Thornhill, chief science adviser to the Thunderbolts Project. Expectations were mixed. In fact, we received some advanced criticism for inviting Shermer, "letting the fox into the hen-house" as some put it. Others said it was our best strategic move ever, but that response came largely from those who saw the event. You can see it for yourself through the link provided below. About 3 months after the event, as we had expected, Shermer's response appeared in Scientific American. Shermer's opening words set up his premise: that the electrical theorists argue against science that is already settled. Newton was wrong. Einstein was wrong. Black holes do not exist. The Big Bang never happened. Dark energy and dark matter are unsubstantiated conjectures. Stars are electrically charged plasma masses. Venus was once a comet. The massive Valles Marineris canyon on Mars was carved out in a few minutes by a giant electric arc sweeping across the red planet. The 'thunderbolt' icons found in ancient art and petroglyphs are not the iconography of imagined gods but realistic representation of spectacular electrical activity in space. These are just a few of the things I learned at the Electric Universe conference EU2015. With these words Shermer opened the door to a highly dismissive review of the Electric Universe themes all written with no personal awareness of the subject matter. It seems that dismissive quips come quite easily when one is fending-off challenges to a belief system - just remind your congregation of things they already know, the challenges can then become a subject of ridicule, no actual science needed. For many years, the EU community has warned about the dangers of self-perpetuating dogma. Yes, modern technological advances are impressive but it seems that theoretical foundations are frozen at levels prior to the Space Age. Add the growing centralization of funding and the cost of institutionalized but mistaken ideas could be catastrophic. As one can see in Shermer's review, he has little or no concerns of this sort. All is well within the sciences! This state of good health, he assures us, is confirmed by thousands of scientists sharing in an underlying consensus, the big questions such as relativity, and the Big Bang, and of course, many others are reliably settled. A much different understanding drives the Electric Universe movement. Electrical theorists have paid close attention to the roles of electric fields, electric currents and high energy electric discharge in space plasma. Plasma is the medium of charged particles that fill the vacuum of space. Space is not empty and the sciences cannot afford to ignore the sea of plasma across the cosmos. That's why the experts in our group have raised an alarm. They recognize that leading institutions responsible for guiding the vision management and funding of research may well have wasted hundreds of billions of dollars asking the wrong questions. In his response, Shermer reverses the role of skepticism - he assumes the mantle of a true believer - one who already knows, the guide for the faithful is already in hand and shared by thousands of trusting followers. Read his response for yourself and you'll see exactly what this means. The Electric Universe movement is inspired by interdisciplinary research, from new data delivered by the space program to volumes of historical evidence. Anyone who wants to know can compare Shermer's review to the actual situation. The EU movement throws a spotlight on a steady stream of new facts that have caught standard theorist by surprise. In one instance after another, the great surprises of the space age are the inherent predictions of the Electric Universe. Simply follow the surprises and the picture of space changes as surely as night and day.  In Shermer's published dismissal of the Electric Universe, his treatment of mathematician Stephen Crothers was perhaps the lowest of low points - just dismissive with no science. Crothers is recognized as amongst the most capable critics of relativity theory and his criticism can, indeed, send orthodox theorists into a frenzy. But Shermer's own words are telling. First, he acknowledges that he wasn't up to understanding Crothers, but then he adds a priceless confession. He writes, "I am confident he's wrong by the fact that for a century thousands of physicists have challenged Einstein, and still he stands as Time's Person of the Century". It's a bit astonishing to see someone cite a celebrity rating as an argument in Scientific American. For an exclamation point on this curiosity, viewers need only consider Shermer's comment in the light of Crothers actual conference presentation. (which you can access through the link given below) Shermer's Scientific American article merely stacks some EU claims on top of each other without any reference to substantiating data, so it's only appropriate here to review the scale of erroneous perception that follows. EU proponents do not claim that Newton was wrong, but for good reason, the electrical view emphasizes that gravity alone could never complete our understanding of celestial mechanics. There's no problem with gravity until or unless a gravity centric dogma takes over allowing theorists to overlook the effective charge and charged particle movement at cosmic scales. Across the vastness of space, even the most minuscule and immeasurable electric field, at any particular place, can add up to a stupendous potential across the volume of interplanetary, interstellar and intergalactic distances. In fact, Newtonian explanations fall short all the time. And we provided hundreds of examples based on original research and published contributions from the world's leading experts on space plasma. Plasma is defined by the presence of charged particles, even in an immeasurably weak electric field, charged particles easily override Newtonian gravity. In fact, we're all living in the presence of charged particles exploding from the Sun. These particles care very little about gravity and continue to accelerate across the vacuum of interplanetary space before crashing into the Earth's magnetosphere to provoke the auroras. For decades, we overlooked the evidence of this until the 1970's when instruments in space confirmed an electrical connection of the Earth and Sun, first stated by the experimentalist Kristian Birkeland, almost a hundred years ago. Yes, we live in a rather quiet corner of the universe today, though it's not always been this way, and gravity is not the only force doing real work across the cosmos. Earth's auroras pale by comparison with the higher energy events we see in space. Explosive events and exotic electrical structures in space mean that gravity does not singularly dominate the macrocosm. The phrase Electric Universe comes from observations of electrical phenomena, in both the laboratory and across the vacuum of space. The work of Nobel laureates and other pioneers of plasma science has for too long been kept in the back room. The highest energy events in the cosmos exhibit every predictable signature of electrical events, including synchrotron radiation pointing to the highest energy plasma instabilities, it's signature showing up across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Well before it's confirmation synchrotron radiation from the cores and along the polar axis of galaxies, was predicted by the father of modern plasma science Nobel laureate, Hannes Alfven. Yes, the stars and our Sun, in particular, offer excellent tests of the electrical perspective. Well before our space probes and advanced telescopes began to more deeply explore the mysteries of the Sun, astronomers had already settled on the idea of a thermonuclear core driving solar activity. But almost immediately, a mystery arose as our satellites in space probes detected a continuing acceleration of charged particles away from the Sun across interplanetary space. How does it happen that the great attractor, holding planets in their orbits, cannot hold onto charged particles as they race away from the Sun, continuing to accelerate up to speeds of millions of miles per hour. This is not a question to be downplayed and much less to be ignored. So, the EU researchers offered a science-based possibility never considered in 60 years of solar physics - the acceleration of the solar wind is the confirmation of the Sun's electric field. Electric fields accelerate charged particles. This is a well-known fact, not something to be denied or ignored. This confirmed electric field exposes one of the greatest challenges facing modern astronomy and cosmology - literally the collapse of the longstanding official dogma. The central tenet of the dogma has been the imagined cosmic pre-eminence of gravity alone across electrically neutral space. That dogma left the Sun as an isolated island where all of it's dynamic activity could only be explained by events occurring inside the island. That means no causative link between it's primary features and it's larger environment - no external electrical influence on the Sun at all, just the trivial gravitational effects exerted on the massive body of the Sun by the remote circling planets. The archaic, but worldwide idea that the planet Venus formerly appeared as a comet is fully documented and will forever remain a mystery, until that global tradition is given the attention it deserves. In every major culture, the regional language of a comet is the regional language of Venus and there's just no escaping the implications. When cultures the world over give the same details in different languages, and different symbols, it's just not rational to ignore the converging testimony. The story of the comet Venus has a long history tracing back to ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian sources. The theme continuing through Greek and Roman times, into the medieval period. As the Egyptian goddess Sekhmet, Venus was the great flame instilling overwhelming terror. As the Sumerian goddess, Inanna, she was the Great Dragon raining fire down upon the land. For the Greeks, Venus was Aphrodite Comaetho. In the language of classical astronomy, the words mean "the long-haired Venus", the comet Venus, the goddess's cometary train seen mythically as a horde of wild beasts. And even in Galileo's time, it is known that popular traditions retained the idea that Venus was a comet. The most striking fact is that the same mystery occurs in Meso-America, where the planet Venus wears the symbolic dress of the comet - the smoking star, a flaming ember envisioned as a luminous soul rising in the sky. The language and symbolism of Venus is the language and symbolism of the comet. It's ironic that Shermer's litany of EU themes culminates with two statements about the cosmic thunderbolt, perhaps the greatest of all ancient mysteries left untouched by modern investigations. What was the earth shaking heaven altering weapon of the ancient gods? While the theme is far too broad for adequate coverage here, the subject must be considered by anyone hoping to make sense of things that were once remembered around the world. The cosmic Thunderbolt never looks like lightning, and yet, it's recorded forms are remarkably similar to high energy electric discharge configurations in laboratory vacuum chambers, with surprising parallels to formations seen in space, as well. Until this cross cultural memory is fully comprehended, astronomers and planetary scientists will labor under the spell of a profound misunderstanding, assuming that planets have moved on their present courses for billions of years. For those ready to hear the ancient witnesses, the cosmic thunderbolt will explain what has been left unexplained across the centuries. For the Electric Universe community, this remarkable weapon of ancient gods provides a critical interdisciplinary bridge that connects the space sciences to a deeper understanding of the human past. Multiple phenomena speaking to us in a hundred different ways, all perplexing, but only until we see the electric force at work. Ignore that force and you are left with a fragmented universe, each fragment calling for a different explanation - dark matter and dark energy, black holes and neutron stars, hidden thermonuclear furnaces and much more. In remote space, impossible galactic jets held in place across a hundred thousand light years and more ... Closer to home, intensely energized planetary nebulae revealing exotic structure beyond any reasonable gravitational explanation. And in our own cosmic neighborhood, countless mysteries of comets; their forms make no sense, they often explode for no acceptable reason, and their nuclei do not exhibit the water that theories require. And also nearby, in overwhelming abundance, the pervasive scars on planets and moons boldly defying theoretical attempts at explanations. At our website, thunderbolts.info you'll discover large libraries of evidence reconnecting observed phenomena to their electrical cause. Consider this research and you'll discover for yourself that we do, indeed, live in an Electric Universe. 198 00:18:14,599 --> 00:15:23,599 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info The following presentation is an adaptation of the Picture of the Day article 'What is light?' by author Mel Acheson. The link to the article may be found in the description box of this video. When you're in a boat, you see waves of water lap against the hull. If you could tie a flag to a molecule of water, you could see that molecule move up and down. When you're at a concert, you hear waves of sound press against your ear. If you could tie a flag to a molecule of air, you could see that molecule move back and forth. When you tune your radio to your favorite station, you set its sensory organ-the antenna and tuning circuit- to respond to waves of electromagnetic potential. The water or air molecule moves. You can measure its spatial displacement as it varies with time, and you can plot those measurements on a graph with displacement along one axis and time along the other. The result is a sinusoidal curve that resembles the form of the water's surface which we call a wave. Hence we speak of water waves, usually without distinguishing the "real" surface feature(s) from the metaphorical mathematical form. And we speak of sound waves usually without being aware that the term is, in this instance, entirely metaphorical. We have developed mathematical manipulations that enable us, on the basis of metaphorical resemblances, to predict and to utilize various attributes of periodically moving water and air molecules. The wave theory of water and the wave theory of sound have been wondrously productive cognitive tools. So, too, we speak of electromagnetic waves. And we have developed mathematical manipulations that have been wondrously productive. We measure voltages or currents; we graph their variation with time; and the graphs have the form of a wave. But what moves? The variation is a changing potential, not a changing location. I could plot the changes in my thinking against time and produce a wave of opinion. Would Quantum Mechanics then apply? Opinions do become entangled and they frequently collapse, but this is hardly what Dr. Schrödinger had in mind with his wave equation. He was thinking of something "material" that moved. The assumption that light is something that moves from one place to another goes beyond even the analogy with water: In water and sound waves, the particles only move back and forth in place. The water molecule doesn't move from the boat to the beach; the air molecule doesn't move from the horn to your ear. The apparent movement "from-to" is a sequential periodicity in the oscillations of the molecules. The idea that light is something that moves from one location to another gives rise to the further ideas of a "ray" of light and, if interrupted into segments, a "bullet of light." The shortest segment imaginable we imagine to be a tiny particle, a photon, shot out of an emitting atom traveling to another atom, and being absorbed. The analogous image with water or sound is not associated with waves but with such things as fire hoses and jet engines-"streams" of water or air. The question of what, if anything, moves with light is an open one. This question goes back 300 years. And-surprise!-it was never settled. It was decided but not settled. A Danish astronomer, Olaus Roemer, measured variations in the times of occultation of Jupiter's innermost moon, Io, when the Earth was at opposite points in its orbit. He attributed the differences to the travel time of something that moved from Io to the Earth, i.e., to the speed of light. The director of the Royal Observatory in Paris, Gian Domenico Cassini, the first of four generations of Royal astronomers, disagreed. He thought light might instead be a cumulative response of the eye, perhaps to variations in some force acting instantaneously at a distance like Newton's gravity. He noted that Roemer's measurements were dependent on a great many variables- different velocities of Earth and Io, different angles of view, different intensities of light, different observing conditions, etc. -- any one of which, or some combination of which, could account for the variations in his (Roemer's) observations. Cassini also took measurements, not only of Io but of the other Galilean satellites of Jupiter. And the other satellites did not show the same variations as Io. Edmund Halley, of Halley's Comet fame, who had helped publish and promote Newton's Principia, became enamored with Roemer's idea (that light was something that moved) and promoted it in the scientific press of the time. Roemer and Cassini died. Halley carried the torch, and Roemer's idea caught on. The mob of scientists rushed down Something That Moves Street and vacated Cumulative Response Street. No one even thought to look for other streets of explanation in the Village of Electromagnetism. Even Cassini's son, who succeeded him at the Royal Observatory, abandoned his objections. As I said, the issue was decided-by mob rule but not settled. What really is the case? Light might be something that moves-but what else could it be? That light is something that moves is plausible. That assumption explains many observations-though not all. But plausibility is not reliability: Unless a systematic effort is made to seek out what else light might be and to devise tests that will distinguish among the various possibilities, no one will ever know if "something moving" is the truth or merely a plausible artifact of selected data. Roemer simply reversed the older intuitive idea that understood seeing as analogous to touching: something-an "ocular ray"-reaches out like a finger and touches/sees the object seen. Roemer assumed rays come not from the eye but to the eye, and that too is intuitive. But as more observations accumulated, things got more complicated. Today, Quantum Mechanics has had to abandon intuitiveness altogether and embrace "Quantum weirdness". Its justification is that it gets results: The math goes from an empirical start to an empirical finish. It's predictive to a very, very, very great degree of accuracy. However, accurate prediction is a sign of a theory's usefulness, not its truthfulness. The theory could be merely instrumental but instrumentalism is not as satisfying as the conviction that one possesses The Truth in capital letters. Light must be something that travels, who could doubt that? The mob must have gone down the Street of Truth after all. What else could light be! That exclamation point begs a question that should be taken seriously. It's a question that lies at the heart of reliability. It lies at the heart of scientific discovery. What else, indeed, could light be? The math (of Quantum Mechanics) goes from 1, which we observe, to 4, which we also observe: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 But there's no guarantee reality goes that way: Maybe the real path is 1 + 3 = 4. Quantum weirdness may only be ambiguity in our categories (of waves/particles that move) rather than in light. What if light is a "cumulative response"? No one has bothered to develop a mathematical theory for that ... yet. What if light is something else? No one has bothered to peer down the cognitive alleyways for a third or fourth possibility: Consider that plasma discharge phenomena are scalable over at least 14 orders of magnitude, from the scale of galaxies to the scale of atoms. Why stop with "fundamental" subatomic particles? What if the "zoo" of subatomic particles is merely a spritz of tiny electrical sparks- plasmoids-observed at different stages of their evolution or under different discharge conditions? (Imagine a subatomic- sized Herbig-Haro star or active Seyfert galaxy- the "doughnut on a stick" form typical of so many plasma discharge phenomena.) What if reality consists of larger sparks driving smaller sparks all the way down the scales, and there is no such thing as a "particle" or a "wave"? With electromagnetism, the electric and magnetic fields vary in strength and polarity. It's not immediately obvious that anything moves- except scientists' opinions about it. And they move more like a mob: Fervency of belief so easily obscures enlightenment. It's been 300 years, and the question is still open. What moves? 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info On August 12, 2018, NASA's Parker Solar Probe was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, beginning its historic journey that would take it closer to the Sun than any man-made object to date. In early December, the first scientific papers were published on the mission's earliest findings. The first four papers have suggested a number of "surprising discoveries" including the speed of the solar wind rotating around the Sun, and the behaviors of dust particles that the probe has encountered at its perihelion. From the perspective of the electric Sun model, perhaps the most intriguing discovery to date is the "unexpected changes" in the Sun's magnetic field, which the probe encountered as it moved through the plasma environment. As one news report describes, "Unexpectedly, the probe also detected a series of flips in the Sun's magnetic fields--dubbed 'switchbacks' -- as streaming winds of plasma flowed past the spacecraft. During these periods, the magnetic field suddenly reversed itself by 180 degrees and then, seconds to hours later, flipped back." In part one of this two- part presentation, retired professor of electrical engineering, Dr. Donald Scott begins his analysis of the Parker Probe data. Well, about a week or so ago, at a NASA press conference, the investigators that are in charge of the Parker Solar Probe described their new findings from the first flybys of that probe. Now, as far as I have been able to find out, the probe has made about three closer and closer passages to the Sun and it will continue to do that for several years and hopefully, if it doesn't burn up, it'll continue to do that. But in any event, the NASA press conference included the statement, which is sort of typical of them, "This is the first time we've been able to fly a spacecraft into the atmosphere of a star." They said that last time too, and I commented on that kind of statement. It all depends on what you call the atmosphere of a star. What is the Sun's atmosphere? Well, the Sun's local plasma extends out to the extent of the heliosphere which is, ends in what we call the heliopause and that's several times the distance out of Pluto, so by definition, any probe or satellite that gets out of Earth's atmosphere is in the Sun's atmosphere, if you familiarize the Sun's  atmosphere goes out that far. But actually, the proper question is: how close to the Sun's photospheric surface will the Parker Probe get? Will it get into the Sun's Corona? Will it get below the Corona- -no, certainly not below the Corona, and nothing's going to, in the foreseeable future, will ever get through that kind of temperature, but NASA says that the probe will, in 2025, get within a distance of four million miles. OK, I think as I said last time, that four million miles is about nine solar radii. That is, if you take a picture of the Sun during the full solar eclipse and see the Corona there, if you look and scale the distance, let's say from the center of the Sun to the edge of the black dot, the shadow of the Moon in front of the Sun, that's of course the solar radius. And so, if you measure out ten times that distance, that's where closest approach of the Parker Probe will get. It used to be said that the farthest out that the Corona extends is about five solar radii. So I said last time and I still think, that the Parker probe was not going to get even close to the outermost regions of the Corona. But recently NASA says no, the Corona extends out to something like five million miles, twelve solar radii, and so it could make, get in, depending on what they guess the feeling of the Sun at the moment is, what it's, how far it extends its Corona, it may touch the outer reaches of the Corona. But there is something that it's going to. The press release goes on to say that the present data that they're getting back "...hints at the likely birthplace of dynamic solar winds, which bathe our entire solar system in energy." Well, that's certainly true. They continue to say, "It describes startling reversals (that is to say switchbacks) in the Sun's magnetic fields. And it detects dust in the solar wind and it shows that solar winds spin," and they say of course in their airy frivolous language, "it spins like children riding on a playground carousel." Anyway, if you can get through that, whenever you hear about things spinning, just quietly think about the fact that force-free currents are collections of counter-rotating spinning magnetic field and current pathways. I submit and I have submitted for a long while, that they're about the only natural phenomenon that do consist of concentric counter-rotating cylinders that do indeed spin or at least twist. In one of our last Space News segments, we discussed reports that the Voyager probes have observed unexpected rotation of the magnetic fields through which it is traveling. That is the Voyagers, they're out at the end, the other end of the thing, they're out of the heliopause and my comment at that time says wow, that's fantastic because that would fit like a hand into a glove with our Juergens' Electric Sun model, and that would say that yes, they have left the heliopause or heliosphere, out through the heliopause, but it still hasn't left the giant Birkeland current that feeds this whole solar system and feeds our Sun, still seeing them, rotating magnetic fields, within that Birkeland current. Getting back to the present though, the present report, I feel it's very likely that the pointed tops of the so-called coronal caps, regions were the arrays of plasma that are leaving up through the corona, instead of diverging from a central point, i.e. the Sun, after they leave they seem to, certain places at least, come back together again and form a triangular or at least a conical kind of a cap. But anyway, a long time EU member, good friend of ours, Chris Reeve apparently asked the question: isn't it possible that these switchbacks are simply the probe moving through the counter- flowing Birkeland current cylinders of each filament? And when I saw that I said, hurrah, thank you Chris! Yes, absolutely, yes, of course, yes, it's quite likely that the coronal caps, those pointed-hat-shapes we observe in the outer regions of the Corona, are exactly where Birkeland currents form, and those Birkeland currents extend out to places like the north poles of the planets, so Birkeland currents would explain the spinning and the reversal of direction of magnetic fields that the Parker Solar Probe observes and that the investigators have found so typically surprising. Scientific reports describe the Parker Probe being bombarded with dust particles during its closest approaches to the Sun. A phys.org report states, "Another surprise was a dust that peppered the spacecraft repeatedly during each fly-by at perihelion... The dust particles are likely debris from asteroids or comets that melted near the Sun and left behind their trapped dust." But this begs the question: how large an amount of rocky comet and asteroid material would have to be spread through such an unimaginably vast volume of space? We asked Dr. Scott how the Electric Sun model of the solar plasma environment might better explain the presence of such dust? I think that that explanation is, it's akin to the typical explanation that they give for why are there all sorts of different elements? You know; manganese, calcium, iron, sulfur, oxygen, you name it, all the other elements in addition to the hydrogen and helium that their model says has to be there, but their model of nuclear fusion does not produce manganese, calcium, oxygen, and sulfur and all the raft of other elements. And so, where does it come from? In deeper outer cosmic space there are novae explosions, Suns explode and they pepper the universe with, and Scott adds parenthetically, (fairy dust) that sprinkles throughout the galaxies and intergalactic space, and that's how all these other kinds of elements that the Sun doesn't generate, that's how they get on the Sun, it's like a snowstorm and they come in from deeper outer space. Now, if you believe that, I've got a bridge that connects Manhattan and Brooklyn that I would be very willing to sell you. Alfven and all of the earlier plasma physicists were well aware that most plasmas are what are called dusty plasmas and that means that they contain neutrals; a fully ionized plasma is very rare, they say that the outer regions of the Coronas, of the Corona of our Sun and probably other stars, are fully ionized plasma, but 99% of most plasmas are not fully ionized. In fact, Hannes Alfven was quoted as saying, if the plasma was more than ten percent ionized, it could be considered a fully ionized plasma because, the forces between the ions and electrons that were there are so much stronger than the gravitation between the neutrals that the neutrals, the gravitational effects just don't count. So that's a long-winded way of saying sure, plasmas are dusty, that's where the dust comes from, it comes from within the Sun, as the ions and the electrons come blasting out of the Sun they bring neutrals with them and that's where it came from. I don't think you have to depend on asteroids melting near the Sun to explain that. Stay tuned for part 2 
[Music] In June of 2022, I offered an explanation of why dark matter doesn't exist. That line of reasoning came directly from an application of the properties of the Electric Sun  model. The mainstream, accepted model has no way to describe or explain dark matter. I  presented that discussion in my latest book “The Interconnected Cosmos”, and also in there are explanations of several other phenomena that can only be understood by referencing the properties of the Electric Sun model. One of these is the so-called solar wind. Now, a gigantic flow of electrically charged particles is more accurately called an electric current. But astronomers had already completely convinced themselves that there was no possibility of separated charges moving through interplanetary space, when in 1962 the Mariner-2 space probe that was on its way to Venus, detected it. Astronomers didn't know what to make of this. Ignoring the earlier 1908 prediction by Kristian Birkeland that electric corpuscles such as this would indeed be discovered, Eugene Parker named the flow the solar wind, effectively robbing from Birkeland the recognition he so richly deserved for his now validated prediction. Also naming it a wind, successfully camouflaged its true electrical nature. Anyway, later the Ulysses Solar Probe discovered that this wind came in two varieties, an irregular, relatively slow type of flow with speeds of up to 400 kilometers per second - that's not slow - but there's also a fast one with speeds up to twice that, 800 kilometers per second. So there are two different types, two different speeds of these two different solar winds. The slow one typically comes from the Sun's equatorially-located so-called ’streamer belt’. The fast type comes from the relatively peaceful surface that we see when we look down through coronal holes at the normal surface of the smooth photosphere. In my book, I point out “...that some skeptics have made much of the idea that electrons are found in both the fast and slow solar winds along with positive ions. Yes. That's true. But that doesn't mean that the net flow of charge is zero. In a plasma, electrons and ions are separated. If they weren't, we wouldn't have a plasma, we would have a simple neutral gas flow.” But in interplanetary space they are separated; negative electrons are generally attracted toward the positively charged Sun, and positive ions are repelled by that Sun. These forces are generally relatively weak. An interplanetary electric field of only a few volts or even microvolts per kilometer is sufficient - given that it extends  over millions of kilometers to accelerate those solar wind ions to speeds of 400 kilometers per second and 800 kilometers per second. But consider what occurs when an electron, moving in toward the Sun approaches an ion that is moving outward away  from the Sun. As the ion and the electron get closer to each other, the attractive force between them increases. The strength of the attractive force applied to the positive ion is exactly equal to the force applied to the electron. These are purely attractive electrical forces and they're equal because both particles have exactly the same amount of electric charge and they are of opposite sign. But the ion has about 1800 times the mass of the  electron. It's sort of like a tug-of-war between a mouse running in one direction and an elephant going in the other direction. They're both pulling with the same amount of force on the stretched spring between them. But the elephant - the plus ion - continues merely on his trajectory  carrying the poor mouse - the electron - roughly in his direction. The ion does not capture the electron, because recombination would quench the plasma. So the electron often ends up being dragged along by the ion but wildly oscillating around the ion at what is called the “plasma frequency.” So how does the Electric Sun model explain the two different solar winds? The essence of the Electric Sun is shown in this image. In this diagram the horizontal axis of each plot is the radial distance outward from a point just below the Sun's photospheric surface. That surface is opaque; we can't see down through it. That's why some people think that is a surface. The top plot shows how the voltage changes as we go out from the surface. It isn't really a surface, it's a layer. But  it's analogous to what we would get if we plotted a cross section of the dam at the end of a reservoir that holds back water. The middle plot shows three different  charge layers that create that voltage distribution. They are three very thin concentric spherical shells that surround the Sun. The height of those triangular regions that  you see, shows the force per unit charge that a positive ion would experience at those various radial distances. A positive value of that is an outward force. So, any  ion that can get to a point in the chromosphere (this would be between points b  and d), will fall down the voltage hill just like a ball rolls down a hill. Dropping down the voltage hill makes the ion go faster and faster. In other words, it accelerates. Its velocity is plotted in the bottom curve. This next image shows what happens normally, when the level of the most energetic ions within the body of the Sun have just enough energy to leak over the top of the voltage dam. The purple is the water and you can  see it just being a little higher than the photospheric tuft and it's leaking over the top  there. If the effective height of the dam can be varied, the volume - that's called the density flow; how much stuff is flowing there - can be varied. This flow, as it passes out of the image toward the lower right, experiences turbulence. This is measured as the temperature of the ion flow; this creates the anomalous extremely high temperature of the lower corona that begins here something like two million Kelvin. Clearly our dam on the Sun is electrical; not made of steel and cement that holds back a fluid. It's made from what astronomers call photospheric granules. But plasma scientists call them anode tufts. The flow, as it moves off to the right is called the fast solar wind. Its velocity is due solely to the height of the dam - the height of the voltage drop through which the ions fall. Its density, that is how many amperes it contains or how many gallons per minute are flowing, is controlled by the height of the floodgate, the little floodgate at the top and a very minor movement of that floodgate can really change the amount of the flow. The solar wind actually stopped for a day or two a few years ago. Why? Did somebody raise the floodgate and cut the water flow? Needless to say the Standard Model has no explanation for this phenomenon, but the Electric Sun does. The higher the face of the dam, the greater the velocity of the water when it gets to the bottom. It's just that simple. But what happens if in some region the dam is  taken away? You visualize somebody blows a hole in the dam, or the dike breaks. Then water, or ions in our case, would flood out from the reservoir. The density of the flood would be greater, more gallons per second, more amperes. But the velocity would be lower because the stuff would be falling from a lower height. Not over the top of the dam wall which is way up high. The lower voltage, in the real case a lower height from the water analogy. The real explanation is obvious from this diagram. This is the same cross section we saw earlier, but a sunspot is a place where there is no photospheric tuft to create a dam. So, if you remove the black line, all you're left with is the interior of the Sun. There is at voltage V1 on the vertical axis and the the ions - you can see the red curve - just flood outward from that out toward the lower corona. They're not restrained in any way as the path of the ions coming through the granules, the ones on the top, they have to get up over that higher voltage V2. And then they fall higher - it's steeper - drop down to where they created some turbulence. But anyway a Sunspot is a place where there are no photospheric tufts to create the dam and the Sun's internal energy, being that voltage V1 and the energy level of the dam itself is V2, so in a Sunspot the internal ions are unrestrained and are able to get out of the Sun by just falling from level V1. So they aren't going as fast as those that fall all the way down from level V2. And this is how the slow solar wind is created from sunspots. The  voluminous but relatively slow moving ions of the slow solar wind flow easily up and out of a sunspot. So we see here the same region of the Sun in all three images. The top picture is the photosphere which is the innermost layer that is closest to the center of the Sun, the one that's at lowest solar altitude, if you want to think of it that way, and it obviously includes a beautiful big sunspot group. The middle picture is taken at a slightly higher level than the one at the top, and it's of the chromo- sphere. In reality that's of course above the photosphere. And the bottom picture is  higher still in altitude, and it's a picture of the lower part of the corona which extends outward from that point out to those several radiuses of the values of the  Sun. So the layer that's at the lowest altitude on the Sun, the photosphere at the top in this image, and the layer that's located at the highest solar altitude, the  lower corona, appears in the bottom of the image. You can see the effect of ions that pour up from the sunspots. They create a high level of turbulence when they enter the chromosphere and even more when they hit the lower corona, so you can see they're white. The photosphere is covered by granulation. It consists of closely packed plasma tufts. The chromosphere is a layer that begins about 250 miles above the photosphere and it's about a thousand miles thick. The lower corona begins just above the chromosphere and it extends outward a distance of several solar radii. The  dark region at the bottom left of this image is a coronal hole. It's simply an area in the Sun's corona that's located above a nice normal quiescent photospheric region that is devoid of any sunspots or other irregularities. These holes are associated with quiet Sun. It may seem to an inexperienced person and to some scaremongers on the internet that coronal holes are something to be feared or worried about. They aren't. They're just not disturbed regions from which coronal mass ejections or any other violent ejections of matter usually emanate. They're peaceful regions more than any other area such as the streamer belt. It's a normal region on the Sun where the photosphere has a smooth appearance and tufting is relatively uniform and undisturbed. And  that's where the fast solar wind comes from. Please summarize the important properties of the so-called solar wind. First, there's a factor of two difference between the maximum velocities of the two winds. Secondly, the density of the slow wind is well over that of the fast wind. The amount of matter, the amount of stuff, in the slow wind is 85 percent greater than in the more controlled fast wind. Slow  wind just pours out of an open hole, so that's why there's more material in it. Thirdly,  temperature is a measure of the random excitement motion of the particles in a  plasma. In the fast wind this level is six times greater than in the slow wind. In the fast wind ions collide forcefully with the bottom of their great fall. Slow wind ions easily escape without falling through a great voltage drop, so they're not as turbulent as the as the fast solar wind. Fourth, the random motions of electrons in the two winds are relatively in the same order of magnitude, the slow wind electrons being only about 30 percent more excited than those in the fast wind. But this observation was made at roughly Earth's distance from the Sun. If you realize that the electrons in both winds at that point are coming in toward the Sun from the outer regions of the solar system. And so they have not yet been through the mixing effects, the scrambling effects of the tuft voltage drops just above the photosphere. That lies in their future when they get closer in. Fifth, in the Electric Sun model the turbulence of the fast wind ions is caused by their falling through this high  voltage drop. And that explains the extreme temperature of the lower corona which has baffled astronomers for decades. Sixth and final, the Electric Sun model explains the fluctuations in the volume, that is to say the quantity of material, in the fast solar wind and how it once was cut off for more than a day. Now, none of these six observed facts are explained by the Standard Model of cosmology. They all result from electrical forces that the ions experience. They're prime pieces of evidence of the validity of the Electric Sun model which is a major component of the overall Electric Universe hypothesis or the Electric Universe model of cosmology. In the Standard Model their eyes are wide shut to the obvious presence of electricity in the cosmos. But those that use common sense  and think for themselves can see the magnificence of our truly Electric Universe. How long do you think it'll be before astronomers open their eyes to what is actually going on in the cosmos? Is conventional science presently living in a reincarnation of the middle ages, where there was a privileged class, consisting of the king, the nobles and the clergy who held all the power and the general population believed whatever nobility told them? And the ascendance of real empirical science would not emerge for many centuries to come, until enough people caught on that the emperor had no clothes. [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info In part 1 of this presentation, Thunderbolts contributor archaeologist Peter Mungo Jupp began his comprehensive analysis on the nature of comets including the Electric Universe perspective that comets are not 4.5 billion year old icy leftovers of the early solar system. Included in his analysis, Jupp presented outtakes of his interview with physicist Wal Thornhill recorded a few years ago discussing Thornhill's perspective on comet origins. In this episode, we begin with Thornhill explaining why the notion of comets as sublimating ice balls cannot explain most comet activity. The other thing is that if you have one of these objects, if it was just a ball of icy dust approaching the Sun, what would happen is that the ice would turn to a gas and it should just blow off like a kind of a wind. But that's not what we see. We see these very well-defined jets and we also see bright spots on the nucleus when they photograph the nucleus. And those bright spots are unexplained but in the electrical model, of course, that is the point where the arcs are coming from. Okay, yep. And that's from within the comet itself and is this the reason you get this huge tail of discharge on the comet, is that? It's one of the reasons why you get these well-collimated jets of very fine material because it's the sort of technique used in electrical sputtering, - the coating of astronomical mirrors and so on - Yeah where you just take atoms at a time off a cathode and then attract them towards a charged surface or you just have them floating in space, if you like, and then they land on the mirror, the glass surface, and form this coating of metal, just a few atoms thick. And so these atoms are shunted way out in space on the tail of the comet. Yes, and they're, and they're phosphorescing... ...well they are glowing because they're an electrical discharge, yeah. And the trajectory that they take is that which is also seen in the laboratory in an electrical discharge. This a parabolic curve. And there's plenty of evidence that this is the kind of thing we should expect. For instance, on Io, the so called volcanoes of Io, they too are cathode jets and they're very distinctive in that, unlike any volcano known on Earth, they deposit their material in a ring but this is characteristic of an electrical discharge because it sorts the material according to atomic or molecular weight... Okay... and it follows a distinct trajectory. Okay, now so we've got a little bit of the nature of a comet now which is basically a negatively charged body moving towards the Sun and something else happens then. It can either go past the Sun, it can split and explode, just like Shoemaker-Levy 9 did, when it impacted on, flash- impacted, I like to call it, on Jupiter, or it can actually hit the Sun. Now, what happens when it hits the Sun? Well this is, we've got photos or movies of this sort of thing and usually it seems... Yes, well, the electrical influence of a comet extends to the boundary of its coma and the coma of some comets, like the recent one of Hartley, was bigger than the Sun. So this tiny lump of rock has an electrical influence which extends over a vast volume. So they're incredibly powerful compared to their physical size? Absolutely, and so you can understand then that that intrusion of a charged body near a charged Sun can give rise to a sudden discharge from the Sun, in other words a coronal mass ejection. Okay, and that's on the opposite side of the Sun, at least in the films I've seen? Well, actually, you get effects occurring on opposite sides of the Sun almost simultaneously which is absolutely impossible if the Sun is powered internally. Yep. However, if the Sun is an electrical body, that is possible because the influences are coming from outside and they can be synchronized electrically. So this huge coronal thing you called it, as it flies towards the Sun, is exhibiting a massive impact in fact not impact, effect or discharge effect on the Sun... yes... and this coronal mass ejection is nearly as big as the Sun in some cases if not bigger. They're huge, yeah. So the puny little comet isn't quite so puny and carrying on this thing, when Shoemaker-Levy 9 split into 23 pieces as it headed towards Jupiter... On the first go-around Jupiter, it split up. Ah, that is when it split in 23 sections. And then it went into an orbit where they were able to predict that it would impact. Now, you think this split up is another electrical phenomenon? Sure, comets inexplicably split and fragment as they cross the ecliptic, usually, which is the current sheet of the Sun or when they're approaching the Sun when the voltage on the surface is changing rapidly. And the reason for that is that any body in the universe, of any considerable mass, will have an internal gravitational field, albeit maybe weak, but that gravitational field will offset all of the positively charged particles which are heavier, more massive, towards the center of the object and the electrons will then adopt elliptical orbits with the nucleus at a focus which is nearer the center. In other words, every atom in that object will be a tiny electric dipole. Okay. So every object of any considerable size in the universe will have the characteristics of an electret which is an object which maintains an electric field. That's an interesting term, electret. Electret, yeah. So, a comet, if sufficient charge is either removed or added to one of these bodies, it can cause internal discharges through the body of the comet and this is what I call earthquake, this is the harbinger of an earthquake. Now, on a small body like a comet, that earthquake is sufficient to shatter it, quite often. So this is the effect ... Yeah, this is the electrical effect, yeah. I mean, the same thing happens on earth, earthquakes are underground lightning. So that explains the fragmentation and the very fine particles that you see in the jets that are all just part of this whole electrical aspect of comets. So we have some good ideas as to how comets are created by ejection from say Jupiter, Saturn, etc. and we have some understanding about their electrical nature. But what about what we now know is it's rocky terrain, gone are the days of the farcical dusty snowball comet. If, for instance, we take comet P-69 as an example, there is no doubt its topography closely resembles that of many planets such as Mercury and Mars. It's complete with valleys, electrical erosion, sand fills and rocky outcrops. But comets, unlike major planets and most moons, are not spherical. We're not sure why but in fact a large percentage of imaged comets, and their similar sisters, asteroids, have nuclei that are double, even triple-lobed. Now, where have I seen this before? Many comets and asteroids have a remarkable similarity to the thunder egg seen on earth and if, as Wal Thornhill often says, electrical phenomena are scalable, we may have an example, on a much smaller scale, of a comet structure. Creation of similar tektites by C.J. Ransom in the Vemasat Laboratories, by electrical discharge, may hold the key to an understanding of both asteroids, comets and planets. Now, thunder egg rocks come in an incredible array. Look at these ones I'm about to show you. Some are hollow, some have crystalline interiors, some have gaseous inclusions and some are filled with liquid, star-shaped interiors, you name it. Depending on the layer the thunder eggs were found in, rapid progression from spherical to double- and triple-lobed rocks develop. I'll just read a little bit from Robert Colburn who wrote, if you like, the quintessential information on thunder eggs. This is his quote on the formation of thunder eggs, "On the bedrock, in contrast with the ashy clay, some eggs could be pried off whole. With more melded into doubles, triples or even clusters, most broke apart revealing a hollow top consisting of a thin layer of chalcedony coating the walls of the egg's interior. Horizontally banded, waterline opal is contained within the thin concentric layer and occupying from 1/4 to 1/2 of the interior at the bottom with the tops being flat floors, some with chalky surfaces that can be scraped with the finger nail. Perhaps we can get closer to understanding thunder eggs by approaching them as gas cavities filled with water-based minerals like those of amygdules, an idea fairly well accepted by most geologists. An amygdule is a mineral-filled gas cavity found in basalt and endocyte lava. So let's begin with a question, how homogeneous is the earth and for that matter comets and meteors? Is it molded within by strict circular boundaries, or is it perhaps, like the internals of this classic thunderegg with a 3d star-shaped interior? Plasma pioneers such as C.J. Ransom, remember, recreated spherical Martian rock blueberries in the lab with electrical discharge techniques. Were thundereggs created by similar measures? And if electrical effects are scalable, could a large Earth body perhaps replicate a thunderegg formation with its gaseous enclosures and spiky outreaches that may, perhaps, resemble the jets of a comet. Now, let's take this a little further. Thomas Gold, in his book 'The Deep Hot Biosphere', makes a strong case for the intervention of gas upwelling as a powerful but neglected process in the workings of large hydrocarbon deposits, either gaseous, liquid or solid from deep within our own Earth. But perhaps even Gold failed to realize the effects of electrical telluric currents swayed by cosmic effects as the primal cause of the chaotic meandering of gases and liquids within charged bodies. Were they the agent that caused cometary instabilities? As Wal Thornhill has always pointed out, the planets, comets and asteroids are electrets or charged bodies revolving in a constantly changing cosmic electromagnetic environment. They thus react with other charged bodies, working towards electrical equilibrium. Thus our big question: Could common interiors also possess hydrocarbon enclosures; the kerogens, oil, coal etc.? Nicolas Biver of the Paris Observatory, France, lead author of a paper on the discovery published october 23rd, in Science Advances, found that Comet Lovejoy was releasing as much alcohol as at least 500 bottles of wine every second during its peak activity. The team found 21 different organic molecules in gas from the comet including ethyl alcohol and glycol aldehyde, a simple sugar. Further in July, the European Space Agency reported that the Philae Lander from its Rosetta spacecraft, in orbit around comet 67P, detected 16 organic compounds as it descended toward, and then bounced across the comet's surface. According to the agency, some of the compounds detected play key roles in the creation of amino acids, nucleobases and sugars from simple building block molecules. So where does this all lead us? We certainly learned the comet is an electrical phenomenon. We've learned that it's not a dusty snowball, it's solid. It moves in elliptical orbits of various combinations but most important of all, I believe the next comet revelation will be the fact that it sustains the molecules of life. The carbohydrates, the hydrocarbons, the kerogens, coal, oil, methane gases contained within the body of the comet. These are common fundamentals of the solar system. Perhaps we've seen a traveling Z-pinch creating all the molecules necessary for life and the fundamentals of this solar system. 
December 2010 Russian astronomer Leonid Elenin announces the discovery of a new comet roughly 400 million miles from Earth calculations show that the comet moving on a highly eccentric orbit will intersect the orbit of the earth based on the size of its coma most astronomers viewed the comet as typical and unexceptional suggesting a body two or three miles wide but the projected earth-crossing orbits sparked an outburst of internet rumors and doomsday predictions most remarkable with the suggestions that the comet was a rogue planet and claims that it would profoundly disturb the Earth causing earthquakes or a shifting of the poles and even the end of the world respected astronomers were dismayed how could such scientific illiteracy attract millions of viewers to Internet articles and videos experts reminded us of the trivial mass of a comet just two to three miles wide passing millions of miles of Earth as it turned out what actually happened to Elenin posed a profound mystery for common science in the summer of 2011 Elenin grew brighter than expected and astronomers began to anticipate a respectable show but the situation changed when a powerful coronal mass ejection erupted from the Sun on August 19th the CM II struck the comet Elenin the comet flared brightly appearing to disintegrate explosively while rapidly dimming before it was visually lost against the glare of the Sun on October 24th only days after the expected closest approach to earth Italian astronomers captured the remains of Ellen and on film an extremely faint and diffuse cloud of dust was all that could be seen how did the disintegration and virtual disappearance of Elenin occur the answer appears to lie in the role of charged particles in an electrical event popular astronomy imagines comets to be dirty chunks of ice moving through electrically neutral space but a growing number of electrical experts say that comet nuclei are negatively charged they say that a comet begins discharging electrically as it moves more deeply into the electric field of the positively charged Sun when the charged particles of a coronal mass ejection struck the comet Elenin the oppositely charged nucleus could not withstand the electrical stresses it disintegrated like an exploding capacitor Electrical theorists assure us that comets are not what we were taught in school no practical experiment ever demonstrated that a dirty chunk of ice would disintegrate explosively under gentle warming from the Sun one of the strongest challenges to astronomers assumptions occurred in December 2011 that was when the Comet Lovejoy plunged into the atmosphere of the Sun its fate seemed certain but to the amazement of astronomers the comet emerged in spectacular fashion it's pale undulating violently under electromagnetic forces then separating from the nucleus only to be reborn after the emergence of the nucleus from the Sun the explosive demise of comets cannot be due to solar heating in fact eruptions and comet disintegration have occurred and regions so remote from the Sun that warming is not even a factor we saw one of the most improbable flaring in the case of comet Halley a regular visitor to the inner solar system in 1991 five years after Halley's closest approach to the Sun it was well beyond the orbit of Uranus where temperatures hover around minus 330 degrees Fahrenheit it erupted producing a dust cloud a hundred and eighty thousand miles across if thermal stresses are excluded it seems that only one consideration remains shortly after the Hali outburst a few astronomers began to wonder could charged particles from the Sun be a factor at the time solar wind activity had peaked at a higher level than had been seen in decades then two astronomers observed that the charged particles of a powerful solar flare on January 31 would have likely reached halle around February 12 the date of the outburst the coincidence of the outburst with that arrival seemed too great to dismiss could electrical events be the key to comet outbursts and fragmentation to this day astronomers have no explanation for the sudden and spectacular brightening of Comet Holmes in 2007 it had been moving rapidly away from the Sun for about five months when its coma size suddenly grew by a factor of a million making it even larger than the Sun was it a coincidence that just two days before the Comets display there was a sharp spike in the output of the solar wind in the electrical view the sudden arrival of charged particles from the Sun will explain what otherwise would have no known cause electrical surges and capacitor breakdowns go together high-tech image processing later showed that the nucleus of homes had broken apart with many fragments contributing to its brightening confirming a general pattern comet's flare brightly when breaking apart in 1976 comet West brightened greatly in a series of outbursts perhaps a dozen or so then shocked astronomers by breaking into fragments warming by the Sun is not a reasonable explanation of such events when comet for tannin fragmented it in 1957 it was just inside the orbit of icy Saturn much the same occurred in the case of comet Biela Bamberg more than once comets have broken up at their greatest distances from the Sun well beyond the orbit of Neptune and when breakup occurs the fragments have separated and inexplicably high velocities mainstream theory has no explanation for the energies driving such events the progressive disintegration of the comet Schwartzman Bachmann three beginning in 1995 left astronomers grasping for answers a 150 million miles away it brightened spectacularly shining hundreds of times more brightly than expected then astronomers discovered that the comet had broken into at least four pieces then in 2006 the Hubble Space Telescope captured the spectacular disintegration of the comet in progress while it was still out beyond Earth's orbit it was then clear that the comet had broken into more than three dozen fragments as how sized chunks of a comet appeared to disintegrate completely some within the span of a single day remarkably similar to the fate of Elenin was the explosive demise of the comet linear in July 2000 like Elenin linear entered the inner solar system from its outermost regions on a highly eccentric orbit for the electrical theorists that means a maximum change in the electrical environment as it approached its perihelion some 70 million miles from the Sun it flared then rapidly disintegrated then came the announcement that the event produced an explosion of x-rays at the interface of the debris cloud and charged particles from the Sun intense interfacial energies of this sort up to the level of x-ray emissions can only be the signature of electric charge exchange the disintegration of Lennear provides a strong parallel to the story of Elenin the teardrop form of the flare and the relationship of the flare to disintegration are virtually identical all that was left of lennier was a cloud of dust the expected abundance of water was simply not there and what of element as reported by Leonid Elenin himself the expected water vapor was missing and so the mysteries of comets deepen and the most urgent need is to reconsider the nature of comets as a whole it's now clear that comet outbursts did not occur because of surface warming but charged particles exploding from the Sun are implicated in cometary outbursts insulating material around a charged body gives way under an electrical kick or spike the point is well illustrated an electric discharge at Stone Ridge engineering here blocks of acrylic are bombarded by high-energy electrons creating an internal cloud of charge but nothing spectacular happens until the blocks are tapped sharply with a metallic spike then charge is released through instantaneous breakdown and fracturing the Lightning pathways of the fractures frozen into acrylic the energies of electrical breakdown and fracturing of this sort will not just explain the flaring and disintegration of comets but the remarkable velocities at which the fragments separate it seems that anomalies are just too easily ignored or forgotten but recurring anomalies can be the door to discovery what better way to move science forward than to start with the forgotten question what is a common how are comets formed what holds the cometary coma in place against the force of the solar wind how're the long filamentary tails created and maintained in the extreme vacuum of space what force creates and confined the powerful collimated jets from the nucleus where is the water-ice of which all comets were supposed to be constituted if charged particles from the Sun are triggers for outbursts or disintegration of comets the behavior of these bodies has almost nothing to do with relative masses or surface temperatures and everything to do with the electric force above all else we must now ask what is the Comets place in the electric universe is it possible that one question could remove all of the anomalies that one answer could explain the flurry the fragmentation and the catastrophic demise of these cosmic intruders 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project at Thunderbolts.info. In a Space News episode, earlier this year, we reported on the mysterious sounds associated with electromagnetic phenomena in Earth's atmosphere. In addition to centuries-old accounts of strange noises, apparently connected to earthly auroras, we discussed the electro-static noises, reported by some witnesses, of spectacular meteors. Today, a new scientific study, published in the Geophysical Research Letters, argues that the sounds associated with some meteor sightings are the products of electrical activity. As reported by Science magazine, "As a meteor streaks through Earth's atmosphere, it ionizes the air around it, splitting it into heavy, positively charged ions and lighter, negatively charged electrons. The ions follow the meteor, whereas the electrons are deflected by Earth's magnetic field. That separation of positive and negative charges in the meteor's wake produces a large electric field that drives an electrical current." The authors state that the electric current launches radio waves which are then conducted through nearby objects producing audible sounds. This explanation brings mainstream scientists much closer to the Electric Universe interpretation. A key difference is that, according to Electric Universe proponents, any object that comes far from Earth will be differently charged and can discharge electrically when it enters the atmosphere. In the 2005 Thunderbolts Picture Of the Day article, The Peekskill Meteor, authors Michael Armstrong and Jim Payette suggest that not only the electrophonic sounds of meteors; but also their bright glare, flare-ups and disintegration, involve electrical discharge activity. They state, "One proposed explanation, with which the Electric Universe would agree, is that meteors (and spacecraft) trigger the formation of instabilities in plasma layers. The energy of the flickering and flaring, as well as of the low-frequency radiation, comes more from the ionospheric plasma than from the meteoroid. The meteors that we've come to think of as 'burning up in the atmosphere' may instead be the targets of mini- thunderbolts from the ionosphere." For many decades, institutional science has imagined that spectacular meteor explosions occur when fast-moving bolides encounter extreme pressure, heat and chemical reactions when passing through Earth's upper atmosphere. But this interpretation has left many unresolved mysteries. In fact, the most renowned of meteor explosions, in modern times, leaves many facts that beg for a new interpretation. In 1908, in a remote region of Central Siberia, a blue-white fireball, which some described as brighter than the sun, exploded with the force of a 10 to 15 megaton hydrogen bomb. The explosion felled some 60 million trees across an area of 2,000 square kilometers. Yet some trees near the blast center were not burnt and a ring of burnt trees, circling the epicenter, was left standing. The thunderous clouds were accompanied by a shock wave that knocked people off their feet and broke windows hundreds of kilometers away. The explosion registered on seismic stations across Europe and Asia and as far away as Britain; Meteorologists registered fluctuations in atmospheric pressure. The resulting pulse of air pressure circled the earth twice and astronomers observed, for several nights afterwards, a glowing red haze in the upper atmosphere though they were not aware of the cause at the time. Curiously, as noted in the Australian Journal of Astronomy in 1993, the Sir Douglas Mawson expedition in Antarctica reported an extensive auroral display a few hours before the Tunguska event. Many historical accounts also exist of strange weather, including lightning and thunder, and even seismic activity, well before the devastating explosion. Despite occasional claims to the contrary, no impact crater for the intruding body has ever been found nor the remains of an impactor. Well, some have occasionally claimed to have discovered Tunguska meteorite fragments. Nevertheless, Tunguska remains officially classified as the largest impact event ever recorded on earth. In the Electric Universe theory, the energy released from an intruding; comet, asteroid or meteor; is not limited by its mass and kinetic energy but also the electrical energy due to its charge differential with Earth. This stored electrical energy also explains the astonishing effects of the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9's explosion as it approached Jupiter; including the completely unexpected dramatic brightening of the gas giant's radiation belts. Similar effects were seen on Mars when the close passage of the comet Siding Spring "blew away part of Mars' upper atmosphere." Calculations of the mass and size of the Tunguska bolide based solely on mechanical considerations cannot be accurate. These principles were more recently demonstrated in 2013, when a meteor exploded in the sky over the Urals region in Russia. Thousands of homes and buildings were damaged and more than 1,400 were injured by an explosion that produced as much energy as two dozen Hiroshima-sized atomic bombs. The object is said to be the largest to have "struck the earth since Tunguska." It's important to note that, based on infrasound data from around the world, NASA scientists stated that the meteorite had to be about 1,000 times larger than they originally thought, based on the object's visual trail. As Wal Thornhill explains in a 2003 article; In the study of meteors, a key element that institutional science has long overlooked is, "The connection between ionized meteor trails and electrical discharge activity in the ionosphere. The meteor trail acts as a giant lightning rod that connects the conducting ionosphere to the upper atmosphere. If the earth is an electrical body in an electrical solar system, it is the equivalent of a temporary short-circuit of a giant capacitor. The current flowing along the meteor trail gives rise to the unexplained brilliance and long-lasting glows of some meteors. It causes them to disintegrate like an exploding capacitor, high in the atmosphere. The Tunguska explosion was probably the most noteworthy example of the effect." Increasingly today, scientists are proposing electrical processes as the answers to long-standing mysteries on comets, asteroids and meteors; revealing a slow, yet inevitable, recognition of our electric universe.

[Music] In the early 1960s, radio astronomy  was still in its infancy. Still, it revealed the marvels of the universe in ways no one could have imagined. When they observed images of the  whole sky in radio, two giant mysterious structures stuck out like a sore thumb. These structures seemed to be polarized, meaning that light that passed through it from a distant source was being rotated, and this meant that there had to be a magnetic field present. In 1965 Tom Landecker wrote a paper and speculated that the polarized radio signals could arise from our view of the local arm of the Galaxy from inside it. When we look up at the sky, if we could see in radio, we would see a tunnel-like structure in just about every direction we look. The North Polar Spur and the Fan Region are by far the two brightest and most dramatic extended features in the large-scale radio-synchrotron sky. Since their original discovery and up until the present day, astronomers have questioned the origin of these two regions. Some argue that they are local features, and some argue that they are large-scale distant galactic scale features. Both of these features have high fractional polarization and coherent magnetic fields, revealing the synchrotron origins of this emission, and confirming the presence of relativistic cosmic ray electrons. Both are clearly seen in dust polarization and have a similar scale. Despite the similarities, very few studies have considered that they might have a common origin. In addition  to the North Polar Spur and the Fan Region, there are several other polarized loops and spurs in the large-scale galactic emissions. One idea is that all of these have a common origin in the wall of what they describe as a nearby bubble. The structures of these regions are also important in understanding what they are. They are long and narrow, and reminiscent of other long and narrow filamentary structures that seem to be  abundant throughout our Galaxy. These seem to form the bones or skeleton of the Galaxy many of these filaments seem to be strongly aligned with the galactic magnetic field and some filaments are shown to be aligned with the polarization features. Increasing evidence is suggesting that there is a strong connection between these two observations. In a new paper the author  makes the suggestion that both the North Polar Spur and the Fan Region  are actually connected together and form a giant structure which is part of the local arm of the Milky Way. Their suggestion to the origin remains firmly fixed in the old rhetoric: a large old supernova remnant, a portion of the local arm, or an expanding  shell, are examples of the origins. Although they outline a large amount  of evidence that the North Polar Spur is local, there is disagreement as to the exact distance, and several studies have pointed out what seems to be contradictory evidence that suggests a portion is local, at about 100 parsecs away, while other portions are more distant at 250 parsecs away. All these studies come  to a similar conclusion, that the high latitude portions are local, while the lower latitude portions are more distant. And this is hard to reconcile with the idea of the origin of the North Polar Spur that they have suggested. The Fan Regions refer to a variety of features in diffuse polarized radio emissions, extending several degrees North and somewhat South of the galactic  plane. It was originally called the Fan Region because its electric field vectors, as seen from the polarized radio emissions, appear to fan out and away from the galactic  plane. Similar to the North Polar Spur, it is highly polarized and extremely bright, but unlike the North Polar Spur, it is not nearly as obvious in radio, and is mostly unremarkable at other wavelengths. The idea that the author of this paper has, is that if you are an observer embedded in a uniform magnetic field aligned with a local arm, you would observe two bright patches of synchrotron emissions, filling a large fraction of the sky at approximately the positions of the North Polar Spur and the Fan Region. The idea is that there would be a series of filaments that run across the sky, which then create the shapes  we see. In their analysis, they calculate that one possible interpretation of this would be a series of arc filaments that lie behind, above, and below our solar system. Now, it may come as no surprise that we are finding these types of structures, but there are a number of points that are worth considering from this analysis. Firstly, where there is a magnetic field, there are inevitably moving charges. Could these structures that they identify, be the filaments that connect and power the stars? Both Don Scott and Wal Thornhill have proposed that filaments run along the arms of the Milky Way, back towards the center of the Galaxy. Are these confirmation of these ideas? One thing that is important to consider is that of scale. We know that filaments exist in many structures that have been observed, from molecular clouds, to the edges of what they call bubbles. The  most remarkable of these is probably the Local Chimney. At the center of this, is the Pleiades, and we sit on the edge of this vast structure. So, are these  filaments in any way connected to this? The author of the paper sees the structure as arcs that have an origin that would actually be in the next arm closest to the center of the Galaxy. This is actually in the opposite direction to the Local Chimney. The author does not really go into any details about what might have created this structure, but postulates it might be similar to the Local Chimney. The problem is that the mainstream origin story for the Local Chimney is a rather unbelievable affair that involves dark matter. Of course,  if this was part of a filament that runs along the arm of the Galaxy, then  we would not expect it to flow in a straight line, but we would expect it to undulate, forming arcs. Still, I question if what we see is all at  the same scale. From an EU perspective, it is a very appealing idea that we sit next to these giant filaments on either side of us. Does our knowledge of the local stars in any way help us to place some markers on what these structures might be? For  those who have seen my precession series, you will be familiar with Jim Weninger's concept that we are on a filament that is twisting around Arcturus, which in turn orbits around the Pleiades. If we examine Arcturus, we know that it is part of a group of stars that are moving together. Our speculation is  that they are all part of a filament that runs through these stars: a stellar filament. Our star is on a different filament which wraps around this one. If we jump back to the North Polar Spur, there is an image that may show you a different perspective. In the image, we can see on the right the North Polar Spur coming down the center of the image. Towards the top of this, we can see what is marked as Boötes. This is a constellation and the brightest star, that is Arcturus. So, could this line actually be the filament that Arcturus sits on? Jumping to a wider-view image of the stars I have  drawn on the three Spurs. The longer line is the North Polar Spur from the previous image. The red dots that are marked, are other known stars that  form part of the Arcturus star stream. So, is it possible that part, or maybe all of it, is part of this star stream? This could be the closest large filament to us, based on Jim’s concept. Closer to us, is the Sirius filament which we would be wrapped around. The distortions in the line may be caused by the interference from this closer filament, but at this stage this is just a guess. Further  analysis of the distances of the stars may help to identify if any of the parts of the structure, can be linked to the Arcturus star stream. It may  also be possible that we are seeing a distortion of the magnetic fields at many different levels, superimposed on top of each other. We are unlikely to see the effects of the filaments we reside on. The  most obvious would be those filaments closer. We must consider that there are many, many filaments, so the further away from us we get, the more  these would end up looking like random noise. If we consider that larger filaments are constructed of many smaller filaments, then from a large enough distance, these may appear as a single filament, when in fact they are composed of many smaller ones. Understanding what these structures in the sky are, is therefore not an easy task. In any case, the identification of these magnetic filaments once more confirms the idea that the arms of the Galaxy are filled with filaments that carry electric charges. [Music] 
Hello. I wanted to give a short tutorial on how I go about analyzing images. A friend of mine sent me a link to an image from the James Webb Space Telescope. As I was playing around with it, I thought this would be a good opportunity to give a little demo. OK, so enjoy. And here is the Webb page that my friend sent me. James Webb reveals complex galactic structures. Look at that, that is incredible. This is apparently a galaxy, just looking at the caption here, IC 5332. That's a catalog number for galaxies. So, I'm going to copy that, and I'm going to go to one of my go-to applications for looking at telescope data, which is this sky.esa.int. It combines telescope data across a very wide range of telescopes. Very easy, very good interface to use. Right now, we're looking at the Crab Nebula. When you launch it up, it'll [shows you things to choose from]. So that's the Crab Nebula. Look over here on the left. This is the layers you can put on top of each other. We're looking at an optical image, DSS2 which is the Digital Sky Survey number two, in color. But we can choose different telescopes. Look at that. All those choices; those are all optical telescopes. HST is Hubble. Let's see if there's a Hubble image of this. That might be good for later research. Good raw data. Okay, nothing that's beautiful from Hubble on this one. So, let's  go back where we were on digital Sky Survey. Let's add on a new row, say in the near infrared. Oh, that's nice. How about the mid infrared, “Oh look at that!.” OK, so we're going to do a near infrared and then I'm going to add also a new row of far infrared. OK. [excitement] You can change the opacity. So, I can blend the images. This is one of the great things about this tool, you can blend the images from different wavelengths and different telescopes. We're looking at one object here, the Crab Nebula. We're looking at it in different wavelengths captured by different telescopes, and we're  blending across the telescopes to give us a fuller view of this mysterious thing that we are looking at. OK. Got a little sidetrack there. Let's go to the IC 5332. That was what we started with here. So, I'm going to type in IC 5332. (Oops, I got an editing problem here, it's going to say nothing there) ... And there is the galaxy that is the subject of this video - IC 5332, it's coming  up. An optical telescope Digital Sky Survey Cool, I'm just going to zoom out a little bit. (Just for  the heck of it, let's just see what else we got here. We can see this in near infrared, a little bit,  not much). There's different telescopes one can choose; not all telescopes have all the data on here. You're not guaranteed to find a picture of this in any other wavelength. I'm just showing that you can choose different wavelengths. Okay, so there's the object in question. You'll notice up here there's a couple of icons for Hubble and for James Webb. Hubble and James Webb have both made the effort to  put some of their specialty images, high quality images, into this tool. it's not the best integration, but it  certainly is worth using. So, I'm going to click on the James Webb version, since that's where this all  started. It knows that I'm looking at this part of the sky. It calls up the pictures that I want. Let's look at this one. Webb, I see, yeah that's it. That's the one, right? That's the one that we started with. There  it is. Now the blending, it's awkward with these James Webb and Hubble specialty images. You don't get to do everything you want. So, what I'm going to do, is take this image and put it into another tool, to do my own blending with it. I'm going to zoom in a bit, so that I can get rid of those boxes. There we go, and I'm going to zoom in - nice big image - and on the upper right hand here, take a screenshot and you can  download this image (I already did it), so I'm just going to say, you can download the image, save it to your computer and then I'm going to look at a the Hubble version of this. So, there's  the Hubble one. It's amazing, right? And then I can save the Hubble version of this, download that. Now I want to blend them. You can use Photoshop - I don't have photoshop on this computer - so they go to ’Online Image Editing Tool’. This one [Photopea] (I don't know how to pronounce it - ’photopia’?) I'm going to load up, one image. Say put Hubble first, IC 5332 Hubble Space Telescope. Open that. There it is! Oops. Just want to zoom in. There we go, and now I'm going to open up the James Webb, but I open it in place, so that they can be layers. So they can be on the same image, but just layers of the same image. So, open the James Webb. All right. so now you can see over here. Here's the layers. We have the Hubble and then we have the James  Webb beneath it - I'm just toggling the visibility here - of the top layer. Let me rename that. That is IC 5332 Hubble Space Telescope, so I can keep track here. When you blend... there's a lot of ways to blend, and the simplest is with ‘opacity’ or ‘fill’ for these images. They're basically the same option. So,  opacity - I'm going to toggle the opacity of the top layer, which is the Hubble Space Telescope. That's kind of  awkward. How it's blending out the blacks there. Let me try switching the order - see if it matters. Opacity, that's better. So, there was something weird going on there with having the one image on top versus the other. I don't know what it is, don't really care right now. I think it had something to do with how the zero pixel was being stored. Okay, back to the project. The top image is the James Webb. I'm going to toggle the opacity and you can see there's the Hubble, there's the James Webb. There's the Hubble, there's your James Webb. And the human visual system is very advanced, and it will start putting things together  for you, if you give it information and let it do its job. Wow! So, what I'm seeing - which I didn't even notice till now - is on the Hubble there are these dark areas. Wow! Didn't even notice those. Look at all those dark areas and what do you want to bet that those are exactly where the James Webb is bright. So, we got to choose some features and check it out. Like right around here, See this orange thing here. You see like an S-shaped ‘wiggle – wiggle’ dark lane. Let's see if that ‘wiggle – wiggle’ dark lane... Yeah, pretty much. Okay, it's not a hundred percent, but clearly, like up here, let's look up here. There's nothing in the James Webb there, it's a dark area with the James Webb. What does Hubble give us? Yep, that is a very clear image for the Hubble - it almost reminds me of the Nautilus shells, when you cut them, and they have the chambers in them. This reminds me  of that. That kind of segregation. So, segregation in the plasma world is... It's a very elaborate  complex thing. Plasma does it very well. You can see... There's these very well-defined boundaries. I'll zoom in on one of these boundaries here. Now. Oh, no back up. Hey, I want to zoom in. Well anyway. Those boundaries are a clear delineation of energy levels - a very sharp delineation of composition. So, whatever is along this thin line here, is a very different energy and composition than what's over here in this dark area. And that kind of segregation is everywhere in the plasma universe. It's everywhere in biology too, frankly. You know the body is segregated into ... The muscles are in bundles; the nerves have their own segregation; the nerves go on their own channels,  etc. Okay. Well, that was really it. I am done with the little demo. I'm just going to keep playing with this, and hope you enjoy it. Bye. [Music] 
[Music] Previous episodes of this story arc describe some historical revolutions and how people thought about the cosmos. Before the revolution became accepted, there was a time of growing doubt about the established ideas, along with the hardening of the inertia of belief in them. But there came a time when new observations and new ideas made the old assumptions and unquestioned world views, more of a nuisance than an aid for explanations. The old ideas couldn't explain the new observations without patching them and the patches became increasingly ad-hoc and ill-fitting. The limits of what was thought to be possible needed to be expanded, and that meant replacing the framework of the old way of thinking with a different worldview. It required a change in what was considered  to be reality. It required picking up the stick of knowledge by another end. We  seem to be in a similar condition today. Modern observations of events in space exceed the possibilities of accepted mechanisms of gravity-and-gas-thinking. But the emerging understanding of electrically active plasma does provide sufficiently expanded possibilities. One of them is the greater power available in plasma systems. In physics, power is the rate of change of energy. With mechanisms that provide  greater power, larger events can happen faster. To become familiar with them, and to develop them, we need to be playing with larger and faster thinking, or in other words: with power thinking. One distinguishing difference between gravity-and-gas-thinking, typified by  the Standard Model of cosmology, and electricity-and-plasma thinking, such as the Electric Universe model, is the matter of power. Plasma systems not only have more energy than gravity systems, they have more power. An excess of energy, beyond what would be required for an equilibrium condition, flows through them. Similar to the flow of electricity in a string of lights being greater than what's dissipated in an individual light. If conditions suddenly change, for example a short circuit, much more energy can appear in the system in an unexpectedly short time. For example an electric arc, such as high voltage switch-arcing. At a stellar scale, the result would be a flare or a nova. I mentioned previously that space age observations have revealed a Universe that is too energetic for its calculated mass. It's also too powerful. For example, the age of the Universe, as calculated  from a Doppler interpretation of galaxies’ redshifts is too short for the processes of gravity and gas to form its observed structure. Astronomers augmented those processes by imagining dark unobservable processes that must be there, because otherwise the theories  of gravity and gas are falsified. Electricity and plasma processes on  the other hand, can be many orders of magnitude more powerful than those of gravity  and gas. And they could aggregate matter over a much larger volume in a much shorter time. Furthermore, those processes are not only observable, but also can be investigated in a laboratory, empirical rather than imaginary. My primary interest in these essays however, is in the new thinking that these discoveries suggest. The implications of larger and faster for the cognitive framework or assumptions, underlying particular explanatory ideas, or theories. The present framework was established in the 19th and 20th centuries, before plasma was discovered. It assumed that change in the natural world was only by relatively weak mechanical mechanisms that worked gradually and uniformly. The new discoveries expand that framework to include more powerful electrical causes that can be sudden and  transient. Astronomical phenomena and plasma behavior have received the most attention, but other sciences and processes are also affected. For  example, conventional thinking in geology assumes that weak and slow processes created the formations we see: erosion, sedimentation, an occasional local earthquake or eruption, creeping continental plates. Millions of years are required for significant changes to occur. But an instability in the plasma dynamics of the Earth's sheath, conventionally called a magnetosphere, could trigger an electrical discharge to the surface or below. It might be triggered by an unusually large flare from the Sun. Flares of that power have been observed on other Sun-like stars. A powerful discharge would scar the surface with craters, canyons and mountains. A sufficiently powerful one could reshape and relocate continents and oceans in days, rather than in millions of  years. That would be impossible with gravity. Also, we have experienced the small disturbances in rotation that present- day flares have caused. When the flare strikes, rotation suddenly changes. After it passes, rotation gradually returns to its previous rate, as if the rotation were driven, like a motor, rather than being purely inertial. One with an order or two of magnitude greater energy and power, could suddenly and significantly change the rotation rate, and cause oceans to wash over continents: a global slosh. The resulting super tsunami would stir up the sediment that's distributed around the globe. As the slurry flowed back toward the basins, it would be sorted into strata of like composition and be cemented, perhaps electrically, into distorted layers of rock. Sedimentology experiments have shown that deposition in flowing sediment can lay down multiple strata in non- horizontal, and even twisted formations. The sediment is sorted as it's deposited extending the group of strata downstream diachronically. Time advances not perpendicularly to the strata, one stratum at a time, as assumed by conventional theories, but parallel with the strata, several strata together. A large flare, that disrupts the Earth's rotation fast enough, could produce the strata we see, in the positions we  see, without needing long times for horizontal deposition and tectonic warping. The effects would be larger than the Standard Model imagines - global instead of local, and faster, days instead of millions of years. Also, the electromagnetic fields in a large flare could alter atomic decay rates. Decay rates were once thought to be constants of nature, but they have been found to vary in resonance with several astronomical cycles. That means that they're related to their environment. Observations of terrella experiments and lightning strikes have indicated that atoms may be transmuted en masse and to other species by the plasma behavior in a discharge. A discharge that affects the entire globe would transmute elements in the debris around the globe. Those materials would then be sorted into like strata in the aftermath of a super tsunami, and radio dating would calculate their age erroneously past the disruptive event. The geological clocks could be reset globally, scrambling the conventional geological record. I've used the term ‘catastrophic’ to label such a disruptive event, but I have misgivings about that. Larger and faster in geology means sudden global change. But electricity and plasma ideas of sudden global change are distinctly different from past catastrophist ideas, even though much of the evidence, uninterpreted observations, is the same. With new ideas and a new theory, the facts, interpreted evidence, are different. The difference between evidence and facts was described in the first episode of this series, Playing with New Thinking. Perhaps the biggest difference is that many past catastrophist ideas assumed that the gods did it, divine catastrophism. They assumed the intervention of some supernatural mechanism that lies outside the scientific and naturalist criterion, that phenomena must be sensible, that is able to be sensed. They stepped beyond sensation and experimentation, into the magic land of must-be and there's nothing more we can do with it. Epistemically, and ironically, this is not unlike the role of dark matter and dark energy in astronomy today. It's a ghost  in the machine. Another difference is the anthropocentric baggage that catastrophism carries. In the past,  before uniformitarianism became the conventional presumption, such change was called catastrophic in relation to  human values, scale, and expectations. An event was catastrophic if it greatly disrupted human life. But an electricity and plasma catastrophic event is only a step up in energy and power above non-catastrophic events. A flare that browns out a power grid is disruptive, one that produces a sheath-to- ground discharge leaves a catastrophic crater. It would be better to have a term that only refers to the upper end of an energy or power scale and that does not evoke the anthropocentric connotations. Larger and faster changes the framework with which we understand our experiences of the  world. It changes our understanding of how the world works. The stories or theories we compose that make sense of selected ambiguous workings that make sense to us, with our particular and limited nerve arrangements and cognitive faculties. Stories that we tell a lot, especially if they help us invent and run gadgets and processes every day, become familiar. We tend to mistake familiar for ultimate truth. When we encounter an unfamiliar story, we notice the differences from the familiar one and dismiss the unfamiliar one as impossible. It becomes habitual. For  instance, conventional astronomers for decades, dismissed electrical ideas because they would say, you can't get charge separation in space. After charge separations were observed toward the end of the last century, they admitted that, sure there was electricity in space, but it didn't do anything! When the ambiguities of our observations break through the habits of the impossible, we have an opportunity  to step into what will seem like a new world with new thinking. An  Electric Universe suggests the possibility that present-day processes could be supplanted by orders of magnitude larger and faster ones. It suggests the possibility that geological formations could be created in  a day. It suggests the possibility that the ancient stories of worldwide  cataclysms, actually happened. The important question is not what happened, but what will we think, happened. [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info. New scientific reports may provide insights into catastrophic events that once occurred on the planet Mars. Scientists at an observatory in Northern Ireland have conducted analysis of nine asteroids that orbit Mars, called Trojans, and they've come to the conclusion that the asteroids are the remains of a former planet. The team discovered that the so-called Trojans appear to be composed of the same material including the mineral olivine which only forms at extremely high temperatures and is thought to be associated with planetary collisions. The team has concluded that the asteroids orbiting Mars are pieces of a former mini planet or planetesimal which was destroyed eons ago by collisions. Those who have followed The Thunderbolts Project may understand why neither mechanical collisions nor a hypothetical former planet are necessary to explain the asteroids formation. For decades, the chief principals of The Thunderbolts Project, Dave Talbott and Wal Thornhill, have proposed a very different history for Mars and all of the planets in the inner solar system. In ancient myth, Mars was identified as both the warrior hero and as his own weapon, the cosmic thunderbolt. Thornhill and Talbott state that Mars was devastated by electrical discharges in an epoch of planetary instability in the relatively recent past, perhaps several thousand years ago in prehistory. As "radical as a theory may seem" it explains and in fact continues to successfully predict countless discoveries that only prove puzzling to planetary scientists. More than six miles of crustal depth was mysteriously removed from the Martian northern hemisphere. Consider also the many millions of cubic kilometers excavated from Mars in the formation of the stupendous feature known as Valles Marineris. Material from Mars still occasionally strikes the earth in the form of mysterious meteorites. Indeed, the discovery of Martian meteorites was treated with great initial skepticism since astronomers could not envision the escaped material reaching the necessary velocities to bring the material to Earth. If electrical discharges did in fact devastate the Red Planet from pole to pole, both the, so called, Trojan asteroids and the presence of the mineral olivine are to be expected. No collisions with former planets are necessary. The mineral olivine presented a puzzle when it was discovered, completely unexpectedly, on a comet. Such was the case with the Stardust's next mission to the comet Wild 2 in 2004. NASA investigators were amazed to discover olivine, and other minerals that only form at super hot temperatures, and dust samples from a so-called "dirty snowball." As NASA curator Michael Zolensky said at the time, "That's a big surprise. People thought comets would just be cold stuff that formed out ... where things are very cold. It was kind of a shock to not just find one but several of these, which implies they are pretty common in the comet." In fact, in the Electric Universe hypothesis, comets, asteroids and meteoroids did not accrete billions of years ago in the solar system's infancy but they were in fact torn from planetary surfaces by electrical discharges. NASA scientists were also amazed to discover the mineral tridymite, on Mars, which only forms at extremely high temperatures and is thought to result from a kind of volcanism never suspected on Mars. As NASA geochemist Richard Morris said of the discovery, "It's really nifty, but we were shocked ... There is no evidence for plate tectonics on Mars. That's why it's such a surprise to find this tridymite." However, as noted in a recent Space News report, tridymite has been reported to form as a product of lightning in a roofing slate, as documented in the book The Data Of Geochemistry. In the feature-length documentary film, The Lightning Scarred Planet Mars, detailed analysis is given of countless geological features on Mars that find ideal analogs in laboratory experiments with electrical discharges. One such example is the towering Olympus Mons, a nearly 22 kilometer high, so-called, shield volcano and the tallest mountain of any planet in the solar system. As noted in the film, this shield volcano interpretation of Olympus Mons presents far more enigmas than answers. The defining feature of a shield volcano is a gentle extrusion of fluid or low viscosity lava. Shield volcanoes on Earth do not present a scarp whereas the scarp of Olympus Mons towers a nearly four miles high. A NASA report freely acknowledges, "The scarp is of unknown origin..." And... "The steep cliff around Olympus Mons is peculiar and not characteristic of terrestrial shield volcanoes." But perhaps most striking of all may be the blanket of incredibly fine filamentary ridges and ravines within the terrain of Olympus Mons. In fact, the continuing discovery of perplexing dendritic patterns on Mars is a key prediction of the Electrical Scarring hypothesis. New images taken by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter reveal precisely the kinds of features expected from electrical discharges. Consider this recently released image of the terrain within the 10-kilometer Zunil crater on Mars. Scientists insist that the crater was produced by an impact but they have no real explanation for the raised dendritic features associated with secondary craters within the crater. NASA's description of the image reads as follows, "Secondary craters form from rocks ejected at high speed from the primary crater, which then impact the ground at sufficiently high speed to make huge numbers of much smaller craters over a large region.... In this scene, however, the secondary crater ejecta has an unusual raised-relief appearance, like bas-relief sculpture." The best guess that NASA can offer is that the so-called impact crater has been mysteriously weathered over eons of time. The agency states, "One idea is that the region was covered with a layer of fine-grained materials like dust or pyroclastics about 1 to 2 meters thick when the Zunil impact occurred (about a million years ago), and the ejecta served to harden or otherwise protect the fine-grained layer from later erosion by the wind." But experimental research within the Electric Universe community provides far more promising possibilities. One such experiment, conducted by Billy Yelverton, produced raised dendritic ridges simply by applying intense vibrations to soil. Consider also this experiment, performed by YouTube user diveflyfish, subjecting aluminum foil to electrical discharge. Indeed we have called the Martian environment a "laboratory in space, ideal for testing the concepts of electric universe geology." It was well over a decade ago that physicist dr. C.J. Ransom of Vemasat laboratories was able to reproduce the mysterious, so-called, Martian blueberries by blasting quantities of hematite with an electric arc. Only one of many such pathways of investigation, as repeatedly outlined on this series as well as many dozens of The Picture Of the Day articles on Thunderbolts.info. Electrical discharges produce effects that could account for much of the consistently bizarre Martian geology. Space discovery today routinely provides surprising discoveries about the Martian environment. As human exploration brings Mars into ever finer focus, we confidently predict that the evidence will continue to mount for catastrophic events that left their indelible imprint on the Red Planet.

Thank you everybody, it's a real pleasure and honor and I echo Monte’s thanks to everybody that's involved in this project, including my co-authors here. So, before everyone falls asleep when we're talking about statistics or goes to get a coffee, I'll make this as exciting as possible. I get really excited to talk about this simply because I... Although many people think statistics is a very mundane dry subject it is really at the heart of true science. I do believe, when I hope to show here is a basic concepts of experimental design and how we are using it in SAFIRE to look at what various factors contribute to various responses. I do believe that design of experiments will be the future of science, statistical approach to design of experiments. So, before I get into though there is a very alarming trend that I've seen, that I want to talk about here. You will see that the US spending on space science and technology, as it has gone up, there is also a concomitant rise and very unfortunate suicides. Serious, is a direct correlation, you can see it's a very strong correlation, I mean, I figured that if we decreased our spending by about 20 billion we could end these unfortunate events, right? So, what does this really show us? This is an excellent website, by the way, if you've never seen it, spurious-correlations, right? It's very, very easy to draw a conclusion from spurious correlation. Correlation does not, don't know causation, right? and, me as a scientist, I'm guilty of that sometimes too. We see something, we see a trend just as Ben talked about earlier. He sees a trend and then falls apart. Well, that means that something might be there statistically, but maybe there's a missing factor and I'll explain by what I mean by factors and everything like that, very soon here. So, an introduction to terminology, this is what I'll be talking about in the slides I'll just race through this to the final outline here. And what the following mean for SAFIRE and experimentation in general really. Okay Statistical and efficiency, statistical and experimental efficiency I wanna say no more "one factor at the time", OFAT is used in the statistical rounds to describe how... actually many of us are trained as scientists and engineers. We very one thing, we look at the response, we write it down. We increase that one thing, we write down the response. Now, when we're all done with that maybe we change something else in the system and we do the same thing. But really what you're doing is you're isolating your factors away from each other, you're not taking into account any interactions between those things that you're tweaking. That's "one factor at the time" experimentation. Now, people in the past have done that before there's nothing wrong with that sometimes you got establish your boundary conditions in your experiment. And that is, that is good. But when you get down to really discerning what causes what, you cannot use this approach. And 2nd order interactions, that's a red font there, I'll explain more what they are and why we must detect them. And really, why do we want to use the design of experiments approach? Means less experiments and better statistical results, it's really that simple. And I'll share some results, future considerations that we're encountering in SAFIRE in just the way to try and track things for those who are visual a green square in this presentation will denote a point that I'm trying to make for decreasing the number of runs by using, no longer using "one factor at the time", and I'll try tide that in. Whereas there are red star will denote a second order interaction, those items where, where two things might interact on a level that you might not be able to resolve if you were to do "one factor at a time". So, some factors and in response to the factor is a "knob setting", many of you might have heard variables in the experiment, for many variables in the experiment. Well that's a factor, okay? It's an independent variable controlled or uncontrolled in an experiment. I like to say it's innocent until proven guilty, in other words, if you have something happening in your observing that changes you gotta go into that experiment unbiased and see what factors influence that response and then you statistically prove that it's guilty. So, a response, though, is a result of the system responding to the factor(s) settings. It must be measurable with understood deviation. A response can also be qualitative, a visual quality of a system. I like it, I don't like it, advertising companies are very good at that. So, this is a fun video. You can turn off the sound, there is really nothing to hear, but... Until the factors and responses here, right? This is great, I can't wait to do this for my six-year-old. I'm not going to build my own, though, I'm a chemist not a... and we won't be doing this in SAFIRE either, so... Because most of us don't have any hair. So, what are the factors? voltage and van der Graaf Generator, right? If you really want to get detailed, the materials of construction, if that was a dielectric on the surface of that sphere it definitely wouldn't work as well if at all. And also maybe the person receiving that charge, what happens if they have shorter, different type hair, really short curly hair is gonna work the same way? What kind of response are you looking for? Do you wanna hurt the person or do you want them to laugh, right? So, this is an example of a factors and responses of how it's important to understand your system, okay? What I will say is that... the design of experiments is not merely coming up with an experimental plan, okay? It is a statistical method of experimental observation, statistics are use to characterize results, it entails randomizing test when possible. Now, not always can, you can always randomized tests understandable we encountered that a lot in SAFIRE due to experimental constraints, but you want to try, because that make sure that no time factors are involved. It assure the test is repeatable, you want to come back the next day or maybe in another lab and do it. You want to ensure that, and I'll talk about this more a little bit. It incorporate an orthogonal or symmetrical approach to experimentation, that's really the inherent power in design of experiment. And ensures discernment of higher order interactions between factors, I mentioned that before, I get into it a little bit more. So, as an experimentalist, you still wanna establish the boundary conditions, especially working in the unknown, that's fine. But when it gets to the point where you have to understand what's involved with those experiments you truly do need design of experiments. So, as an experimentalist, I will correct you, if you claim to be using design of experiments and you're not. So, I've been that guy at a dinner party and I'll be that guy at the dinner party, so... Let's talk about something we're all familiar with, baking. Other factors involved in bread? Any one? Yeast, yes. Salt, sugar, what else? Rise time, temperature, water and big temperature, right? There's probably a few other factors I missing here. Right now that's 9 factors, OK? And may be a response here would be the rise in the taste and texture, crust thickness of the bread, stuff you can measure, may be a qualitative assessment of how how good it tastes. Now, brad is a pretty everyday thing that we all pretty much know how to make, right? But what if you're working with a new grain, a new lot of flowers, the different particle size there's lots of factors to take into account here. And if you really did want to look at 9 factors in a baking experiment, if you, even if you use a factorial approach which means a design of experiments approach if you wanna resolve all the interactions between flour and yeast and rise time and all that, you need 512 experiments. So, 512 experiments and then not to mention you also have these factors of noise you don't know if these are gonna play a role in your experiment, maybe your oven goes dead after 250 experiments and get a new oven, right? So, that's just gonna give you a general idea, luckily people have worked out the bread experiment and we pretty well every day, we're thankful for that. So, let's get into the, now that we have an idea of how complex bread is we'll get into the much simpler system of the Sun, right? It's pretty easy, those gravitational compression, Monte talked about this earlier, there's hot turbulent gases coming up from the fusion that's created by the gravitational collapse of the mass from that gradual accretion disk in it compresses down. The energy was released in some ways, there's some debate of how that energy gets released to the surface and eventually reaches us here on the Earth. There's a lot of responses we can look at in the system. One of them being fusion, I know there's been a lot of talk about that. Fusion, is it a factor or response in this model? Is it a response to the gravitational collapse, and fusion is initiated, and then it drives the Sun, and they're going to run out of energy? As it, is it a factor for those other responses that happened on the surface. There's also the electric Sun model that has been talked about extensively, charged plasma affecting matter at a different potential. And in this case we have an anode Sun, and these are from a Wal Thornhill e-book by the way, haven't put the credits on there Wal, I'm sorry. And there's a steady drift of electrons towards the Sun. Probably emanating from a dense plasma sheet or some sort of double layer. So, which of these two models can we test in a lab? Which of these models that are listed in the EU row, charge differential affecting matter of a different charge differential acting on the material and the responses there, if fusion is happening, we should see if some response to that. In addition to all these other things, these responses should be consistent with the EU model just like was said in Ben's film. And the factors in a traditional model we have to weigh against as well. Fusion, I think, could be both the factor and the response in that. So, that makes it a very hard system to test statistically if we don't know which is a factor and which is a response. So, let's get into some experimentation. We have a particular knob in our system and this is gonna walk through this just because I want to show you how that feeds into actual design of experiments. When you have a knob in a system you have a continuous set of factors, we call these 'continuous factors', you can dial that knob to whatever number you want, right? So, some experimentation is needed to understand what your limits are, but let's say we can dial this knob to whatever level we want, we measure response this is a graph of a line Y = mx + b So, 'm' being the slope of this line, 'Y' is the value of a response, the hardness of the bread crusts, the taste of the creek bed plus whatever may be and 'x' is the setting of our knob, say on our oven. So, the hypothetical response 'Y' is a measurement of the oven temperature, or the voltage drop or the plasma intensity, whatever it may be. Now, in this hypothetical example, I kind of scattered ± 0.1, across that whole response. and it might not always be a straight line in real life, oftentimes is a curve and we have to apply certain mathematics but for the purpose of this illustration I just want to illustrate a straight line, right? So, there are two ways to approach experimentation. You could set there, you could dial the knob 10 times and look at the response. 10 times along that line, right? One factor at a time. Could also do possibly 3 settings. May be replicated, you can build in some replication to your system, which is important, right? So, maybe dial to 1 we take a few readings, we dial to 7 we take a few readings, we dial to the midpoint of 4 we take a few readings, then we go back to the other set points. So, you can see here that we have pretty much the same data from our 3 level test and we have a set of data from our 10 level test. Now, there's a difference between these, when you're in the real world and in the lab. We could do this one of two ways we can set the knob 10 different times and do 10 different readings or we can do it a few times and utilize the average and the deviation in those responses. Right? So, we can do our 10 levels and I can say, Jano here are 10 levels, and Jano being the good guy that he is he'll carry out the experiments He doesn't crumble, right, he doesn't crumble and he will continue to do those experiments but then I gotta go to Michael and I gotta say Michael here are 10 spectra that we have we got a look at these peak ratios these full with half max's and says; 'Man we don't have grad students at least not yet, not yet'. but in actuality if you really think about this can be very overwhelming and this is what we're up against right now is with NASA data. If you do find some NASA data and you've dug into the data from NASA it is often very, very difficult to get through. Some of the data is very easy to find, but it's harder to manipulate into a usable form and it's even harder to data mine, okay? And is an example of that, will have gobs and gobs of data may be 10 data points which we then gotta translate into a response that we can analyze and our scientific method. So, Michael illustrate on this, illustrate that on this slide and that's why grad students are very valuable and just a side note I think there's a great future for the young folks or even all other folks who are looking in data mining and data analytics that's really the secret of Science in the future with these gobs and gobs of data coming out us from the right and the left we really need people who know how to dig into data, filter it out and get good, good statistics from it. So, this is where we introduce a little bit of course fog analogy in some mystery into the design now we're just gonna run three different settings, right? a lot easier to just let it run a few times at each setting Jano is much happier with that your three levels replicate them a few times, okay right? That's what Canadians say. And then, I give that to Michael, but I say, hey, here respects from 10 runs but we can take the variance in the averages and use them. Michael's thumbs up there, he can go home in Canada the next day. Not very much difference between the data again this is just a very hypothetical experiment, right? But on the left we see that 10 data points on the right we see the 10 data points at three different levels. So, which looks easier to do? So, what we're looking to do is furthermore utilize this in terms of experiment has cushioned and data acquisition and storage. It's much easier to store say the average and variance of a few data runs rather than a full suite at different levels, okay? Additionally, for those who are more data minded I apologize for a small fun here which is more symmetrical, I introduced the concept of orthogonality here, orthogonality is necessary in the design of experiments to do statistics. There even though it's evenly spaced there truly is North orthogonality associated with that 10 point data design on the left and on the right we do have orthogonality there are 3 data points that can be symmetrical with another 3 data points from another factor and then we let the math and statistics work out the relationships between the factors. And if you do look, I don't know if you can see but I'll go into the statistics one more little bit later on our SAFIRE experiment but the statistics are the same, okay? For the most part there they are the same. So, I want to emphasize here the efficiency of statistical experimental design. This chart was made by Louis Volante, he really pioneered the statistical experiments at Kodak back in the heyday of photography, of print photography and it really shows the advantages of using a design of experiments approach in the first column we have a number of factors in your experiment. So, 3 factors time temperature pressure, right? in the center of 4 factors will be one more factor 5. So, these will be selections of a number of factors which were gonna look at. The efficiency all be on the right there is actually a measure of variance in the design. And what that means? It's statistical efficiency, it's how well the designers set up in space, right? Data points take up a certain type of space. So, it's a measure of inherent variants before you even doing experiments you can do that with statistics, you can measure the variants associated with the design. So, to have the same statistical efficiency this one factor that I'm type runs you need a minimum of 16 runs compared to 8 runs in a full factorial DOE. you need double the amount of runs to obtain the same statistics, really, as you would using a design of experiments approach. And something to take away here full factorial DOEs. They are not the best DOEs to use anyway, but they lend insight into interactions that you wouldn't get from 'one factor at a time' or you would do many runs. So, this is where the orthogonality and the symmetry really empowers the design of experiments approach. So, bring it back to the factors of bake time, here's where I can introduce the concept of 2nd order interactions. We have bake time, temperature rise time, etcetera, and to really resolve the second order interactions we need many more runs. Already told you 512 runs if we were to use a full factorial DOE. Maybe if we can decrease our number of factors, we can decrease the runs, we could do that, but we do need to resolve the interactions between certain things we know that between rise time to rise temperature there's a there's some sort of relationship there, right? You know when you put your rising bread next to the fireplace it will rise will quickly and then collapse, whereas you put in a nice medium warm corner all drives nice and slowly. There is a relationship there, likewise between yeast and sugar, there is a relationship there, the yeast need certain amount of sugar. And finally between yeast and a liquid, you don't want to overdo the liquid in your system. Those are examples of 2nd order interactions and to resolve them mathematically it requires at least 2 to 3 runs between those factors in addition to those factors being related to others. So, how are we doing that in real life if you're so inclined to read the statistics paper. I'm a chemist, I'm not statistics person and for me as a challenge get through the paper but it but it really is enlightening because there is a level to resolve second there's a way to resolve 2nd order interactions with a proper kind of design of experiments this more recently has been a leap forward for design of experiments in screenings sense, in other words, when we wanna, when we first establish our boundary conditions we want to know what interactions are there between the factors and really this, what they call Definitive Screening Design when you have second-order interactions and effects which we know are there from plasma, it's a very nonlinear response, this is a very valuable approach. Really only when you have more than 6 factors otherwise there are other approaches. But going back to our dial, if you think about it now, if we just code are settings between negative 1 0 and one being low medium and high those can be any numbers, right, for each factor setting, but just for the ease of picturing this, yes 6 dials, you can dial them in at 6 different methods, 6 different ways. Try to think of that experimental matrix in your head without the use of computers, is nearly impossible. And so, what you're seeing on the right there is this definitive screening design which will resolve the second order interactions between these factors. So, how a design of experiments would work is that after much discussion we would sit down and we decide on the runs that we're going to do the limits on each factor we devise the design of experiments So, the Xᵢˏ₁ factor here, these would be the settings for each run for the Xᵢˏ₂ factor, pressure, time, whatever may be, here, Xᵢˏ₃ factor voltage, etc, etc. So, these are 6 factors and these are each experimental run and we get the response out that were looking for. Whether be a certain peak height, full with half max, mass loss on the anode, etc. There's a specific response for each experiment and you can have as many responses as you want, okay? But notice, I circled the zeros because of the midpoints, right? You notice the symmetry in this design? You see I can fold it over, diagonally? So, you can see that this -1, -1, -1, -1 is down here -1, -1, -1, -1. So, that's the symmetry I was talking about orthogonality that really empowers DOE. Now, we only have to run 13 runs to resolve second order interactions that are not confused with any main order affects. I'll get into more detail what those main order effects are. So, it's a very powerful approach, this approach was used by a company recently to find a catalyst for CO₂ sequestration and they won a prize for the DOE using it. It's got to cut off a little bit but this is just a to note the symmetry of the design space, right? If you look at the design space, all the designs bases covered. If it wasn't symmetrical you'd see gaps in those those dots. And what this axis is? This is actually X₂, X₃, X₄, X₅ and X₆ these are the factors and these are also factor settings. So, just the way to visualize what the factory settings are associated with each experiment and to make sure you have your design space covered it efficiently. So, again 13 runs we can get that design of experiments done and then you follow up on that once you figure out your second order actions you do further experiments to increase your response. In a typical deal we factorial you would need to do 64 runs 'one factor at time', don't even try to calculate it. When we were first... When we first assembled SAFIRE I took the approach of using screening designs. We had a number of factors, we didn't have enough factors to utilize a definitive screens design, so I just used to be a factorial designs. You'll notice again the symmetry were symmetry comes into play here. We typically had 4 to 6 factors in each experiment, in this case we're three dimensional creatures, so we can envision three dimensions at once. We have pressure, voltage and current as our settings, we also had type of gas, the type of anode and type of cathode in some experiments, and we had a voltmeter that was across... ...between the cathode anode across their to measure the voltage drop. Okay, and we also had other responses that we are monitoring, but this is just to give you an example of design of experiments. You can see that each of these data points is a unique data point and this is why I also design of experiments builds and reproducibility each of those data points actually augments that orthogonal approach to help us reproduce these settings. Is also center point here and what that center point does is it says; okay, I think there is curvature between these factors. It doesn't give you an exact measurement of that curvature it just says hey you look between these two factors in further detail. Okay, so that's 9 data points in a single experimental run, in a very dynamic system and money give you a teaser of this graphic I try to do this in as many runs as possible to kind of monitor what the plasma is doing. As I said before, think about this in your experiment if you run experiments especially the qualitative experiments were you looking say a creators or trying to rate different responses that are a qualitative in nature at all times we should try and make them quantitative, right? Maybe the number of Tufts that come into existence, etcetera, but in some way at least rate them. Yes, I like it, no I don't, scale of 1 to 5 or 1 to 4, so you're not sitting there on the fence. There are ways to do that for qualitative responses that goes along way for quantifying and optimizing your process later on. Again I said the advertising companies do very well with their there are many, many surveys that they perform to figure out the best factors involved in an advertising. Qualitatively, as we're going into some numbers here, so... this is not really a graph of a response, is a graph of the model. So, you hear models talked about in the literature and in the press a lot. These models are derived from real data, they're not derived from a computer, okay? The data that's going in still controlled by us, we saw how to choose the right statistical aspects, but this voltages on Y-axis and we have our model that we've built from our various terms on the X-axis. This model is composed of voltage, of the pressure, of the current, etc how many factors are involved with your response. And what it's doing is, it's plotting a line that if it's perfect and a perfect world, you'd perfect model goes to zero axis, here, or the 0 point here in the origin and you would have no scattered, but we're dealing with real data, so you have scatter. And it's measuring the ability of the model to predict the response at a certain setting. So, once we have this, in this design space, I know that I can go to a setting here I can back out those settings in real life, I can dial that in and I'm going to predict a certain voltage drop. And statistics here are telling me that, you know what? That's an R squared of 98, that's pretty good 98%. You have a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of about 23, plus or minus 23 volts in this response, that is unaccounted for by the model. Doesn't mean that error, it means it's just unknown, the models telling me that I have 23 volts that you're just gonna have to deal with, that I can't tell you what it is. I don't know why it's plus or minus, right? Most importantly you see the P value is less than .0001 And that value needs to be below .05 for the model to be valid, in other words, it deviates from the norm significantly, so less them .005, so... So, let's dig it in a little further. Ben really struggle with me because he was searching for the other factors, how can you tell what other factors contribute to response? And really that's what science is about. When we're dealing with the response we want to know what factors are contributing to that. And through statistical design of experiments we can do that, okay? So again, I already mentioned that the model matches real data, because of predictable result. There's a very small variance in the model, as you can see in the line there. So, small variances good, you're not dealing with very large confidence intervals here, which means you can predict things very well and the deviation from the norm is significant it's a valid model, we can use it for engineering to dial in further. So, let's get the crowd involved with parameter estimates. So, every one wants to know what causes something to happen and when you're dealing with systems with more than one factor which pretty much I believe every physical system is, you always have that question. It's an unfortunate series of events that, I read many technical papers on a weekly basis and I would say maybe, maybe, 5% of all these papers utilize a statistical design of experiments approach. So, that means a building models without having proper control of all the factors going into that model. It's not taught very much in schools, it's starting to catch on I know the US military schools are are doing it and they're leading the charge in that. But really what this tells us, if everyone can look there at the highlighted region. For those of you who can see the font, what's the biggest number? It can be negative or positive. Pressure, right? It's pressure. It's not that hard to discern which of these effects is the most important in the response of voltage drop across in this experiment. Pressure is the main effect. What's interesting is that, the next effect is squared term of pressure, positive 107. So, right now, out of all this number which is about, you know, a little over 300 these parameter estimates, pressure is taking up nearly 2/3 of the model. In other words, that model that was there, that graph 2/3 of that response that it's predicting is due to pressure. Them what this is telling us also is a second-order interaction, that's the third largest term. Pressure time set voltage, what does that mean? All it's telling us is that in some way the voltage is interacting with the pressure. It's not giving us a physical model, it's not giving us a natural model that we can go from. Now, is the hard job of me sit down with Wal and understand what he's doing and for us to ask if this data makes sense, right? But a second order effect that is drawing down that voltage it's a negative number draws down the voltage, as pressure and voltage go higher. And finally, the main effect or the single factor here, Set voltage is about 47 and statistical speak it's about the same as the second order interaction. This is what design of experiments gives us, it gives us a series of factors and ratings associated with each factor. So, you know when you go back to your bread that the type of flower and the amount of water you added were the most important effects, they contribute 80% of the model, the rest 20% you could live with not worrying about. They often call that the 80% solution in Department of Defense, sometimes that's good enough. So, what does that do for us in terms of parameter response? Again, you know, 'one factor at a time' it's just not gonna be capable of this, the parameter estimates tell us what extent of each factor contributes to the overall response. What that really does for us, is it enables the mathematical model to be generated, it enables a response curve to be generated that give me, in just at real time, and we can understand these effects. So, we can see that at low pressure and low voltage settings we have predicted voltage drop about 393 and this is a setting about 400 volts maybe to .5 toor, actually to .6 toor. Now, as we move cursor over to... This is bilt from a predictive model to about 10 toor. What happens to the voltage drop? It drops, right? It's not a linear drop, it's definitively not linear and that's due to that 2nd order or that the higher power effect, that squared term of pressure. That's why you have this curvature associated with this response. So, we have a predicted voltage of 230. So, now I hope you see the power in this, but because we now have predictability in the whole region of design space for SAFIRE project. And most importantly, what we look for are regions of what we call, robustness. So, if you look at going from this graph to now sliding over the... ...sliding over the cursor. If you look at the slope of the Set voltage, flattens out, right? Where the implications of that? The implications of that are, I can now set my voltage wherever I want on this curve and the voltage drop is gonna remain at 257 volts. So, that's leading a little bit insight into what might be happening in the plasma again this is where we sit down and discuss what this means. And I interpreted this as just being a robust area where like Monty alluded to before, doesn't matter what kind of voltage you put in that voltage drop is gonna remain constant, something else might change, the appearance of the plasma might change, other aspects of the plasma might change, but the voltage drop is going to remain constant. And you can do this through a series of responses and build up yourself a few curves. So, DOEs are our way to decrease experimental runs while you maintain your statistical efficiency. You also look to make... ...to resolve your higher order interactions between your factors those are really the two main points to take away points that I like to put forth but also take home message that this methodology can be implemented into many areas of research and process optimization. Years ago I... the reason I came across design of experiments was I had to do training for my job and I went to a course talk by Doug Montgomery for the American Chemical Society and I came out that course because he taught the basics of design experience, I came out that course slap my head realizing how much time and energy that could have saved me in my grad school days. But these kind of things you learn and it's really come about more recently because of the the computer software that's really available to us. Because a computer software can handle these really complex arrays of design of experiments and help us layout the experiments and do them more efficiently and resolve the interactions between these factors. Shamelessly, I don't particularly have a favorite software, but this will be my ending slide. So, if you're interested feel free to check out any other software that you see on the screen with no particular favorite on my part, so... I earn my nickel and that's really all I have. Thank you. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info Of all the planets in the inner solar system perhaps none have proved more puzzling to scientists on Earth than Venus. On close examination we see that almost nothing about the planet makes sense from a conventional viewpoint. From the extraordinary movements of Venus's atmosphere at speeds up to 60 times faster than the planet's rotation to its extraordinary super bolts of lightning vastly more powerful and prolific than lightning on Earth to its super hot temperatures, well over 800º F hot enough at the planet's surface to melt lead, to the mysterious vortices seen wandering at the planet's poles to its vast stringy cometary tail stretching for millions of miles sometimes even touching the Earth's orbit. Countless unresolved mysteries on Venus demand entirely new theoretical pathways. A scientific paper published this year in Nature Astronomy only deepens the mysteries. A team analyzing data from the ESA's Venus Express mission have discovered a mystery in the darkness of Venus's nightside atmosphere. Of course, the planet's forementioned superfast winds have long been a puzzle for planetary scientists. Lead author astrophysicist Javier Peralta says of the enduring mystery, "We've spent decades studying the super-rotating winds by tracking how the upper clouds move on Venus's dayside - these are clearly visible in images acquired in ultraviolet light. However, our models of Venus remain unable to reproduce this super-rotation, which clearly indicates that we might be missing some pieces of this puzzle." Using the visible and infrared thermal imaging spectrometer or VIRTIS instrument, the team gained new insights into what happens to these winds on the planet's night side which remains hidden in darkness for hundreds of days. They found that Venus's tremendous baffling winds are even "more chaotic" on its night side than on its day side. They had expected just the opposite. As described on Sciencealert.com "Existing models of the atmosphere have predicted super-rotation largely occurred the same way on both Venus's day and night sides, but the new infrared perspective shows the whirling Venusian winds are actually more irregular and chaotic when hidden from the Sun." As seen in this image, the most puzzling feature to the scientists is the filamentary patterns seen in these clouds which are not seen on the planet's day side. The team characterizes the phenomena as essentially a type of gravity waves in this case what they refer to as stationary waves. One of the researchers states, "Stationary waves are probably what we'd call gravity waves - in other words, rising waves generated lower in Venus's atmosphere that appear not to move with the planet's rotation. These waves are concentrated over steep, mountainous areas of Venus; this suggests that the planet's topography is affecting what happens way up above in the clouds." However, the scientists are forced to acknowledge some of the problems with this theory. As the Sciencealert article states, "VIRTIS observed areas in Venus's southern hemisphere, which is generally low in elevation, but the team says gravity waves still influence the atmospheric movements - but strangely enough, there was no evidence of them in the lower cloud levels, up to 50 kilometers above the surface." Team member Ricardo Hueso states, "It's an unexpected result for sure, and we'll all need to revisit our models of Venus to explore its meaning." From the Electric Universe perspective, the striking filamentary clouds are simply due to electric currents in the Venusian ionosphere. It has long been known that the solar wind interacts directly with the ionosphere and of course filaments are the forms we see when electric currents travel through plasmas. The concentration of the filamentary clouds on high mountain tops is also a prediction of the electrical interpretation. For many years planetary scientists have sought to explain the bright mountaintops of Venus which reflect radar signals. Some scientists have proposed that the mountains are covered by a "heavy metal frost". However, in 2003 physicist Wal Thornhill wrote in an article on his website Holoscience.com "A much simpler answer is that diffuse electric discharge, known on Earth as 'St. Elmo's fire,' occurs preferentially at the higher altitudes of the mountains on Venus. In that thick atmosphere it forms a highly conductive dense plasma, which is a superb reflector of radar signals." The difference between the day and night side phenomena on Venus may be due to the comet- like electrical interaction feeding Birkeland currents into the planets so-called magnetotail. Magnetic turbulence on the night side can then be the effect driving the chaotic winds. In the Electric Universe view of Venus it is not a coincidence that Venus today shows such similarities to a comet. In fact, following the hypothesis that was first proposed by Immanuel Velikovsky in his book 'Worlds in Collision', it has always been the position of the chief principals of the Thunderbolts Project that Venus once appeared in the earthly sky as a terrifying comet. Before the earliest space probes imaged the surface of Venus a number of scientists, most notably Fred Whipple, the originator of the dirty snowball hypothesis, had predicted that Venus would be covered with oceans. Instead, of course, Venus is extraordinarily hot and dry and its surface is blanketed with networks of filamentary scars matching the form of so-called Lichtenberg patterns produced by electrical discharge. Today Venus has a much more direct electrical connection to the Sun than the earth and it is this relationship that holds the key to understanding its bizarre atmospheric and weather phenomena. As mentioned, the predictions of the Electric Universe for Venus are much different than those of standard planetary science. In 2005, physicist Wal Thornhill offered such a radical prediction in his analysis of the North Polar vortex on Venus. Professor Ross Taylor said of the vortexes discovery, "...the absence of viable theories which can be tested, or in this case any theory at all, leaves us uncomfortably in doubt as to our basic ability to understand even gross features of planetary atmospheric circulations." It was Thornhill's position that such vortices would inevitably be found at both poles of the planet though only the one at the North Pole had been observed at the time. He wrote, "We should expect to see evidence of the twisted-pair configuration at the poles of Venus, if the input current is sufficiently strong and this model is correct... The Venusian polar dipole shows the precise configuration and motion of Birkeland current pairs in plasma discharge experiments. That includes a surrounding spiral vortex." In 2006, scientists indeed found a similar vortex at the South Pole of Venus. As we see in these images, it appears stunningly similar to twin current filaments studied in laboratories on Earth. But as Thornhill noted, "...there was no reason, other than an appeal to symmetry, for scientists to expect a similar vortex at the South Pole of Venus." Thornhill explained that the mysterious polar vortices and Venus's super-fast winds share the same source, incoming electrical currents from the Sun. He wrote, "Venus Express science team members say they want to know how these vortices remain stable and where they get their energy. This goes to the heart of what drives the super-rotating upper atmosphere of Venus... Venus, as shown by its cometary plasmasphere, is still discharging strongly to the solar plasma. The enhanced infrared emissions seen from the polar dipole is due to the dissipation of electrical energy in the upper atmosphere of Venus. The polar dipole has a variable rotation rate and it varies the position of its axis of rotation with respect to that of the planet. It was observed to move 500 km from the Venusian pole in less than a day and return just as quickly. The variable nature of the electrical input to Venus via the Sun and the snaking about of the Birkeland currents explained both these characteristics." However, in 2005 Thornhill offered a similar outrageous prediction on the planet Saturn, that science discovery also confirmed. In his analysis of the warm polar vortex discovered at Saturn's South Pole Thornhill wrote, "The Electric Universe also predicts, experimentum crucis, that both poles should be hot, not one hot and the other cold." In 2008, the Cassini spacecraft confirmed the astonishing prediction, astonishing because the freezing cold North Pole had been deprived of sunlight for more than 12 years. The author of a paper on the discovery stated, "We didn't expect it to have a hot spot at the north." Electric currents from an electric Sun connect it to planets and (are) driving atmospheric and weather phenomena. How many enduring mysteries will be resolved when planetary scientists finally recognize these simple and logical concepts? 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info The essentialness of water to life is self-evident to all inhabitants of our planet. Wherever liquid water flows, life is possible, and thus cosmologists are on a never-ending quest to detect watery worlds similar to Earth. The human body is said to be composed of "mostly water" and of course water is vital for the body's functioning. Within the electric universe community, water’s electrical properties and their relationship to the structure of water, is a subject of great interest in growing research. At past Thunderbolts project meetings, Dr. Gerald Pollack has presented his thesis on structured water, and the apparent relationship between water’s electrical charge its inter-molecular structure and its surrounding environment. Pollack has proposed what he describes as "EZ water" an "Exclusion Zone" of water which has a negative charge. A new scientific paper may lend credence to these notions and if valid, could have ramifications reaching well beyond the earth and life sciences, affecting all of cosmology. In this episode physicist Eugene Bagashov introduces the controversial research to the Thunderbolts audience and begins outlining the important questions the paper may raise. I would like to discuss a recent paper published a few months ago in the World Journal of Applied Physics. To be honest, when I first read it, I was quite shocked as I believe its contents might have a wide range of highly important implications for physics, including astrophysics and also chemistry and biology, and maybe other branches of science as well. Now before I begin talking about the paper itself, I should note that the journal where this paper was published, is only a couple of years old, and it does not look very credible, at least to my eye. Of course, in general I am advocating for more academic freedom and certanly do not mean that this is a bad Journal just because it's new, but I've read the text of the paper carefully and there are a few hints here and there that might indicate (on) a certain lack of a review process. Just as an example, in the last section of the paper, the author provides very important results of a group of "scientists from Israel," but he never gives any actual reference to their work to verify his words. And it seems that the author performed this research alone, so in the end we're basically left to rely on his goodwill, if you like, and to believe that the experiments that he performed, were done properly and that his judgement about their implications is reasonable. So, in general I would advise a very careful and skeptical approach to the results reported in this paper, especially given its already mentioned potential importance. Well, since I've already stated my general concerns, from now on I'm going to proceed with the description of the results provided by the author, pretty much taken at face value. And after that I'll describe my own vision of the possible implications of these results, again implicitly supposing that they are genuine. The paper deals with the properties of charged water. So essentially, the author has been performing a series of different experiments, in comparing the behavior of uncharged versus positively or negatively charged water. Uncharged water was stored in closed aluminum containers and to charge it positively, the author was either treating it with gaseous oxygen, or filtering it through silica gel. The oxygen was supposed to absorb some of the electrons from the water and silica gel absorbs hydroxyl ions, thus leaving the water with excess positive charge. Negatively charged water was obtained by either treating the uncharged water with gaseous hydrogen or by filtering it through the activated carbon. The hydrogen was supposed to provide additional electrons to the water and carbon absorbs hydrogen ions from it. thus leaving the water with excess negative charge. By changing the intensity or duration of any of these procedures, the researcher was able to control the resulting electric potential of the water. Now let's take a look at the reported findings. The first result that the author reports is the significant change in ultraviolet absorption spectra of charged water. One can see that charged water absorbs much more UV light than uncharged one and the spectrum itself significantly depends on the sign of the charge. In particular, the positively charged water demonstrates a sharp peak with the maximum shifted into the shortwave area, and the negatively charged one demonstrates a flatter peak, shifted slightly into the longer wave area. It is interesting that the paper also contains UV absorption spectra of DNA solutions in positively and negatively charged water which also differ. The second result is a change in mechanical behavior of charged water, namely when it is flowing out of a narrow gap, the stream of positively charged water rotates counterclockwise and the stream of negatively charged water rotates clockwise. The author also mentions that the solutions of surface active substances demonstrate behavior similar to the positively charged water both in their UV absorption spectra and in flow dynamics. And the solutions of surface-inactive substances behave like negatively charged water. It looks like the solutions themselves are acquiring different charge, depending on the interaction of the dissolved substance with water. At least that is what the author suggests. The third result is a different behavior of solutions prepared with the use of water with different electric potential. In particular, the evaporation of solutions of salts leads to the formation of different crystal forms, depending on the charge of the water. One example is the evaporation of a positively charged solution which leads to the formation of large cubic crystals of mono-potassium phosphate, while the negatively charged water evaporates, leaving thin needle-like crystals of the same substance. The author also shows that the copper powder behaves differently in the water with positive and negative charge. In the negatively charged water it forms typical dendritic Lichtenberg patterns on the bottom of a container, while in positively charged water, it remains a bit more inert. The fourth result is a significant change in surface tension of charged water. The author shows that the negatively charged water has much lower surface tension than the positively charged one. I'll remind you that surface tension is the parameter that determines how hard it is to spread the liquid, so to speak. So liquids with high surface tension would tend to be more lumped as one might say, concentrating in isolated droplets and thus having a lower surface area, while liquids with low surface tension can be more easily spread and their droplets are more likely to join into a continuum. So the positively charged water, having a higher surface tension, tends to be more lumped, while the negatively charged water with lower surface tension, tends to be more spread. The author demonstrates this in a petri dish, where the negatively charged water covers its bottom completely, spreading over all of its area, while the positively charged water concentrates in isolated droplets. Another experiment to demonstrate this change in surface tension, is performed with starch powder. When it is deposited on top of the negatively charged water in the dish, it covers all of its surface in less than two seconds, and thus is able to remain afloat. But when it is deposited on top of the positively charged water it accumulates at the deposition site and quickly sinks because of that. The author also performs a pretty staggering experiment, where he shows that the steel needles, when placed on the surface of negatively charged water, sink immediately. But on the surface of positively charged water, they can remain afloat for up to 12 hours. He also mentions that the same effect can be achieved with uncharged water and charged needles. In this case, a negatively charged needle would sink and the positively charged needle would not, at least for some time. The fifth result is the change in the ability of water to hydrate polymers. In particular positively charged water hydrates polymers of biological origin faster than the negatively charged one. To demonstrate that, the author puts some starch powder in two bottles: one with positively charged water and the other with negatively charged water. After half an hour at room temperature, the starch swells in the bottle with positively charged water and does not swell in the bottle with negatively charged water. The author also notes that the bottles themselves were made of polymer, polyethylene in particular, and it seems that the positively charged water can penetrate through it easier than the negatively charged, or uncharged water, since he noted that the positively charged water was able to partially evaporate, even from a closed bottle. And the sixth result that the author describes, is the change in the freezing temperature of water, depending on its charge. Here he does not perform any experiments but describes some other people's results. Remember that note I made before about scientists from Israel. So it is well known that perfectly pure uncharged water can stay liquid up to very low temperatures something like -42 or even -48ºC, so called supercooled water. It does not turn into ice, because there are no centers of crystallization in it, which are usually represented by various impurities. So the ice crystals in pure water cannot find any starting point for their growth. The author adds to this that the impurities must always be charged, either initially or because of their interactions with water itself. So the lack of these charges inside the water volume seems to reduce its ability to crystallize, which means it might be fruitful to study the freezing of charged water in the first place. The researchers that the author mentions, were studying the freezing of water droplets deposited on surfaces with different electric charge, and they've supposedly found that the uncharged pure water froze at the temperature of -12.5ºC, while the negatively charged water froze at lower temperature of -18ºC, and positively charged water froze at the higher temperature of only -7ºC. The author even goes as far as to state that the charge might change the heat capacity and thermal conductivity of water. So, to sum up all these results, the paper states that the electric charge of water influences: 1) its ultraviolet absorption spectrum; 2) its mechanical behavior (namely the direction of rotation of the stream); 3) the behavior of water solutions; 4) its surface tension; 5) its interaction with polymers, namely the ability to hydrate them and penetrate through them; and 6) its freezing temperature. Overall, the author suggests that the charge of water actually changes its internal structure, which in its turn determines the observed differences. I'd like to note that, although I have certain doubts about some statements that have been made in this paper, the good thing about all of this is that it all can be quite easily experimentally verified or falsified, and I definitely hope to see more research in this area in the coming months or years. So even if the author is wrong we will probably know soon enough. In our next episode, Eugene will offer an extensive thought-provoking analysis on the far-reaching ramifications of this theoretical pathway, including its significance for manufacturing and industry, for biology, and for all of the space sciences, perhaps demanding entirely new attempts to understand our universe. 
It's rather tough, following two such accomplished story tellers. The story that I want to tell though is one of elegant simplicity. It was that, a title I suggested to David Talbott when I looked at the picture that was emerging from an understanding of gravity, which I spoke about last year, and as I worked on it I understood that the universe really is much simpler then anyone could have considered. But then, at the same time, there was something that occurred in Canada, a presentation which I watched with dismay, called the elegance or the simplicity of everything. I'll see if I can get this to.. it says the connection is lost.. Here we go. So The Elegant Simplicity of the Electric Universe. How come so many clever people can't see it? Only in the last few months that I've found out why. It's an understanding that's important for everyone, including all of you here. Today specialization is the enemy of science. It produces more complication than simplification because experts mislead each other with things, as Tom said: "they don't know they don't know." The result is a useless reflection in a shattered mirror. So, who am I to be speaking to you about the elegant simplicity of the universe? Looking back I can see how I got into this position, how I became a boundary writer of science, as the science editor of the Canberra times dubbed me some years ago. From the earliest age I was curious about how things worked, or read books and investigated things on my own. Other kids did the same so I didn't consider myself exceptionally clever. Looking back, it seems the event that separated me from my peers was being inspired by an extraordinary story of planetary chaos by Immanuel Velikovsky and his book "Worlds in Collision". This happened while I was in high school. So, I began to question many of the things I was being taught and when I got to university I think I was the only physics undergrad who used to haunt the Anthropology shelves at the library, checking to see whether Velikovsky had cherry-picked his sources or whether he had made a real case to be answered. And I came to the conclusion that he had made a very good case to be answered. So what had Velikovsky done? He'd thrown down a gauntlet to astronomers that they rejected by having his best-selling book burned. So, book burning didn't finish centuries ago. It happened last century. Velikovsky's heresy was to publish that electromagnetism played a dominant role in the solar system, particularly during periods of planetary chaos. Many years later and shortly before Velikovsky's passing, I visited him at his home in Princeton and discussed this issue about the electrical nature of gravity because this was perhaps the single most important thing that the astronomers threw at him. That his mechanism disobeyed Newton's laws. Once again this is the certainty that there's only this law, there's no what if.. There is some other aspect to the mechanism? So, it has taken me all of the intervening years since then, there's quite a few, to overcome the education I received as a student, to find the few true pioneers of science and to relate this to everyday experience. I firmly believe that the Electric Universe is simple and you could begin to teach it in primary school. It's an amazing and engrossing story which fires the imagination and the explanations relate to everyday experience. The Electric Universe is a cultural, as well as a scientific, revolution that has been millennia in coming. It allows us to understand, for the first time, the obsessive fear of the planetary gods and their doomsday weapon, the mighty Thunderbolt. The phenomenal thunderbolt of the planetary gods is the link between our human story and the science of the electric universe. Some of the renowned scientists of the past like Newton and Faraday, predicted that electricity is the secret to understanding gravity and therefore the universe. But in the early 20th century, following the madness of World War, we reverted to the ancient geometric religious mysticism of Pythagoras and Plato. In fact mathematicians were formerly called geometers. And wartime established a fire hose of government funding of science that hasn't ceased. It has had the unintended consequences of paralyzing progress within huge bureaucratic institutions and fostering censorship in the form of anonymous peer review which stalls even minor advances. Paradigm shifts come from individuals and are resisted vigorously by authorities. The wartime command to large groups of scientists to shut up and calculate has become, with the advent of computers, shut up and simulate! Simulations' pretty pictures are routinely used to persuade non-expert audiences. Science is now in show business producing CGI virtual reality entertainment on big screens. But computer models can only reflect back what you put in. As a scientist, one must attend to what lies beyond any model. Here is M74, a perfect example of elegant simplicity. It's called the perfect spiral galaxy. Cosmologists can't explain its formation or rotation without inventing weird stuff like dark matter and a central black hole. But adding arbitrary patches to a model to make it work on a computer screen is not simplifying and it's certainly not elegant. It's generally a sign that your model is incomplete or just plain wrong. You'll notice on the picture the strings of red spots in M74. They are star birth regions that are brought out in this image. I'll discuss this later because they confirm the Electric Universe. The definition of elegance for a scientific theory or solution to a problem is, well-designed, pleasingly ingenious and simple. Symmetry and balance are also often important. But assessments of ingenuity and simplicity are subjective, like an individual's response to modern art. Paul Gauguin wrote: "The history of modern art is also the history of the progressive loss of art's audience. Art has increasingly become the concern of the artist and the bafflement of the public." So where are the art critics of modern science when presented with a chalkboard covered in mathematical symbols, most of which are undefined in any real sense? Critics of this art of branded deniers, as if consensus constitutes a religious truth. Only a belief can be denied and if it's a consensus belief it ain't science as Michael Crichton said in one of these famous speeches. The late astronomer Halton Arp lamented that investigative journalism, or in other words art criticism, in science is dead. The Big Bang is the antithesis of elegance and simplicity with its random explosions and collisions and its multiplicity of forces and particles. Despite this, he is an authority who said publicly that everything is not just simple but astonishingly simple. Neil Turok, director of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Canada speaking on October the seventh last year.. The astonishing simplicity of everything, but that implies you know everything. But I will show you that there are many very basic things that experts don't know they don't know. Neil Turok defined simplicity: "Simplicity means concepts which unify. They bring together disparate ideas, disparate knowledge, make sense of them and simplify." I agree. But adding fudge factors like dark matter and dark energy is the antithesis of simplicity. What other disparate knowledge was canvassed? Certainly not Halton Arp's observational research that shows the universe is not expanding. Certainly not peer-reviewed plasma cosmology that explains it simply and predicts so much in cosmology. Simple concepts are those that explain as much as we possibly can with the least possible number of assumptions. And I agree, that's a good test. The problem is how little theoretical physics actually explains. Quantum physics has no explanation, gravity has no explanation and the two are incompatible. Theoretical physics, as it stands today, is very limited. But as British astrophysicist Mike Disney shows, the number of free parameters (assumptions) in the Big Bang exceeds the measurements. So consensus Big Bang cosmology fails this test at the starting gate. A recent massive supercomputer simulation produced the universe of galaxies that seems to match observations. Despite using concepts that are invalid. So what good are computer simulations? With all the free parameters it could have produced a platypus or koala bear. Nevertheless, simulations are offered as experiments and proof of theories. After describing the Big Bang, Turok said: "The universe has turned out to be stunningly simple. It's simpler than any of our models can explain." But hang on a minute, if none of the models can explain the simplicity, surely all of the models have failed. Now, here's the astonishingly simple equation of all known physics. I would ask, where is life and consciousness in that equation? You'll notice that Peter Higgs gets a mention, the second from the right. Turok said: "They've found the Higgs boson"! No, they didn’t! If the Higgs mechanism explains masses it should be able to calculate the mass ratio of the proton to the electron. It can't. And who in this audience thinks that's simple? That it allows them to understand everything. But here we come to an important qualifier. "The grand unified theory is compact and elegant in mathematical terms." Turok then launches into numbers, Pythagoras' theorem, imaginary numbers, allowing the solution of any equation and an enthusiastic endorsement of mathematics for the rest of the lecture. But unless each symbol and operator can be defined.. pardon me, defined in real physical terms, an equation is physically meaningless. Mismatches with theory cause the invention of ever more particles and forces. Which violates the claim of simplicity and elegance. In fact, mathematics is an art often applied unscientifically to science. Unless you have all of the correct physical concepts and definitions in your mathematical model, the conclusions cannot be relied upon. The art becomes surreal. The genius Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe wrote: "Mathematics has the completely false reputation of yielding infallible conclusions." So we come to art and surrealism and the celebrity, Kip Thorne, Feynman emeritus professor of theoretical physics in Caltech who has this to say about simplicity: "Simplicity is the touchstone in finding new physical laws... if it's elegant, then it's a rough rule of thumb: you're on the right track." Thorne was the executive producer of the sci-fi film Interstellar. The film blurb says: "His math guided the creation of the mesmerizing and the most accurate simulation ever of what a black hole would look like. And it was the product of the year of work by 30 people and thousands of computers." Kip Thorne said: "I think the thing that makes this film different is that the science is woven into this film and into the story from the beginning. And woven in deeply. Real science." Quite the reverse is true, cosmology has become science fiction entertainment. There's nothing scientific about the slide on the right from Thorne's Wolfgang Pauli lecture in Zurich in 2011, "a black hole is made from warped space and space and time". But as Steve Crothers has shown, black hole theory makes no sense mathematically, let alone physically. How do you make a material object out of two immaterial concepts, space and time? As science teacher Evan Camp, Evan Camp's student asked: "How can smart people believe this stuff?" Recently I found the answer and it shows that our education systems damage our ability to do science. The first thing to do, I think Tom touched on this, is to first know yourself. The distinguished doctor Iain McGilchrist is a psychiatrist, doctor, writer, former Oxford literary scholar who wrote: 'The Master and his Emissary' subtitled: "The Divided Brain and the Making of the Western World" His shorter e-book is: The Divided Brain and the Search for Meaning. Which I recommend to you. There are also some excellent Youtube videos, interviews with him and also an RSA animation from which I will have a few images. He points out: The brain is profoundly divided and this organ is profoundly asymmetric. And he asked the question: Why would nature divide brains if there wasn't some use for that? He said: It's not true that one part of the brain does reason and the other does emotion. Both are profoundly involved. It seems the main function of the corpus callosum that join, joining fibres between the left and right hemispheres, is to inhibit the other hemisphere. Something very important is going on here. The right hemisphere reacts faster but inhibits less strongly. I should point out too that physically they are different. One hemisphere is slightly smaller than the other and the left hemisphere is slightly rotated and the surface convolutions are different.. And even the chemical signaling is different on both sides so they have a different job to perform. This is a slide from the RSA academies, the Royal Society of Arts academies in the UK. I presume you've probably all seen the animated swift drawing while somebody is lecturing. This is from the YouTube video that I recommend you to have a look at. In this he shows that the left hemisphere is narrowly focused and attends to detail while the right hemisphere is more broadly focused, it's alert and open to what's going on around. And he gives an example of the chicken. He said: the left hemisphere in the chicken is looking for the seeds amongst the dirt, the right hemisphere is making sure the chicken doesn't become somebody else's lunch. And I think that's a good way to look at it. In other words the left hemisphere is survival, the right hemisphere is a broad picture of what’s going on around you. I wrote to Iain McGilchrist and I sent him a copy of the paper, PDF of the paper which had actually studied the left and right hemisphere and image the activity that goes on when you ask physics questions, of a student. And you'll notice that the left hemisphere lights up like a Christmas tree and the right hemisphere is rather passive. The different colors just referred to different characteristics of what's being asked. Algebraic equation representation is red, the green is periodicity, energy flow is blue. This brings me to, we've all heard of cognitive dissonance, as if you're presented with something that you just cannot handle, it just doesn't make any sense to you. And it seems that it's a result of the differences between the two hemispheres of the brain. The left hemisphere, as I said, has narrow focus, only sees what it expects to see and has automatic machine-like responses. It's about survival. Education in science reinforces the bits rather than the whole picture. So the left hemisphere is involved in the training. It's a vicious cycle because it focuses on aspects we expect to see. You get stuck in a certain way of thinking. Also the left hemisphere needs to be in control. And the left hemisphere people, that's those who have dominant left hemisphere, exhibit denial. We can all think of many examples of this, I think Michael Shermer's visit to our last making was an example. The right hemisphere: meaning comes from understanding the whole. In other words, it's trying to take in the whole picture. And being comfortable, and this is important, with not being able to grasp everything. You don't need to understand the creation of the universe. What's more, he said, happiness comes from understanding your connectedness and engagement with the world. I would say the universe because that's what the Electric Universe is about, connectedness. Left hemisphere, Big Bang cosmology is consequently, I would say, hope-less. McGilchrist's e-book is subtitled: "Why are we so Unhappy?" And this is an, this is the whole thing about the Electric Universe, there is no subject that it shouldn't touch on if it is a real cosmology. He says, happiness comes from social connectedness and a sense of purpose beyond the immediate. I would say that seems to characterize our conferences. There is a great sense of purpose. Modern goal-oriented education, on the other hand, and its constant audit and inquisition, turns off the intellectually adventurous teachers and students. We don't understand the world by putting it together bit by bit. Quite the opposite, in fact. So, Left Hemisphere Training The knowledge that is mediated by the left hemisphere is within a closed system. This is typical of the scientific approach of course, you isolate the small part of something and then try and analyze that. It has the advantage of appearing perfect but the perfection is bought ultimately at the price of emptiness. So you see, the Big Bang is a closed system. The universe expanded from a non-physical point thirteen and a half billion years ago and increasing entropy and disorder is expected but we see increasing order. The universe is not a closed system! Geology is a closed system. So geologists could simply extrapolate things seen today back a few billion years and make up any story they fancied. Biology is a closed system. Each organism is self-contained. Brain circuitry will explain consciousness. Sheldrake and others show this is invalid. The closed mechanical model is wrong! Einstein's inertial frames are closed systems. They have lost all external references. You gotta ask, the speed of light, you know, inertial reference frame with respect to what? Some arbitrary observer. So modern science is empty of real meaning. Left hemisphere dominance is the safeway. A way that minimizes risk and provides a way forward that seemingly is a more secure and logical approach to decision making. The Machine metaphor reduces things to isolated bits and loses sight of the connected whole. Stars are isolated objects, galaxies are isolated objects, we are isolated individuals. It's chickens, picking at seeds in the dirt. Of course, when you're tied up with this narrow view you end up with a whole of mirrors effect. The more we get trapped into this, the more we undercut the things that might have led us out of it and we just get reflected back into more of what we know, about what we know, about what we know, about what we know... So the greatest problem becomes the things we don't know we don't know. More information, we have it in spades but we get less and less able to use it, to understand it, to be wise. These are Iain McGilchrist's words. Instead we go searching in the crap for signals we expect to see. That's my words. "There's a paradoxical relationship", Iain says, "as I know as a psychiatrist, between the knowledge of the parts and wisdom about the whole. It's the machine model that is supposed to answer everything but it doesn't." In other words the theory of everything. This is a perfect example of a hall of mirrors. This is the large hadron collider control room. Experiments are done on computer screens, it's virtual research. In our computerized world the virtual makes something seem more real. As one scientist said, sexy images sell! We see that all the time in the media. The picture, however, has become fragmented and surreal science fiction. Mistakes no longer mean going back to the drawing board, mistakes now need to be de-bugged. It creates a classic hall of mirrors reflecting a single model. Signals buried in noise become statistical discoveries and proof. The computers are programmed to find, deep in the noise, what they expect to see. I think the, the LIGO and the gravitational wave experiment is a prime example. Images on a screen become real discoveries or proof, the Higgs boson, gravitational waves. It illustrates group-think and left hemisphere dominance, a blindness to alternatives. ...Sorry... But paradigm shifts come from individuals using their mind, not large teams using computers, the ultimate black boxes. They invent new forces and particles to reclaim control of the model. The quark, the gluon, dark energy, dark matter. So big science is failing. There have been no fundamental advances for a century. It's accepted that the basis of what we now... what is now known is more or less correct. A Copernican revolution is totally unthinkable within the current system. There are not many differences between the modern academy and the universities in the 16th and 17th century which conformed to the church and to Aristotle's text. The symptoms? Science is non-predictive. There are continual surprises. Counter arguments are ignored or unpublished and the history of science is sanitized to give the impression of progress. What's the remedy? Evan Camp is a teacher, an 8th grade science teacher who ran an Electric Universe group after school. He presented an outstanding talk at EU 2013, Exciting Students with Unsettled Science. It's available on the Thunderbolts.info YouTube channel. He said: "Every mile you go in the wrong direction is really a two-mile error. Unlearning is twice as hard as learning." In fact it's much harder than that because at the end of the first mile you are lost. Because what you have learned inhibits new learning and accelerates forgetting. This requires an active remedial process. It requires a conceptual mediation program as early as possible. Such a program has been tested by Dr. Harry Lyndon in south Australia, with encouraging results. He says, the primary goal of science educators involves helping young people to acquire scientific knowledge with greater facility. To achieve a deeper level of understanding in their studies and for these understandings to be lasting. It has been established, however, that a universal problem in schooling concerns the fact that science learning is evidently difficult for most students. A general conclusion that even students who are successful in examinations are unable to retain and apply scientific concepts. When students move into high school, many experience disappointment because the science they are taught is neither relevant nor engaging and doesn't connect with their interests and experiences. When new information or ideas disagree or conflict with what the left hemisphere already knows, the left hemisphere inhibits or denies the new information and causes accelerated forgetting of the new knowledge or skill. It protects all prior knowledge. Old learning disables new learning. According to Lyndon, it's why old habits die hard. Old Way/New Way Learning where the old and the new are repeatedly contrasted is a method developed by Dr. Lyndon and a colleague and it's an innovative teaching method. It's a system where the students actively and repeatedly contrast the old and the new until the inhibition is overcome. It forces the student to think about thinking. This is important for what is to follow. Because it will help those who follow the Thunderbolts movement to understand the problems others face when confronted with a paradigm shift of the magnitude of the Electric Universe. And also some areas of your own personal denial. So, cosmology must address the infinitesimal as well as the infinite. So let's go to the heart of the matter. Because, incredibly, mass is undefined! In every textbook and encyclopedia the amount of mass is confused with the amount of matter. Perhaps because they both begin with the letter 'M'. This means that no scientist understands E=mc² This confusion allows particle physicists to talk of creation and annihilation of matter which is impossible without understanding what matter is. It's not physics. E = mc² is simply telling us that that mass is a measure of the amount of energy held in matter. Particles have no mass, we're told. And with this ignorance the standard particle model says, subatomic particles have no intrinsic mass which is nonsense. Are they saying protons and electrons have no rest mass, no energy? It seems so. In the standard particle model mass is provided externally by a kind of cosmic trickle of imaginary Higgs bosons. The total cost of finding something dubbed the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider ran over 13 billion dollars in July 2012, at the running cost of a billion dollars a year. That makes it more than 17 billion years, billion dollars wasted, chasing the green of the Cheshire cat. The LHC operates like smashing countless jumbo jets in the mountains and picking over the debris to see how they fly. But the whole is more than the sum of the bits, we can see. We are not dealing with closed systems. Even worse, it's like asking one of Douglas Adams' telephone hygienists to do the investigation. The investigators are not properly trained. Energy is undefined. What you will find in textbooks are examples of different forms of energy. The Big Bang is supposed to have originated from pure energy which is nonsense when energy only makes sense in relation to matter in motion, with respect to all other matter. But matter hasn't been defined in any physical sense involving sensible internal movement. The quantum realm is weird. It's admitted by leading physicists that no one understands quantum mechanics. It's incompatible with Einstein's postulate of no instantaneous information transfer and it seems to involve even the experimenter's thoughts in the outcome of some experiments. Once again, any experiment is not a closed system as physicists like to assume. That is why the quantum realm appears weird. Light and the electric force are mysteriously transferred through empty space. We have all experienced the force between two magnets. What's happening in the space between them? The pioneers of electromagnetism knew there has to be a medium to transfer the electric force. They called it the ether. The ether has to be an electrically polarizable medium that fills the universe. In that way you can daisy-chain the electric force directly. It's a longitudinal force. And applying the speed of light limit to that makes no sense whatsoever because light is a wave motion. I think I've said before that's like the difference between pulling on a rope and feeling the tug at the other end almost instantly, and waving one end of the rope and waiting for the wave to get to the other end. Light is a slow process in the universe. So if we have this ether that fills the universe, space is full. There's no such thing as a perfect vacuum. Einstein knew there has to be an ether but his postulates somehow did away with it. He admitted that his theory of relativity would fail if the Earth's motion through the ether were detected. That's because his inertial frames of reference would not be equivalent. It would be like having one observer experiencing a gentle breeze from the ether wind while another might be suffering a howling gale. As it turns out, Dayton Miller repeated the Michelson-Morley ether experiments far more rigorously and at different elevations. He found an ether drift. Sadly, left hemisphere training denied and quickly forgot this fact. So let's have a look at the standard particle model. An atom, once a promise of fundamental simplicity, is really a nucleus within a hazy probabilistic fog of electrons. The nucleus is some protons and neutrons held together by the mysterious short range nuclear or strong force. The particles in the nucleus have a hidden, unknown number of weird undetectable bits inside. These bits are appearing and disappearing in defiance of a principle of science that miracles are forbidden. Meanwhile, a recent report from the Large Hadron Collider suggests new findings that don't fit this model. Here's a snapshot of a proton by Professor Matthew Strassler. He writes: "...imagine all of the quarks (up, down, and strange -- u, d, s), antiquarks (u, d, s with a bar on top), and gluons (g), zipping around near the speed of light, banging into each other, and appearing and disappearing." So, a proton is said to be some quarks held together by some gluons which are themselves the quantized manifestations of the strong force. There is no mention of how a force manifests as a particle. It gets much worse. A gluon is really one of several colors of gluon. But it also has the simultaneous property of anti-color. Gluons mediate the interaction between quarks but they also mediate the interaction between themselves and quarks. That's right, gluons are the strong force but they also experience the strong force. Happily for the physicists, quarks are unobservable in principle because they only exist inside the nucleon. It's very convenient.. This is simple? You can forget elegance. This is extreme, narrow, left hemisphere focus on a model with no basic definitions to make sense of the words being used. Andrew Pickering, the author of "Constructing Quarks", it is a sociological study of particle physics and it's interesting book, says: "There's no obligation on anyone to take account of what 20th century science has to say. To listen too closely to scientists may be simply to stifle the imagination," that is the right hemisphere. "Worldviews are cultural products, there is no need to be intimidated by them." We come to the Electric Universe model of the atom. The electrically neutral atom is made of charged particles, positive and negative in equal numbers, together with a number of neutral particles called neutrons. Stating the obvious. All subatomic particles are real with real locations in space, it's not a probabilistic fog. There is a polarizable ether which transmits force and carries electromagnetic waves. The universe is full of an electrically neutral perfect fluid of neutral particles which passes through atoms and celestial bodies practically as if they weren't there. Neutrinos fit this description. So, the Electric Universe then defines what it means by energy and mass. Energy is matter in motion relative to the matter in the rest of the universe. It used to be said, in relation to the fixed stars. This is not a closed system approach. It is a unifying relational concept first articulated by Ernst Mach. So we define mass: Mass is a measure of particle distortion instead of acceleration in response to the electric forces from all other matter in the universe. It's a bit like pushing a balloon full of water. It will tend to distort, rather than move. And it's the same with these orbital systems of electrons and protons and so on. Once again, this conforms with Ernst Mach's principle. Neutrons may not exist in the nucleus. If so, only two particles are necessary to build all of the elements. This idea came from Edwin Kaal who I'm pleased to say is here and will be presenting in the breakout room. And the problem for physicists is how do you hold together all of the positive charges in the nucleus, they should repel one another very powerfully. The repulsion of those positive charged protons should prevent it from forming in the first place. However, atomic nuclei seem to require neutrons for stability. That's because when a radioactive atom nucleus decays neutral particles are sometimes observed to leave the nucleus and exist for a few minutes before further decaying into an electron and a proton. So it was assumed, such a neutral particle pre-existed in the nucleus. The "what if" question wasn't asked. That maybe that wasn't so. This is an assumption that still does not explain how the positive nucleus remains cohesive. So a special short-range strong nuclear force was invented. The proliferation of forces and particles. Edwin Kaal suggested a simpler solution. If the electrons remain as discrete particles in the nucleus that will tend to arrange themselves to, on average, seat equidistant between the protons; because the distance between the protons is greater than that between each proton and a neighboring electron, the attractive electric force between the proton and electron, sorry if it's too fast, will be four times greater than the repulsive force. This simple hypothesis removes the need for an extra strong force within the nucleus. It's much simpler. And then it seems that neutrons are short-lived, metastable resonance of a closely bound proton and electron. This is simple. The Electric Universe simply proposes structure within structure, repeated pattern. To understand magnetism and gravity we must go to the heart of matter a similar approach to that of Andre Marie Ampere, Carl Friedrich Gauss, Wilhelm Weber and Walther Ritz, who considered the behavior of positive and negative charged particles of different mass with great success but were ignored for political reasons. Chiefly, they weren't English, I think. Here's a simple hypothesis. The electron and proton have stable resonant orbital structures of smaller charged particles. In that case, the positron, that is the antiparticles, and anti proton are mirror particles. They're not antiparticles, they're mirrors. There is no antimatter, no creation or annihilation. But this requires that there be an ether of composite neutral particles of vanishingly small mass, the neutrinos. Neutrinos must be quite complex inside but totally collapsed so that they can accept energy and then become a particle and its mirror. But there's nothing, it is just assumed that when these particles seem to disappear, that they're annihilated, the matter has disappeared. That's not so. So the ether must be nor matter of vanishingly small mass composed of all the sub particles needed to split into an electron and a positron for example, when subjected to the appropriate energy, electromagnetic energy. For stability, and this is one of the stumbling blocks, of course, for particle physicists to go this way, is that the electric force must act between the tiny particles within the atom instantly. No speed of light delay. The two stable particles -- the electron and the proton, if we assume the neutron is just a metastable particle, form 254 stable nuclides plus another 85 metastable, that is radioactive nuclides, for a total of 339. So from this simple resonant systems of structure within structure we have all of the materials we need to see, to make what we see in the world around us. When those nuclei combine with the requisite number of negative electrons to form atoms and molecules, the possibilities are boundless in the living world. What does this mean? Only a single force is necessary, the powerful instantaneous electric force. The phenomenal strength of the naked electric force can be judged by the simple illustration in the lower left. This shows that if the charge; passing through two 120 watt light bulbs in one second, were to be transferred equally to two metal plates, the repulsive force between those plates would equal 1 million tons. So it's critical that the electric force is a balanced force, attractive or repulsive. These two propositions are the epitome of elegant simplicity balance. The little diagram there on the left, extreme left at the top, shows the attraction between positive and negative and the repulsion between like-particles. There are two forms of the electric force that we experience. One is the electrostatic, we have separated charge some distance apart, and the electric dipole where the distance between the two charges becomes so small that the field is altered and you get a different effect called the dipole field. So it just depends on the degree of separation of a positive and negative charge. It's a difference in scale. On our scale we experience the dipole field of atomic electric fields and subatomic electric fields in the form of magnetism and gravity. They are dipole fields. So both forms of the electrostatic and the dipole field occur between atoms and is responsible for chemistry. The e-force operates between all of the particles and sub particles within each atom. In close proximity this can result in distortion of the atoms to form electric dipoles themselves. Which can result in the attraction to form a molecule or they may enter a new resonant dance by sharing an electron as chemistry. The dipole distorting action on electrons and protons produces dipolar magnetism. The diagram there is actually, I made a mistake, the positive and negative on the left and right should be reversed. But this just shows that if you... just try this thing here... if you have an electric field operating on a particle here, charged particle here, and accelerating it and on the opposite side decelerating it, the result will be an elliptical orbit with the nucleus at one of the focuses. And the result of this is that you get a transverse dipole and that transverse dipole is shown there as the magnetic force because if you have two current-carrying wires, where the electric field in the wire is causing this distortion in electrons, then the dipoles are aligned so they tend to attract and we know that current flowing down two wires in the same direction attract, in the opposite way they repel. OK, so. And the other thing is that, I mentioned the ultra-week dipolar gravity. And this is the diagram, what happens to an atom in that case. The gravitational field cannot be shielded from, so the gravitational force operates on the heavy nucleus so that it falls towards one of the focuses of the ellipse. This time it's oriented radially towards the surface of the body. But the interesting thing about that is that once you've said that, this means that the body like the Earth and the Moon, which are shown here, the negative poles on both bodies are facing outwards which means they're repelling one another. So it means that the, it's long-range repulsive, short-range attractive. We, on the surface of the earth, are like iron filings. We don't care which magnet, we go to adjust, the nearest one will do. The gravitational mass of the distant galaxies has a fundamental influence over the motion of the bodies in the solar system and this is actually shown by precession of the perihelion of the planets which is tied to the distant stars and not to the Sun or general relativity. Because general relativity doesn't have a reference frame like that. Short-term changes in the Earth's magnetic field that occur over periods of just years or decades have now been shown in new research to have a very close relationship with changes in gravity. The two are very similar, similar forces. There is no gravitational collapse in space, no black hole swallowing everything. It is the electromagnetic force alone that coalesces matter in deep space. So the assumption that gravity was the controlling force on the large-scale is incorrect. There's no need for a Big Bang to separate everything initially, gravity is a balanced force like magnetism and cannot form neutron stars or other fanciful super-condensed celestial objects. A planet's gravity is established at its birth by powerful electromagnetic forces. Once the body is formed and the charge on the surface is established, the gravitational field is set by both the surface charge and the initial coalescence by electromagnetic forces. So the outcome of all that is that all matter in the local universe is connected by the electric force instantly. That's Mach's principle. The origin of mass and quantum spooky connection. Because this force is instantaneous, this so called, entanglement and non-locality suddenly has a simple explanation. And energy is a measure of motion with respect to the matter in the rest of the universe. Mass is a measure of the energy stored in the orbital motion inside a particle. And simultaneity means there is a universal time and three-dimensional space. We return to the sanity and simplicity of classical physics. These matter resonances are interesting too because having an orbital structure allows resonant instantaneous connections and complex interactions which explains weird quantum behavior. The important thing is that the electron and proton have an orbital charge structure like atoms which explains their internal energy and their magnetic moment. And distortion in an electric field appears as an increase in mass rather than acceleration. Quantum tunneling In transistors electrons face a barrier like the illustration in the diagram. It's like having to carry a weight over a hill but in a weird quantum phenomenon called tunneling the electron passes through that barrier as if there's a tunnel. The Electric Universe model of the electron and proton, having an orbital structure of oppositely charged particles, allows us to see that the hill or the repulsive electrical force between similar charges can instantly disappear or become a downhill race. The reason is that the force between two similar particles can become attractive instead of repulsive if you get the particles together at just the right moment. In chemistry this resonance is achieved by the use of heavy metal catalyst which has numerous internal subatomic resonances. The same catalytic process is available, in my opinion, for nuclear fusion. So called warm fusion is possible by nuclear chemistry, catalyzing the nuclei to attract instead of repel. So catalytic chemistry is possible, in my opinion, in the photospheric plasma of all bright stars where the nuclei are separated from the electrons and can actually come close together in the presence of the heavy elements we see in the spectrum. And you've gotta ask the question then, is this the path to the future power? Like the Sun. But only "unlike the sun" that is believed by present science. In this way all-stars generate the heavy elements in their photospheres where we detect them in their spectra. Rare exploding super novae are the most ineffectual production means imaginable. Because having produced it you then disperse it into deep space. There's also an unsuspected resonant means of connection in living systems. The morphic field of Rupert Sheldrake, the mind-body connection, consciousness, subtle energies. The Electric Universe model explains biological transmutations at body temperature as demonstrated by Dr. Louis Kervran. His is a clear demonstration of this simple process. Is light a wave or a particle? If so, what's waving? Einstein did away with a medium to waive. Or is light a particle, a photon? It can't be both, a wave and a particle. You'll notice they merely mouthed a term that it's particle-like, they say. It's a meaningless use of language. If so, according to Einstein, to travel at the speed of light it must have zero mass. But a particle of zero mass has no energy. You can't multiply 0 x infinity and get a real number. And if it's got 0 mass it can't be affected by gravity so there can be no gravitational lensing. Lensing occurs as a simple atmospheric diffraction effect in the ether. It's like an atmosphere around the body. Evidence from stars at the galactic center show no gravitational lensing as expected from standard theory. Clearly, we depend on light to observe the universe but we don't understand light. Photons don't exist. Light is a transverse electrical disturbance in the ether. And the ether must be a dielectric medium to transfer an electrical disturbance. The wave carries energy through the medium.. ..catch up here.. ..and the energy is absorbed by the first atom that is in instantaneous resonance with the sending atom. It gives the appearance that a photon has traveled between the sender and the receiver. It's appearance only. Talking about light brings us to cosmological redshift. Hubble found, the fainter and smaller a galaxy appeared -- the higher was its redshift. In the diagram you can see the spectral lines of hydrogen move progressively to the red end of the spectrum as the distance is thought to increase. The redshift was simply assumed to be due to velocity away from us by analogy with the Doppler shift of sound. Hubble's law is considered the first observational basis for the expansion of the universe. But ironically, Hubble thought it the least likely explanation. He felt, it more likely indicated some new physics. So it was Hubble's professional astronomer assistant, Halton C. Arp, who later proved this to be so. If the redshift is not simply a Doppler effect, Hubble wrote, the region observed appears as a small homogeneous but insignificant portion of the universe extended indefinitely both in space and time. Recently and surprisingly more distant galaxies seem to be accelerating away from us. This discovery won the Nobel Prize and gave rise to the need for huge amounts of mysterious dark energy to power the acceleration. I read about that discovery on October the sixth 2011. The discovery of the acceleration of the expanding universe is an interpretation based on total ignorance of the real nature of stars and the standard candle which was used as the measurement to determine the distance away. So it's gratifying to find support once more in a report this month titled: "Could a new type of supernova eliminate dark energy?" It has been found that the near-UV light from the most distant supernovae is brighter than the closer ones. In other words, there's something going on at the atomic and subatomic level. Of course, this is unexpected and unexplained. The diagram on the left shows the difference between the Big Bang universe and the Plasma Universe. It's easy to see which one is simpler. Intrinsic redshift and Dr. Halton Arp (Hubble's assistant who was dubbed the modern Galileo). He found redshifts, quasars, physically connected to and in front of, high redshift quasars rather, physically connected to and in front of low redshift active galaxies. This observation of a quasar between the galaxies NGC 73 19 and the Earth is impossible if the quasars are over 90 times farther away than the galaxy. So, Hubble was right. Something is wrong with physics. Arp showed the redshift happened in small jumps or quanta which indicates a subatomic effect. But subatomic, these quantum effects are supposed to only occur at the subatomic level, here we've got occurring on the galactic. This requires, once again, the electric force to be operating at ultra-high speed, instantaneously. So, quasars are born at high speed and with low redshift. This is Arp's diagram, you see the parent galaxy in the center. This is one here. And the high redshift quasars, and the redshift decreases as they move away. Initially their velocity is very high, they are faint, highly red-shifted and traveling at the fair fraction of the speed of light. Over time they gain in mass. This is interesting. That means that energy is being supplied to the matter in the quasar, the mass is increasing. So that eventually they can actually become a turnaround here and become a companion galaxy. This is an example of another path that they can take where you end up with another Bi Lac objects as it's called, producing multiple galaxies here. So there is a genealogy, if you like, of galaxies. The idea that the Andromeda galaxy is going to crash into our galaxy in the future, is rubbish. It's based on the idea that Andromeda's blue shift, with respect to us, means that it's approaching us. No, just means that it's older than us. So the Electric Universe explains this. Quasars are born at high speed and with low mass. They escape the forces of the electromagnetic galactic nucleus, that's the parent galaxy, as neutrons. And because the neutrons have no charge, they can escape the intense electromagnetic forces that hold that plasmoid in the center of the galaxy. They have enough time to get away from the, those powerful forces and then they decompose into electrons and protons which are the forerunners of hydrogen. So, as the electrical energy pours into the quasar its mass and brightness increases and it slows down to become a companion galaxy. So this was an explanation, the only explanation for Halton Arp's observations. Quasars are not the brightest and most distant objects in the universe. They are among the youngest and closest, so they.. the objects in the mirror really are closer than they appear. The visible universe is smaller than we have been told. So the universe, the real universe, is in balance. It is not expanding. This is important for understanding of gravity. Gravity cannot be simply an attractive force. The universe is of unknown age and extent, the origin of the universe is unknown, there is a universal now and space has three physical dimensions. This brings everything back down to, as Tom was pointing out, conditions as we experience it on Earth. Dark Matter Galaxies Galaxies are treated as isolated objects in space produced somehow by attractive gravity in an expanding universe. Their rotation and structure remains a mystery. They're made of eighty percent invisible dark matter. Tom got a good introduction to that story about dark matter. Dark matter has been described as an invisible elephant in the room. You know it's there by the dent it makes in the floorboards. Dark matter is only inferred theoretically by using our experience of gravity on earth and projecting it onto the rest of the universe. Once again it's the geocentric problem. We look at the gravity on earth and then we just extrapolate outwards. Because that's all mathematicians can do. It needs an impossible gravitational black hole in the center, black holes exist theoretically in asymptotically flat space in an empty universe. You cannot superimpose any other matter in such a hypothetical universe. Black holes don't exist! Yet some sport long thin high-velocity jets over intergalactic distances. There's no satisfactory theoretical explanation for these jets. This is the standard, taking the standard approach. Electric Galaxies On the other hand, Plasma Cosmology shows experimentally and observationally that galaxies are governed by electromagnetic forces. Tony Peratt said that they introduced gravity into their super computer runs and it made no difference whatsoever. Spirals rotate as simple Faraday motors, that's why that curve is flat. It's as if you've got a plate and you're just spinning the plate. Stars are born in and trace the spiral power lines. Where there is a higher density of gas and dust, it's typical of an electrical discharge, where the density of the material becomes greater, the discharge becomes more filamentary. Stars form along those pinched current filaments. There are no black holes. It's a compact high-energy plasmoid and this comes down to peer-reviewed Plasma Cosmology. Their apparent mass is due to the relationship between mass and energy. If e = mc², if you got a high concentration of energy in that tiny plasmoid, it will exhibit a considerable mass. It's certainly not a black hole. The other thing is that galaxies lineup axially showing the electrical connectedness because they're threaded like catherine wheels on a wire. And that wire is one of these intergalactic Birkeland current filaments. So let's look at stars. We've done galaxies, let's look at stars. Eddington, Arthur Eddington had the temerity to say, "it should not be too difficult to understand something as simple as a star". This is typical left hemisphere. His quote is typical. Isolate, simplify and ignore a global view because if you look at corona, sunspots, flares, magnetic cycles, etc. his gas model doesn't predict any of them. And the alternatives are not explored. He dismisses electrical aspects in a few paragraphs. The failure of this approach is shown by continual complications with each new discovery. It's treated as an isolated gravitating ball of gas. Conventionally, it's a body that satisfies 3 conditions. It's made of hydrogen plus a few impurities, having core of the lightest element is the most fanciful assumption. It's needed to allow the thermonuclear energy model to be viable. That also requires a hypothetical extreme conditions in the core. It's only required by the thermonuclear theory and is completely untestable. It also has, I mean that's unverifiable, and also the sequence of nuclear reactions that take place in the core cannot be verified. They're very complex and requires quantum tunneling which I referred to earlier, and what's more, there's a more complex different story for different stars. It's certainly not simple. It's an explosive model because one of the reactions is sensitive to the temperature to the fifth power. It also needs an unknown radiation zone to break down the x-rays from the nuclear core. There's no body known that has a radiation or the energy transferred through the body, through a radiation zone. So this is hypothetical. And also from the point of view of life on Earth and so on it has a restrictive and variable 'Goldilocks zones' distance from the star. It's not the best place to nurture life in the universe. Impossible Stars Formation by gravitational accretion doesn't work. It's never been explained satisfactorily. It has hydrogen, the lightest element in the core, the model doesn't predict the observed features of behavior, has different models for white dwarfs, neutron stars, etc and the life story of stars is super complicated and untestable. And some stars do strange things, they switch from one place to another without going through the transition stages. Renowned scientists like Eddington who made grave mistakes about the Sun and Einstein's general relativity, he went out explicitly to prove Einstein correct -- not to test his theory, continue to haunt us today. It gives the light to the belief that science is self-correcting. It is, oh sorry, it is not, given the way in which science is done today. As Eddington said, if there's no other way out we may have to suppose that bright line spectra in the star are produced by electric discharges. The clues were there but "what if" was not followed through. Herschel reveals a ribbon of future stars. This was reported on March the 30th this year. So this is a very recent picture. Stars and planets are formed by powerful electromagnetic forces like pearls on a cosmic string. This is a quote from an earlier report. Gravity can be ignored. In Plasma Cosmology there's no gravitational accretion. There's no way you can form a string like that using gravity. Gravity is a central force and material tends to come in to a center. It doesn't form a string. But this recent report says, this is important, stars are shot out of the filaments by a slingshot mechanism. And there's a diagram here which shows the filaments moving around like those in the plasma ball, they snake about. The stars having been formed in this filament are left behind as the filament moves on and these stars are shot out. And it's interesting because plasma.. Tony Peratt described to us once the effects seen in high energy discharge experiments as these plasmoids scattered like buckshot. Now it's not only stars that are formed here, it's all solid bodies including planets. And they may be captured by the stars to form the weird assortment, over three-and-a-half thousand of them, so far, of exo-planetary systems that have been observed. New stars also may fission to produce hot Jupiters in very close orbits and achieve electrical stability with their changing electrical environment. The movement of the filaments, as I said, is like those in the plasma ball. Heavy elements convect into a cool core. This is interesting because these, those blue filaments you saw before are the coldest part of the cloud and this is where the stars are forming. The traditional view is that the stars had to form by gravitational collapse and not lose any of the heat of the collapse, otherwise they couldn't start their nuclear fires. This doesn't require any of that. It was one of the surprises for theorists. Is that the, the blue filament I mentioned is the coldest part of the cloud and contains eight hundred times as much mass as the Sun. This is not a surprise for plasma cosmologists. So, all stars have a cool planetary core. Stars and many planets are born together along the same electrical umbilical cord. Other planets and moons are born later in electrical fissioning events and capture events. Hydrogen and helium tend to form the outermost atmosphere. This is a diagram showing the actual form of the filaments. You'll notice the pattern there. This is showing an experimental pattern of a discharge on an insulating plate. And this shows a Martian electrical scar. You can see the similarities. As the cosmic lightning bolt fades, stars and planets are captured into planetary systems. So, electric stars, they remain a gaseous electric discharge phenomena like spherical searchlights, following their birth. In fact some of the characteristics of the photospheres are like that of a searchlight. All bright stars catalytically produce heavy elements in the photospheric plasma discharges. Red stars have gigantic anode sheaths. Sorry, got the right picture there. Plasma discharges adjust to their environment by moving electrical barriers called plasma sheaths or misleadingly, magnetospheres, because they trap the magnetic fields inside. If Jupiter's plasma sheath would lit up it would appear the size of the full Moon in the sky, at opposition. And its Galilean moons would be orbiting comfortably inside it. So red dwarfs are not dwarfs and their bloated glowing anode sheaths are the cosmic wombs for life. Because inside that radiant red sphere all satellites receive uniform heat and light over their entire surfaces. It doesn't matter how they're moving or rotating, that will be the case. Of course this poses a problem for the SETI project because radio waves cannot penetrate the glowing plasma sheath. So if these are the wombs of life, we don't have any way of radio communication with them. But of course, gravity can pass through. White dwarfs are not dwarfs at all, they're just stars with no bright photosphere. And a faint white coronal discharge. These are some of the planetary systems that have been discovered. You can see that it's quite a shambles. So as I said before, at the galactic scale electromagnetic forces form these gigantic Birkeland currents and they dominate. At the planetary scale, inside the star's protective plasma sheath, gravity dominates. So you have to choose the region you're talking about when you talk, when you try to apply your model to stars, galaxies and so on. In fact, the inside the star's protective sheath, with gravity dominating and it dominates because it cannot be electrically shielded so the impact from all of the other stars in the universe is acting like a pressure in on the, the planets moving around the Sun. In fact this repulsive force from the rest of the universe can reverse the Earth's motion about the Sun in 6 months. That is 6 sextillion tons by 140,000 miles an hour. So it gives you an idea of the impact. Then the Thunderbolts of the Gods operate to modify masses.. oh, sorry.. In planetary systems the electric force comes into play only when plasma sheaths collide because then the electrical insulation breaks down. And the electric current flows between the two bodies. Then the Thunderbolts of the Gods operate to modify masses and change orbits and to quickly reestablish order. This is one of the problems that Velikovsky faced, how do you explain events, within the memory of mankind, of chaos in the solar system and it looks like clockwork today. This is the answer, you have to apply the electric model of gravity to be able to do this. So Velikovsky was right. Electricity and magnetism are involved in the celestial mechanism. Changing the surface charge on a planet Change modifies the strength of the internal electric dipole which is responsible for the planet's mass and gravity. And the changes to both bodies, which I've shown in previous YouTube talks, tends to move the two bodies apart, which is very convenient.. This overcomes the objections of the Harvard book burners to Velikovsky's Worlds in Collision. However, it doesn't detract from the title to say that Worlds didn't collide. It was an electrical clash of the titans. There's Velikovsky with his great book. So what we have now in science is a mythical journey. It is a rehash of a creation myth. The Earth was born and for four-and-a-half billion has remained roughly where it is now. Long ago the Earth had a few massive impacts to birth the Moon and almost wipe out life on Earth at intervals. Ironically, planetary collisions have been found essential 66 years after Velikovsk's book Worlds in Collision was burned. Thousands of exo-planetary systems don't fit the story. There are stars that shouldn't exist, hot Jupiters that orbit the star in hours or days, backward orbits and polar orbits. Life on earth remains unexplained. The odds against random events producing life are practically infinite. The rest of the story is once-upon-a-time, fragmented, boring and non-predictive. We are an isolated and improbable accident. That's why we have difficulty imagining life elsewhere in the universe. Alan Alda complains, everybody is ignorant about science. Alda was 11 years a host of Scientific American Frontiers on PBS and he helped inspire the creation of the Center for Communicating Science at Stony Brook in 2009. Is it any wonder? When this is the face of science today. There is no real meaning or morality in modern mechanistic science to engage students or the public. Everyone thinks it is all mathematics. It saddens me to see so much talent wasted in the pursuit of myth, hunting for dark matter. Their heads have been filled with it. Our REAL journey. You're looking for the nearest exoplanet -- we're standing on it. Pay attention to the oldest stories of the celestial gods who created the skies and land we see today. Yorro Yorro is a research book about the Kimberley region, Aborigines in western Australia. And they, some of their stories are so close to the reconstruction of the Saturnian polar configuration that it's almost scary. And these are the words from the elders and they were very precise in their words. It says, in the beginning people saw before the Ice Age, that the Moon, Sun and some of the stars had been on Earth. In other words, they were very close. One song told about a flood, long before the last, that was brought on by a star with trails. The symbols that testify to these events are still in the Kimberley. The Wandjina creator-figure, which is the one you can see on the front of the book there, that features are explained. All rings around the head represent clouds and lightning. The big spirit Wandjina have large eyes. This is the eye-god motive that David Talbott has explained at length. They never have a mouth nor ears and the line between the eyes indicates where the power flows down and it's not a nose. And it has, it looks like a hollow tube which, in the plasma column scenario of the Saturnian instability, is accurate. Wallanganda, the Creator of Wandjina, did not create with his hands, only through his voice, with power. It reminds me of, "in the beginning was the Word". Andy Hall has recently explained that the overpressure from supersonic shock-waves, that is from the electrical blast that striked the surface of the body, are powerful enough to form mountains. Rock flows until the overpressure drops whereupon it solidifies instantly but retains an imprint of the shock-wave. Those shock-waves would have produced harmonics and overtones, a global sound like a symphony of giant trumpets. There's many traditions about the creation being associated with sound. This little book I bought in Central Australia on a visit to Uluru, that great red rock which looks just like an asteroid has landed. And it also tells a story by these people in the Kimberleys but is illustrated by children and it's very quaint. Yet the story is by David More Jolly, who's the elder, It tells of two suns in the sky who lived in hollow logs, plasma columns. There is a period of intense heat from them. Then one sun is attacked with a spear, the thunderbolt, and is bitten by a snake, cometary Venus, who lives in the sky. The little sun gets snagged in the fog of a celestial tree which is the Axis Mundi thing. The Tree of Life, the Celestial Tree. So this is an extension of the forensic technique that Velikovsky introduced. He never referred to the Australian Aborigines but some of their memories are, seem to be so accurate that they are a better source than some of the more, so-called, advanced cultural reports. All of these story elements makes sense to mytho-historians and to the leading plasma cosmologist and colleague of Hannes Alfvén -- Tony Peratt. Accept the best evidence regardless of its fit with modern consensus science and man-made theoretical laws. It is better to adopt the forensic science approach to the evidence for past events that cannot be repeated than to rely on theoretical science which is based on sets of beliefs and a geocentric perspective. Use that evidence to develop a more holistic science that brings a phenomenal real journey to light. To be real and useful, science must be holistic. The Electric Universe is a holistic science that applies seamlessly from the galactic to the earthly to the biosphere and on down to subatomic particles. Humanity's dramatic experience of the electrical nature of celestial mechanics would make an awe inspiring and frightening IMAX movie that would make science fiction seem a pale shadow in comparison. But in my opinion, once understood, there will be no rational urge to revisit doomsday upon each other and the earth under the unrecognized banners of the prehistoric warring planetary gods. Planets bear the scars of their electrical birth and past encounters on their faces. Apollo astronauts commented on the fresh appearance of lunar craters, the event that caused the great gush across the face of Mars appears in stories from ancient cultures. These are just yesterday in geological time. I recommend you to see episode II Symbols of an Alien Sky, The Lightning Scarred Planet Mars. We may understand our history and place in the electric universe for the this time. This is singularly important for our sense of well-being. It gives dramatic new meaning to our lives in a sense of responsibility for our jewel of a planet. Without this sense we probably have no future on Earth. Also in the event, myth becomes science. There was a unique myth-making period and all surviving cultures required their stories to be faithfully transmitted for millennia, such was their importance. We look at these enigmatic rock art figures from the remote Kimberley region in Western Australia and see only their strange, haunting and artistic beauty. And it was rather ironic that just a week or so ago, and David Novak was there to see it too I think, they had the vivid festival in Sydney where they project images onto public buildings and of course the Opera House's the the most public building in Sydney and this was a presentation of Wandjina figures. I mean they are haunting and I think they probably evoke some kind of a subconscious connection but how much more would they mean if people really understood their origin. We need to give more credit to the indigenous people. Now Even Camp said that one of the unique aspects of the Electric Universe theory is that it's good storytelling. It answers all three questions, what if.. What if the sky was different in the past? What if Saturn was worshipped as the Sun? What if there were electrical discharges between planets? ..sketch of him.. What if there were electric discharges between planets? Today we have meteorites from Mars. What if Lichtenberg figures explain the scars on Mars and Earth? Shows students pictures of cratering on different bodies and asks students to explain them from two points of view. The standard model needs different explanations for each. ..oops, sorry that was unexpected.. The Electric Universe, on the other hand, has a single explanation for them all. Then there is the story of the dissidents. If only Birkeland hadn't been ignored, Hannes Alfvén had been listened to, Halton Arp's research hadn't been dismissed. A pixar rule for storytelling number 16: what are the stakes? Give us reasons to support the character. What happens if they don't succeed? Stack the odds against them! What of the future if this goes on? We continue wasting money and careers looking for things that don't exist. We cripple students by not training them to think. We may have no future on this planet. As Evan Camp says, "the power of eliciting engagement is to get people to come to their own conclusions". Thinking is going to be the future of education. So, our Electric Universe future. Mahatma Gandhi said: "There is a force in the universe which, if we permit it, will flow through us and produce miraculous results." The Electric Universe is an inspiring story that motivates students both conceptually and artistically and that is what's needed for left and right brain hemisphere development. Education, classical science and the arts, left and right hemispheres ..just catch up here.. Many principles of the Electric Universe were foresaying by scholars in the past; Newton, Faraday etc. A Release from existential fear. Velikovsky's The Bonds of the Past, a documentary. There is a collective inability to face the truth that prehistoric mankind faced doomsday. For millennia, sciences preached stability and order but as amnesiacs we have a compulsion to instinctively repeat the catastrophes of the past destroying each other and the earth from the sky with apocalyptic weapons like the planetary gods of old. This was one of Velikovsky's greatest fears. But we have, on the other hand, the possibility of an unparalleled renascence with the Electric Universe, bringing everything together seamlessly, understanding ourselves and our past, can heal the wounds and provide a more universal sense of connection and purpose. Understand the electric force of nature. Power "like the Sun." And Gravity. Quantum Interactions. All three rely on understanding matter interactions by the instantaneous electric force. Understanding living organisms, the mind-body connection and beyond. Also understanding the dangers of genetically modified organisms and manufactured food. There's no thought given to the effects, the unintended consequences of fiddling with these things when our basic knowledge is so lacking. And the idea in an Electric Universe is to live in tune with the Earth and each other. Resonant Connection On the most general level, the Electric Universe is a new paradigm of universal resonant connection. The arbitrary inertial frames of reference of physics are not equivalent when everything is connected in real time. How and where you are makes a difference to your energy state. For example, the GPS system is supposed to prove relativity theory. It doesn't. The atoms in orbiting clocks have a different energy from identical clocks on Earth so engineers simply count a different number of ticks to compensate. Time is universal, unchanging and unchangeable. Clocks are not. Think of the relationships between all things connected by the universe electric force and consider that the electric force must act instantly otherwise no information transfer is possible between resonant tune systems. Spacecraft using slow speed of light transmissions, require constant retuning of receivers on Earth to compensate for their motion. Obviously living systems could not function if moving parts of the body lost contact with the brain. Acknowledging this simple fact will explain quantum weirdness and open up science, particularly biology, to amazing possibilities that are presently forbidden. And understanding gravity and magnetism as balancing electric forces will change forever our view of the heavens and the earth under our feet. As the morphic resonance experiments of the biologist Rupert Sheldrake have shown, the things that are learned by one organism are immediately available to others like them, anywhere on earth. The universe learns. Resonance between molecular tuning forks allows instant information transfer, the mind-body connection and beyond. Life is structured water. This was said to me by Gerald Pollack. The experiments, or his experiments, show that structure of electrically polarized water molecules gives rise to water's amazing properties. It allows information to be stored and transferred within a living cell. The memory mechanism of homeopathy. It suggests that the electrically polarizable ether particles may also participate in information storage as well as transmission. The Electric Universe resonant electrical model of matter and the all-pervasive neutrino ether, suggests that resonance and structure within structure can store unlimited information and transfer it instantly. There is more to life than meets the eye. We've always known that instinctively. The Electric Universe suggests that the information needed for life, forget the gene -- that's just the factory floor, is universal. So life can take hold wherever conditions arise that allow it. We see evidence for that in the great changes immediately following catastrophic mass extinctions on earth. We see it in organisms living in anoxic conditions over volcanic vents, on the ocean floor and at great depths in rocks. Just as gravity cannot be shielded, since all matter participates in force transfer, so it is with this universal information bank. There are no islands in space. We are Earthlings in the complete resonant connection sense in a meaningful Electrical Universe. The fact that we exist suggests the purposeful universe. Our lives have purpose. We don't manifest as a blank slate. So, children should be observed and supported in their individual passions, not suppressed and molded to have desires for them. We are born with a purpose but many need help to discover that purpose. In answering the question: Why are we so unhappy, Iain McGilchrist says: "True happiness is based on connections with others and a sense of purpose beyond the immediate." True happiness is one aim of this conference. The new panorama of an amazing shared history and kinship must change the world. In the search for meaning, the Electric Universe paradigm can, as Iain McGilchrist says, change the world. Elegance, harmony and simplicity of concepts are the Electric Universe guiding principles. Thank you. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts. info Today, the chief principals of the Thunderbolts project, Wal Thornhill and Dave Talbott, take a closer look at the latest information from the Rosetta mission to comet 67P. As discussed in previous episodes, the comet nucleus looks nothing like the smooth icy body expected by mainstream scientists. 67P’s double-lobed form may have its ideal analog in the structure achieved by plasma scientists Dr. C. J. Ransom, blasting hematite with an electric arc. and the mysteries do not end with the comet's appearance. The so-called “water output” detected in the comet's coma has puzzled scientists on Earth. Months ago, the detected signal of water was much too high to explain through sublimating ices from solar heating. And on October 23rd, scientists from the University of Bern announced that they are “detecting many more molecules already at large distances from the Sun,” which comes as quite a surprise. The surface of the comet does not reveal a single trace of water ice. It is covered with abundant rocks and debris, including this 150-foot boulder which Rosetta scientists have called Cheops. Many of the comet’s features make it appear as if it were torn from a mountain. We also see curious chains of pits, reminiscent of many planets and moons. At the comet’s neck, we even see features resembling the Martian sand dunes, which planetary scientists attribute to mechanical wind on Mars. Wal Thornhill begins our discussion with a closer look at the features on comet 67P, which testify to electrical discharge machining having shaped the comet’s surface. One of the key arguments used to support the impact origin of craters in the solar system, is that they seem similar to terrestrial explosion craters. However, superficial appearances can be deceptive: there are many unresolved problems with the impact cratering model. The more than 90% of circular craters on the moon require the supposed impact cause to hit the surface vertically. So, it was proposed that hypervelocity impacts would cause an explosion above the surface and generate circular craters. However, comets are supposed to have been formed by accretion. Circular craters should be rare, but Comet 67P shows many circular craters. In the image here, we see two overlapping circular craters, with no evidence of damage to, or in-filling of, the earlier crater. Professor Tommy Gould remarked upon this kind of crater overlap and the fresh appearance of craters, when viewing images of the moon's surface from the Lunar Orbiter. Planetary scientists have never solved this puzzle. Neat, overlapping circular craters are characteristic of electric discharge machining where an arc strikes the surface vertically, and moves from a newly excised crater to the nearest high point, which is generally the wall of the crater just formed. What's more telling is that the walls of the craters on comet 67P are raised above the surface and sharp-edged. An impact tends to flatten and scatter surface material. Once again, an electric arc melts and sputters surface material cleanly off into space. When the arc ceases or moves on, we see the process frozen, like a single frame from a movie. The slightly irregular shape of the crater walls on 67P, is reminiscent of Victoria crater on Mars, which has been investigated both from above and on the ground by the Mars rover Opportunity. I proposed an explanation for its irregular walls in 2006, based on the unique behavior of an arc impinging briefly on an anode. This may seem like a contradiction of the comet as a cathode in the Sun's discharge. But the electrical birthing process from a planetary surface can have the comet temporarily more positively charged than its surroundings. Victoria crater notably has a pattern in its floor that is attributed to windblown sand dunes, but may more easily be accounted for by the detailed behavior of an anode arc. So, it is significant that the comet has a similar pattern in the neck region. A good example of cathode edging is to be seen on this smooth area and is most closely matched by that scene on Io, with the scalloped walls of its so-called ”calderas.” That is where the comet jets originate, just as we see on Io, along the edge of the caldera. Prior to the Deep Impact mission of 2005, NASA scientists had suggested that Tempel 1 lost about one third of a meter of depth in each orbit. When the Stardust Next spacecraft reimaged the Tempel 1 comet's surface in 2010, it found that the wall of the most prominent mesa, which was 15 meters high, had retreated an astonishing 50 meters. The excavation of material was precisely focused at the location of the mysterious pixel saturation, which according to proponents of the Electric Universe, was the focal point of electrical arcs. The erosion along an escarpment is also one of the features seen on comet Tempel 1. Interestingly, judging by the muted feature to the right, some of the machined surface material is being deposited electrostatically, mostly in the neck region of the comet. Presumably, in a manner recently discussed by lunar scientists in reference to migrating lunar dust. All of the visual evidence so far, discounts the dirty snowball story of comets and supports the Electric Universe story of recent planetary history, witnessed by our prehistoric ancestors, and involving the Thunderbolts of the planetary gods. You know, week by week this comet is challenging all of our popular ideas about comets, their origin and their nature. Here, we see this amazing cold, black and scorched landscape. We can't find a trace of water; we see a surface dominated by craters and sharply cut, even mountainous peaks. And now we see the comet releasing gases that under present theory, could not be released at such distances from the Sun. Not if warming is the cause. Now, keep in mind that these observations are not speculation. But how could our long-held comet theories withstand these latest surprises. For decades, comet science rested on a dirty snowball model. The claim has been that volatiles, most notably water and carbon dioxide ices, sublimate as a comet moves closer to the Sun. Sublimation simply means volatiles converted directly into gases, without passing through a liquid phase. Now, today 67P is almost 300 million miles from the Sun. That's more than three times the distance from the Sun to the Earth. At that distance in the vacuum and the deep freeze of interplanetary space, theorists cannot find a way for trivial warming to account for the molecules now being actively removed from the surface and injected into the 67P coma. This includes formaldehyde, hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen cyanide, sulfur dioxide and carbon disulfide. At the present distance, origin by sublimation is just not even conceivable. Now, what do we do when a theory runs into contradictory discoveries. Well, the first requirement is to simply expand the field of view. Consider alternative theories, alternative explanations. You know for many years now, the leading theorists of the Electric Universe paradigm have claimed that popular comet theory no longer works. They see the 67P discoveries not as surprises, but as confirmation of explicit predictions that follow inescapably from an electric comet model. When comets move through the electric field of the Sun, they begin discharging electrically. That would logically begin with sputtering of surface materials by the bombardment of protons in the solar wind. But as electrical stresses grow, that leads to excavation of material by electric arcs. Now that should show up, as the Rosetta probe draws closer to the surface or the Philae Lander, actually reaches the surface, and achieves the closest ever view of a cometary surface. And as the comet itself moves toward perihelion this coming summer, what will be the surprises in store for us at that time?

[Music] [Music] more than two centuries after Benjamin Franklin flew his kite the origin and behavior of lightning continues to amaze and to puzzle the lightning specialist lightning will occasionally imprint its distinctive form on terrestrial surfaces and even on the scan of humans in the laboratory the counterpart to lightning is the Lichtenberg figure perhaps the most common and fascinating form taken by electric discharge dendritic means treel ike branches and dendritic forms can be easily confused with fracturing the dendritic patterns seen here are not fracturing as the term is normally understood but electrical breakdown channels on a polycarbonate plate Georg Christoph Lichtenberg appears to have been the first to demonstrate the different forms taken by dust on positive and negative surfaces a line of investigation later followed by others but with no impact on planetary science late in the 19th century industrialist Lord William G Armstrong explored the power of electricity to produce exquisite forms on surfaces of different charge the feathery qualities of Lichtenberg figures on a negative surface would be compared to the morgue and Hritik patterns on a positive surface at Stone reg engineering the technology of Lichtenberg figures has produced an art form lightning captured and clear acrylic blocks the blocks are bombarded by electrons from a five mega volt particle accelerator arriving at nearly the speed of light but coming to a stop within a fraction of an inch into the block a cloud of trapped negative charge here the event producing the dendritic channels is triggered by a simple stroke of a metallic pin that is all it takes for a breakdown of the insulating material and a nearly instantaneous release of charge and dendritic channels [Music] millisecond lightning storm frozen into the acrylic block [Music] the branching of the electron channels gives a spectacular fractal pattern apparently occurring all the way down the scale to the molecular level from what we have earlier presented it is evident that planet wide electric discharge created vast regions of raised and Lichtenberg figures on Mars [Music] laboratory experiments show that in regions of positive charge dust will typically gather into raised Lichtenberg formations standing out from the surrounding terrain in fact sharply sculpted dendritic Ridge systems are abundant on Mars showing up wherever the highest energy events are implied the great trench of Valles Marineris is an extraordinary example here we find the raised Lichtenberg figures exactly where we would expect them running down from sharp cliffs and high points in predictable patterns stretching for hundreds of miles along the trench yet strangely the mystery receives almost no mention by planetary scientists [Music] we also observe dendritic ridges on the great mound of olympus mons both on the miles high scarp and on the caldera walls [Music] [Laughter] in fact the mystery is global we see the same pattern on the walls of major rills we see it along the so called fractured terrain of noctus labyrinth as' and everywhere on Mars we see the dendritic patterns reaching down from towering cliffs and mesas we even see such Ridge systems descending from the rims of large craters opening the door to a much broader perspective on crater formation [Music] in the hypothesis presented here many craters on Mars were produced by the same electrical events that created chains of craters and a great variety of channels or rills [Music] as a discharge column sputters across a surface its diameter will vary with discharge energy and a narrowing or pinching by the induced magnetic field the pinching effect will be most strongly focused at the point of contact with the surface the sputtering arc will leave a unique signature in the form of scalloped walls popular explanations say that surface collapse must have produced these cratered channels [Music] but scalloping effects on Mars are by no means limited to chains of craters planetary scientists cannot agree on the forces that created this bizarre channel network north of Valles Marineris other channels that are said to have been caused by fluid flow either water or lava exhibit the same scalloped walls similar neatly cut scallops appear on the cliffs of towering mesas and the so called calderas of the great mountains of mars reveal the same pattern [Music] even the celebrated Victoria crater supposedly formed by impact exhibits alcoves and scallops similar to those of the great rills and valleys and the scalloped walls of Zoo Neil crater are virtually indistinguishable from the scalloped walls of Valles Marineris [Music] additional patterns enter the picture as well including a consistent global connection between scallops and dendritic Ridge networks the explanation appears to lie in the fractal nature of cylindrical current sheets current flow can metamorphosis into secondary cylinders in fractal-like substructures to be pinched by the induced magnetic fields into a narrow highly focused discharge we see this interplay of different scales in the cylindrical currents of Earth's Aurora's as charged particles enter and exit the polar regions in an electric circuit invisible current sheets magnetically pinched at Earth's poles divide into visible curtains of secondary cylinders [Music] all dancing in the turbulence of Earth's upper atmosphere the same electromagnetic structure arising from charged particle movement will at times be seen in the electrified tails of comets [Music] in the largest-scale events carving the surface of Mars we envision multiple columns of charged particles being pinched into a narrow discharge at the surface this established principle will be crucial to comprehending the giant Valles Marineris with all of its accompanying chasms smaller scallops within larger scallops they are the imprint of pinched cylindrical currents constituted of smaller cylinders the pattern occurs repeatedly and is surely no accident consider the consistent relationship between the scalloping effects and Lichtenberg Ridge systems the most prominent of these dendritic forms are those that separate the larger scallops the smaller dendritic ridges define the boundaries between smaller scallops at both scales the ridge networks can be seen as the final events and catastrophic discharge activity as charge redistribution gathered and fused to loose material into the familiar Lichtenberg patterns [Music] in this revision of margin history contradictions find a unified resolution in an electrical cause enigmatic craters crater chains indirect ridges scalloped craters calderas and rills all are connected to the observed behavior of electric discharge here is an image of electric arcing to a negatively charged surface capturing the feathery discharge glow or Corona the corona is constituted of extremely fine air like filaments radiating from the primary streamers [Music] on a surface affected by electric arcing experiments show that regions of localized charge can attract dust or sediment into a record of the electrical activity or discharge pathways now too many fine details [Music] here is a ridge complex on Mars covering thousands of square miles [Music] the ridge forms have puzzled planetary scientists for more than a decade now [Music] since standard geology does not include such forms this unique behavior is a logical test of the electrical hypothesis examine closely we see perpendicular hair like filaments illuminated by the Sun [Music] confirming an electric discharge attracted dust and to raised relief [Music] this exotic formation was produced electrically by DZ Parker on a CRT screen showing a gathering of dust in a region of previous discharge activity the ridge with its fine filaments offers a striking counterpart to the baffling margin formations we have suggested that the northern hemisphere of Mars was eroded electrically to a depth of five miles or more as seen on the global elevation map it is only reasonable therefore to look for transitional zones on the margins of the more depressed or heavily eroded regions [Music] if the erosion was electrical what should we expect to find particularly in the regions that separate the low-lying northern latitudes from the elevated and densely cratered southern hemisphere we should expect to find what we do find vast regions from the equator northward join the predictable phases of electrical erosion first electric arcs raking across the surface created a network of channels cutting the region into discrete blocks then the arcs acting on the sharp edges of the blocks continued to extend the valley floors leaving separate angular islands the islands standing out above the newly excavated terrain were then progressively eroded into various pyramidal forms then mounds as electric arcs continued to erode the sharp edges and finally the remaining mounds were etched away just as industrial applications of electric discharge machining can erode high points to produce a flat surface all that is left of the earlier margin planes are the few scattered remnants of sculpted mesas and Bluffs disappearing altogether in the flat depression farther to the north [Music] this transitional process can be observed

Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info In recent years, an incredible development has transpired in the space sciences. Mainstream astronomical literature now rather routinely acknowledges the existence of electric currents in space. But the question is, how significant a role do these electric currents play in the dynamics of the universe? In our most recent Space News, we reported on the discovery of a radio-emitting plasma filament which connects two galaxy clusters. If electric currents connect celestial objects at such vast cosmic distances, as plasma cosmologists have proposed for decades, then how might we also detect electric currrents in our own celestial neighborhood? Today, physicist Eugene Bagashov and several colleagues are attempting to answer this question through a detailed analysis of the conditions near our solar system. In part 3 of this four- part presentation, Eugene continues his discussion on the evidence for plasma currents connecting our solar system with the nearby interstellar environment. Let's examine some other evidence that the local interstellar chimney structure, where our solar system is situated, represents a large scale plasma filament. One of the interesting pieces of evidence is the existence of the so-called Gould Belt, the belt of bright stars, molecular clouds and star-forming regions encircling the Sun at an average distance of about 1,000 light years and having a thickness of about 2,000 light-years. Perhaps the most fascinating feature of that belt, if we look at it in galactic coordinates, is that it doesn't quite coincide with the galactic equator, that is the galactic disk, but is tilted with respect to it to an angle of 18 degrees or about so. In galactic coordinates, it makes it look like a sine wave with an amplitude of 18 degrees. This structure seems to be the largest of such sort in our vicinity, so it's not quite clear how it came to be and why is it tilted that way. But, as we've previously seen, the local chimney is also not strictly perpendicular to the galactic plane but slightly tilted. And if we compare the relative positions of the Gould Belt and the local chimney, it would become clear that the Belt, sort of, wraps around the chimney and is most likely related to it, rather than the larger structure of the galaxy itself. Moreover, the whole structure of the Chimney, plus the Gould Belt around it would immediately start to resemble the famous Squatterman Figure, a typical shape produced by the plasma discharge. We see a current column in the center that widens at the bigger distances up and down from the center and we see the torus around it represented by the Gould Belt. Take another look at this picture and you'll see what I mean. The characteristic circles are there on both sides of the chimney. In my opinion, it is highly unlikely that such a configuration was produced by some chaotic gravitational interactions. Moreover, another prominent structure of the so-called Lockman Hole coincides with the axis of the local chimney. Lockman Hole is defined as a region of a much lower density of neutral hydrogen, so it looks much more transparent in extreme ultraviolet and soft X-ray range and it doesn't glow as much itself in the infrared. But it might just be the case that the very fact that there's not much neutral material there, is only the consequence of a higher ionization. There's a stronger current shooting near the center of the local chimney so we don't see many neutral atoms along its way. One might also look at the parameter called the Interstellar Extinction. and has nothing to do with mass die-offs of species or something. It means the extinction of light that is its absorption or scattering by the interestellar dust or atoms. So if we look at both galactic hemispheres, north and south and measure this parameter across the sky, we'd see that right near the galactic north and south, perpendicular to the galactic plane, there are quite prominent clearings represented by the black plumes on this picture. The northern one, which you can see on the left, is exactly a Lockman Hole. It's evident that both of them more or less coincide with galactic north and south but not quite, they are slightly tilted, just like the chimney axis is. So they represent exactly that, the openings of the tube-like local chimney structure into the space below and above the galactic disk. The existence of these clearings has been quite an asset for extragalactic astronomy as they represent the more or less transparent windows into the outer universe. Perhaps another piece of evidence for plasma processes might be various anomalous readings of chemical compositions of stars, both in our vicinity and in the farther cosmos. Again, Pleiades cluster may be a great example, but as some of the papers indicate, the problem seems to persist for stellar clusters in general. The spectral characteristics of even the most typical stars somehow often violate the expectations, and perhaps it may all be tied to their positions with respect to the surrounding filamentary structures. Some works have actually directly stated that the anomalous stellar chemistry might be linked to the larger scale magnetic fields in the corresponding regions. One of the mechanisms of production of these chemical anomalies, as Don Scott himself indicates in one of his papers, might be in the so-called Marklund Convection, the sorting of the chemical elements in a Birkeland current column, according to their ionization potential. In fact, that might be one of the reasons why there's less hydrogen in the center of the local chimney column, just because, according to Marklund, Alfven and Scott, hydrogen would prefer to gather at the outermost shells of the chimney, sorted out by the convection in plasma. That way or another, this mechanism definitely deserves a lot of attention with regards to stellar chemistry, and plasma filaments might just be the right tool that the astrophysics was missing so far to explain many of these observed peculiarities. Another evidence for the actual existence of the plasma currents in the local chimney might be represented by the scattering of the radio waves. It has been previously shown that this process, which depends on the properties of interstellar medium, does not occur homogenously in the area of the local chimney. Which would mean that there are areas of higher and lower plasma density and perhaps, current strength. Speaking of current strength, one of the hypotheses in the Electric Universe is the possible relation of the brightness and temperature of the stars to the current density of the plasma filaments that interact with them. In that regard, I wish to bring up an interesting paper that discusses the changes in measured temperature of the star Arcturus, the brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere, over the span of several decades. The graph given in this paper is quite astonishing. It almost seems like the temperature of the star was steadily rising over a very short time span, at least in astrophysical terms. I haven't seen any explanations for that according to the current astrophysical models, but in the framework that we are dealing with here, perhaps we might assume that Arcturus was just pretty quickly moving into the area with a higher current density, and therefore its brightness increased. It's not very hard to believe in as, although it's pretty close to us, only some 37 light years or so, its velocity relative to the Sun is very high, some 122 km/second. That's about half of our own speed around the galactic center. Most of the other objects in our vicinity typically have speeds of maybe tens of km/s, relative to us. That is not the only example of such sort. Perhaps another one might be represented by another very bright star, in this case the brightest star in the whole sky, Sirius. It has been a mystery for quite a long time, why the ancient civilizations, including Egyptians, Greeks and Romans, called Sirius a red star. It is clearly bright blue right now, and couldn't possibly have been red, even 2,000 year ago according to the current stellar models. But perhaps the change in color of Sirius was caused by the same reason as brightening of Arcturus--the shift with respect to the surrounding plasma streams. We might see that on the scales of the local interstellar cloud, Sirius seems to currently occupy a somewhat clearer filamentary area. That may indicate a stronger current in the surroundings and therefore higher temperature of the star, whereas in ancient times it might have been connected to the local current filaments more poorly and demonstrate a somewhat dimmer red color. Another, perhaps more general consideration that we might take into account, concerns the frequency shifts of electromagnetic waves that travel within space plasmas. There has been some debate about the possible intrinsic redshifts of astrophysical objects as promoted by Halton Arp, etc, but there is a possibility that even the regular wave of light may change its frequency when it propagates through plasma. One of the known examples of that effect is the frequency blueshift of laser beams. It is known that under certain conditions, when the electromagnetic wave encounters an area of strong ionization, its frequency might rise quite significantly. Then there is a hypothesis that an inverse process, a redshift, might also occur in certain conditions, say if the plasma is very hot but has a very low density. So it could be seen that a lot of effects that might usually be attributed to, for example, Doppler frequency shift, might theoretically be related to the distribution of various cosmic plasma structures that the light that we observe was travelling through. Jim Weninger proposed an idea that, for example, the so called Flyby Anomalies might be explained through that. A Flyby Anomaly is an unexpected instantaneous change in speed of a spacecraft that performs a gravitational maneuver near Earth or other planet, at least one other example would be Jupiter. So, since the velocity of a spacecraft is measured through Doppler effect, it is quite possible that some similar plasma processes in the vicinity of Earth cause this frequency change, and not the actual change in velocity. If all that is correct, this is yet another indication that we need to pay more attention to the distrinbution of plasmas in the neighborhood of the solar system, the local interstellar cloud and the local chimney. Stay tuned for part 4 
[Music] Pulsars are mysterious objects that  emit electromagnetic radiation in a clockwork-like fashion. The period of this pulsing can be extremely short. Back in 1967, Jocelyn Bell Burnell, using a newly commissioned radio telescope, discovered a very strange signal. It was initially dismissed as radio interference by her supervisor. But continued observation showed that it appeared at the same declination and right ascension, which ruled out a terrestrial source of interference. They  eventually were able to resolve the signal as a series of pulses, evenly  spaced every 1.32 seconds. At the time, no astronomical object of that nature had ever been observed. Speculation as to the origin of the signal started to grow, with some even suggesting that the signal might be beamed to Earth from extraterrestrial intelligence. In December of the same year she managed to discover a second pulsar and ruled out the idea of it being a signal from ETs. In 1968 Thomas Gould suggested that pulsars were highly magnetized, rapidly rotating neutron stars. This model required a high energy plasma beam to be emitted from the poles of a spinning neutron star, and accelerated along the star's dipole magnetic field, emitting radiation as pulses towards the observer. Like the sweeping lights from a lighthouse. Since then many more pulsars have been observed, and the shortest pulse ever detected was a staggering 1.4 milliseconds. Where does the neutron star come from and why does it rotate so fast? The mainstream idea is that these objects are the remnants of a supernova explosion. The central region of a star collapses, crushing together every proton and electron into a neutron. The dense core of the star is all that is left. The angular momentum of the original star is conserved, meaning the much smaller object has to rotate at an incredible speed. The only way for those beams to be produced is in the presence of a very strong magnetic field. But all we have are neutrons. The origin of the critically strong magnetic field required for their model is therefore unclear. To add to these problems, a new pulsar has been discovered, which seems to rewrite a lot of these ideas. The pulsar had one of the slowest pulse rates ever seen, at 76 seconds. Most are  between a few seconds down to milliseconds. Apart from the unexpected pulse rate, it also seems to reside in what scientists call the “neutron star graveyard.” This is a region of space where they don't expect to detect any radio emissions,  at all. This is because they theorize that neutron stars here, are at the end of their life cycle and therefore not active. It is also unique, as it appears to produce at least seven distinctly different pulse shapes, whereas most neutron stars don't exhibit much  variety. This makes it hard for them to explain, using their model of a rotating beam. One particular type of pulse shows a strong quasi-periodic structure. This suggests that a type of oscillation is driving the radio emissions. This is a large clue to understanding what causes the pulses in the pulsar. Anthony Peratt and Kevin Healy have proposed a completely different mechanism, which would not require a fast spinning plasma beam, but instead, utilize the known properties of transmission lines. This is similar to the way planetary magnetospheres are described. If the  star is surrounded by a disk of plasma, then it is likely that it is electro- magnetically coupled to the magnetosphere via field-aligned currents. In a lossless line with perfect end-conductors, the pulses propagate back and forth forever. In reality, the kinetic energy of the relativistic current flowing along the guide’s magnetic field is lost in synchrotron radiation. Any  disturbance on a transmission line, such as an arc discharge or an interruption of steady-state conditions, results in initiation of travelling waves, which propagate towards the ends of the line, where they may be reflected and modified, attenuated and distorted by any losses until they die out. Field-aligned current pulses propagate at high latitudes along the dipole magnetic field. Two regions of high density plasma terminate this magnetospheric transmission line: plasma near the  pulsar surface, and plasma at the disk. The transmission line may also contain a double layer. This structure forms a toroid and the relativistic current pulses propagate within the toroid waveguide. The pulsar's magnetospheric transmission line can be modeled by two current- conducting boundaries that represent the inward and outward field-aligned currents. The line is terminated by two conductors - the pulsar surface and the disc. A voltage pulse is launched from the pulsar surface. This ends up being reflected back, which changes its polarity. In both simulations and experiments carried out by Peratt and Healy, they saw both single and double pulse profiles. When they included the effects of plasma flowing between the current boundaries, some important modifications were observed. As the electric field propagates along the line, electrons accelerate away from the boundary. Due to the intense magnetic field associated with the current pulse, they are constrained to flow along the ExB drift, rather than across the line. This means that the entire line acts as a continuous source of low level radiation and noise. All pulsars show this background radiation. Whether the radiated pulse has a single or double pulse profile, will depend on the extent of the radiation region at the pulsar surface. If the radiating current is confined to a shallow region instead of an extended region, a single pulse profile will replace the double profile. This effect is actually frequency dependent. Lower frequencies are associated with fields that are extended in the emission region and are more likely to show pulse structure. The source of the radiation energy is not contained within the pulsar, but may instead derive from either the pulsar's interaction with its environment, or by energy delivered by an external circuit. This means that pulsars do not have to be composed of neutrons. They are  simply no different than a normal star. What has changed is its electrical  environment causing a resonance in the circuit, which creates the pulses. In the distant past, this star might have suffered a catastrophic short circuit. So violent is the discharge, that it is not only creating heavy elements in the process, but also explodes the entire surface double layer. With nothing to hold back the charges, the majority of the material that made up the star races outwards in an explosion. In some cases, a remnant remains after this process. The electrical power input continues  to drive the magnetospheric circuit to produce the characteristic pulsar emissions. No  neutrons, no spinning beams, simply a star that has changed its electrical environment, causing a resonance in its circuit which creates the pulses. [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info For nearly half a century, the chief principals of The Thunderbolts Project have been presenting a scientific case for relatively recent celestial catastrophes in the inner solar system, within human memory. These events were recorded in the myths and storytelling of ancient man in prehistory. The dramas reverberating through generations and shaping the earliest civilizations. The catastrophes were electromagnetic in nature. Planets seen in the earthly sky discharging electrically, the Thunderbolts of the gods. But what about more recent disasters in the AD time periods? Disasters that also may have been triggered by fundamentally electromagnetic phenomena in the solar system. In recent episodes, Thunderbolts colleague Peter Mungo Jupp has explored the voluminous evidence for the electrical nature of comets. As Jupp has noted, it is an unlikely coincidence that mankind viewed comets for millennia as harbingers of doom and destruction. In modern times, we witnessed the spectacular influence of a comet on a planet in Shoemaker-Levy 9's close encounter with Jupiter. In this episode, Jupp offers the provocative conjecture that such an encounter between our own planet and a cometary intruder may have caused an AD disaster that caused the death of tens of millions of human beings, the so-called plague of Justinian. Thomas Short, writing in the 18th century, chronicled the many calamities that had decimated mankind over the last 4,000 years. Earthquakes, plagues, pestilence, incredibly overwhelming floods. But as you read through this curious book you were intrigued by the number of comets associated with these dramas unmatched in modern history. In the early century of the present era, the Romans at one time counted 50 comets in their skies. This is unheard of today. With the skies over Rome at the end of a bloody era, that only in recent centuries has become stabilized, can there be bones of truth in this mythology? They're invariably connected to the major disasters and up until the 1800's mankind held a fear of comets. What happened? Then the age of reason struck and incredibly, the number of highly visible comets shrunk. Has something happened? Eventually, by the end of the 20th century, it became scientific dogma the Comets were dusty snowballs. How incredibly wrong this early scientific theory has been proven by modern science and its observation of comets! So we've seen the dramatic effects comets can have on at least Jupiter and the Sun. But what about the planets and particularly Earth? Have comets in the past had dramatic effects on Earth? And this is where we come to plague, war, flood, earthquakes, pestilence and famine. Has in fact the cosmos; in the form of comets, the Sun, planets in disturbed motion, all the outer reaches of the universe; affected Earth and caused chaos? Has in fact this occurred on the Earth? Have comets caused the demise of civilizations? Claude Schaeffer documented at least six destructions of civilizations prior to the Christian era spanning at least 2,000 years. But did later lower scale calamities also affect civilizations? I suspect yes. So now let's go the first of these more recent deadly events. 1500 years ago, a pungent plague nearly exterminated mankind. The Emperor Justinian from Constantinople gave his name to this empire wrecker. Thomas Short wrote, from 560 AD a plague raged for 52 years the like of which has never been seen before. Conventional wisdom maintains this war by plague began in Ethiopia and was carrried by ship-borne rats to Europe and beyond. And we don't forget with our new knowledge of bacteria and viruses being carried by vectors far above the earth, this theory of deployment has been questioned. Our pertinent scrutiny ask not only what caused this exterminating plague with its incredible and unmatched virulence but whether some parallel catastrophic events had a similar foundational driver. How Deadly was the Justinian Plague? It was totally chaotic in nature. It's struck in many different seasons with its virulence and invasiveness change from city to city and amongst every age group and gender it was ruthlessly indiscriminate and even if you survived, no immunity was guaranteed upon the next episode. Death was usually within three days from multiple causes, buboes and high fever, carbuncles and suicidal madness. But quick and immediate death. The mortality rate was horrific when compared to modern experiences of plague or any other pathology. Short says, for instance, than in ancient Constantinople, that's Istanbul, 10,000 people died a day when the plague struck. Placing this dreadful scourge aside and examining parallel events, we find some remarkable coincidences. During this plague period, no less than 9 highly visible comets were seen. Weird, blood-colored flashing skies and strangely multiple suns often accompanied this scenario. Also associated were 10 incredibly destructive earthquake storms, for instance Antioch 200,000 dead, and 7 worldwide mega famines. Accompanying this were totally chaotic and unseasonal weather with cataclysmic inundations by water, wind and temperatures. Now this stage, I emphasize, these famines and other dramas were not normal occurrences. For instance on several occasion, Short notes, the famines were so devastating that women horrifically ate or sold their own children to survive. In the widespread earthquakes whole towns were swallowed up and lakes formed and cities burned. Was this perhaps from methane seepage or massive lightning storms plasmoids? Are these parallel events associated? The possibility of an Electro-universe connection should be considered. For instance, what drives the virulence of bacteria? Stimulation of growth and degradation by ions, neutrons, electrons and the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation are claimed from various sources. That's what place do not only solar events have to play in bacterial invasiveness but possibly of mankind's classically dreaded Comet. Comets, although they travel fairly well-defined elliptical orbits, are virtually undecoded phenomena. Some passed by the Sun harmlessly, some disintegrate and break into many sections, such as Shoemaker-Levy 9 when it collided with Jupiter. Others grazed by the Sun with little known effects. Whereas occasionally some bury themselves into Sun and appear to translate to coronal mass ejections on the opposite side. The factors governing this seemingly, but probably not, chaotic behavior is a mystery. Have we come to understand they are negatively charged, somewhat like a mobile z-pinch? They must therefore interrelate to other electrets. But the methodology of this behavior is merely speculation and certainly Shorts' novels show anecdotal evidence and suggest just this inferred behavior of these 9 spectacular comets that occurred during the Justinian plague. Now equally we're satisfied that earthquakes are shaped in some way by electrical phenomena. It's always been a puzzle to where do an earthquake comes from. The energy comes from the stored electric charge within the earth. If a discharge takes place beneath the earth then you must get effects on the surface that are felt and the earthquake is one such consequence. - Right, so it's just like thunder - Underground, yes Finally, weather is more and more being seen as an electrical phenomena, certainly by EU advocates. In addition, chaos theory maintains that outside attractors establish a new harmonic. These constantly adjusting perhaps radically adjusting electromagnetic influences are the central cause of heavily chaotic unceasing and extreme weather such as floods. This in turn causes dramatic famine and drought. From all these possibly related events Short quotes, "two-thirds of all people died." This is a summary from one of his primary sources, The Chronicle Magdeburg. This Justinian plague was preceded often by the appearance of several suns at the same time. Other times, the Sun was quite darkened. A comet appeared a whole year together adding forth its beams like swords. The heavens seemed all the flame and several other medias fell. Nowadays we automatically dismiss this evidence from a bygone era as fanciful, exaggerated and primitive. But there's bigger questions here. Could these cosmic dramas that influence weather also be driving plagues, locusts, inundations, earthquakes and the very wars of mankind. And the big unanswered question, comets. Historically, always feared in man's history of legends. If a comet can hit Jupiter, Shoemaker-Levy 9, or a comet can cause the Sun to have a massive CME, could not they too be involved in this cosmic drama that affects weather, plague and earthquakes. Unanswered questions needing more investigation. 
[Music] Star clusters are large groups of stars. Globular clusters are tightly bound together and can consist of hundreds of millions of stars. Open clusters are more loosely clustered groups of stars, generally containing as little as only a few hundred stars. The Hyades is our nearest open star cluster - it is located about 153 light years away from the Sun. It is roughly spherical in shape and consists of hundreds of stars that appear to be of a similar type, age, and composition and they all have the same proper motion through space. You can observe this cluster by looking at the Taurus constellation, where the brightest star forms a V-shape along with a still brighter Alpha Tauri star. Alpha Tauri is actually not part of this cluster. It just sits in the line-of-sight of the cluster. Astronomers estimate that the age of the Hyades Cluster is about 625 million years. The core of the cluster has a radius of nearly 9 lightyears. The stars in this cluster are more enriched in the heavier elements than our Sun and the other stars in our neighborhood. This puts these stars in a different stellar group to our Sun. Their age, metallicity and proper motions coincide with those of the larger and more distant Beehive Cluster, which is situated about 600 lightyears away from Earth. In a new study, astronomers think an invisible force is tearing apart the Hyades Cluster. They think that the culprit for this may well be a dark matter substructure. This would contain the mass of 10 million suns and yet be totally invisible to us. Using the data from ESA’s Gaia satellite, they were able to create a new map of the Hyades Cluster. In this data they identified a massive bump in this  cluster. They believe that the gravitational forces that target the cluster, have, over the eons, sculpted two structures known as tidal tails, that sweep out in front and behind the central hub of stars. They believe that something is pulling apart one of these tails. Scientists initially produced a simulation of the cluster in order to attempt to predict the current positions and velocities of the stars over time. When they then compared this to the actual data from Gaia, a discrepancy appeared. The  trailing tail in the real data had far fewer stars compared to their model. In order to explain this, they postulated a close encounter with a massive galactic lump. The problem was that this would need to be incredibly massive and yet there was no trace of it. Their solution was to suggest that it was being caused by dark matter, the invisible force that all too often is used to explain phenomena that don't match their models. Let's just take a little step back here. The first question to ponder on is that of the tidal tails. We see these on different scales. Stellar tidal tails are thought to form as a result of the rotation of the star cluster around the galactic center. As the  center of the clusters are highly populated, some stars can gain enough velocity to escape  the cluster. These escapees will tend to leave via two points, but continue to orbit the cluster. Over time the cluster becomes more smeared out over these points. It should  be noted that we have not actually observed this happening. We only see the various states of these clusters. Do we see these tails elsewhere? Yes, we see many of these examples in galaxies. These are thought to be galaxies that are in the process of merging. As one passes close enough to the other, it disrupts the stars in the outer area and smears them out creating a tail. But do we know that these galaxies are actually in the process of merging? Well, the short answer is no. it is inferred from what they observe in the still images. Halton Arp had a very different view of these so-called mergers. His view  was that new matter was being created in the center of galaxies and pushed outwards. This could form lumps of gas which might turn into quasars that would continue to move away, and would eventually form a companion galaxy. He felt that these so-called mergers were in fact the opposite. A prime example of this is Arp 105. This is  considered to be a merger of two galaxies, when in fact the obvious conclusion is that of a proto-galaxy being ejected jet-like, from an active elliptical galaxy. Exactly opposite this is the counter-jet, a magnificent straight plume, punching  through a disrupted spiral. Very close to this ejector galaxy, we also find the telltale signs of a high redshift quasar. When you examine the redshift of most of the companions around this galaxy, they were all positively red-shifted with respect to the dominant galaxy. If these companions were falling in or orbiting the dominant galaxy, you would expect to find as many relatively positive, as minus velocities. The fact that they were not, clearly indicated they were all moving away from the central dominant galaxy. In other words, they had been  ejected. Another example that is worth considering is ESO 161 IG 24. Here, a  galaxy seems to have developed a clustering of material along its arms, possibly showing this ejection process can also follow out along the arms. And this is probably a more classical image showing these tidal arms. So what is the difference between this galaxy and a barred spiral galaxy then? Essentially they both have arms protruding, one just has longer ones. Astronomers will tell you that the bars form when stellar orbits in a spiral galaxy become unstable and deviate from a circular path. These grow over time and are eventually locked into place making a bar. In the Electric Universe, these spiral arms are formed by filaments that twist their way back to the central plasmoid, which powers the galaxy. This will form a loop-back much further out. In the case of the tidal arm in this galaxy, are we not just looking at an arm where the filaments in the arm have been pulled much further outwards? Returning to the star cluster, the first obvious point to discuss is the shape of the whole cluster. It is interpreted as a central cluster with two tidal tails. If we examine this structure, you might see something a little different. If we ignore the idea that this was originally a spherical cluster, and instead focus on the shape, we  see something rather more obvious. The stars are all located within a narrow band that twists towards the center, and then flows out on the opposite side. We also know that these stars are of a similar composition and of the same proper motions as the Beehive Cluster. Is it possible these two are connected along a stellar filament? Could the reason  we see such a high density of stars around this point, be due to the formation of a pinching in this area, leading to an instability in the filament, causing the shape we see and also the much higher number of stars in this area? The difference between one side and the other, would be accounted for by the pinching being less restrictive on one side, compared to the other. We know that open clusters are confined to the galactic plane and are almost always found within the spiral  arms. This is exactly where we would expect to see filament structures. One other  example of an open cluster is the Pleiades, which we have previously speculated sits at the center of the filament we are also part of. and passes up through the galactic plane, creating the structure we see, called the local chimney. This we speculated was created in a massive pinching effect. So the open clusters therefore show us an area that has experienced an intense pinching effect, causing  the rapid formation of many stars in a very confined area. Could these clusters, instead help us to map out some of these larger filament structures running all along the spiral arms of the galaxy? [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info A new scientific paper provides stunning confirmation of one of the most striking predictions of the Electric Universe/ catastrophist hypothesis. The paper, published in the journal Icarus, reports that the water in Saturn's moons and in its rings is remarkably similar to water on our own planet, a completely unexpected finding for planetary scientists. The team of scientists made the discovery by remotely measuring the isotopic ratios of water and carbon dioxide in the Saturnian system. As reported by the Phys.org the findings "...mean we need to change models of the formation of the Solar System because the new results are in conflict with existing models. Models for the formation of the Solar System indicate that the deuterium/hydrogen ratio should be much higher in the colder outer solar system than in the hotter inner system where the Earth formed. Deuterium is more abundant in cold molecular clouds. Some models predict the deuterium hydrogen ratio should be 10 times higher for the Saturn system than on Earth. But the new measurements show this is not the case for Saturn's rings and satellites except Saturn's moon Phoebe. Those who follow this series understand this is only the latest in a seemingly endless string of 'surprises' for the standard model of our solar system's formation and history. Discovery continues to offer no support at all to the widely accepted nebular hypothesis which states that planets formed from accretion in a nebular cloud that collapsed gravitationally billions of years ago. However, as unexpected as the connection between Saturn and our own planet is for planetary scientists, this connection was in fact explicitly predicted by one of the great scientific heretics of the 20th century. Nearly 3/4 of a century ago, Dr. Immanuel Velikovsky proposed that within human memory, a period of chaos reigned in the inner solar system. In this scenario, one of the migrating planets was Saturn. And it was Velikovsky's seemingly outrageous thesis that the water in Earth's oceans came from the gas giant. In part one of this two-part presentation, physicist Wal Thornhill outlines the incredible and ongoing predictive success of the Electric Universe/ catastrophist paradigm. There has been a flood of scientific reports recently, supporting the Electric Universe model and confirming its predictions. But the most spectacular example of predictive success occurred on December 3rd when it was reported in phys.org that the water in Saturn's rings and satellites is like that on Earth! Astonishingly, the water has the same signature isotopic ratios of deuterium to hydrogen or heavy water to normal water. It happened that the founder of mythohistorical cosmology, Dr. Immanuel Velikovsky, made the shocking claim based on his research in the 1940's that Earth's water came from Saturn. Of course, a single success is open to the charge that it was a lucky guess, no matter how well-documented the research, but Velikovsky went on to be the only scholar before the Space Age to successfully predict the extreme surface temperature of Venus, the remnant magnetism of Moon rocks, radio noises from Jupiter and many other remarkable discoveries. His thesis uncovered a period within mythic human memory of awe-inspiring chaos in the planetary system involving electrical discharges between planets during close encounters, the mythic thunderbolts of the planetary gods. The ancients were adamant, as Heraclitus around 500 BC put it, "...it is the thunderbolt that steers the universe." It was no earthly spark; it took the strange involuted corkscrew form of plasmoids and was associated with stones or meteorites falling from the sky, and global devastation. It was Velikovsky who first threw down the gauntlet to modern astronomers to recognize electricity in space. They refused to pick it up and instead behaved like the Inquisition against Galileo. It seems, an unstable solar system was against their religion. To squash growing interest in his ideas on campuses in America in the 70's, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, known as the AAAS, organized the thinly disguised ambush in San Francisco in 1974. It became a rallying cry for dissident scholars to attend the first international symposium on Velikovsky and the recent history of the solar system in Hamilton Ontario later that year where, incidentally, I met Velikovsky and David Talbott for the first time. But nothing has changed in the following decades despite the Space-Age discovery that magnetism exists throughout the universe. It shows that astrophysics is in the wrong hands and should be passed to electrical engineers. Velikovsky's best-selling book 'Worlds in Collision' published in 1950, was the inspiration for a number of scholars which has lately resulted in a truly interdisciplinary cosmology based on human history and the electrical nature of matter and matter interactions including the forces of magnetism and gravity. The Electric Universe was developed in an effort to explain the remarkable research results of those inspired by Velikovsky's forensic technique of investigating mythic history, in particular the works of David Talbott and Dwardu Cardona concerning the worship and central role of Saturn as our original Sun. Electric Universe cosmology reestablishes the successful classical physics of the 18th and 19th centuries and its extraordinary successful space-age predictions contrast markedly with the lack of predictive success for the last century of the purely theoretical approach which adopts mathematical concepts and ideals without regard for the principles of physics or basic standards and definitions. A classic case of the 'cart before the horse.' The recent discovery of the isotopic likeness between the water of Saturn's rings and the Earth is documented in the Icarus paper 'Isotopic Ratios of Saturn's Rings and Satellites: Implications for the Origin of Water and Phoebe'. The simplest interpretation is that the long-held model of the formation of the solar system is invalid. The Phys.org reports, "By developing a new method for measuring isotopic ratios of water and carbon dioxide remotely, scientists have found that the water in Saturn's rings and satellites is unexpectedly like water on the Earth... Adding a neutron to one hydrogen atom, (that) then called deuterium, increases the mass of a water molecule by about 5%, in other words - heavy water, and that small change results in isotopic differences in the formation of a planet, moon or comet, and changes the evaporation of water after formation. The deuterium to hydrogen ratio is a fingerprint of the formation conditions, including temperature and evolution over time. Evaporating water enriches deuterium in the remaining surface. Models for the formation of the solar system indicate that the deuterium to hydrogen ratio should be much higher in the colder outer Solar System than in the hotter inner system where the Earth formed." Planetary scientists faced a fundamental problem to explain the presence of our oceans. The hydrogen and oxygen required would have been swept out of the inner solar system by the early Sun. So, they resorted to an ad hoc story that countless comet collisions from a hypothetical invisible cloud of comets enclosing the solar system deposited the Earth's water eons ago. This new discovery discounts that hypothesis. A simple hypothesis will connect Saturn's rings' material with the Earth. True the deuterium to hydrogen ratio is a fingerprint of the water formation conditions and it is more straightforward to not assume evolution of the ratio and to suggest that it is a fingerprint of the origin of the water on Earth. Given the success of Velikovsky's remarkable prediction based on documented evidence, we cannot simply assume the Earth formed in the inner solar system. This latest evidence clearly supports Velikovsky's mytho-historical cosmology which identifies a close association between Saturn and the Earth within human experience. That means the comforting belief the Earth has been circling the Sun like it does today largely undisturbed for billions of years, has been as great an impediment to scientific progress as the centuries-long and even more comforting belief in a primordially Earth-centered universe. Of course, too shockingly unexpected and related discovery supporting an earlier scientific claim, raises the odds enormously in favor of a hypothesis. This was true of Immanuel Velikovsky's later claim in 1950, of the extreme surface heat of Venus, when everyone else believed it will be similar to Earth because the two planets are twins according to conventional thinking. But the gravitational model of the formation of the solar system, eons ago, has been shown to be fictional now that we have discovered thousands of exoplanetary systems that don't match it. It persists only because it is the foundation of our uniformitarian belief in a safe, clockwork solar system. It is merely a soothing bedtime story about the history of Earth and our misunderstood and forgotten ancestors. De Santillana and von Dechend in Hamlet's Mill, described our period as 'The Darwinian Period' Where "the simple idea of evolution, which it is no longer thought necessary to examine, spreads like a tent over all those ages that lead from primitivism into civilization. Gradually, we are told, step by step, men produced the arts-and-crafts, this and that, until they emerged into the light of history. Those soporific words 'gradually' and 'step by step' repeated incessantly, are aimed at covering an ignorance which is both vast and surprising. One should like to inquire; which steps; But then one is lulled, overwhelmed and stupefied by the gradualness of it all, which is at best a platitude, only good for pacifying the mind, since no one is willing to imagine that civilization appeared in a thunderclap. The use of the word 'thunderclap' is remarkably appropriate. And that is the crux of the problem, for Velikovsky's proposal of a red-hot cometary Venus as a motivation for the sudden rise of civilization challenged that comforting Darwinian belief. The result was a modern equivalent to medieval book burning. The textbook publisher Macmillan was threatened by latter-day astronomer priests who boasted they had not read the book because it was obviously wrong; it didn't obey Newton's laws; and stopped the publication of a best-seller. Specialism and an instinctive desire for celestial law and order rendered them blind to the forensic mythohistorical evidence Velikovsky had drawn together to understand the creation stories globally, referred to almost unimaginably spectacular and terrifying behavior of the planets. Velikovsky claimed it was the origin of our instinctive doomsday fear. Creation originally referred to the phases of the celestial spectacle and not to the universe. That makes sense. Modern cosmologists bit off more than they could chew and they suppose they had to compete with a universal creation story that doesn't make sense. So what does Venus got to do with the water in Saturn's rings and satellites being found like that on Earth? The answer lies in the inspiration generated among a remarkable group of scholars by Velikovsky's well-documented thesis that early humanity witnessed Venus's birth and early appearance as the archetypal comet. He wrote, "In former times the planets played a decidedly more important role in the imagination of peoples, to which fact their religions give testimony. True, Sun and Moon were also numbered among the planet gods, but usually they were not the most important ones. Their enumeration among the seven planets sometimes startles the modern scholar because these two luminaries are so much more conspicuous than the other planets. The dominance of Saturn, Jupiter, Venus and Mars must startle us even more as long as we do not know what was displayed on the celestial scene a few thousand years ago. The mythologies of all peoples concern themselves with the birth only of Venus, not with that of Jupiter, Mars or Saturn. Venus experienced in quick succession its birth and expulsion under violent conditions; an existence as a comet on an ellipse which approached the Sun closely; two encounters with the Earth accompanied by discharges of potentials between these two bodies [that is, thunderbolts of the planetary gods]... Of course, as a pioneer, Velikovsky made errors, chief among them was his placement of planetary chaos within historical times. The events he describes were memories at the times the pyramids were built as evidenced by the Pyramid Texts. The plasma forms seen in the sky were chiseled into rock in the form of petroglyphs. It seems reasonable to suggest that echoes of the prehistoric catastrophes reverberated down into historical times and catalyzed descriptions in terms of the remembered doomsday events. As to the first cause of havoc in the solar system, Velikovsky made this astounding intuitive leap. "Some dark star, like Jupiter or Saturn, may be in the path of the Sun and may be attracted to the system and cause havoc in it." But of course astronomers were right. This mytho-historical reconstruction was unique and could not be explained by the physics then or now. With no experience of the events of the myth-making epoch, the questions never occurred. It has taken lifelong dedication by a number of scholars with the courage to pursue Velikovsky's leads in the face of indifference and hostility, to understand his errors and to produce a surprisingly detailed sequence of events that demanded scientific explanations. It resulted in a truly interdisciplinary Electric Universe cosmology with profound scientific and cultural significance for our future. As evidence, in June 2004, just prior to the Cassini spacecraft arriving at Saturn, I published 'Cassini's Homecoming' which was to show again the explanatory and predictive power of this multidisciplinary cosmology. I wrote, "...a scenario follows that is so alien to any conventional theory of Saturn's history that it should be easily tested against information gained from the Cassini mission. It shows striking connections between many seemingly unrelated facts about certain planets." It's an epic story and it involves us. In our next episode, Thornhill will outline the successful predictions he offered in 2004 prior to the Cassini-Huygens mission to Saturn. Predictions based in part on the mytho-historical reconstruction which has revealed the incredible yet forgotten role that Saturn played in the myth-making epoch in prehistory. 
I actually changed the title a little bit it says was the Big Bang a fizzle in reality I don't think the Big Bang ever happens so the the real question is is the Big Bang Theory of fizzle modern cosmologists would have us believe that thirteen point seven five billion years ago a spot of infinite density and infinite temperature and infinitely small for some inexplicable reason exploded in an event now known as the Big Bang one way to put it is that in the being in the beginning there was nothing and then nothing exploded now scientists have spent a lot of time working on this big thing Big Bang Theory and they've taken it down to an incredible amount of detail and here's a short extract I'll just read this from Wikipedia I hope you don't fall asleep on me approximately ten are approximately one trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang happened and we got into the expansion phase of the Big Bang a phase transition caused a cosmic inflation during which the universe grew exponentially after this inflation stopped the universe consisted of quark gluon plasma as well as all the other elementary particles now I don't know about you when I first was introduced introduced to this theory I was flabbergasted who in the world has the hubris to think that they can ascertain what happened in the first trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second of an event that occurred 13.7 5 billion years ago now there are cosmologists that have spent their entire career lecturing on this subject writing books about the subject teaching their students grading their grades deciding whether or not they're going to advance in their careers based on whether or not they support this subject and billions have been spent on machines to try to figure out whether the theory is correct we built the Large Hadron Collider we have incredible telescopes that have been put up and we have space probes then they're just trying to earn out the last few minor little details about this theory here's a graph here's a graph showing part of the progression and you can it's kind of hard to read but up here we start at 10 to the minus 43 seconds on up to the 10 to the minus 10 seconds finally at about 300,000 years we actually start creating atoms complete atoms and then we get into about a thousand million years after this occurred we start getting into galaxies there's a lot of different charts and things you can find on this theory and they get there's there's a wide variety of theories actually out there but I gotta say that as a person who was very interested in science and wanted to study science as a child I was a little bit jaded by the whole thing and I started thinking that maybe there's a better career so I'm much I'm much different than a lot of the presenters here I don't have a degree in physics I haven't written any books and after trying school three different times I never really made it through but I've read hundreds of books I have enough credit hours to get several degrees but what happened was and when I was a kid this is my story as I found out about Immanuel Velikovsky and and I know a lot of people here kind of got their start into this this direction with Immanuel Velikovsky and he taught me several things one thing is that science the scientists and they're out there that are publishing all these these documents really may not know everything I also learned that in order to derive a complete theory about everything you have to include everything so you can't ignore what the religions and the myths and the geologists and the archaeologists are saying if you're going to create a theory describing the creation of the universe so a full understanding requires that we take into account everything that we've learned i also learned from Velikovsky that if you're going to come out with a new theory or something that opposes the the mainstream thought it's not going to be accepted easily and in fact Belikov ski was vilified for what he wrote refuse to read his work or even consider it and the Velikovsky affair where they talk about science not being able to accept his theory there's actually a bigger story than what Velikovsky himself wrote in high school I was asked to do a report on a fiction book and I told my teacher I thought that was a waste of time and I asked her if I could do a autobiography on I signed instead and she go ahead went ahead and let me do it and there was a quote in there and it said that when Arthur Stanley Eddington was asked how it feels to be one of the only three people who understand relativity he answered who's the third now I'm a farm boy from Colorado and I read this and I thought how in the world will I ever be able to contribute to that that line of thought so instead I figured that maybe I should get into something a little more real and I thought maybe designing toasters would be a lot more rewarding than studying quantum mechanics or black holes so I got a job in the semiconductor industry as an electrical engineer and I ended up working a lot with statistical analysis of data trying to find patterns automatically in semiconductors there's a massive amount of data and a lot of it never gets looked at so I created programs that would try to find here you see in the middle the pattern that shows up I also got a chance to look into plasma edge equipment and plasma is used extensively in semiconductor manufacturing to create the integrated circuits that are in our phones and our TVs and everything else and here's an example of a plasma edge equipment it was kind of fun I got to change gasp gasps compositions temperatures RF power and just play around with it I spent hundreds of hours looking into these and when I looked up and saw the twin jet nebula it became apparent to me that this is not an exploding supernova this is a plasma formation I now do contract work working with highly sophisticated websites that are data and media intensive so if anyone needs something like that just give me a call that but I very clearly remember though about five years ago when I was reading on the internet and discovered the electric universe theory and this brought it all back to me this brought back the joy of science and exploration it was no longer the science of the advanced mathematics that no one else can understand instead it brought it back to the the science that creates this modern world it's the electromagnetism that we know about in our motors and generators and oscillators transmitters receivers all the things that have created our modern world are incorporated into the electric universe theory it's no longer it's something that is only the the gods of the mathematics or the high-end mathematic people that can understand even a mere mortal like myself could understand this and I like to talk I like a microphone it's fun to get up in front of a group so I started talking about the electric universe and I'm as a member of Toastmasters I had to give weekly presentations and and I started kind of branching out and doing service groups like the rotary group and Lions group and I belonged to a couple spiritual groups and there they're all excited about this and so I started giving presentations and I kind of boiled this down oh this will be an oversimplification but I boiled down the the two major ideas I see that are wrong with with cosmology today and into two concepts and one of them is is that gravity is the primary force that shapes the universe and electricity plays no role now there's a bunch of presentations on this you're gonna hear about them from other people these are kind of some of the ideas that have fallen out of that and I'm really not going to cover this any farther but there's another idea which I felt never really was covered adequately in these in these conferences and that's the idea that redshift can be used to measure velocity and therefore can be used to measure distance so when you hear that a galaxy or a quasar or some object has been found that's a hundred million light years away this is the Met that they're using to measure that and so some of the ideas that fall out of that is that the universe started with the Big Bang that's because we believe that the universe is expanding and if it's expanding then and at some point it must have all been back together at one point so there was a start to the universe and it's been expanding ever since after the Big Bang and then they discovered that the rate of expansion appears to be increasing and if the rate of expansion is increasing something an anti gravity like force is pushing the universe apart and they called this dark energy and then another conjecture that kind of is predicated all of this is that matter is the same across the universe and this means that a proton weighs the same here in our galaxy as it doesn't another galaxy as it does anywhere else now I don't know anyone that's ever sampled another galaxy and actually measured a proton and one of these other galaxies but this is a very strong underpinning to this whole story of redshift so you might ask what is redshift all back back in 1842 a gentleman named Christian Doppler took a train a flatbed and put a band on it and ran it by some observers and they would listen to it and they all had perfect pitch I guess and they would listen to the change in pitch and the idea is with with sound is that when a train goes by you hear a triangle you don't actually need the band you can forget the band but no train goes by you hear it it goes and it drops in pitch or another idea is a car when you hear a car go by it goes whereas you never hear a car go free so there's a drop in pitch and the same thing happens with light light is just another example of something vibrating and up here in this first picture if you imagine that this galaxy here is stationary and we are on the earth looking at it and we see an absorption line so there's a dark spot that shows up in the spectrum and in this case we'll just put it in the middle because that's a good way to do this example in this case we have a galaxy that's moving away from us and that effectively links it lengthens out this wave a little bit and that causes the light to shift a little to the red there's a little bit slower frequency light likewise if you have an object moving towards the US then it's going to shift a little bit to the blue now as it turns out almost every object we see outside of our galaxy is shifted red there are virtually there are very very few objects that are blue shifted or moving towards us and that's why we believe in the expanding universe this came about with Milton Humason back in 1927 discovered that these remote galaxies were red shifted and then George Lemaitre and I probably dis clobbered that was a Belgian priest and he actually proposed this Big Bang Theory and then finally in 1929 Edwin Hubble who the Hubble telescopes named after proposed Hubble's law and and there's really two parts to the law and that's all objects in deep space are red shifted and that's not quiet there are a couple that are blue shifted but then also from that he determined that this redshift is proportional to their distance to earth so once again when you hear about objects that are a hundred million light years away that is coming from this idea of redshift Carl Sagan actually in cosmos in chapter 10 quoted and and I had to cut out a bunch of what he wrote because Carl Sagan can really talk a lot I'm not sure he says a lot sometimes but the main point is is that Halton ARP has found enigmatic and disturbing cases where a galaxy and a quasar that are an apparent physical Association have very different redshifts and if this is the case if a object is the quasars are supposed to be at the very edge of the Gallic or the universe there they're so far away there are 12 billion light-years away according to conventional cosmology and if for some reason you can see a relationship with an alleged nearby object then something's wrong with the whole idea of a redshift and this is actually I should clarify as recessional red ship or a redshift of an object moving away or away from us or towards us there are other types of redshift there is gravitational redshift there is thought to be we'll get into a third one here in a second with ARP but at the end it says our if ARP is right the exotic mechanisms proposed to explain the energy of these distant quasars would prove unnecessary now these quasars are allegedly at the edge of the universe and yet we can still see them and if we can see them they must be incredibly powerful and it was brought up last night about a quasar that was thought to be 12 billion light years of promise and the the web says that it's 20 billion times the size of our Sun has that has a mass of 20 billion times that of our Sun and they're thought to be this water cloud around it of a hundred and forty trillion times that of the Earth's oceans and it emanates the energy I thought this was incredible anime emanates the energy equivalent of a hundred trillion of our Suns now this all comes from the idea that it's 12 billion light years away if it happens to be much much much closer than suddenly this could be just a normal object it doesn't have to be anything dissing credible because quasar thought quasars are thought to be the most luminous most powerful and energetic energetic objects known in the universe and that then this brings us to the whole point of this this presentation is Hall nerve Halton ARP went to school in Harvard and then got his PhD at Caltech and he actually did some work for Hubble in his early career looking for Novas he worked at Mount Wilson in Mount Palomar as a staff astronomer so he wasn't a cosmologists sitting at a supercomputer doing simulations he actually looked through telescopes and he created the ARP Atlas superior galaxy showing 333 galaxies that he thought didn't fit the model that most people believed in he wrote several other books about redshift and a lot of this presentation is taken from this book here seen read so what's his evidence and there's a lot of different evidence I just have a couple of them up here the main ones here but one of the main pieces of evidence is that he has found pairs of quasars on opposite sides of nearby galaxies and once again the quasars are far away the galaxies are very close how is it that these quasars could be related to this this closeby galaxy here's an example missus I see 1767 it's called a cipher galaxy a Seyfert galaxies is known to emit lots of x-rays and radio waves and they found these two quasars right next to it now what's odd about this is that these numbers here this point six one six and point six six and nine are our indicators of the redshift and if it's a positive number that means that it's redshifted is moving away from us if it's a negative number it's blue shifted and moving towards us and these two red shifts are extremely close and the probability of finding two quasars opposite a central galaxy with an extremely close redshift is very very low and I don't remember the exact numbers on this but I know he quotes numbers one and ten thousand one in a hundred thousand for some of these different examples I'll show you so the conventional astronomy said well yeah but you know it's almost impossible to win the lottery too but people win the lottery and they're right so maybe there's other proof now I actually thought this was about quasars as it turns out these are clusters of galaxies showing the same type of effect if you look this is the redshift of this item is 0.55 and the redshift of this item is 0.5 9 and the redshift of the central item is point 0 1 4 so once again we have two objects and opposite sides of a central in this case a pair of galaxies but it shows another example where there is a galaxy in the middle of two other objects in this case other clusters of stars here's a third example we have these two central galaxies here in the middle and 474 and n-470 and opposite it we have two quasars we have one with a redshift of 0.67 2 and a fairly close redshift to 0.67 5 now it's starting get looking little odd that we keep seeing this exact relationship so if you would imagine that the central galaxies here now is a blue house we'll go back to the lottery analogy we have a blue house in the middle and we have twin daughters living on each side of the house now how often are you going to find that the lottery winner always lives in a blue house and has twin daughters living on each side here we have another example of NGC 2639 the two quasars have redshifts of 0.307 and point 3 to 5 so we have yet another family that's lucky here here we have another example with the m95 in the middle it has 2 quasars on each side of 0.2 0.3 3 and point 0 3 6 but now one thing I haven't brought up is that not only are these galaxies or these quasars found as pairs on opposite sides of a central galaxy but they are found on the minor axis of that central galaxy and this is usually plotted as Halton ARP when you read his information there was a surprise when he would you'd be hoping of course that he'd find that but it happens again and again and again here's a little bit different picture we have and I a lot of items by the way in space are named after Halton ARP he was a very famous astronomer at one point he was rated as being one of the top 20 astronomers in the world and then he started saying the redshift the theory of redshift was incorrect then he was dropped off the chart but here we see two items again with the redshift of 1.25 and one point two six very very close redshifts bound opposite this central galaxy art 220 so you know the individual charts are to me convincing enough but since I did a lot of work and semiconductors looking at statistics this chart I don't see how anyone can refuse this chart and it shows the relationship of the brightness of different quasars and the brightness of a Seyfert galaxies and the correlation is astounding this is a 1 in 10,000,000 chance according to Halton ARP that this is accidental and to me he has some other charts showing the same type of information and and of course the way the conventional scientists answered this was by not looking at it so then he started realizing well maybe there's a little more going on here than just quasars and he started looking around and he found many many examples where we have a central galaxy the central galaxies minor axis is plotted here and we see all these quasars or some of mark quasars but I think in this case they are and you find out that they're fairly well aligned along this central axis not only that but the closest object this one has a redshift of 2.1 one point four point eight three point six nine I should have bought my glasses 0.33 so as you go farther and farther away from the central galaxy it turns out the red shifts go off and drop off and become less and less and his conclusion from this is is that we have a central galaxy here in the middle and it these central galaxies are actually ejecting these quasars generally in pairs not all the time but for the most part in pairs and so the quasar starts out with a very high redshift when it's immediately at the point of ejection and as it proceeds outwards the redshift drops off lower and lower and lower it reaches a point where the gravity of the central galaxies begins to pull it back and it starts to come back into the central galaxy and at that point it has a redshift very close to that of the central galaxy he believes that the at this point of ejection when the quasars are ejected they actually have no mass so this gets back to the assumption we had earlier where protons throughout the universe weigh the same regardless where they are in his theory they are very different and they actually started out with a mass of zero which makes it very easy for them to eject and due to the fact they have a mass of zero that's what is causing the redshift and his term for this was intrinsic redshift instead of the recessional redshift that Edwin Hubble talked about well this extended even further it kind of got to the point a lot of people say that Halton ARP cherry-picked is is in his evidence and that he was looking for these specific examples where there were blue houses with twins living on each side and they won the lottery and but it really got to a point where people would say well I found a pair of x-ray sources or I found a pair of quasars or I found a pair of in this case galaxy clusters and halton Arbuckle ah well then that's looking between them and and find the cipher galaxy in the middle and this so I think the instead of him cherry-picking the data it's almost like the data picked him so this is one type of evidence and there's a lot of examples if you read through his book intrinsic redshift you'll find dozens and dozens more and I'm sure that he actually found many many more examples than that but what's another type of evidence is that he actually found visible connections between alleged nearby galaxies and far away quasars and an example of this is Markarian 205 you see at the bottom now this and it's associated with this galaxy NGC for three one nine and the inn for three one nine has a redshift of point zero zero six which means it's not hardly red shifted at all whereas Markarian has 10.0 seven this is a significant difference they should be very very far too far apart and distance from us but there's this luminous bridge that apparently connects them he's found these luminous bridges visible he's also found them an x-ray and they are now finding these loom bridges in gamma-rays but the idea is is that well this is just a coincidence we're not really seeing what we think we see and what does it all mean one redshift is not the the recessional redshift is not an indicator of velocity but it's really an indicator of age second all quasars are not super bright incredibly energetic objects they're very close the third one is really really don't know the age of the universe we don't know if it started we don't know if it ended and we will probably never know we don't know the distance too many extra galactic objects and we do really can't see as far as we think we think we're seeing 12 billion light years out we may only be seen into our local neighborhood the Big Bang didn't happen quasars are actually young galaxies and there could be in expelled and there's also if you look at some of those equations he would say the general relativity is no longer needed to explain the galaxy and he really doesn't talk about the electric universe a lot in his writings but I know that at the end he pretty much embraced that this probably explains a lot of his ideas and he's often being called the modern Galileo because Galileo looked through a telescope and kind of got in trouble with the orthodoxy of the church hall NART looked through a telescope and got in trouble with the orthodoxy of modern cosmology both of them said we aren't the center of the universe and we're not the focal point which I really didn't get into that proof but in the end though Galileo went out and I would say that in the end Halton ARP also went out and he will get the last laugh thank you 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info Scientists on Earth are again being reminded of the awesome power of dust storms on Mars. The first stirrings of what has become a globe-encompassing phenomenon began on June 17th when a dust storm touched down on the famous Gale Crater. For several decades such remarkably energetic Martian storms have posed enigmas that meteorologists have yet to resolve. Mars's atmosphere is only slightly more than 1/2 of 1% as dense as Earth's yet Mars has towering dust tornadoes some the size of Mount Everest and global dust storms that dwarf anything ever witnessed on our own planet. In such a tenuous atmosphere, how is dust removed from the soil and accelerated into massive clouds circling the planet up to 40 miles or more above the surface? What holds the dust aloft? What accelerates the winds and dust across the near vacuum of Mars's upper atmosphere to speeds greater than 250 miles per hour? NASA scientists first witnessed such an awesome event in 1971 when Mariner 9 became the first space probe to orbit Mars. In the subsequent nearly half century, mainstream planetary science has shown little progress in deciphering the many mysteries these and many others strange natural events on the red planet present. For many years, The Thunderbolts Project has offered detailed analysis on the role of electricity in our solar system and its connection to planetary atmospheric and weather phenomena. This analysis has made many predictions which continue to receive stunning confirmation. To understand the global Martian dust storms it's first necessary to explore the undeniable electrical nature of another type of dramatic dust raising event, a Martian dust devil. The so-called dust devils on Mars are truly alien when compared to dust devils on our own planet. These monstruous formations are typically kilometers high and hundreds of metres wide or approximately ten times larger than any earthly tornado. The tremendous electric fields associated with the phenomena have been acknowledged by NASA for well over a decade. In 2005, the Space Agency issued a news release which declared, "When humans visit Mars, they'll have to watch out for towering electrified dust devils." Unfortunately, mainstream planetary scientists can only theorize that the electric fields are ultimately caused by the mechanical energy of air convection. The NASA release states, "Dust devils get their charge from grains of sand and dust rubbing together in the whirlwind. When certain pairs of unlike materials rub together, one material gives up some of its electrons (negative charges) to the other material... Smaller dust particles tend to charge negative taking away electrons from the larger sand grains." And here we see a fundamental confusion of cause and effect. As physicist Wal Thornhill wrote in 2004, "...in an electrified universe charge is already separated on the macroscopic scale and the movement of air in a dust devil is an effect of charge recombination, not a cause of charge separation." With such low atmospheric pressure how does one account for the dust particles leaving the surface? For decades, the Electric Universe community has developed experimental research on electrostatic dust transport which can provide great insights into everything from the collimated jet seen exploding from comets to the dust storms on Mars and other worlds. In 2001 Thornhill wrote, "When I was doing experiments on electric discharges to a clay surface there was an electric wind effect that would blow away all of the dust and loose particles from the surface before any arcing took place. When the diffuse discharge is big enough it will rotate causing a tornado effect. We have seen but not recognized electric winds on Mars. Mars has no counterpart of thunderclouds to provide a convenient path to ground for electrical differences between the ionosphere and the planet. As a result more diffuse and very tall discharges must occur, giving rise to an electrical vortex that manifests by the material rays from the surface into the thin atmosphere." In June of 2001 the greatest dust storm ever witnessed on Mars began and did not start to subside for a full 4 months. In 2005 the Thunderbolts.info website published a Picture Of the Day article that made two completely unconventional predictions about such dust storms. As noted in the 2007 article 'Martian Dust Devils ― Prediction Confirmed' taking a pointer from Wallace Thornhill we asserted that the global dust storm that engulfed the planet Mars in August and September of 2001 involved a packed assembly of dust devils carrying great volumes of Martian dust into billowing clouds. Since publication of that TPOD, a review of dust storm images from the Mars Global Surveyor and from THEMIS together with the systematic study of related phenomena on Mars has confirmed that our statement was accurate and yet it is also clear that the concept of compact "dust devil congregations" could only appear absurd to conventional schools. In standard theory an atmospheric vortex requires a vastly larger circulation of wind, a condition that precludes what seems clearly to be seen in edge-on pictures of "storm fronts" on Mars. This image shows apparent vortices, a word that would not be used by NASA scientists rising into billowing clouds from the margins of the south polar ice cap in the Martian summer. The caption accompanying the release reads, "Like billowing smoke from a brush fire, clouds of dust are seen streaming off the edge of the Martian south polar cap." The same 2005 Thunderbolts article summarized the electrical cause of the massive Martian dust storms as follows, "Since Mars has no thunderstorms to 'charge up its ionosphere', it should present a good case study of the Electric Universe. The electrical model predicts that the Martian ionosphere is indeed charged, and it posits no isolated dynamo to 'separate charge'. On Mars, electrical effects will reach directly from the ionosphere to the surface without the ameliorating leakage via storm clouds that we see on Earth. Unlike radiant energy from the Sun, electrical energy can accumulate in the planetary capacitor for some time, with the potential for planet altering events when the atmosphere finally breaks down and massive discharge activity is initiated... At the same time the electric currents flowing in the Martian ionosphere will drive the high-speed winds in the upper atmosphere." The article then offered a second extremely radical prediction about global Martian dust storms. It stated, "There is also another aspect to the interplanetary circuitry affecting Mars. The greatest storm on Mars in 2001 occurred when the planet was nearing perihelion and was the closest it had been to Earth in about 12 years. At that time it was also being 'tickled' by the Earth's plasma sheath, establishing a temporary electrical connection between Earth and Mars for the transfer of charge. It seems that Mars responded with an outburst of atmospheric discharges, these taking the form of monstrous dust devils - or more accurately, electrical tornados." Today as massive dust storms are again encircling the Red Planet science headlines have announced another crucial fact about Mars though no one outside of the Electric Universe community appears to have noticed the connection. Just as in 2001, today Mars is again approaching perihelic opposition and by late July it will make its closest approach to Earth in 15 years. One such convergence of circumstances could be considered coincidence but a second instance demands closer examination. Of course the Electric Universe also predicts that dramatic solar activity in the form of coronal mass ejections can provoke electrical discharges from celestial bodies that move within the Sun's electrical domain including comets and even planets. Such a display was in fact seen on Mars in recent years to planetary scientists' complete bafflement. In March of 2012 amateur astronomers spotted enormous plumes jetting from the Martian surface. The plumes were more than 250 km high and several hundreds of kilometers in length. As the lead author of a scientific paper on the discovery stated, "At about 250 km, the division between the atmosphere and outer space is very thin, so the reported plumes are extremely unexpected." In 2016, scientists using data from the Mars Express spacecraft discovered something equally unexpected. Immediately before the plume was first spotted Mars appeared to be hit by a coronal mass ejection. David Andrews of the Swedish Institute of Space Physics stated, "It's very surprising that was affecting Mars right before the plume was first observed." The implications of electrical phenomena are obvious even to mainstream scientists. A New Scientist report of the discovery stated, "One possibility is that plasma could be interacting with ice grains or dust lower down in the atmosphere and electrically charging them, boosting them higher, but it's not clear how the effect would be big." It must also be noted that in 2012 just days before scientists noted that baffling plumes, Mars was again at opposition and at the time was at its closest proximity to Earth in over two years. As we've noted several times, it's been known for many years that when the Earth's magnetotail passes over the moon it causes electrostatic dust storms and visible electrical discharges. As noted by NASA scientist Tim Stubbs, "Earth's magnetotail extends well beyond the orbit of the moon and, once a month, the moon orbits through it. This can have consequences ranging from lunar 'dust storms' to electrostatic discharges." It is a poignant commentary on institutional science that decade after decade of similar discoveries continue to provoke only surprise and perplexity. Yet the surprises are only met with ad-hoc amendments to existing theories rather than the development of promising alternatives. Alternatives which have been waiting for many decades in the fields of plasma physics and electrical engineering. Planets are "organisms" that interact with their plasma environments in incredibly dynamic ways. A fact which only confirms that we live in an electrically alive and connected universe. 
[Music] Well, about a week or so ago at a NASA press conference, the investigators who are in in charge of the Parker Solar Probe described their new findings from the first flybys of that probe. Now as far as I have been able to find out, the probe has made about three closer and closer passages to the Sun and it will continue to do that for several years and hopefully, if it doesn't  burn up, it'll continue to do that. But in any event, the NASA press conference included the statement, which is sort of typical of them, quote, “This is the first time we've been able to fly a spacecraft into the atmosphere of a star.” I said that last time too and I commented on that kind of statement, it all depends on what you call the atmosphere of a star. What is the Sun's atmosphere. Well, the Sun's local plasma extends out to the end of the heliosphere which ends in what we call the heliopause, and that's several times the distance out of  Pluto. So, by definition, any probe or satellite that gets out of Earth's atmosphere is in the Sun's atmosphere, if you realize the Sun's atmosphere goes out that  far. But actually the proper question is how close to the Sun's photospheric surface will the Parker probe get? Will it get into the Sun's corona? Will it get below the corona? No, certainly not. It will not get below the corona. Nothing in the foreseeable future will ever get through that kind of temperature. But NASA says that the probe will in 2025 get within a distance of four million miles. Okay, I think as I said last time, that four million miles is about nine solar radii. That is, if you take a picture of the Sun during the full solar eclipse and see the corona there, if you look and scale the distance let's say from the center of the Sun to the edge of the black dot, the shadow of the moon in front of the Sun, that's of course the solar radius. And so, if you  measure out 10 times that distance,that's where ‘closest approach’ of the Parker probe will get. It used to be said that the farthest out that the corona extends is about five solar  radii. So I said last time, and I still think it, that the Parker probe was not going to get even close to the outermost regions of the corona. But recently  NASA says no, no, the corona extends out to something like five million miles: 12 solar radii. And so, depending on, I guess, the feelings of the Sun at the moment, how far it extends its corona, it may touch the outer reaches of  the corona. But they're assuming it's going to. The press release goes on to say that the present data that they're getting back quote, “...hints at the likely birthplace of dynamic solar winds, which bathe our entire solar system in energy.” And that's certainly true. They continue to say, “It describes startling reversals (that is to say switchbacks) in the Sun's magnetic fields. It detects dust in the solar wind and it shows that solar winds spin.” And they say of course in their airy frivolous language, “...it spins like children riding on a playground carousel.” Anyway, if you can get through that, whenever you hear about things spinning, just quietly think about the fact that force-free currents are collections of counter-rotating spinning magnetic field and current pathways. I submit  and I have submitted for a long while, that they're about the only natural phenomena that do consist of concentric counter-rotating cylinders, that do indeed spin, or at least a twist. In one of our last Space News segments, we discussed reports that the Voyager probes have observed unexpected rotation of the magnetic field through which it is traveling. That is the Voyagers, they're out at the heliopause and my comment at that time says that wow, that's fantastic because that would fit like a hand into a glove with our Juergens’ Electric Sun model. And that would say that, yes they have left the heliosphere out through the heliopause, but it still hasn't left the giant Birkeland current that feeds this whole solar system and feeds our Sun, still seeing the rotating magnetic fields within that Birkeland current. To get back to the present though, and the present report, I feel it's very likely that the pointed tops of the so-called coronal caps, regions where the arrays of plasma that are leaving up through the corona, instead of diverging from a central point, i.e. the Sun, after they leave, they seem to at certain places at least, come back together again and form a triangular or at least a conical kind of a cap. But anyway, a long time EU member, a good friend of ours, Chris Reeve apparently asked the question, isn't it possible that these switchbacks are simply the probe moving through the counter-flowing Birkeland current cylinders of each filament? And when I saw that, I said hurrah, thank you Chris. Yes, it absolutely is, of course,  yes. It's quite likely that the coronal caps, those pointed hat shapes we observe  in the outer regions of the corona, are exactly where Birkeland currents form. Those Birkeland currents extend out to places like the north poles of the planets. So, Birkeland currents would explain the spinning and the reversal of direction of magnetic fields that the Parker Solar Probe observes and that the investigators have found so typically surprising. Why are there all sorts of different elements? You know manganese, calcium, iron sulfur, oxygen you name it, all the  other elements, in addition to the hydrogen and helium that their model says has to be there. But their model of nuclear fusion does not produce manganese, calcium, oxygen, sulfur and all the raft of other elements. And so, where does it come from? In deeper outer cosmic space there are novae explosions. Suns explode and they pepper the universe with (and Scott adds parenthetically, fairy dust) that sprinkles throughout the galaxies and intergalactic space and that's how all these other kinds of elements that the Sun doesn't generate, that's how they get on the Sun. It's like a snow storm and they come in from deeper outer space. Now, if you believe that, I got a bridge that connects Manhattan and Brooklyn that I would be very willing  to sell you. Alfven and all the earlier plasma physicists were well aware that most plasmas are what are called dusty plasmas. And that means that they contain neutrals. A fully ionized plasma is very rare. They say that the outer regions of the coronas of our Sun and probably other stars, are fully ionized plasma. But 99% of  most plasmas are not fully ionized. In fact, Hannes Alfven was quoted as saying if the plasma was more than ten percent ionized it could be considered a fully ionized plasma, because the forces between the ions and electrons that were there, are so much stronger than the gravitation between the neutrals, that the neutrals and the gravitational effects just don't count. So, that's a long-winded way of saying, sure, plasmas are dusty, that's where the dust comes from. It comes from within the Sun. As the ions and the electrons come blasting out of the Sun, they bring neutrals with them and that's where it came from. I don't think you have to depend on asteroids melting near the Sun to explain that. In describing the switchbacks, or magnetic  reversals, the Parker Probe is seeing, the press release stated, quote ”These reversals happen at a high rate of occurrence. That high rate is surprising. In fact the nature of these structures remains unknown.” Well, we can help them with that, I think. But anyway, we know that the Parker Probe is traveling at a speed of approximately 430,000 miles an hour. Now, that's fast. In fact it's 190 kilometers per second. And so in in a couple of minutes the probe travels about 15,000 kilometers. That distance could very well be the thickness of one of the layers in the Birkeland current which would be the cause of those magnetic reversals as the probe goes through the Birkeland current. The press release also announced that close to the, Sun the solar wind seems to get sped up by powerful ”rogue waves” quote, unquote, that move through the magnetic field. The quote  from the press release states quote, ”We'd suddenly see a spike in the flow where in just a couple of seconds the solar wind would start flowing at 300,000 miles an hour faster. That's about 134 kilometers per second increase in the speed of the solar wind that they're observing. And if the velocity of the wind is about 400 kilometers a second, the press release said they were doubling the speed - it's not quite doubling. Also, they said there are jets of plasma in  these streamers. Well, I maintain the increases in the solar wind speed may indeed be caused by double layers. Now in the in the past our viewers have seen this image that I've included here, of what a double layer looks like. So just to  refresh for the viewer. There are three plots there. The top graph is the voltage that we would measure as a function of radius distance out from the Sun. So you can see that the voltage is dropping rather precipitously from point c to d, to e. And that results in the middle plot which is the electric field that is produced by that sharp drop in voltage. Now there's nothing mysterious about that electric field. It's just the force on a positive ion and if the electric field is positive, as you see it there it is, that means that the force on that positive ion is outward in the positive direction. Outward from the Sun is the positive direction. So, the bottom plot there is the plot of the charge distribution that would be there to cause what those other two plots look like. That's from Maxwell's equations, but if we look at the charge distribution there, you can see that there are two spherical shells. One of positive ions and then right on top of that a shell of negative charges, mostly probably electrons, and that's why it's called a double layer. The plus and the minus layer are right there together. And there are two different spherical shells in that double layer: the inner half is positive and the outer half is negative, and in between, in the center of that double layer is an extremely strong electric field. Now that electric field, if it's strong enough, can actually rip apart any charged intruder into the double layer. So the SAFIRE experiment that everybody has been hearing about and that's worked out so well for us, that experiment produced an image of a whole series of these double layers surrounding the anode, the Sun. And the most powerful one is right there above, or actually on the surface of the anode. And that's completely consistent with Juergen's Electric Sun model, because that's the photosphere. That's  where the sunspots all happen and in that double layer there's where all sorts of things occur. And then, as you go out from that layer, outward from the Sun, the  double layers get dimmer and weaker. You can see them finally disappear, off in  the distance. We don't see any of those double layers around the Sun with our eyes or with telescopes now, simply because if they're there, they're  in the dark mode of plasma operation. They're in the same mode of plasma operation that surrounds the north pole of the Earth, and it's the dark mode, we don't see that either unless of course there's an aurora at which time the plasma jumps into the glow mode as it did in that photograph that Monty (Childs) so kindly sent us. But normally it's not visible, it's a dark mode plasma and so are those double layers around the Sun. Also, things are happening very quickly these days. In a new paper entitled, “Probing the energetic particle environment near the Sun,” the authors seem to acknowledge that magnetic reconnection can't actually explain some of the effects they're observing. I was  waiting, predicting that we would hear about magnetic reconnection, but I'm very pleased that they have essentially written that off, at least in this paper. They said instead, “We find a variety of energetic particle events accelerated both locally and remotely, including  by co-rotating interaction regions, and impulsive events driven by acceleration near the Sun and an event related to a coronal mass ejection.” Unquote. So they use the word co-rotating and I wonder if by using the word co-rotating did they actually mean counter  rotating? Nothing more was said and so we'll have to wait to see what they have  discovered. But they've discovered, everything that they have discovered is certainly explainable by Birkeland currents. Also, incidentally, regarding the question of how all those other elements get onto the face of the Sun, that we discussed earlier, one of the most important results of the SAFIRE team, was their discovery  that in their electrical plasma discharge (and remember that was in a hydrogen atmosphere just like the Sun is hydrogen), the transmutation of elements occurs. That's the kind of process that the old prehistoric alchemists were looking for. They wanted to change lead into gold or something like that. Well, actually SAFIRE has done it, in microscopic amounts, but they've done it. So that in a plasma discharge, hydrogen apparently can give birth to a long list of other elements. Not just one, that  were not there before the discharge started. So that may well be how those other elements got onto the Sun and get out of the Sun, as we speak. And the point is fairy dust has nothing to do with it. [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from The Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info Today, physicist Wal Thornhill concludes his three-part presentation on the early science results from NASA's Juno mission to the gas giant Jupiter. As previously noted, like countless other recent space discoveries, the mission findings are challenging, not only long-held assumptions about Jupiter, but also consensus theories of planet and star formation and the history of our solar system. On the question of Jupiter's internal structure and composition, Thornhill offered the provocative thesis that Jupiter is hollow. In this episode Thornhill presents his predictions for forthcoming Juno revelations, including the mystery of what lies beneath the planet’s Great Red Spot. We begin with some further explanation of electrogravity. Of course, the idea of a hollow Earth with an inner surface like a geode, is a formidable challenge to our entrenched belief that the earth has a dense core. It's a belief that can only be overcome by explanation, by demonstration and by willingness to consider the evidence. Consider for a moment that the electrogravity model presented here applies equally to any spinning object, where the heavy nuclei in each atom are offset radially from the spin axis to form tiny radial electric dipoles. This is the simple reason why inertial mass is equivalent to gravitational mass. The centrifugal force is not a fictitious or pseudo force, it's identical to gravity. It's the reason why a spinning Space Station, like the one famously modeled in Stanley Kubrick's landmark film, ”A Space Odyssey”, produces its own gravity. This raises the question how someone in the space station knows they are spinning. Only by looking out of a window and seeing the stars sweep past. The so-called fixed stars are the reference standard for all motion in the electric universe, because the electric force of gravity connects all matter in the universe, practically in real time. That's why gyros are used for inertial navigation, because they tend to lock themselves gravitationally to the matter in the rest of the universe. Think about it. In a universe of countless negatively polarized stars and planets repelling each other, a gyro has a positively polarized rim which is attracted to all of those celestial bodies. Sadly, those who have demonstrated what seemed to be anti-gravity effects of gyros, have not had any useful understanding of gravity from physicists to explain what they were observing. Most significant was Professor Eric Laithwaite’s 1974-75 Royal Institution’s Christmas lecture, finally posted online in December 2013, which I recommend watching. As for willingness to consider eyewitness evidence, scientists at the Royal Institution behaved predictably by refusing to broadcast the remarkable lecture on the grounds as the Royal Institution website says and I quote, ”Laithwaite appears to have used various engineering approximations in his calculations on the behavior of gyroscopes. And when told by professional mathematicians that once the calculations were done rigorously there was no discrepancy, he refused to believe them.” These are the same professional mathematicians who can't define mass or energy in terms of matter and have no sensible model of the real nature of gravity. Laithwaite was only one of three people since 1945 to deliver more than one series of the Royal Institution’s Christmas lectures. His first series was the first to be televised on the new BBC-2 channel. Back to Jupiter's origin and composition. Decades ago the plasma cosmologists and Nobel prize-winning plasma physicist Hannes Alfvén predicted that stars would be formed along Birkeland current filaments inside molecular clouds. He famously said, “Gravitational systems are the ashes of former electrical systems.” Infrared Space Telescopes have recently confirmed this, but no acknowledgment has been forthcoming from settled astrophysics because of their taboo against electricity in space. The electric universe simply adds that both stars and planets are formed in the same event. The cosmic lightning characteristically snakes about and is observed to toss the newly formed bodies out laterally. But collisions are avoided by repulsive gravity. The thousands of crazy exoplanetary systems are simply explained by the inward gravitational pressure of all other bodies in the universe against a repulsive gravitational force of the nearest dominant body. Hot Jupiters, orbiting their star closely, is not a puzzle. When we get rid of the gravitational accretion and merger by collision myth. On the question of the composition of Jupiter, plasma physicists have shown that Birkeland currents draw the heavy elements towards the centers of celestial bodies and the gases form their atmospheres, with hydrogen and helium outermost. So, the composition of Jupiter can't be assessed from its atmosphere. Jupiter is not mostly hydrogen and helium. All of the issues raised, mean Jupiter is a solid shell, composed of heavy elements. It will have structure, both on its external and internal surfaces. Jupiter is not as Scott said of the simplistic standard model, ”boring and uniform inside.” Anywhere you look will not look the same. So let's return to Nasa's teleconference. Scott Bolton, Juno principal investigator said, ”There are motions deep inside Jupiter that people hadn't anticipated and the gravity field is consistent with that. What we were really looking for was a core, whether there was a compact core or no core, and instead what we found was that it looks really fuzzy.” ”There may be a core there and it may be very big and it may be partially dissolved... that came as a big surprise to us, that there was no core. These mysteries extended to our magnetic field experiment.” Jack Connerney, Juno deputy principal investigator, said ”On Earth the compass doesn't deviate much from the north-south direction. On Jupiter the magnetic field was both stronger than we expected where we expected it to be strong and it was weaker than we expected where we expected it to be weak. ”There are small spatial variations which indicate we may be very close to the source. So it may be above the metallic hydrogen and may operate in the molecular hydrogen envelope.” The electrogravity model of hollow celestial objects removes any idea of planetary magnetic fields being generated by internal dynamos. That hypothesis has never been able to successfully model the complexity and variety of planetary magnetic fields found in the solar system. It doesn't work for the Sun either. As Faraday found, magnetic fields are intimately associated with electric currents, but electro-gravity is also associated with magnetism. Both forces have the same origin in the distortion of protons and electrons. The earth shows a connection between the two forces which requires a fundamental reinterpretation. The simplest explanation for a dipole magnetic field aligned roughly with the axis of rotation of a planet, is that the planet carries a surface charge which constitutes a current. This was considered for the origin of the earth's field but it was rejected because the electric current of 10^9 amperes required, seemed too high because the charge it implied would generate a tremendously strong electric field at the earth's surface which doesn't exist. However, there is a clear air electric field of about 100 volts per meter. The problem with this argument is that to measure voltage requires a reference and the earth or ground is considered our reference voltage. And it is clear that the earth has plenty of electrons to carry the return current of our Power Networks. But the fundamental error comes from the belief that stars and planets can be considered electrically neutral in space plasma. This has been proven incorrect in the case of the Sun, where numerous electrical double layers or plasma sheaths have been found in the interplanetary plasma that reduce the electric field between them. The earth has plasma sheaths in the ionosphere and magnetosphere which do the same thing. So the 100 volts per meter measured in the lower atmosphere doesn't give a true picture of the charge on the earth. Venus's lack of a magnetic field could be down to its ultra-slow rotation, but it leaves Uranus’ and Neptune’s oddly offset magnetic fields unanswered. It seems more probable that the cool solid shells of planets retain some of their nascent magnetic fields, when the ambient field of their birthing Birkeland current was at its peak. Planetary rotation can also be understood as an imprint of the rotating Birkeland current filament. The slow retrograde rotation of Venus, its heat and lack of a magnetic field, argues for a different, recent birth. The global myths of Venus as the archetypal comet, match this idea and introduce an alternative birth process for smaller rocky planets and moons by a process of electro-gravitic expulsion from a much larger body. This proposal makes sense of the large numbers of satellites of the gas giants and the spectacular icy rings of Saturn which are of very recent origin. Finally a word about Jupiter's Great Red Spot. Its continued presence for centuries is another argument for a solid body beneath the clouds. It's giant tornadic form is that of a continuous electrical discharge vortex from an elevated surface feature acting like a lightning rod, which could be the birth scar of one of Jupiter's moons. The Juno spacecraft is due to observe the Great Red Spot closely on its next close encounter with Jupiter where I expect even greater gravitational and electromagnetic anomalies to be found associated with the spot.

Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info In Part 3 of this four-part presentation, physicist Eugene Bagashov continues his analysis of the New Horizons mission to the dwarf planet Pluto. In the Plutonian system, one of the great surprises for planetary scientists was a Chandra Observatory's detection of X-rays from Pluto. This is only one of several phenomena at the planet that sometimes draw the analogy of Pluto to a comet. In the Electric Universe Theory, as developed by physicist Wal Thornhill, any body on a significantly elliptical orbit can display comet-like characteristics. Today, Eugene Bagashov offers his own thoughts on this and other surprises from Pluto, including the mysterious behavior of the Plutonian atmosphere. Eugene Bagashov: In one of the previous Space News episodes on Pluto, I've mentioned the various atmospheric anomalies that have been detected at this dwarf planet by New Horizon spacecraft. Those include, for example, the low atmospheric pressure and at the same time the unexpectedly high location of haze layers. And in the paper called "The Atmosphere of Pluto as Observed by New Horizons" that came out in March of 2016, there are reports of some new misconceptions being observed. For example, it is said that the upper atmosphere, approximately 200 kilometers and above, is much colder and much more compact than the models indicate. So, the authors have supposed there should be some "cooling agent" present there. Yet, they acknowledge the complete lack of evidence for such a presence. And it seems that the nitrogen escape into space is also a few orders of magnitude less than was previously thought, actually around 10,000-times less. Such a huge mistake clearly means there is something wrong. Basically, the model that is being used doesn't seem to work. The temperature near the surface, on the other hand, was determined to be somewhat higher than it should be, around 45 Kelvin. The models seem to indicate that, at the given atmospheric pressure, the nitrogen ice will be in equilibrium with the atmosphere only at around 37 Kelvin. So, the atmosphere near the surface is 8 degrees too hot, if one might use this word for Pluto conditions at all. It's too hot for the nitrogen ice to just sit there. So, the scientists have supposed that the surface might possibly be covered with some other less volatile material. Yet, as I've noted in previous parts of his review, we clearly see nitrogen spectral signature on the surface. The mentioned paper also reports of an identification of at least 20 haze layers in the Pluto's atmosphere, separated by distances of the order of tens of kilometers. The authors propose gravitational wave-like displacement as the physical reason for the observed layering. It is thought that the process might be initially driven by sublimation and the interaction of weak Pluto winds with the orographic features such as mountains. The proposed wind speeds are around one or two meters per second. But from the EU perspective, such layered structure makes one think about plasma behavior, which is not at all far-fetched, given their apparent lack of any significant protection from ionization by solar particles and galactic cosmic rays. In my opinion, it is entirely possible that the electromagnetic effects might be somehow ruining the models that are used by the New Horizons team to infer the temperature, pressure, and other relevant parameters. Another evidence for this comes from the recent paper quite straightforwardly titled "The Puzzling Detection of X-rays from Pluto by Chandra." Chandra is a well-known space X-ray observatory. Once in 2014 and on three occasions in 2015, it has been devoting its time to the Pluto observations in support of the New Horizons mission. As a result of approximately two days of total observation time, it has detected eight photons in the energy range from 300 to 600 electron volts while none has been detected in the range of 600 to 1000 electron volts. The detected events seem to be genuine, that is, not related to background sources or the instrument noise. And they all come from the square box with the side of 100 Pluto radii centered on the planet itself. Unfortunately, the instrument resolution couldn't allow for any more details. So, they have to originate from somewhere in the system. And maybe eight photons in two days doesn't sound like much. But considering how far away we are, if the same flux is going in every direction, we get a pretty impressive 200 megawatts of X-ray power flux leaving Pluto. This is about it 1,000-times weaker than the total power of Earth auroras during a decent geomagnetic storm. The question, however, is where do these X-ray photons come from? The authors of the paper rule out the possibility of auroras on Pluto since it is supposed not to have any significant magnetic field. Another possibility is scattering of solar X-rays but the spectrum is different and the power is up to 1,000-times too high. So, the last option that the authors propose is the so-called "solar wind charge exchange." Basically, this means that the solar wind ions strip away electrons from the atmospheric atoms, and those electrons settle in the solar wind atoms, making the neutral or less ionized, at the same time emitting a photon in this case in X-ray energy range. Very roughly speaking, it is the transport of negative charge from the atmosphere to the solar wind, which sounds pretty much like an electric current. Anyway, the interesting part is that this process will be more or less consistent in terms of spectrum, still is thought to be too weak to provide the needed number of events. The author state that one needs around 40 times more solar wind hitting Pluto than should be available at this distance from the Sun. I quote: "The solar wind must be somehow significantly focused and enhanced within 60,000 km of Pluto for this mechanism to work." Do we know any means of focusing positively charged particles? Well, the most simple and straightforward answer would be with the electric field. If you suppose that Pluto bears the negative charge with respect to the solar wind coming from the inner heliosphere, it would indeed tend to focus it, almost like an electric lens, so to speak. It might as well happened that the charge would be big enough to accumulate the wind from a very big area. Thus generating the needed number of events. What is interesting is that the solar wind density, registered by SWAP instrument at the time of the fly-by, was actually around five-times bigger than expected. It was thought to be a result of the recent passage of coronal mass ejection shockwave but might at least partly be caused by the mentioned focusing of the solar wind. One of the arguments against the electric comet idea, by the way, is that the solar wind density is too low to produce the observed amount of water in comets. But very simple calculations show that it might be easily compensated by taking into account the negative charge of comet nuclei, which we know is present and the charge needed is very reasonable. For example, for the maximum of [Comet] 67P water emissions, my calculations gave the charge of the order of only tens of coulombs. Of course, here I've neglected Debye screening and other complex plasma effects, which might be very important but the core idea seems not at all impossible. So, it seems the specific electromagnetic effects might be responsible for the X-ray emissions on Pluto as well as the other mentioned anomalies. I'd like to mention that the comparison of Pluto with comets and 67P in particular is not too far-fetched. The X-rays detected by the Chandra telescope are in the energetic range of a few hundred electron volts, which obviously would correspond to the electrons being accelerated by the electric field of a few hundred volts potential difference, somewhere in the Pluto environment. And interestingly enough, the Rosetta probe, upon the arrival in the vicinity of the Comet 67P, have detected a mono-energetic beam of singly-negatively charged dust particles with energy of a few hundred electron volts. The fact that those particles had almost the same energy means they also most likely were accelerated by the electric field, and not were the result of some thermal processes or whatever. So, it seems that in general this kind of electric potential scale, a few hundred volts, might be characteristic of the interaction of very small bodies with interplanetary plasma. Another occasion of very similar negative beam detection is the Saturn's moon Hyperion, zapping the Cassini probe during its flyby in 2005. There the potential difference was of the same scale, around 200 volts. Stay tuned for Part 4 For continuous updates on Space News from the Electric Universe, stay tuned to Thunderbolts.info 
[Music] Comet 29P is one of the largest known comets at about 37 miles or 60 kilometers. It is part of a group of comets  called the Centaurs. These comets orbit between Saturn and Jupiter. What you might not realize is that this comet is the second most active body in the solar system after Jupiter's mighty moon Io. Why this comet is erupting has scientists baffled. Given this, it is perhaps even more strange that most observations of Comet 29P have come from amateur astronomers. One of the problems with Comet 29P is that its eruptions have been unpredictable, meaning getting telescope time to do the systematic monitoring has been quite difficult. Amateur astronomers do not have these limitations. They can bring out their telescopes whenever required and can observe whenever they choose. On the 25th of September the patient dedication of an amateur group of astronomers was rewarded in the most unexpected way. They were located across the globe in Utah, Scotland, France and Tenerife. When they trained their telescope on the comet, they spotted several sequential eruptions. There were four obvious ones and then a fifth one at the end. After less than two days the brightness of the comet had increased 250 times. The series of outbursts generated a bright nebulous coma. The amateur astronomers then alerted other amateur and professional astronomers. Since the outburst was so unusual, a group based at six US universities were able to obtain time on the Hubble Space Telescope. This would have been the first time that they would be able to catch the aftermath of such a big outburst. The previous observations had been much smaller outbursts. Unfortunately, the Hubble Space Telescope experienced a technical glitch on the 25th of October and went into safe mode one day before it was supposed to observe the comet. They were hoping to be able to observe if any fragments were ejected by the comet, possibly forming a new comet on a different trajectory. The fact is that astronomers know very little about Comet 29P and its strange behavior. They don't understand why it suddenly increased its activity now. Their  concept is that these are balls of ice and dust. The activity of comets is therefore related to the heat from the Sun. As it moves closer, more material is vaporized, leading to greater activity and this is where Comet 29P presents a headache for those scientists. As its orbit is circular, meaning its distance from the Sun barely changes. This would therefore mean that it should  not show any rapid changes in activity at all. And yet, it is the second most active body in the solar system. So, how do they attempt to explain this then? They assume that the comet has a slow rotation rate and has one side  that is more volatile than the other. So when this faces the Sun, it becomes more  active. In their theory comets, asteroids and meteorites, all have a common origin which is way outside the solar system. And yet we find many comets that seem to be associated with large gas giants. Professor Vsekhsviatskii, director of the Kiev observatory and head of the faculty of astronomy of the University of Kiev, had concluded from his studies of comets that celestial mechanics, the distribution and statistics of cometary orbits, and consideration of the kinematics of the cometary system, leave no doubt whatsoever that all comets, and therefore the products of their decay, were formed inside the solar system and were formed a little later than the planets were. The existence of the family of short- period comets of Jupiter, Saturn Uranus and Neptune and the peculiarities of their motion and nature, their chemistry, their close association with Jupiter prior to the discovery, demonstrates a recent origin of comets. As Fred Whipple wrote in his book, “The Mystery of Comets,” a plot of the orbits of short period comets, projected on the plane of Jupiter's orbit, show a remarkable clustering. The ring of the aphelion curve outlines Jupiter's orbit beautifully. The conclusion has been clear for more than a century. Jupiter's huge attractive mass has somehow collected two-thirds of all the short-period comets into a family. When voyager discovered that Jupiter  had a faint ring system, it turned out that professor Vsekhsviatskii had predicted the ring's existence as early as 1960 in a science journal. And the passage from this paper is as follows, ”The existence of active ejection processes in Jupiter's system demonstrated  by cometary astronomy, gives grounds for assuming that Jupiter is encircled by comet and meteorite material in the form of a ring similar to the rings of Saturn.” It will sadly come as no surprise that his name is totally absent from any scientific literature relating to comets and planetary rings. Electrical stressing events can cause the ejection of bodies from large gas giants. The Electric Universe concept is that comets are nothing more than asteroids which have a different potential to their surroundings. These objects spend most of their time at the extreme edge of the solar system, which has a different charge potential to the inner part. When they approach the Sun, a charge imbalance develops between the nucleus and the high voltage and charge density near  the Sun. As the electrical stresses start to grow, discharge takes place and a plasma sheath develops which appears as the coma and tail. The observed jets are the electric arc discharge which will cause electrical machining to the surface of the comet. This excavated material is accelerated along the jets into space. But this comet does not have the same elliptical orbit, so how would this work? If we inspect the orbit of Comet 29P, we can see that although it is largely circular, it is inclined to the ecliptic which is where the majority of the planets orbit around the Sun. Would this allow Comet 29P to gain a charge imbalance to the Sun? If this were the only factor, we would find the discharges only occurring after it had reached its highest point and returned closer to the ecliptic, and this is not what we find. If we look at the average flare rate of the comet, it seems to happen roughly every 57 days. With a range between 52 and 60 days. When we examine the rotation of the Sun, this takes 24 days to rotate at the equator and about 35 days at the pole. So does this 57 day average correspond to a double rotation of the Sun? Could the Sun's heliospheric current sheet be responsible for triggering short-lived outbreaks on the comet? Could the rotation of active hotspots on the Sun periodically cause coronal ejections to be thrown out at higher latitudes which then head out towards the comet? This sudden change in the charge could then trigger the larger events on the surface of the  comet. One other interesting coincidence is the alignment of the planets during the highest and lowest points of activity on the comet. If we look at April 2019, this is a predicted low point for the comet and we see that there are no planets aligned with it. October 2019 is a predicted high point, and we see Earth is aligned. May 2020  is a low, again no planets are aligned. Then November 2020 is a high and we see both Mars and Earth are aligned. June 2021 was a low and once more  no planets were aligned. Then finally December 2021 was predicted to be a high and we see Venus and Earth aligned. This data uses the average light curve from the comet over a prolonged period of time, and in some cases we can see that the flaring events occur before the actual peak of the curve. So the most recent was predicted to occur in December, but the flare actually occurred in late September. Is this mere coincidence or is this an additional trigger? [Music] 
[Music] is it possible to identify the events that shape the surface of the planet Mars a planet of vast but unrecognized landscapes Vista after Vista eluding every attempt to explain them scientists labor to solve the mysteries through textbook theory but if as we have claimed the cause was electrical they will never get the expected answers many details of a new interpretation come from laboratory experiments with electric discharge but how far can this new interpretation take us toward an understanding of Marjan history one advantage of the electrical perspective is that it's every implication can be tested against massive layers of evidence now available including wide-ranging experiments with electric arcs if as we've proposed Mars was immersed in hemispheric discharged the planet can be viewed as a laboratory in space for testing the electrical hypothesis as seen in lightning displays electric arcs exhibit dendritic branching of Lichtenberg patterns these look very much like the dendritic erosion created by flowing water and electric arcs exploding across a surface can produce sinuous channels that also resemble fluid erosion but there are differences an electric discharge to a solid surface electron pathways frequently create dark spotting or chains of craters running along the channel floors are closed by the presence of crater concentrations in relation to surface channels offers a fundamental test of the electrical hypothesis [Music] [Music] an electric experiments we also see coronal streamers radiating perpendicularly from the primary discharge channel both the cratering and the coronal discharge are keys to a new understanding of the margins surface [Music] in electric arcs cut the great channels on Mars [Music] Nergal Valles is some three miles or more in width and 250 miles in length yes it did look like a dry riverbed when first seen by the Mariner 9 mission in 1972 but the original confidence of planetary scientists soon gave way to doubts bent a contradiction a river can take many twists and turns along its path but it's tributaries will not look like the blunt alcoves of Nergal Valles margin channels exhibit the predictable features of an electric scar rotating cylindrical arcs sputtering along the primary discharge path produced scaloppine of the channel walls with sharp angular projections that are inconsistent with fluid flow the same process left overlapping craters and alcoves that make no sense in terms of familiar erosional patterns [Music] we see virtually identical craters alcoves and sharply cut stubby gouges along the needy Valles [Music] numerous other margin drills underscore the same enigma and the unanswered questions grow year by year [Music] planetary scientists identify depression such as these as collapsed lava tubes lava tubes form is flowing molten rock cools and hardens at its surface insulating the law of a below so it continues to flow in a tube that eventually empties when an empty lava tube collapses the result will be an entrance to a lava tube cave a good example is Barker's cave in Australia so a cave entrance is the first thing to look for on Mars the second thing to look for is a rubble field created by a collapsing roof and a third thing to look for is abundant outflow since the emptying of a lava tube requires an outflow region but in reviewing innumerable instances of claimed lava tube collapse on Mars we find no cave entrance no rubble field from a collapsed roof and no outflow the depression stand alone with literally nothing to support the theoretical interpretation like any fluid lava flow follows topographical relief always running downhill the channel seen here change direction randomly in apparent disregard for topography they make 90-degree turns unrelated to surface gradients and they also cross over each other with no disturbance of either these depressions cannot be collapsed lava tubes look what are they what you see here is not the planet Mars it is a surface affected by a very high voltage but micro amp current creating a complex of gouges and craters again in electrical terms craters and channels are inseparable companions in responding to the mysterious channels and depressions on Mars many planetary scientists thought they saw spreading and fracturing and indeed evidence of fracturing is present on Mars as seen here here there are no associated creators or creator chains and the nature of the stresses acting on the surface is an open question planetary scientists think in the same terms when considering the region of a vernest caulis they identify the channels as cracks or fractures but why the concentrations of craters and crater chains a rotating electric arc traveling across the surface can alternately sputter forward to produce linear chains of creators or advance on a continuous path to cut channels as if by a router with uniform depth and parallel sides a question of crater formation on rocky planets and moons must be reopened the impact explanation would mean it's only necessary to count craters in order to calculate the age of a surface but electric discharge on a hemispheric scale could quickly create a surface that looks a billion years old - those counting craters plasma scientist dr. CJ ransom of Venus at laboratories conducted a series of experiments with electric arcs electric discharge produced surface cratering patterns closely resembling those observed on planets and moons even the surface darkening in central bumps or mounds of so many craters on Mars were present in the laboratory experiment electric arcs can also produce cratering patterns that could never be produced by impact complex terracing of crater floors and crater walls are a common effect of a rotating electric arc or discharged streamer across the surface of Mars we observe countless examples of exotic terracing impact Theory was never able to resolve the mysteries so-called bull's-eye craters with a central crater inside a larger crater are surprisingly common on Mars but this be a rare accident that explanation is reduced to absurdity when two such craters are seen side-by-side in fact several bullseye craters appear within the same region of Mars but an ionized discharge path of lightning does allow for subsequent discharge along the same path the bullseye crater is a logical extension of the electric model and when it comes to improbable events side by side these two craters with central Peaks each terminating in another crater will certainly never be explained by impact impacts do not create hexagonal craters but look closely at this region of Mars and you'll see several hexagons an observed form taken by rotating plasma as seen in the planet Saturn's electrified polar hexagon in an extended discharge systematic cratering pitting or etching can be the norm that's why in industrial applications electric discharge machining can achieve exceptionally dependable results the microscopic pitting of electric discharge can give a consistent depth and a remarkably smooth surface despite the fact that the surface is entirely constituted of craters or pits the same effect can be observed on seemingly smooth surfaces in the northern hemisphere of Mars surfaces that have been excavated miles deep [Music] but look more closely with the help of recent high-rise images and smooth surfaces are revealed to be nothing more than fields of small densely packed craters [Music] the baffling crater field seen here like so many others on Mars is a perfect counterpart to an electrically machined surface [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info [Host, Michael] Today, we offer a brief introduction to a fundamental theoretical difference between traditional solar physics and astronomy, and the physics of plasma cosmology. On the Sun, we're told the magnetic field lines move, or merge, and frequently break and "reconnect". This process is called magnetic reconnection, a mechanism that many solar physicists claimed to be responsible for enormous energetic outbursts from the Sun, such as solar flares. We are told the magnetic reconnection in Earth's magnetosphere is one of the causes of Earth's aurora. And, astronomers now envision the process in the magnetospheres of many planets. However, the 20th century's most distinguished plasma physicist, Nobel laureate Hannes Alfven, admonished astronomers to drop the concept of "magnetic reconnection" since the language confuses cause-and-effect. Alfven stated, "Of course there can be no magnetic merging energy transfer. Despite ... this we have witnessed at the same time an enormously voluminous formalism building up based on this obviously erroneous concept". Thunderbolts colleague Dr. Jeremy Dunning Davies explores the plasma cosmology alternative to the reconnection concept. [Jeremy] The subject is magnetic reconnection. Now, in very simple terms from what is written, it seems that as far as magnetic reconnection is concerned, one is required to believe that enormous quantities of energy are produced by magnetic lines of force breaking, and then reconnecting. Now, undoubtedly there is some physical process occuring which produces the enormous quantities of energy observed in the situations concerned. But, this explanation, at least in it's simplest form, cannot possibly be valid since, crucially, lines of force are simply not real. They're not physical entities. Now in astrophysics, the idea of magnetic reconnection is used to explain some huge surges of energy in what, for example, solar flares. This point needs to be considered now, in the light of what I've just said. But, it might be noted that, when you take separate magnetic fields and they come together and combine into a single field, the strength of that resulting field will be enhanced at some points, and weakened at others. The overall result might be expected to be a completely new pattern of lines of force due to the totally new magnetic field, brought about by the natural merging of the original fields. Again, there's no breaking of lines of force, merely the natural emergence of a new pattern due to the said merging. As for the enormous quantities of energy produced in some physical occurrences, such as solar flares, it seems to me, far more likely that the true explanation is to be found within the realms of plasma cosmology/plasma physics, whichever you like to call it. Now, most of the experiments associated with plasmas are performed in normal-sized laboratories, here on the Earth. And, there's no real reason to suppose the results of such experiments extrapolate to the cosmic scale but, we've got to start somewhere. And, it seems that the field of plasma research does offer many good clues to help in the search for the real explanation of such phenomena, as solar flares. Now, this is seen quite rapidly by examining the contents of Anthony Peratt's book, 'Physics of the Plasma Universe'. In this volume (Chapter 5 of this volume, specifically), one reads of double layers and their properties; and in Section 5.5 of that very chapter, which deals with the basic properties of these double layers, one reads of the phenomenon of exploding double layers. Now interestingly, this is a topic discussed also in Alfvén and Arrhenius book, 'Evolution of the Solar System'. And, in that book on page 250 and I'll quote specifically from it. They say, "If a current flows through an electrostatic double layer (which is often produced by the current itself), the layer may cut off the current. This means that the voltage over the double layer may reach any value necessary to break the circuit (in the laboratory, this could be 10^6V; in a solar flare, it might be even of the order of 10^10V). The plasma, however, explodes and a high-vacuum region is produced. Now, all this information, specifically in Peratt's book, relating to double layers would seem to indicate a more physically realistic explanation of some cosmological phenomena, such as solar flares. Indeed, as far as solar flares are concerned, they are discussed specifically in Section 5.6.2 of Anthony Peratt's Book. Now, bearing in mind the total physical illogicality of the notion of magnetic reconnection, together with the realization that a physically acceptable alternative is there for all to see and examine, it is difficult to see how the presently accepted position can remain tenable, and accepted, as yet another piece of scientific conventional wisdom.

Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info A new investigation into the wind patterns in Earth's upper atmosphere may provide critical insight into our planet's electrical environment, and its relationship to the Sun. In countless past episodes, retired professor of electrical engineering Dr. Donald Scott has outlined his mathematical modeling of a Birkeland current structure, and its visual identification as counterrotating cylinders. Recently, Dr. Scott invited members of the Electric Universe community to begin tracking our planet's wind patterns, which can be viewed in real-time through the website seen on your screen. In his own investigation, Dr. Scott has made what may be an important discovery -- an apparent periodicity to the counter -rotational patterns seen at our planet's poles. In this episode, Dr. Scott explains the potential significance of this discovery for the Electric Universe model of the Sun, and its connection to Earth. Back on May 10th of this year, I did a Space News and there was a sort of put my toe into this area of earth.nullschool.net site, and the major point, I think that I was trying to make there is, that it seems to me that if you can, as you can with nullschool, look at various levels, you know, in the various altitudes in the atmosphere of Earth and you can see very clearly that the outer reaches of Earth's atmosphere are very ordered, they are quite circular  most of the time and, as contrasted to, if you go down farther into the atmosphere, those patterns get all chaotic and messed up and the winds... to me the conclusion is obvious that the Earth masses disrupt those beautiful circular patterns. And so I think that's the evidence of the fact that the structure of those circling flows are created by the incoming Birkeland currents that have those nice concentric circular forms to them and the further down you get, the more disrupted it gets; it's kind of like watching the crash of an airplane into a mountain, I mean, it's very nice before it hits. So anyway, that was my main point in that first Space News. But then, when I looked at it and I looked, as I always do, at some of the comments that were made, there was a commenter, his name, he put that his name is Dr. BH, so hello to Dr. BH whoever he is! And he asked, he said, do these patterns change as the seasons and the dominant hemispheres align with the Sun, can you show a connection this way? And I began to think, I said yeah, hey that sounds, that's a good question! So I got to wondering whether there might be some periodicity, maybe yearly periodicity in the general form of those high-altitude wind circulations. Of course, most people realize, when they're asked what causes the seasons, the answer is not that the summer is caused by the Earth being closer to the Sun than it is in the winter. Anyhow, what is the cause? Well, we, most people realize the Earth's rotational axis is fixed in inertial space, that is to say, the axis of Earth always points in one direction. Of course, walk out at night and look up, it's our old friend Polaris, the North Star or the pole star, and so as the Earth travels around in this path around the Sun, it doesn't look at the Sun or away from the Sun, it looks directly at Polaris and it keeps looking at Polaris, every minute of every day of every hour of every year. When Earth gets to the point in its orbit where its axis of rotation is pointing the North Pole away from the Sun, that's the Northern Hemisphere's winter solstice, that's what causes the winter and the summer. So anyhow, with those facts in mind, I figured a priori before I looked at nullschool again, that in December there might be a strong, inward directed Birkeland current from the Sun entering Earth's South Pole, because the South Pole is pointed more toward the Sun. Well anyway, to make a long story short, that isn't what happens. Nothing remotely even akin to that  was observed, at least by me, when I looked at the earth.nullschool.net site. What I did see, during the height of the Northern Hemisphere summer, that is aphelion, Earth farthest from the Sun, current enters into both the North and the South Poles, generally. Now you know how I discovered that, I took my finger, it's the old right- hand rule, you put your fingers in the direction of the wind flow, the current flow, and then your thumb is going to be pointed in the direction of the, assuming that our theory is right, in the direction of the Birkeland current that causes that rotation. And then, during the Northern Hemisphere winter, that is perihelion, the Earth is closest to the Sun, the North Pole is pointed away from the Sun, the South Pole is directed toward the Sun, and what do you observe, you observe that current is directed out of both the North and the South Poles. So it's strictly not what your intuition, at least not what my intuition tells me what happened. Well anyway, if you look at that table you can see that overall, what happens is that in those, those four lines in that table, and if you look at the third and fourth columns there, the northern hemisphere current and the southern hemisphere current, you can see that in the summer in the northern hemisphere, that is to say the second row within that table, the current is in, both at the North Pole and at the South Pole. And the last line in the table, when it's winter in the north and of course, we're closest to the Sun, the northern hemisphere current is out and the southern hemisphere current is out. So you've got this really strange, sort of, in out, in out, out, in out, in, sort of arrangement, and what's the punchline, what's the bottom line? And my conclusion is, that if you look at the second row and the last row, you can see that in the summer in the north, which is the winter in the south, the current is going in at both poles; and in the winter in the north and the summer being in the south, current is going out of both poles. So there's a seasonal year-long cycle, in which these flows completely reverse, and it's at those solstices. So let me summarize, I've written it down, let me read what I've written. From December through February, the southern hemisphere summer, the North Pole is pointed away from the Sun, Earth is nearest the Sun, it's at perihelion, and what I'm talking about is row four of the table, the Birkeland current is directed out of both hemispheres. If you look at figure one, that is, the Birkeland current is directed out of both hemispheres, strong at the North Pole, figure one, and weak at the South Pole, figure two. Incidentally, that figure one, the strong currents, are something well over 300-350 km/h, that's moving. The weak currents are more like 50 kilometers per hour. Now I see it's strong at the North Pole in Figure 1, and weak at the South Pole, and you can see what I mean. Anyway, both currents being out, the Earth is losing positive charge during that season, the Earth is like a capacitor, if you have current flowing out every hole in the north and in the south is going out, well, clearly, the Earth is losing positive charge. If the Earth is, at that time, closest to the Sun, that says that according to EU Theory, that that would be a position of relatively higher voltage, we are closer to the Sun, higher voltage, the Sun is very strongly positively charged. Therefore, we ought to be collecting some positive charge from the surrounding plasma, through which Earth is moving. I'm just talking about this plasma ocean that we float in. Now, if you put in there the Birkeland currents that I'm talking about, those seem to have the opposite effect. If the Earth is losing charge and the Birkeland current is directed out of both hemispheres and it's strong at the northern pole, that is, look at Figure one, you can see that the rotation is quite strong, and weaker at the South Pole, that's figure two, but still directed out of both hemispheres at that point, and that's what's important, and so the effect of this newly observed Birkeland current mechanism appears to provide a means through which the Earth may dump such added positive charge over this part of the year. So if it's normally collecting it from the ocean of plasma through which it's floating, and that Birkeland current is connected to the North Pole and the South Pole, and the charge is flowing out, it's sort of a Birkeland current is sort of neutralizing the pick-up of the charge that is happening. Anyway, for the three months of the year at the South hemisphere winter, that is the South Pole pointed away from the Sun, Earth is farthest from the Sun, it's at aphelion, I'm talking about row two of the table, the circulation pattern indicates that Birkeland currents simultaneously enter down into Earth at both the North and the South Poles. Now, if you look at figure three, you'll see that that entering in is pretty weak at the North Pole but quite strong at the South Pole. So Earth effectively gains positive charge during this season but it's farthest from the Sun, and so therefore Earth ought to be losing charge, but the action of the Birkeland current apparently counters any such loss of charge. So the essence of it all is that yes, there is a yearly periodicity during which everything completely reverses direction, and it acts in a very complex way, as we can see. The question is, is the Earth at aphelion, that is far away, or perihelion, close in, and I think this fits with Wal's idea with which I again firmly agree, that the Sun's electric field creates a higher voltage region near the Sun and a lower voltage region farther out. But, so we understand a little bit, but this is a rich, I think, and complicated area that's open for research that nobody seems to have discovered, yet. 
[Music] To understand more of the predictive analytics of the Doherty set and how it applies to the Electric Universe model, I will now proceed to show off 10 real- world applications and examples of magneto- hydrodynamic currents, flows and patterns. But first, I will simplify our understanding of what exactly the Doherty set is. The set is simply the next iteration of the fruit-of-life and flower-of-life sequences that so many of us are already familiar  with. The flower-of-life is an ancient motif found all over in temples and other holy places throughout the world. This concept is very important, but  if you just take it one step further and take the fruit-of-life seen here and rotate it on top of itself, one layer after another layer, using the inverse square Bessel function as a parameter, it constructs the Doherty set. We will get more into this later in this episode when we explore Theodohertian roots. So that's how you construct the Doherty set. It's all one over r, just as Don Scott reiterated so eloquently in his latest video. Perhaps this geometry provides the rotation and origin of spin, as Birkeland Currents that professor Don Scott just hypothesized as well. It certainly does make sense that this emergent dynamic geometry is fundamental in the construction of Birkeland Currents. Since this show is all about magnetohydrodynamic flows, let's define what magnetohydrodynamics is. Magnetohydrodynamics is the study of the flow  of electrically conducting fluids in the presence of magnetic fields. Models in which plasma is treated as a perfectly conducting fluid, are the most successful models for describing the equilibrium and large scale stability properties of magnetized plasmas. Examples of such magnetofluids include plasmas, liquid metals, salt water and electrolytes, among others. We will probably get deeper into these flows in other episodes, but for now we will begin with a simple water droplet in acoustic levitation. Have a look-see how each of the harmonics fit nested within the framework of the Doherty set, even as the frequency increases. These shapes are natural 3D cymatics. Now, let's  imagine these shapes moving through tunnels. Not just any tunnels, but tunnels in space, connected directly to the universal electric circuit. These plasma tubes, or currents, do indeed exist and are called helicon waves. Waves exist, and oftentimes make up the geometry of  the entire structure of the current or flow. Helicon waves are what we see as the auroras and yes, they have a sound. The literal sounds of the heavens. So when we're viewing the auroras, just know that they are literally 3D cymatics, which brings us to the next type of current, Birkeland Currents. Intricate  geometric patterns persist in and along Gaussian Bessel filaments or Birkeland filaments. Like, for example, look at Saturn's north pole. This hexagonal geometry was created by, and persist due to Birkeland Currents coming from the Electric Sun. Look at the similarities all the way down to the petals that propel the counter  rotation. Let's bring it back down to Earth and talk about the geometry of lightning. Now we would assume that this wave- nested-within-wave behavior that  is indicative of Birkeland Currents, would have a fundamental geometry that would allow it to efficiently distribute charge and that this caduceus-like braiding would work all the way down into the filament of lightning and indeed,  it does. In a paper written by Wayne Burn titled “Polygonal Crater Formation  By Electrical Discharges”, he shows that charge flows through lightning in hexagonal tubes, or sheaths, each layer in counter-rotation. This is similar to all the other flows that we've talked about thus far. Evidence of this geometry of polygonal cratering can be found all over  the planets, including the moon. This process is also known as “electrical scarrification”. Further proof of this geometrical process of charge and charge separation can be found in Theodohertian roots. Theodohertian roots are extremely easy to understand, and just like the water droplet, they increase the [number] of sides, incrementally along with the harmonics. First, charge neutrality seeks edges as we just saw in lightning. Knowing that, we begin using regular polygons. Then  we nest the polygons equally inside each other, giving us the inverse triangular, inverse square, inverse hexagonal, etc. geometries. We then bound, or circumscribe the polygons, and this is what gives us the Bessel function. Each one of these Bessel functions is unique, just like our fingerprints, and atomic uniqueness. From there, we iteratively repeat the Bessel function, cascading outward from the initial Bessel function. It is this projective geometric construction that forms the filament. This is how to build the Doherty set and the first principal geometries of Birkeland Current formation. It is all cavitating. Along these filaments, constructive and destructive wave interference also occurs, which is largely responsible for the reality we experience. Destructive interference is when two waves traveling in the same direction, are aligned at the crest of one wave and the trough of the other. The waves cancel out. Constructive interference is when two waves traveling in the same direction, overlap and their crests combine to produce a larger wave. For the next flow we have vortices, chirality and cavitation. First, observe  our polar vortices and the magnetosphere. Now, observe the “vortexture” of the Doherty  set overlaid. It's literally like a “vorchestra”. The “vorchestra” can be thought of like the fascia - the sheath of stringy connective tissue that surrounds every part of your body. It's electric and moves all of our thoughts through our body, along this entire organ, at the speed of light. But this “vorchestra” is on all scales, connecting everything in the cosmos. Another term for this is also the “cosmic connectome”. We can see the electromagnetic field creates the form, and the shape has power. The  chirality of the vortex spinning clockwise or counterclockwise, is another electromagnetic force, often controlled by the Coriolis effect. These vortices form on all scales, from the galactic to the cavitation of microspires. For this next example, we will combine a few of the previously mentioned flows. In 2016, researchers discovered a new type of  fire - blue whirls. Blue whirls are a swirling flame phenomenon that evolves from a chaotic fire whirl and burns with nearly soot-free combustion. Supercomputer simulations have revealed the  flame structure and flow structure of the blue whirl. At this point, I had already been sketching this shape for years, and I knew of its importance in the grand scheme of things. So in 2017, I published a paper exposing the taxonomy of opposed spiral vortices of the blue whirl to be composed of a set of six opposed spiral vortices. In 2019, a paper published by Cornell University shows that the vortexes of the blue whirl are composed of three different  flames. And so we're getting somewhere with the predictive power of the set. Speaking of prediction, this geometry predicts that the base of Birkeland Currents or how a Birkeland Current nests and stacks on the poles, is similar to the shape of a blue whirl. This heterodyning, phase-conjugate stacking reminds me of something else. Phase  conjugation is multiples of the Golden Mean. Surprisingly, another current that this shape shows up in, is in Elon Musk's SpaceX Raptor engine test. This particular shape is indicative of minimal energy configurations and also shows up prominently in lens flares,  as well. A kink instability is a current-driven plasma instability, characterized by transverse displacements of a plasma column's cross-section from its center of mass, without any change in the characteristics of the plasma. So basically, it's extremely similar to the braiding of the caduceus, as seen here in the Doherty set. This is the first 10 concatenations. Concatenations are just a series of interconnected things or events. Currently, there is an unknown amount of pairing and nesting of different sizes of kink instability on all scales. There's so much work that still needs to be done on mapping out the infinite amount of toroidal node, helical, coaxial coils. And I stress that I say toroidal node, because the helical filaments are centered by nested [tori] and these nested [tori] are also the repeating cosmic Bessel function that any source star gives off. For this last example, we have branching systems - roots trees, distribution of matter in the universe, Lichtenberg flow, or dendritic arborization. It's been called many different things. This shape takes place in many living things throughout the Universe. It's one of the shapes that remind us that everything is electric. Our synaptic brain activity, our veins, our organs and even the hypothesized dark matter that is actually a Birkeland polyphase web. So many things take on this beautiful shape in  nature. Lichtenberg flows are often a sign of living systems, or a vestige that living systems were once there. All in all, cosmology is gorgeous and filled with myriad flows. And once again, it is self- evident that the Doherty set and the EU model itself, provide a framework to help us understand the intricate dynamic geometries of magnetohydrodynamics on  all scales, from the micro to the macro.

Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info On this series, we reported on the increasing frequency with which astrophysical literature acknowledge a fact which was long verboten in the space sciences. The existence of electric currents that flow through the so-called vacuum of space. At the vastest cosmic scales, many astrophysicists now recognize the "fundamentally electromagnetic structure" of the stupendous jets hundreds of thousands of light years long emanating from active galactic nuclei. At a much smaller scale, in our own neighborhood in the solar system, electric current systems are known to link the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn with their respective moons. And on our own planet, in recent years with improved technology has come ever finer evidence of tremendous electric currents that are connected to previously unknown phenomena. In 2017, we reported on the discovery of so-called supersonic plasma jets high in the Earth's atmosphere which reach temperatures approaching 10,000 degrees Celsius. A Phys.org report described the surprising discovery as follows, "The theory that there are huge electric currents, powered by solar wind and guided through the ionosphere by Earth's magnetic field, was postulated more than a century ago by Norwegian scientist Kristian Birkeland... While much is known about these current systems, recent observations...have revealed that they are associated with large electrical fields." Nevertheless, antiquated notions of charge neutrality and disconnected bodies in empty space continue to dominate the space sciences. In this episode, our guest Richard Moore explores the role of electric currents called Birkeland currents throughout our electric solar system. We're on the verge of a paradigm shift in cosmology and it's being pursued by the scientists that are putting together something called the Electric Universe model. And it's really rather unique kind of collaboration going on, kind of ironic collaboration, where the EU scientists are pursuing the theory and doing experiments that can be done in the laboratory. And then meanwhile, the mainstream cosmologists who completely dismiss the model or even ignore it entirely, ironically they are helping develop the EU model with all of their space probes because every single space probe is, turns out to be confirming, verifying the EU model and even though that's happening the mainstream still doesn't recognize what they're doing. So it's a very interesting kind of ironic collaboration between pioneers on the one hand and the mainstream people who don't realize quite what's going on. So it all started, I think, with Kristian Birkeland way back in 1908. Combination of experiments and going out and observing the Aurora, he came up with the theory that the Auroras are caused by the electric current from the Sun. This was completely rejected by the mainstream cosmologists primarily by a man named Sidney Chapman who really dismissed and attacked the whole idea because the mainstream people didn't believe that currents can flow through what they thought was empty space. But then, in 2007, just about a century later, the THEMIS satellites found evidence of what they called magnetic ropes connecting the Earth's upper atmosphere directly to the Sun. In other words, they were confirming Kristian Birkeland's original theory. So what they did, they described it as thirty kilovolt battery in the space creating flux rope pumps into the upper atmosphere. Even though it was confirming Birkeland's theories, they didn't really quite see it as currents, they saw it as magnetic ropes. Now, the reason that the current comes in at the poles is because of the Earth's magnetic field. As the current comes out from the Sun, it's focused in by the magnetic field into the poles. These currents that come from the Sun to the Earth, the mainstream calls that the solar wind as if it was something blown away from the Sun by kinetic forces. They aren't really recognizing that it's an electrical gradient which is causing the current to flow out to the Earth and other planets. So now let's take a look at the structure of the Birkeland current. As a current flows through plasma, it creates its own magnetic field which contains itself, forces it to be focused into these rope-like currents. And in 2016, one of these space probes found that these rope-like currents go into Saturn. So it's showing that the currents go all the way through the solar system reaching even the outer planets, just as they do with the Earth. So again, mainstream cosmologists ignorant of the properties of Birkeland currents attribute this rope shape to an imaginary thing they call magnetic reconnection. In fact, in this image we can see that there's a gradient with the Sun being more positive and the outer shell of the heliosphere more negative so that there's this gradient that forces electrons toward the Sun and positive ions away from the Sun. So what they call a wind is actually an electrical gradient which is what causes these currents to come out from the Sun. And then, another probe, we can see in this NASA study, they found that there's a flow of electrical energy that goes by every moon, every planet, every asteroid and comet, are all influenced in one way or another by these currents which the mainstream continues to call - a wind. Now, let's look a little closer at what a Birkeland current is like. Each one of the strands of the rope, as we can see in this image and looking at a cross-section, it's made of concentric cylinders of current that rotate in alternate directions and we can actually, again, with the help of mainstream probes, we can see this counter rotation, we can see it happening in the Aurora on the Earth. And then we can also see it in the poles of Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune. Clearly, these are all caused by the same phenomenon, these counter-rotating Birkeland currents. Now, in the case of a planet like Mars, where they don't have a strong magnetic field, in this image we can see that the aurora can happen over the entire surface of the planet. Since it's not focused into the poles, the current can come in toward the planet itself and we can see an aurora over the entire surface. Similarly, on Mars, because there's not a magnetic field to constrain the currents to the poles, we can have streams of currents coming right down to the surface and creating huge tornadoes, electrical tornadoes that are many, many times the size of any that occur on earth. Now, let's move on now to the effect on comets. A comet is moving rapidly, you know, it has a very exagerated eliptical orbit, so that it's coming rapidly from the negatively charged part of the solar system toward the more positively charged part. And that causes the comet to discharge creating a tail that points in the direction of the electrical field. According to the EU model then, the only difference between an asteroid and a comet is the orbit. It's not that there's any difference in what they're made of, it's just because a comet has an exaggerated orbit and it discharges whereas the asteroids, which are comparatively circular in their orbit, they don't discharge. So, the mainstream has this theory that comets are dusty snowballs and they say the tail is due to the sublimation of water. However, when space probes have actually reached a comet, as we can see in this image, they can see they're just rocky bodies, like asteroids. They're not at all dirty snowballs. So, once again, the mainstream is confirming and verifying with their probes what the Electric Universe has said all along. As Arthur Schopenhauer said, "All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed and then third, it is accepted as being self-evident. Now, where we are right now is that the EU model is being ridiculed and ignored. It hasn't quite been violently opposed yet because it hasn't been acknowledged enough in the mainstream to even be seen as a threat but we can see by the trends that are happening with these discoveries that can't go on much longer. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info On this series, we have presented evidence for a dramatically new way of viewing all celestial bodies. In an Electric Universe, nowhere can one find a "island" in space. Across vast cosmic distances, electric currents flow through the conductive medium of plasma electromagnetically pinching gas and dust to form stars and planets. In our last episode, we focused on the electrical circuitry in our own celestial neighborhood in the inner solar system connecting the Sun to all the planets including the Earth. Today we shift our focus to the outer solar system, for the tremendous electrified environments of the gas giants Saturn and Jupiter are the seventh of ten reasons why the universe is electric. Charged Planets in the Outer Solar System The NASA missions Juno and Cassini to Jupiter and Saturn, respectively, have provided data that could shake planetary science to its core. The discoveries dramatically highlight the failures of standard theory versus the successful predictions of the Electric Universe. We begin an exploration of the Juno discoveries which, in the words of NASA investigators, have proved that scientists' fundamental ideas about the Jovian atmosphere were ― "totally wrong." ― One of the greatest surprises the team first reported was that Jupiter's magnetic field, which was already thought to be tremendously powerful, is twice as strong as previously believed. The turbulent Jovian atmosphere has also proved "mind-boggling" with rapidly changing cyclones at the planet's poles proving far more dramatic and "weird" than investigators had imagined. As Juno principal investigator Scott Bolton stated, "Had someone shown me a picture of the pole just 10 years ago, I never would have guessed it was Jupiter." Scientists' estimates of the planet's internal structure have proved equally troubling. Scott Bolton states in a January 10, 2018, article on space.com, "Our ideas were totally wrong about the interior structure, about the atmosphere, [and] even about the magnetosphere." The article continues, "Astronomers believed that Jupiter had either a very small and dense core, or perhaps no core at all. But data from Juno revealed that Jupiter has an enormous, 'fuzzy' core that might be partially dissolved. This discrepancy between scientists' expectations and the data suggests that there's a lot we still don't know about giant gas planets, Bolton explained." A critical clue to the missing theoretical foundations for investigators is found in the following statement from the space.com report, "Strangely, auroras on Jupiter seem to be powered by a mysterious physical force that astronomers haven't been able to identify. According to the mathematical calculations, Jupiter's auroras should be about 10 to 30 times more energetic than Earth's, but Jupiter has seen auroras that are hundreds of times stronger for no apparent reason." Scientists had long proposed that a kind of localized charge separation produced Jupiter's X-ray auroras in the planet's interaction with so-called volcanic plumes from its moons. That perspective was summarized as follows by NASA investigator Randy Gladstone, "...the volcanic moon Io... spews oxygen and sulfur ions into Jupiter's spinning magnetic field. Somehow, these ions make their way to Jupiter's poles where electric fields send them hurtling toward the planet below. Upon entering the atmosphere, their electrons are first stripped away by molecules they run into, but as they slow down they start grabbing electrons back. The 'charged exchange reaction' produces intense X-ray auroras." And here we see perhaps the fundamental source of countless surprises for space scientists at all scales throughout the cosmos, the belief that no celestial object can have a net electrical charge. But this antiquated perspective is now refuted. As reported in an October, 2017 Science blog by author Emily Underwood, entitled 'Can Large Electric Fields Power Jupiter's X-ray Auroras?' "The data revealed particle signatures of parallel electrical fields over the poles of Jupiter that forced electrons near the poles upward, away from the planet, while protons and other ions moved downward into the atmosphere. This massive electric potential ― upward of a million electron volts ― provides a possible explanation of where the X-ray auroras get their energy, according to the authors." It's always been the Electric Universe position that the tremendously powerful Jovian auroras, the weird and turbulent polar storms and the planet's tremendously powerful magnetic field are all ultimately induced by electrical Birkeland currents from the Sun focused at the planet's poles. As noted many times on this series, in recent years, retired professor of electrical engineering, Dr. Donald Scott, has developed a mathematical modeling of the structure of a Birkeland current identified visually as counter-rotating cylinders clearly seen in the earthly auroras and dramatically at the poles of both, Saturn and is seen on your screen in the at least 15 counter rotating cylinders at the North Pole of Jupiter. A law of physics, consistently stated on this series, is that electric currents and only electric currents produce magnetic fields. Neither the Earth's nor any planet's magnetic field is produced through an internal dynamo and all of the Juno data clearly supports this claim. Mission scientists acknowledged that all of the models which imagined a dynamo deep within the planet, have been refuted. As reported by Newscientist.com, "(A) shock is that Jupiter's huge magnetic field is even stronger and much more irregular than expected. The irregularity of the field so far is a sign that the dynamo driving it may originate higher up in Jupiter's interior, perhaps from a layer of metallic hydrogen." Scott Bolton stated, "I didn't expect all the theories to be wrong, but there's motion going on in the planet we did not anticipate." But the "wrongness" of all the standard theoretical predictions has not forced investigators to consider what Electric Universe proponents have always argued, that the source of Jupiter's magnetic field does not come from inside the planet at all but rather it is induced by Birkeland currents whose signature is clearly seen at the planet's poles. It has also been the prediction of the Electric Universe that a far more immense electrical circuitry exists in the Jovian system, connecting the gas giant to its moons, than standard astronomy has ever envisioned. It's critical to note that according to recent scientific research by the Cassini mission at Saturn, the spacecraft's magnetometer had only been able to detect about 5% of the electric currents in the so-called plumes of the Saturnian moon Enceladus. According to data from Cassini's Langmuir probe, the electric currents may, in fact, exceed 10 million amps. Likewise, the electric current system at Jupiter is the real cause of the dramatic electrical discharges seen on the Jovian moon Io, which astronomers have long erroneously identified as "volcanic plumes". But the notion that the so-called plumes are produced by cryovolcanism has been repeatedly refuted by discovery. One of the most surprising features of the so-called plumes was their filamentary structure. The official Wikipedia page on the Tvashtar Paterae region on Io, states that the more than 300 kilometer high "plume" displays "an as yet unexplained filamentary structure". But as we've outlined many times, this statement is factually incorrect. As early as 1979, the renowned astrophysicist Thomas Gold proposed that the so-called volcanism on Io is actually high-energy electrical discharge activity. Nine years later, plasma physicist Dr. Anthony Peratt and co-author Alex Dessler wrote in their scientific paper that the best analog for Io's so-called plumes is the plasma gun, a mechanism that produces the distinct filamentary structure that is never present in volcanic plumes. In 1996, prior to the arrival of the Galileo probe at Io, physicist Wal Thornhill made a series of predictions including, - the so-called plumes would be found to move across the surface of the moon - the "vents" of the plumes would be vastly hotter than the expected temperatures of lava and - the plumes are in fact the jets of moving cathode arcs eroding the periphery of the dark areas that planetary geologists had been calling lava lakes. According to Thornhill, these so-called lava lakes are the solid dark surface of Io beneath the "snow" that has been deposited by continuous discharge activity. Therefore, the "lava lakes" would not reveal the heat of a recent lava flow. All of these predictions received stunning confirmation. Io's "volcanic hot spots" were not only hotter than any lava on Earth. They were too hot to be measured by Galileo's instruments. Also, as predicted by Thornhill, the discharging was focused on the edges of the so-called lava lakes though the rest of these dark fields are comparatively cold. In fact, the expected volcanic vents were not found. Inspiring further astonishment, the "volcanic plumes" emit ultraviolet light which is unthinkable under normal conditions of volcanic venting but which, of course, is characteristic of an electric arc. Nevertheless, space scientists today still insist that Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system. The cryovolcanism or ice volcanoes that scientists envision, is produced by Jupiter "gravitationally needing the moon" to induce tidal heating producing volcanic eruptions. However, in 2013, scientific reports revealed that Io's so-called volcanoes are in the "wrong locations" according to the predictions of every existing tidal heating model. As noted in a 2013 Huffington Post report, "Io's major volcanic activity is concentrated 30 to 60 degrees farther east than models of its internal heat profile predict, suggesting that the exotic, volcanic Jupiter moon is even more mysterious than researchers had previously thought." As noted by the lead author of a paper Christopher Hamilton, the findings, "...can't be reconciled with any existing solid-body tidal heating model." As mentioned, the Saturnian moon Enceladus displays filamentary jets similar to the electrical discharges seen on Io. Planetary scientists interpret these explosive features at Enceladus's South Pole as "ice geysers and plumes" produced by cryovolcanism. But it's critical to remember that before the Cassini team discovered the features more than a decade ago, scientists had expected the moon to be geologically dead and the last place they expected such activity was the moon's South Pole. As reported by space.com, "The finding flipped everything scientists knew about Enceladus on its head, because what should have been a dead moon appeared to be geologically active and what was supposed to be the moon's coldest region turned out to be its warmest." As in the electrical circuitry of the Jovian system where the electrical footprints of the moons have been seen in Jupiter's aurora, the electric currents connecting Saturn and Enceladus are now recognized by planetary scientists. And like the tidal heating models for Io, new discoveries have only proved increasingly problematic for the theory of so-called cryovolcanism on Enceladus. In 2016, scientists were amazed to discover that when jets of dust and water vapor explode into space when Enceladus is at its farthest from Saturn, the amount of gas accompanying the outbursts is anomalously low. As summarized by space.com, "The researchers expected quite a lot more gas expelled at the far part of Enceladus's orbit, to help explain the outpouring of dust, but they found that gas output had bumped up by just 20 percent, far less than expected." The team had focused on a specific collimated jet that was part of a large water plume. The leader of the studies said of the findings, "We had thought the amount of water vapor in the overall plume, across the whole south polar area, was being strongly affected by tidal forces from Saturn. Instead, we find that the small-scale jets are what's changing." Hypothetical cryovolcanoes, resulted from tidal forces, are not necessary to explain the stupendous filamentary structures on Enceladus and Io. More than a sufficient basis exists to finally consider the electrical interpretation. As we focus our attention on the gas giant Saturn and the stunning data from NASA's Cassini mission, we again see numerous opportunities to test the predictions of the Electric Universe versus those of standard theory. In fact for over a decade, data from the Cassini spacecraft has confirmed many of these predictions all of which were completely unexpected in standard reasoning. In 2005, Wal Thornhill published his analysis of scientists' discovery of a "warm polar vortex" at Saturn's South Pole. He also offered an explicit prediction, "The Electric Universe also predicts, experimentum crucis, that both poles should be hot, not one hot and the other cold." In 2008, the Cassini spacecraft confirmed the astonishing prediction. Astonishing because the freezing cold North Pole had been deprived of sunlight for more than 12 years. The author of a paper on the discovery stated, "We didn't expect it to have a hot spot at the north." From the electrical perspective, it is not coincidental that the hot spot is located "smack dab" in the center of the north polar vortex. Like the planet Venus' polar vortexes, Saturn's north polar hotspot and the vortex structure in which it is located is created by a flow of electric current along magnetic field lines to the pole. In fact, the Sun's electromagnetic relationship with Saturn is also a stunning recent revelation. In 2016, scientists reported their first ever observation of so-called magnetic ropes traversing the vast distance between the Sun and the gas giant. The lead author of a paper in the Geophysical Research Letters says of the finding, "Contrary to previous ideas about Saturn's magnetosphere being unlike its terrestrial counterpart, these findings reveal that Saturn at times behaves and interacts with the Sun in much the same way as Earth." But how can the fluid dynamics that NASA envisions, explain "rope-like structures" that twist and change dynamically and extend the nearly 900 million miles from the Sun to Saturn? The so-called magnetic ropes are in fact twisted filamentary pathways traversed by electrically charged particles. Again, the signature of Birkeland currents, counter-rotating cylinders, are clearly seen here at the North Pole of Saturn. Like the Juno data from Jupiter, the Cassini mission must force a dramatic reconsideration of the real cause of Saturn's magnetic field. Again, the findings do not fit with the predictions based on the belief that the magnetic field is generated by an internal dynamo deep within the planet. A major surprise is that Saturn's magnetic field appears to have no discernable tilt. As reported by Imperial College London, "Based on data collected by Cassini's magnetometer instrument, Saturn's magnetic field appears to be surprisingly well aligned with the planet's rotation axis. Previously, mission scientists thought that 0.06 degrees would be the lower limit of tilt that could generate the observed magnetic field. However, the results show that the tilt may be much less than this. Scientists currently think that planetary magnetic fields require some degree of tilt in order to sustain currents flowing through the liquid metal deep inside the planets. With no tilt, the currents would eventually subside and the field would disappear." Professor Michelle Dougherty stated, "The tilt seems to be much smaller than we had previously estimated and quite challenging to explain." Additionally, the Cassini mission provides the opportunity to test the electrical model of the Saturnian rings whose earliest origins trace to the experimental work of Norwegian explorer and scientist Kristian Birkeland. Well over a century ago, Birkeland's famous magnetized terrella simulated the earthly aurora's. Revolutionary research, that standard astronomy largely dismissed, until Birkeland was finally validated more than half a century after his death. The terrella experiments also produced intriguing rings which led Birkeland to systematically simulate the rings of Saturn. He found that the rings could be easily reproduced simply by changing the polarity of the electrical discharge. And now, a Langmuir probe onboard the Cassini spacecraft, has made yet another unexpected discovery for mission scientists. A strong electrical chemical coupling between Saturn's atmosphere and its rings. As described on spacedaily.com on December 12, 2017, "The upper atmosphere of Saturn is charged and consists primarily of hydrogen and hydrogen ions... Strong variations in density indicate that the electrically charged part of Saturn's atmosphere (the so called ionosphere) has a strong coupling to the visible rings that consist primarily of ice particles. The ice particles are also electrically charged." The principal investigator of the Langmuir probe data stated, "The first results are surprising... It is as though the small ice particles in the D-ring suck up electrons from the ionosphere. As a result of the coupling, electrical flows of gas to and from the rings along the magnetic field of Saturn cause the greatest variations in density." Like Jupiter, the tremendously electrified Saturnian environment is undeniable. Many planetary scientists had long proposed that Saturn's rings are billions of years old, perhaps even forming with Saturn itself in the conjectured infancy of the solar system. But in August of this year, the Cassini team attempted to estimate the mass of the rings in order to guess the rings age. The idea is that a great mass would be required for the rings to withstand erosion from collisions over time. However, as noted in a BBC report, "...it is looking like the opposite may actually be true - that their mass is less than previously estimated. If confirmed it points to the Rings being the remnants of some object that has broken apart around Saturn in the recent past." Cassini project scientist Linda Spilker stated, "...if the rings are less massive they won't have had the mass to survive the micro-meteoroid bombardment that we estimate to have happened since the formation of the planet. So, we're heading in the direction of the rings being perhaps 100 million years old or so, which is quite young compared to the age of the solar system." But the chief principals of The Thunderbolts Project have offered a radically different recent history of Saturn and all of the solar system. A history that includes an understanding of the electrical nature of stars and the electrical expulsion and capture of planets and moons. In this thesis, it is not possible to calculate the density of celestial bodies by estimating their mass using Newton's law of gravity. In the electrical model of stars, one cannot classify stars and gas giant planets based on their calculated mass. Stars are an electrical discharge phenomenon and their electrical environment determines their mass, appearance and classification. Our chief principals have proposed the provocative hypothesis that in the relatively recent past Saturn was an independent brown dwarf star with its own family of close orbiting small planets and with its ephemeral rings being recently ejected within the last tens of thousands of years. This thesis was summarized by Wal Thornhill as follows, "As a small star approaching the Sun, Saturn flickered like a faulty electric light when the two stellar magnetospheres or plasma sheaths touched. Saturn's electrical power was usurped by the Sun and its appearance changed dramatically. Such rapid variability in the appearance of stars is well documented. Before dimming forever, Saturn would have flared up to relieve the stresses caused by the sudden change in electrical environment. Saturn's present low internal electrical stress, as indicated by its low apparent mass, suggests ejection activity. But even so, the core of the electric star has not completely cooled ― Saturn still radiates more than twice the heat it receives from the Sun. And we have a simple explanation for the origin of Saturn's mysterious short-lived rings." Of course, neither recent solar system instability nor the electrical capture of celestial bodies are concepts that planetary scientists have ever entertained. But the failures of the standard model of our solar system's formation and history are dramatically underscored with countless discoveries of seemingly baffling exoplanetary systems. In fact, in recent years, astronomers have more and more routinely described our own solar system as exceptionally strange. Recently, this problem has been affirmed by an international team of scientists who have discovered that exoplanets that orbit the same parent stars, are "like peas in a pod". The research published in the astronomical journal focused on close to 1,000 planets in over 350 multi-planet systems. A Phys.org report summarizes the findings as follows, "...the team found two surprising patterns. They found that exoplanets tend to be the same sizes as their neighbors. If one planet is small, the next planet around that same star is very likely to be small as well, and if one planet is big, the next is likely to be big. They also found that planets orbiting the same star tend to have a regular orbital spacing." The lead author of the research stated, "The planets in the system tend to be the same size and regularly spaced, like peas in a pod. These patterns would not occur if the planet sizes or spacings were drawn at random." Of course, this is in stark contrast to our solar system where the planets are in the words of physicist Wal Thornhill a "fruit salad". This discrepancy has led astronomers to increasingly entertain dramatic changes to our solar system since its formation. The phys.org report states, "...in our solar system, the inner planets have surprisingly large spacing and diverse sizes. Abundant evidence in the solar system suggests that Jupiter and Saturn disrupted our system's early structure, resulting in the four widely-spaced terrestrial planets we have today." Yet institutional science remains unready to entertain a dramatic disruption of our solar system that occurred much more recently, perhaps even within human memory. But what basis remains for continued faith in the 4.5 billion year old story of our solar system's formation and evolution? A story that has led to endless surprises and intractable problems for planetary scientists. It is past time for scientists to wipe the proverbial drawing board clean to allow discovery to illuminate an increasingly self-evident fact that our world, our solar system and our universe is electric. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info We have created this special Top 10 series to highlight the most compelling evidences for the dominant role of electromagnetism at all scales throughout the cosmos. Thanks to ever finer technological data the existence of electric currents traveling through space is now undeniable and is more and more routinely acknowledged by astronomers and astrophysicists. Yet the ramifications of this revelation have been slow in affecting any meaningful change in consensus scientific theory. A major obstacle is a lingering belief that science discovery has emphatically contradicted that celestial objects cannot have any net charge separation. It is then not a coincidence that objects in space (are) behaving like charged bodies from the mysterious collimated jets of comets to the spectacular sprites and elves seen on our own planet's upper atmosphere, to the catastrophic electrical discharges focused on stars producing supernova explosions, to extra-galactic jets traveling at nearly the speed of light over a million light years or more. Today, we will explore why the high-energy electrical scarring of bodies in our solar system is the 8th of ten reasons why the universe is electric. The Electrical Scarring of Planets and Moons The myth of a solar system that has remained unchanged since its hypothetical formation 4.5 billion years ago, has now crumbled. As we've reported in many episodes in recent years, the standard theory of planets and stars forming in a nebular cloud from gravitational collapse and accretion finds no support in the thousands of exoplanetary systems discovered to date. As astronomer Gregory Laughlin told the journal Nature in 2014; using our solar system as a model has, "...led to no success in extrapolating what's out there." So different as our solar system seems to be that astronomers now increasingly entertain the notion of planetary migration. As noted in a recent phys.org report, "...in our solar system the inner planets have surprisingly large spacing and diverse sizes. Abundant evidence in the solar system suggests that Jupiter and Saturn disrupted our system's early structure, resulting in the four widely-spaced terrestrial planets we have today." Some astronomers today now suggest that these gas giants acted as so-called wrecking balls migrating toward the inner solar system destroying an early generation of planets and robbing the planet Mars of its lighter elements. The gas giants may have indeed acted as "wrecking balls" though not through mechanical collisions and tidal forces, but rather through bodies of different potentials discharging electrically. As we will see, the experimentally proven ability of high-energy electrical discharges to produce craters, and countless other planetary features, offers an entirely new perspective on planetary science and the solar system's history. The Moon The most heavily studied rocky body in the solar system outside of the earth is of course the moon. When the first space probes returned images of the moon they revealed a surface heavily pockmarked with craters and riddled with long sinuous channels called rills. Scientists seeking to interpret these features were constrained by the traditional geologic toolkit. The "debate" over the lunar craters only included two possible causative agents, volcanism or impact. Eventually, a consensus was reached that meteoritic impacts were the primary source of the lunar craters. The moon and some other bodies in the solar system are so heavily cratered that astronomers invented a violent epoch called 'The Late Heavy Bombardment' a hypothetical period when disproportionate numbers of asteroids supposedly collided with planets in the inner solar system. One reason for the hypothesis is that isotopic dating of moon rocks seems to imply that the so-called impacts that caused rocks to melt appear to have happened over a relatively short period of time. But like countless other discoveries, the simultaneous appearance of many lunar craters is consistent with the electric discharge hypothesis. Far from popular consideration, well before the first man walked on the moon, the amateur astronomer Brian J. Ford published his laboratory experiments suggesting that craters on the moon were carved by cosmic lightning bolts. In the cited experiments Ford used a spark machining apparatus to reproduce in miniature some of the most puzzling lunar features including craters with central peaks, small craters preferentially perched on the high rims of larger craters and craters strung out in long chains. Ford also observed that the ratio of large to small craters on the moon matched the ratio seen in electrical arcing. The craters we observe on the moon emphasize the need for radically new theoretical pathways in planetary science. One mystery that the impact hypothesis will never explain is the extreme circularity of the vast majority of lunar craters. Experiments with impacts have long shown that in order to produce a highly circular crater, an object typically must strike the surface from directly above. The aforementioned Brian Ford noted that over 90% of circular craters on the moon could not have been produced by sideswiping impacts. As on other rocky bodies, we see countless cleanly cut craters with no ejecta on the crater floors. Electrical engineer Ralph Juergens, an early proponent of electrical planetary scarring wrote of this phenomenon, "Explaining a crater floor of bare, once molten rock in terms of the conventional impact theory is a little difficult. One must resort to ad-hoc theorizing to the effect that something, perhaps the shock of the postulated impact explosion, melted a considerable volume of rock at some depth, and that following the explosion this material welled up to engulf the crater floor and flow around obstructions encountered there; otherwise, debris from the explosion itself could be expected to clutter the crater floor. Impact theory offers no reason, however, to expect such a sequence of events, and nothing in terrestrial experience with crater producing explosions supports the idea. Though an electric discharge might be thought of as taking place in a very brief span of time, an interplanetary discharge must surely be an event of greater duration than an impact explosion; the long-distance flow of current would persist beyond the instant of any initial touchdown explosion, and ejecta that chance to fall back into the crater thus produced could be swept away or melted in place." Juergens also published a groundbreaking analysis of the sinuous rills on the lunar surface. A sinuous rill is a long winding valley usually with steep walls and often emerging from a crater which could be found on the moon at many scales. Prior to the Apollo missions, astronomers' early hypotheses suggested that the rills were "cracks" on the moon's surface. Later guesses included flowing water until scientists settled on flowing lava as the agent. Today, the accepted theory is that the moon's sinuous rills were created either by lava flowing across the surface or beneath the ground to form a "lava tube" portions of which eventually collapsed. Juergens compared the respective point-by-point requirements of various competing theories versus the actual observed characteristics of the rills. Unlike planetary scientists, Juergens included among the possible agents high-energy electrical discharge. On every evidentiary point the electrical discharge hypothesis is either permissible or predictable and unlike every competing hypothesis in not a single instance does the evidence preclude electrical discharge as the cause of the rilles. Even prior to Juergens' investigation, several scientists had noted that flowing liquids, whether water or lava, could not have caused the observed features of the lunar rilles, including the strings of craters along the rilles' floors. These points are dramatically emphasized when we examine the moon's famous Hadley rille. Today, planetary scientists agree that the rille is a "collapsed lava tube". However, the rille does not match the required characteristics of lava tubes on numerous points. Most importantly, the collapsed areas of a lava tube will be rubble-filled depressions. High-resolution images of the rille revealed no rubble and no collapse tubes. It is simply an empty, sharply cut channel which matches the expected characteristics of a "electrical breakdown channel". Perhaps the greatest problem for the volcanic hypothesis of lunar rilles is their tremendous length. On our own planet, the longest lava tube reaches only 65 kilometers. That is about half the length of Hadley Rille which is 130 kilometers. However, the exact opposite should be true. On Earth, the atmosphere is insulating, allowing lava to retain its heat. In the "vacuum of space" heat will be much more rapidly radiated away. On our own planet, as lava flows over distances no more than tens of kilometers, the cooling at the surface causes a "roof" to form. It may then continue to flow as a tube beneath the surface. That is the only way the lava tubes can achieve even their modest lengths. Consider then the most prominent lunar rille called Schroter's Valley; 185 kilometers long and up to 10 kilometers wide with its depth at points reaching up to 1,300 meters. Flowing lava, eating away surface material to cut a deep channel would have to show up somewhere. We should see either breaches in the deep walls or evidence of abundant outflow. Instead, the channel simply dwindles until it disappears. Curiously, the flow of rills on the moon and other worlds isn't limited to downhill like lava and water carved channels on Earth. All fluid erosion theories for Schroter's Valley have chosen to ignore that the apparent mouth of the "stream" is on high ground and the narrowest part of the channel is on low ground. We also note that within Schroter's valley is a much more narrow, secondary rill whose defining feature is a chain of small craters. As we turn our attention from the moon to the planets in the inner solar system, we will see emphatically demonstrated the failures of standard geological theory to explain the most dramatic features on planetary surfaces. Venus Many years before the first space probe returned images of the surface of the planet Venus, one of the 20th century's great scientific heretics Immanuel Velikovsky made several outrageous claims about Venus. Velikovsky proposed that just a few thousand years ago Venus appeared in the earthly sky as a terrifying comet. In stark contrast, many astronomers, including the originator of the dirty snowball hypothesis of comets, Fred Whipple had proposed that the surface of Venus might be mostly or entirely covered with oceans. So the discovery of Venus' super hot temperatures, an average surface temperature of 863 degrees Fahrenheit, was one of the great surprises of the early Space Age. Another surprise is the amazingly "young appearance" of Venus's surface. Venus shows an astonishing lack of so-called impact craters which most planetary scientists today believe is due to a "resurfacing process" that must have removed the craters, most likely a recent volcanic overturning of the entire Venusian crust. The most striking features on Venus are the vast networks of filamentary scars or what experimentalists with electrical discharge recognize as "Lichtenberg patterns". In the Electric Universe Theory some rocky planets are born in the same glowing electric filaments as stars which are seen strung like beads on the necklace in molecular clouds. Others are born by electrical fissioning of larger bodies in the process of adjusting to a suddenly changing electrical environment. If Venus was once an earth-threatening comet as ancient testimony from around the world universally claims, it must have had an eccentric orbit that brought it close to the earth. Electrical discharging would have heated the crust and created the filamentary scars stretching across the planet's surface. Of course, it has long been shown experimentally that lightning occurring in a high-pressure gas causes this kind of "Lichtenberg pattern". At low atmospheric pressures cratering is more common as seen on the moon and the planet Mercury. Intriguingly, in 2013 science reports described the Venusian ionosphere's interactions with the solar wind as being more typical of a comet than a planet and like a comet, Venus has a vast tail that stretches up to millions of kilometers, sometimes touching the Earth's magnetosphere. The planet's super hot temperatures, its mysterious super rotation, and it's extraordinarily powerful lightning are all expected in the Electric Universe reconstruction of Venus's recent cometary origins. As we continue, we will see overwhelming evidence for the cataclysmic events 'The Thunderbolts of the Gods' that ravaged the planets in the inner solar system. Mars Prior to the Space Age, most astronomers had expected Mars to be a long geologically dead and barren rock in space. But beginning with the arrival of the first space probes, the surface features of the Red Planet have provided endless surprises for planetary scientists. Mars today is a world with spectacular weather events including tremendous wind and dust storms that sometimes engulf the entire planet. But nothing we observe today, accounts for the remarkable and often bizarre Martian geology, including features that speak to events more violent than anything that has ever occurred on our own planet. The most dramatic features on Mars provide all of the clues to these events. The stupendous Valles Marineris is a chasm that stretches for 4,000 kilometers long and up to seven kilometers in depth. For comparison, even though Mars is only about half the size of Earth, Valles Marineris is the length of about 5 Grand Canyons. It was the aforementioned Ralph Juergens who proposed in the 1970's that Valles Marineris was a vast scar, carved by an interplanetary lightning bolt. In fact, as we’ve reported in a 2015 Space News, the hypothesis of the electrical origin of Valles Marineris has been tested experimentally. In a collaboration between the late Michael Steinbacher and engineer Billy Yelverton, the experiment attempted to simulate the conditions that might have been present when the trench was formed with dust being dropped from a reservoir above a discharge table as seen on your screen. The feature that consistently appeared greatly resembled Valles Marineris. The two also noticed a pattern that physicist Wal Thornhill had previously noted in a 2003 article entitled 'Spiral Galaxies and Grand Canyons'. Valles Marineris' s-shape reproduced in the electrical discharge experiments strongly resembles the form of a barred spiral galaxy. As Thornhill wrote in 2003, "The connection lies in the fact that galaxies are the largest visible electric discharge phenomenon in the Universe." Of course, as we've detailed many times, this notion has extraordinary experimental support as demonstrated in the images on your screen of the plasma experiments by Dr. Anthony Peratt and Winston Bostick, respectively. In the feature-length documentary film ― The Lightning-Scarred Planet Mars ― detailed analysis was offered of countless Martian features that find ideal analogs in electrical discharge. One such example is the towering Olympus Mons, a nearly 22 kilometer high so-called shield volcano and the tallest mountain of any planet in the solar system. As noted in the film, the shield volcano interpretation of Olympus Mons presents far more enigmas than answers. The defining feature of any shield volcano is a gentle extrusion of fluid or low viscosity lava. Shield volcanoes on Earth do not present a scarp whereas the scarp of Olympus Mons towers at nearly 4 miles high. A NASA report acknowledges this problem as follows, "The scarp is of unknown origins..." "The steep cliff around Olympus Mons is peculiar and not characteristic of terrestrial shield volcanoes." But perhaps most significant of all is the blanket of incredibly fine filamentary ridges and ravines within the terrain of Olympus Mons. In fact, the continued discovery of perplexing dendritic patterns on Mars is a key prediction of the electrical scarring hypothesis. A pristine example was discovered in 2017 when an image was released of the terrain within the 10 kilometres Zunil Crater on Mars. Planetary scientists insist that the crater was produced by an impact. They have no real explanation for the raised dendritic features associated with secondary craters within the crater. NASA's attempt to explain the image reads as follows, "Secondary craters form from rocks ejected at high speed from the primary crater, which then impact the ground at sufficiently high speed to make huge numbers of much smaller craters over a large region... In this scene, however, the secondary crater ejecta has an unusual raised relief appearance like bas-relief sculpture." The best guess NASA can offer is that the so-called impact crater has been mysteriously weathered over eons of time. But experimental research within the EU community provides much more promising possibilities. One such experiment performed by the aforementioned Billy Yelverton produced raised dendritic ridges simply by applying intense vibrations to soil. Consider also this experiment performed by YouTube user Dai fly-fish subjecting aluminum foil to electrical discharge and consider also the side-by-side comparison of highly mysterious so-called Martian spiders and an electrical discharge experiment performed by Zane Parker. As we've said before, the Martian environment is a "laboratory in space" for testing the concepts of Electric Universe Geology. As we've detailed many times, more than a decade ago Dr. C.J. Ransom performed the only experiments to date that have reproduced the Martian blueberries, tiny spherules that appear by the trillions embedded in the Martian soil and the same spherical forms are seen in giant mysterious domes inside of craters, a continuing puzzle for planetary scientists. A great testimony to the electrical catastrophes that ravaged Mars is the more than six miles of crustal depth which was mysteriously removed from the Martian northern hemisphere. Where did all this material go? A clue is found in the completely unexpected discovery of Martian meteorites on Earth. Initially, planetary scientists treated the discovery with great skepticism since they did not expect that the escaped material could reach the necessary velocities to bring it to Earth. The massive electrical excavation of Mars could have also been the source of the mysterious asteroids that share Mars's orbit, called Trojans. In fact a scientific paper published in 2017 proposed that the asteroids are the remains of a decimated mini planet since they are composed of olivine and other distinctly planetary minerals. Planetary scientists also imagined violent collisions as the likely source of the Martian moons Phobos and Deimos. As described in a Space.com report, "A large impact or smashing into the Red Planet could have sent pieces flying into the air, where gravity may have drawn them together. An existing moon might have also been destroyed creating the rubble that later formed Phobos and Deimos." As we look closer at Mars's Phobos collisions and gravitational accretion, the only theoretical mechanisms available for planetary scientists prove totally inadequate to explain what we actually see. Like countless other rocky bodies, we see dramatic parallel channels and crater chains features not expected at all from mechanical collisions. But as we've illustrated dozens of times, they are routinely produced in experiments with electrical discharge and the most dramatic feature on Phobos, the astonishing Stickney crater, underscores a puzzle that is repeated on countless bodies in the solar system. The crater is 9 kilometers across, nearly half the diameter of Phobos itself. How could any impact capable of producing such a massive crater fail to shatter the moon? A similarly improbably huge crater is seen here on the Saturnian moon, Tethys. The moon is only 1,000 kilometers in diameter and yet its giant hexagonal crater is an incredible 450 kilometers across. As reported by Universetoday.com, "...Whatever struck Tethys in the distant past probably should have shattered it into pieces ...but didn't." On the famous asteroid Vesta, the largest so-called impact crater is an astounding 475 kilometers across. The diameter of the asteroid is only 525 kilometres. Craters much too massive to have been produced by mechanical collisions is just one of many enigmas resolved by the electrical scarring hypothesis. In the companion piece to this video called 'The Craters are Electric' we outlined numerous types of craters seen on every type of solid body that are routinely produced by electrical discharge in the laboratory including weird hexagonal or square craters, so-called bull's-eye craters, craters with flat floors and pinched-up rims, the extreme circularity of craters, and the complete anomaly of smaller craters appearing on the rims of larger craters. If we apply these explanations to the massively cratered surfaces of airless worlds, as seen on our moon, on the planet Mercury, on the dwarf planet Ceres, and in the outer solar system on the respective moons of the gas giants, we find a simple resolution to endless mysteries that the impact hypothesis has never explained. As the Electric Universe Geology community continues its inevitable growth, the closer humankind comes to a reconstruction of an essential chapter of our history. A chapter of a drama not written in science textbooks yet indelibly imprinted in every arena of human culture. A drama waiting to be remembered. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info In Part 1 of his presentation, Australian archaeologist Peter Jupp began outlining his case for the sudden fossilization of organisms on Earth. As Peter explained, many examples exist of life forms that were not fossilized over geologic ages but rather through the instantaneous process of petrification. But what natural mechanism could achieve this? As Peter will explain in greater detail at the forthcoming Thunderbolts Conference in Phoenix Arizona, the answer lies in decades of laboratory research into high energy plasma discharges. Peter Jupp: Let's go on now, you've got a similar case study here with the Jurassic coast ammonites. These marine creatures of all sizes, you know, they're up to about ten foot across, they're huge. They're meant to be from the Jurassic age but that's another debate altogether. Now they were buried instantaneously, they look up at you along this beach, and you can see them clearly, the image will illustrate this. And when you cut them up and slice them, you can see the intricate details. Every little piece of function across the cut. They weren't destroyed, they were something, if there was molten rock, surely it would have burned them up. Is there a possibility that water actually, they're in, immersed in the water and some strange geological happening, I suspect a plasma discharge, converted that water to calcium carbonate? Now that's pure speculation so where else could we get some evidence that something like this transmutation of elements might be occurring? One of the very interesting possibilities here is plasmoid research. Now if your, certain electrodes are placed in solutions, and electrodes are damaged, you get actually transmutation of elements. Now, there's new elements created but the electric current flow also forces many plasmoids to emerge from the electrodes. And some, quite curiously, look like comets, miniature comets, pouring off it and they're creating new elements. Is this a possibility, is this cold fusion as we call it, cold plasma fusion, possibly responsible on a massive scale and as Wal Thornhill is always quoting, electrical phenomena are scalable. If some major plasmoid occurs, or plasma discharge, is that possibly responsible for that something turning water into calcium carbonate? For instance, large plasmoids from volcanoes and earthquakes, both electromagnetic phenomena, but the plasmoid's ability to create new elements whilst emitting light is an area of still pioneering stage of our understanding. What further sort of evidence we have? Well, I talked to professor Richard Firestone from Berkeley, he is one of the preeminent isotope physicists in America, he runs the Berkeley laboratories there, he has recently retired from Berkeley actually, but he studied the Carolina Bays, for instance. He was studying the production of nano-diamonds that are curiously found in the Carolina Bays, plus many other elements. He is not sure what caused the Carolina Bays but certainly the number of elements is just staggering. They are a marker. Richard Firestone discovered without fail, these depressions, the Carolina Bays, which were mimicked in Alaska and the Deccan Traps and in Australia, contain large concentrations of nanodiamonds and other exclusive chemical signatures, for instance: iridium, helium 3, fullerenes, that's buckyballs, carbon, glass, hollow spherules, and magnetic particles. Could an electrical discharge or an emerging plasmoid instability possibly create these diamonds? Perhaps another interesting conclusion is consideration of related phenomena, comes from the Calabrian earthquakes in the 16th century. The earthquake formed perfectly round shallow holes just like the Carolina Bays. Is an electrical discharge involved? As Rick Firestone notes, importantly, the Carolina Bays accompany and bank along huge Lichtenberg river systems. If you've seen the film from space you can see these Lichtenberg systems spreading across the land over many miles and all along them are the Carolina Bays, these shallow depressions, they're obviously associated with their formation. Was this another massive electrical discharge? It's a great possibility. So there's many things to come I'd want to go into more detail, in the lecture that I'll be giving later in this year, in Phoenix Arizona, but more detail about particulary the ammonites, which are fascinating, stir me, certainly about Dr. Larry Agenbroad at the great site in South Dakota, the La Brea Tar Pits and perhaps some of the other ones, such is the nano-diamond formation in the Kimberley. So, I'll look forward to expanding on some of these details would give more facts when we get back together.

You've all heard all sorts of mention in the last couple of days and you will continue to hear mention of this thing called the Birkeland Current. And all of you, to a lesser or greater degree, have some idea about what is meant by that term. What I'd like to do is to give you some results that I've developed over the last year to try to nail down some of the properties of Birkeland Currents. There are some well-known properties of Birkeland Currents that I think most of you will know. In no particular order, the definition of it, it's the flow of electrical charge in space. So, that means there is an electrical current. The flow of charge - how many Coulombs pass up an observation point - in one second, constitutes the amperage of that current. Currents create magnetic fields. In other words, if you have a Birkeland Current , if you have a current, you will have a magnetic field. And if you have a magnetic field, you better remember that there's a current there that made it. Some astronomers lack that insight, I guess. One example of a Birkeland Current is the one that connects the Sun to the Earth, that powers up the Aurora Borealis and the Aurora Australis. And the man who discovered that fact, was Christian Birkeland, after whom those flows are named. He was dogged for years by a man whose name was Sydney Chapman, an astronomer who claimed that Birkeland was crazy. Obviously there could be no flow of current - of charge - through space. It would all dissipate. At first they said, well, space is an insulator, you can't get current through an insulator. Then they changed their mind and said, oh no, no, no, space is a perfect conductor. Well you can't have it both ways. Actually, the latter is closer to the truth. Space contains plasma and plasma is a very good, not perfect, but very good conductor. And so, when charge flows in a plasma, it has certain properties. There's a picture of what those Birkeland Currents look like. They come from the Sun and they drop down into that cone at the north pole and the south pole of the magnetosphere. Typical properties of Birkeland currents: They twist; they often come in pairs; they produce helical magnetic fields - we'll talk some about that. In fact, we'll talk a lot about that in the next half hour. Sometimes they're called ‘vortices’; they form filaments in sunspot penumbras. You've probably seen those. There's a picture of what they look like. On the right is a single Birkeland Current - you can see the twist. In the left-hand picture, when it's magnified, you can see they do very often come in pairs. They're very straight, typically. They can curve and twist too, but they are straight and that's a mystery. If you have a fire hose and you spray a fire hose, if I had one in my hand, I don't think I could hit somebody sitting in the back row of the room. The thing would dissipate. These things, contrary to Sydney Chapman, do not dissipate. And the question is why, and I hope to answer that this morning. They connect stars in strings. A number of years ago, you've probably heard somebody say, “Gee, it looks like those stars form in strings.” Astronomers say, “No, no that's an optical illusion, they don't form in strings.” Yes, they do form in strings and those strings are Birkeland Currents. The Birkeland Currents also connect galaxies. Just a couple of weeks ago, I think Wal mentioned this the other day, there was an announcement in Science Digest that astronomers - Australian astronomers, coupled with some [astronomers] here - have discovered that galaxies do indeed form on strings, which is a big reversal. Anyway, I developed over the last year a method for taking a close look at what the magnetic field is - what it looks like, the structure of it, around the Birkeland Current. Let's just assume, in your mind's eye for a second, in space you've got this bunch of charges that are flowing along. What will happen? I've just said they'll make a magnetic field. Sure, but what will the shape of that field be, and what will the properties of that that whole operation look like? I've discovered, because of the results of this work, that the magnetic force fields that surround Birkeland Currents reach out vastly - and I can't overemphasize that word too much - vastly farther into space than previously thought. The magnetic fields that the Birkeland Currents create, wrap around them, similar to the bindings of Roman fasces. You know the fascist business? You can take a bunch of sticks and wrap it up and it's much stronger with the wrapping than the individual sticks would be. I searched the internet for a picture of a Roman fasces and that's the best one I can come up with. Clearly, that winding goes around in one direction, but in reality - maybe not on that picture - it also wraps around, going back from left to right and right to left. I'll talk more about that in a second. What is a minimum energy field? Somebody mentioned that the other day. In nature, stuff tends to seek a minimum energy. Water runs downhill. Perfume spreads out - will diffuse - right up uncorking the perfume bottle. In a few minutes the people in the back of the room would smell the perfume. People in the front row would smell it first, and after a while, if I left it open long enough, there would be a level concentration of perfume throughout the room. And so, stuff just tends to shrink away. If you push on it, it'll move away to avoid the push. And it's a natural thing. Lightning follows whatever path seems to lead downward to a lower voltage. Planets. One of the primary claims of the Electric Universe is that the separation of the planets is due to a push-pull, back and forth, a jockeying. Many people don't realize that the planet Venus has a long tail. That tail carries electric charge and it just flicks the outer regions of our magnetosphere as Venus passes between us and the Sun. And if we get too close, our theory is that it is a push. On Earth electricity goes wherever you lead it. The wire goes like that, that's the way the current is going to go. Provided, of course, you put a voltage at one end and a lower voltage at the other end, so that the charge can flow downhill to a minimum energy. In space however, it goes wherever it wants to, because there are no wires. So that lightning, that charge moving through space, (in this case through our atmosphere) is following a path that it wants to, to get from a higher voltage to a lower voltage, why doesn't it go in a straight line? Well, because it meets up with all sorts of stuff in the atmosphere. Little regions, clouds of charge, changes in humidity, maybe a cloud or something here or there. It is going as it senses downhill, just the way water would ripple down over the surface of a mountainside. And of course, if you really get out in space, it does go where it wants to, as long as you leave it alone, as long as you don't put any rocks in its path. As long as you don't put a magnetic field there that will disturb the direction of that flow. That's the jet from the M87 [galaxy]. And that jet is several hundred light years long. See how well it's collimated. It's a heck of a lot better than your garden hose. So the question is why is it collimated? Why does it stick together like that? Well, there's one thing that even that jet from M87 senses and that is the Lorentz force. There's a current there, right? And if there's a current, you know there's a magnetic field. Well, if a current crosses over a magnetic field, you get what's called the Lorentz force. This is as complicated as the talk gets. So, don't sweat. If you point your red arrow in the direction of the current flow and it crosses a magnetic field, that's the direction of the blue arrow. And you point your fingers in the direction of the red arrow, and then move your fingers toward the direction of the blue arrow. So, we start with the current and then move toward the magnetic field. Your thumb is going to be in the direction of the force that those charges are going to experience. In other words, in this situation, the charge which is flowing from left to right will start to curl up. That's how cyclotrons work. You know the things go around in a circle and the radius is called the Larmor radius. Well, anyway that's the only force that charge moving in free space - if you leave it alone - will suffer. It'll feel that Lorentz force. I realized that - and I didn't invent that idea, I just realized it - and then I found in Tony Peratt's book an equation that says if you want to have a cosmic Birkeland Current at a minimum energy, suffering no forces, the way to get the Lorentz force to zero, is to have that Birkeland Current look like this. And out comes this big equation. Now if you're a mathematician - and I am surely not - then you can visualize what that structure has to be. Well, I looked at that equation for a long time and as I say this talk is a non-mathematical talk, but... [Quoted link is invalid] ... you can see the paper and you can wallow around in the mathematics as much as you want to. What I did was when I got that equation, I plugged it into a computer and did an iterative solution, almost exactly the same as Dr. Wolf was talking about, in the generation of fractals. You get the equation, pick a number, stick it in and see what you get. And take that number and stick it back in the equation and see what that produces. And eventually you get this trail. Well, I didn't generate anything as wild as a fractal, but I did come up with a solution. I will show you the solution in a second. But the purpose was to get an equation which would result in a Birkeland curve, that is free. Left alone. Leave it on its own devices, what will it look like? To understand this, we have to talk a little bit about cylindrical coordinates. Is there anybody who doesn't have any idea what a cylindrical coordinate is? Cartesian coordinates are the x, y and z  in there. You see the x, y and z? z is the vertical axis. x is coming out at you, and y is going from left to right. We want to specify the position of a point like this guy up here. You can specify: it's this far in the x-axis, this far in the y-axis and this far in the z-axis. That's the point. Cylindrical coordinates is the same thing, except instead of the x- and y-  axes (you still use the same Z-axis), but instead of x and y, you replace x and y by, at what angle are you from the center of this cylinder, from this pipe? And how far out are you? So, think about a Birkeland Current. Think about an oil pipeline or a water pipeline. It doesn't make any difference where z is particularly, because it's all the same. Things don't change in a cylinder. It doesn't even depend on where you are in theta, because it's  symmetrical. It doesn't make any difference where you're at the three o'clock position, the six o'clock position, where you are. The radius, oh yes, that makes a big difference. How far you are out from the center of the thing. That is critical. So, I'm trying to plot the magnitude and the direction of the magnetic field, and that's  this B vector. The B Vector has two components, one in the direction of the flow - z, and  one in the wrap-around direction, the theta direction. So, if you can come up with a solution that will enable you to tell what B(z) is and what B(theta) is, how strong they are for any given radius you are out from the center of this thing, then you can predict and plot what the magnetic field is going to look like. OK, now hold on to your seats because there's the answer. It may not make much sense looking at it, but let me see if I can explain what I'm talking about. The black line is the strength - it starts off there at 1 - of the axial magnetic field, B(z). That's how strong the field is along the axis of the flow. The red component is the strength of the wraparound field [B(theta)]. The horizontal axis here is not time. Please, it's not time. It's the radius, the radial distance you are out from the center of this flow. So, can you begin to see what's going to happen? Right at zero, or as close to the vertical axis as we can get, the wraparound - the red - there is no wraparound field. It's  all parallel; the magnetic field is exactly in the same direction as the current. And then, as you begin to come away from - that is increase the radius - that axial field  component.... Of course you know the sum of the two vectors B(z) and B (theta) is the B that we're looking for. So, what's the sum of two component vectors? Well, it's the square root of the sum of  the squares, right? Well, that's the light blue curve. So, the light blue curve, the cyan curve, is the total strength of the magnetic field as a function of how far you come out from the center of a Birkeland Current. And other than maybe a couple  of little ripples at the close-in, small values of r, it comes down pretty well, decaying like any decaying exponential right? Well, no not like any decaying exponential. The purple curve is one over the square root of r. Most people will say OK. If you know what we are so proud of in the Electrical Universe and that is we're always saying to the astronomers that gravity goes down as one over r squared, and the magnetic field from a wire carrying a current goes down as only 1/r. That's a much less rapid decay. 1/r is much less rapid than one over r squared. This goes down as one over the square root of r. So, this stuff reaches out into space much farther than we had heretofore thought, because there are no wires up there. We don't get any 1/r decay. We get a one over the square root of r decay, which means this stuff has a much wider effect than we had ever sensed before. Also, if you think about it, try to visualize in your mind's eye what's going to happen as you go out to higher values of r. First, the axial strength is getting weaker and the red curve is building up to a maximum. That maximum occurs almost (not during the first cycle but the other cycles) - it's almost exact - the maximum  of the curlicue kind of the curling around field occurs when the axial field component  is zero. So, what that means is, just look at these 11 plots. Just look at step number 1. Think of yourself as you’re above this Birkeland Current that’s in the cylinder. The cyan-colored arrows are the direction of the field. The whole field, because there is no wrap-around. And then, as you come to step number 2, that's a little farther away from the axis of the flow, and you can see that the curl-around field begins to contribute. The axial field gets weaker and the whole thing begins to tilt. And so, this magnetic field begins to wrap like a fasce around the current. In step number 3 you see that the wrap-around field is stronger yet. The white arrows in each of these successive diagrams [are a repeat of the previous one] and so each successive diagram is one layer higher, away from the center of this flow. The white field shows what is happening just below the blue field. Eventually, when you get to somewhere out here between 4 and 5, you can see that the white arrows are really zero. Notice there is no axial magnetic field. It's all wrap- around. It's just as though you took tape and just wrapped it around that pipe. And then, as you go farther and farther away, the axial field actually reverses direction, begins to come back at you and so the curl is down. And then... when you get to number 6, the axial field has reversed and is just against you. Again, what's going on between 6 and 7? Well,... at 6 the wraparound field is zero and at 7 it's beginning to wrap the other way. So, first of all it wraps this way. Then it goes back down that way. Perhaps some of you have seen that diagram that was published by one of our EU heroes, Hannes Alfven. You can see that the red arrow is right near the center of the flow, and (what should I say) the pitch of it is not very high at all. Then the farther out you get, like you go to the blue arrow then the pitch is less. It's a finer thread, if you will. And then finally out to the green arrow, well that's out there somewhere between my diagram 3 and 4. The axial field is zero and the thing just goes around. That's fine as it goes. As far as it goes, Alfven was right. He just didn't go far enough, because  the next radius out, bigger than the green circles there, would produce something like the blue, except with a wider radius. And instead of going up, it would come down. Let me give you an analogy. The perfume bottle when I opened it, would go to all corners of the room. It would spread out in all dimensions. This is also a minimum-energy field and that means that this magnetic field is going to wrap around the current, every possible way it can. And so it isn't just going to go clockwise and then stop. It's going to go clockwise and then counterclockwise, and come back down again. So, the question is, well so what? Well, here's the comparison of the field strengths. The yellow curve is one over the square root of r. The purple curve is the wire's magnetic field which is 1/r, and if you look at a couple of different radial distances, there my observation number 2 says that the Birkeland Current magnetic field is 32 times stronger than gravity at r=10. And it's even 3.2 times stronger than the previous EU estimate which [was based on] the magnetic field in a wire. But there aren’t any wires out there, So, therefore it spreads out even farther. The Lorentz force compresses matter at various radial fields, I don't know how much longer I got here, but let me just try to give you what I think is the most important thing. Here's a picture that looks like a bullseye, as you're looking down a Birkeland Current. [Pay attention to the thin little black circles with numbers. The numbers at the various radius distances correlate with the numbers that you see in the field strength figure below]. For example at about 31. That's a  place where the axial strength is zero. So what you've got is simply the wraparound magnetic field, the red is at a maximum, and so there's what I've tried to draw there at 31, you can see that's a strong wraparound current. If you come out to radius 73, you can see that again, you're at a point where the wraparound field is very  strong. The axial field is zero and so what you got is the thing goes around the other way. Okay, so what? Well, consider yourself as a positive charge and you're heading down the highway here. You are going to either intercept, depending on how far your path is, whether you're right at the center or whether you're a little bit farther out from the center of this flow, are you in the right hand lane or the high-speed lane, you're going to encounter either this (at that point) downward magnetic field, or, if you're out here, you'll encounter an upward magnetic field. You see it? Well, now think about the Lorentz force. If you're at radius 31, you're going that way, the magnetic field is down, and so you've got a force pushing you in toward the center. Remember the Lorentz force: you put your fingers in the direction of the flow of a current charge, then change them into the direction of the magnetic field and your thumb tells you what the push is going to be. So you've got current going in at radius 31. You've got a magnetic field downward. So, in, down, the force is in. So any charge around the radius 31 is going to be squeezed into the middle. Is that good? Yes, it's good  because in the middle you've got a very strong axial [magnetic field]. The black line is at a maximum. You got a strong field going that way. Then you have nothing in any other  direction. And when the current wants to go in the same direction  as the field, it's a super highway. So, that's why these Birkeland  Currents work so well, right in that first little area. What about the rest of it? Well, you can  spend some time doing this kind of stuff, but for example at radius 75, look at 75. The z- field is zero and you got a counter- rotating magnetic field and so what happens? You're heading into the board. You're a plus charge. and you put your fingers in the direction of your flow, and then you look at the magnetic field: it's up. Okay, your fingers are there, go up, out. So, any  charge that's flowing around radius 73, is going to be expelled outward from the flow. And so,  every time you come to one of these reversals, you're going to be pushed either in or out. And that's what I've done. I've tried to mark in the pink as where the charges  end up. Okay. I hope it's clear. If you look at this long enough, it becomes clear,  I guess... Pick anything, like pick 136. What's going on here? Well, at 136 you look along over here someplace that's right there, that says that the wraparound field is zero  and the axial field is negative. So, at 136 there is no wraparound field. It's zero, and this magnetic field is coming at you. Doesn't that defeat the purpose? You don't want any current flowing back, you want current going that way. Well, you notice there's no charge carriers  there. Because at 136, they're either pushed that way into this, sort of first shell, or they're pushed outward to that shell. So, regions like 51 and 136 radius, out here is another one at 220, it's sort of like a super highway. But there's no cars on the highway. There's no charge carriers there. I hope I've shown that at certain places, at certain radii, it's easy for current to flow, and other places it's hard for current to flow and certainly because of the counter-rotating wraparound field, charges will tend to form in these layers. So, these layers are concentric cylinders. This is the same sort of result that Marklund came up with, with Marklund convection. If any of you are familiar with that. Marklund, a Swedish scientist/engineer I think, developed almost the same thing except his mechanism is predicated on the idea that you've got a variety, a spectrum of different types of elements, and he found that what goes to the center are the easily ionizable elements. To me it's very counter- intuitive. Iron and stuff like that are easy to ionize, so you'll find iron and the heavy elements in the middle. And one of the hardest elements of all (which seems absolutely nuts to me, but  it is true) to ionize is hydrogen. And hydrogen is on the outside. So, that's Marklund convection. He's got the same result as this. That is there are concentric cylinders and there's a selectivity as to what kind of elements you're going to find in which layer. And that's great. My result is independent of what you've got there. In other words, this will happen no matter what the stuff is that's flowing. It could be just protons, it could be  electrons. If all you have is electrons, everything I said, just reverse it. It goes the other way, it's no problem. But the same kind of selectivity the same kind of forming these concentric layers will occur. Well, is this true? Well there's a famous picture of Saturn's north pole. It's also the famous hexagon in the middle. You see the little one right in the middle and my results here do not predict that hexagon. I wish they did, but they don't. But they do predict those circles. Here's a Birkeland Current coming down into Jupiter's north pole. Same sort of thing. there are concentric circles. That's where the charge  hits. That's where the charge is concentrated. And the wrapping around, by the way, I don't have any slide to show it but the the way this crazy ’going this way and then back that way’ it's wrapped like a Roman soldier. In World War I the soldiers wore patisse, wrapped around their leg. I think they only wrapped them in one direction. But if you wrap them all the way down and then come wrapping them about the other way and then back down the other way, you got a real wrap. And that's a real reason, in my mind, that the whole thing hangs together, and doesn't dissipate. Here's a picture from Tony Peratt's lab. That's a dense plasma focus device and you can see the circularity of it. You can almost see this circle going one way and then going the other way. Here's a picture that C.J. Ransom and Mel Acheson can be proud of. They made that one in CJ's lab. And  again that's the result of a high amperage current. Probably, CJ if he's here, can tell you  what the surface, the substrate is. But you can see, it forms a bullseye. And the strongest one is of course that one right in the middle. So, that's because of the properties, I think we've identified here as the properties of a Birkeland  Current. We, Wal, me, a few other of us nuts, are convinced that what you're looking at there is a Birkeland Current. A Birkeland Current that's undergoing a z-pinch, and you can see, I think very obviously, that the Birkeland Current consists of concentric cylinders. You can see the outside too certainly. And the center one I think that that, and that, are double layers in a central stream of current. Whether the current's going all one way or all the other, we've talked for hours on  this and we still can't figure it out. But I would say if that is indeed a Birkeland Current, all the currents going one way on the outer sheath, whether it goes in the opposite direction in the center, I don't know. But certainly, it can go whichever way it wants to because in the center, the magnetic field is lined up with the flow of charge, no matter which way it's going. And so it goes for free. It's a super highway. Anyway, that Planetary Nebula M2-9 that's not Messier. Somebody else quoted Walt Whitman, so I didn't want to be left in the lurch. And after all this lecture of numbers and all this he says he looked up in perfect silence at the stars. You have to look. And I submit that's one of the primary rules of the Electric Universe. That is, let your eyes tell you and that is a concentrically-made sheet of current. Again, just looking downstream, that's  what you see in a Birkeland Current. And there's that picture of Saturn. I submit that's  pretty darn good evidence. Anyway, thanks. [Applause] [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info New scientific reports are again confirming the electrical nature of one of the most mysterious phenomena in the cosmos ― the comet. For more than a decade scientists have puzzled over the spectacular display of Comet McNaught. In the winter of 2007, the object dazzled observers on Earth when it became the brightest comet in over 40 years and the second brightest since 1935. The more scientists have learned about Comet McNaught, the more it has confounded conventional comet theory. In 2007, as the comet was passing near Mars, the Ulysses spacecraft made the completely unexpected discovery that the solar wind velocity dramatically decelerated as it encountered the comet's ion tail. At that distance from the Sun the solar wind is typically about 700 km/sec, but inside the ion tail of the comet it was only 350 km/sec. Space science professor Michael Combi said of the discovery, "This was very surprising to me. Way past the orbit of Mars, the solar wind felt a disturbance of this little comet. It will be a serious challenge for us theoreticians and computer modelers to figure out the physics." And today, scientists continuing to study comet McNaught have reported another discovery that stunningly confirms the electric comet theory, that is that the material in the comet's dust tail is "electrically charged". The team was attempting to learn about the extraordinary dust tail, specifically the structured bands of dust or striations which did not disperse in the "vacuum of space" but stretched for over 100 million miles behind the comet. Previously, the great comet of 1744 was said to have presented the same mystery in its time when it produced six tails which were observed from Earth. Today, almost three centuries later, scientists utilizing a new image processing technique are able to study the formation of the striations in McNaught's dust tail. What they have found was completely unexpected. Planetary scientist Oliver Price who developed the technique said of the investigation, "My supervisor and I noticed weird goings-on in the images of these striations, a disruption in the otherwise clean lines. I set out to investigate what might have happened to create this weird effect." As reported on phys.org, these so-called weird effects were, "Located at the heliospheric current sheet, a boundary where the magnetic orientation, or polarity, of the electrified solar wind changes directions. This puzzled scientists because while they have long known the comet's ion tail is affected by the solar wind, they had never seen the solar wind impact dust tails before." "Dust in McNaught's tail ― roughly the size of cigarette smoke ― is too heavy, the scientists thought, for the solar wind to push around." This electrical interaction between the heliospheric current sheet and the comet's dust tail is summarized by planetary scientist Geraint Jones, "It's like the striation's feathers are ruffled when it crosses the current sheet. If you picture a wing with lots of feathers, as the wing crosses the sheet, lighter ends of the feathers get bent out of shape. For us, this is strong evidence that the dust is electrically charged, and that the solar wind is affecting the motion of that dust." The Phys.org report concludes of the team's findings, "... it was a surprise for them to see the solar wind affect larger dust grains like those in McNaught's tail-- about 100 times bigger than the dust seen ejected from around Jupiter and Saturn-- because they're that much heavier for the solar wind to push around." It has always been the Electric Universe position that most comet activity is the result of the comet moving through regions of changing electric potential. The reason comet activity tends to increase as it moves closer to the Sun is not due to sublimation of invisible hypothetical water ice. Indeed, every comet nucleus imaged to date has appeared rocky and desiccated. Comets spend most of their time in the farther reaches of the solar system where plasma charge density is low. The comet moves slowly and its charge will normally easily come into balance with that region. But as it approaches the Sun, the nucleus moves at a furious speed through regions of increasing charge density and varying electrical characteristics. The comet's surface charge and internal polarization developed in deep space respond to the new environment by forming cathode jets and a visible plasma sheath or coma. The jets flare up and the comet may shed and grow anew several tails. In fact, the negative charge in Comet McNaught's ion tail would have attracted solar wind protons, the obvious explanation for the deceleration of the solar wind as it met the comet. Comets can also suddenly brighten when moving away from the Sun or even explode when moving through any sudden dramatic change of electrical potential such as when encountering a CME from the Sun or even the magnetosphere of a planet. In fact, on two occasions in modern times, when astronomers have been able to anticipate a comet's close encounter with a planet, Shoemaker Levy 9 at Jupiter in 1994 and Siding Spring at Mars in 2014, the electromagnetic effects produced by the encounters were vastly more energetic than anything comet scientists had thought possible. Comet jets may be the clearest example of electrical discharge we've observed on a comet. Standard comet theory has failed completely to predict or explain the actual form and behaviors of the collimated jets of dust and gas seen exploding off of comets. This problem confronted scientists on NASA's Stardust mission when its spacecraft approached the comet Wild 2. An official NASA report describes the conundrum as follows, "The team predicted the jets would shoot up for a short distance, and then be dispersed into a halo around Wild 2. Instead, some super-speedy jets remained intact, like blasts of water from a powerful garden hose." An obvious problem is, the comparison of comet jets to the blasts of a garden hose is completely inappropriate. In the so called vacuum of space, what mechanism collimates the jets causing them to not disperse as comet scientists had predicted? An ad hoc theory some comet scientists have proposed is that so-called apertures or nozzles on the comet nucleus act as the "hose" through which the jet passes preventing its dispersal. However, such features remain elusive. This is acknowledged in the 2012 scientific paper 'Cometary Jet Collimation Without Physical Confinement' which states, "Contemporary models postulate that these jets collimate when the expanding gases and dust pass through a physical aperture or nozzle. However, recent high-resolution spacecraft observations fail to detect such apertures on cometary surfaces. Recent high-resolution images of comet nuclei revealed that the gas and dust expelled by the comet is organized into narrow plumes or jets..." "Furthermore, these models do not explain why cometary jets appear to be directed normal to the local gravitational potential. This is especially puzzling because the jet velocity, typically 300 m/sec far from the comet, greatly exceeds the escape velocity of only about 1 m/sec." In stark contrast, more than a century ago, one of the pioneers of electrical experimentalism, the Norwegian physicist Kristian Birkeland successfully emulated cometary jets from a cathode in a vacuum tube. Birkeland wrote, "From a cathode of graphite there came long, steady pencils of light, which greatly resembled the so-called eruptions or jets in comets." And today, the experimental approach to the Electric Universe continues, as we see in this home experiment by Thunderbolts colleague Jacob Gable who stunningly emulates cometary jets of gas and dust through simple electrical discharge in a makeshift vacuum chamber. The comet remains one of the most significant celestial objects for scientific investigation and it remains one of the clearest evidences that we live in an Electric Universe. 
The Electric Universe The Electric Universe -- Predictions & Surprises -- The space sciences today face a quandary that won't go away. Why have the greatest discoveries come as a shock to astronomers? Since the beginning of the space age, these surprises have occurred at all scales of observation, from remote galaxies down to our own neighborhood in the Milky Way, where planets and moons circle the Sun. We've seen this story a hundred times and more as new data sent theorists back to the drawing board. Contrast this quandary to the record of the Electric Universe. This new paradigm is in its early phase of emergence but its core prediction is crystal clear. When we examine energetic events in space, we will always find electromagnetic intensities far beyond the ability of prior theory to explain them. The impressive record of this prediction arises from a singular fact: that electricity, not just gravity, is highly active across the cosmos. Science advances through the predictive ability of new ideas. Ideas that connect observed facts to causes that can be named. Things already known and things yet to be discovered become predictable when seen in the light of a new interpretation. And so, the Electric Universe predicts and explains the spectacular jets emitted from galactic cores, the remarkable hourglass forms of stellar nebulae, and the acceleration of the solar wind out past the planets. Dozens of surprises follow logically and inescapably from the proposed cause but this is something you have to see for yourself. The great discoveries are no longer surprises as year by year the space sciences look more and more like the Electric Universe. The Electric Universe Thunderbolts.info

standard geology tells us that incremental processes over eons of time have shaped our planet's surface weathering erosion and plate tectonics are the primary processes that geologists believe have defined our planet's visible features as planetary scientists have explored our own Moon and other heavily cratered bodies they have considered collisional impacts in volcanism as the possible cause of the craters leaving countless anomalies unresolved however overwhelming evidence suggests that other processes not included in geology textbooks have left their indelible Mark upon the Earth and other planets a growing field of scientists and independent investigators are exploring the geological effects of high energy electrical discharges in a relatively recent Epoch of planetary instability a key figure in this field is Michael steinbacher a professional photographer who has studied the geological formations in the American southwest Michael is scheduled to speak at the forthcoming conference EU 2015 Paths of Discovery taking place June 25th to 29th in Phoenix Arizona today Michael offers a brief introduction and overview of his talk where he will present a photographic illustration of the electric Universe catastrophist Model A Link to Michael's YouTube channel can be found in the description box of this video my talk is basically going to be on the pestop geology model fortunately for for all of us we have Billy Elton doing experiments showing what happens when you have Dusty plasma and electromagnetic events taking place he's making what looks like mountains sometimes there're circular formation sometimes they look like galaxies at my request he did an experiment using a Channel of water with an electromagnetic event of anode and a cathode on either side and he released Dolomite and clay from above and it did what I had hoped it would do it prevented accumulation it didn't erode a canyon it prevented accumulation where the water was flowing and in between the two anode and cathode electrodes material seemed to accumulate prefer ually and it seemed to be wet as if water was being pulled up or Wicked somehow being involved with the process and it made something similar to the Grand Canyon and he's repeated it and it has scalloped edges at times so it really looks like what you see in the field it's very confirming I think of the model that I'm proposing Dolomite is is a wonderful mineral it it has all sorts of problems if you want to explain it having been created on the earth in the quantities required for what you find in the mountains and and and associated with oil uh it just doesn't form unless the ocean is boiling and full of uric acid urine which is not very likely on the other hand NASA was shocked when they went through the tail of Haley's Comet and collected dust they found 7% Dolomite and they think it's understated they also found Limestone they've also found everything required to explain pretty much the entire geologic column in Comet dust and not just one Comet but they're all sharing these anomalies hydrocarbons and Dolomite Limestone and things that really shouldn't be there things that people thought required water and this Dolomite seems to have fallen from the sky as described by our ancestors and it seems to have been at the very end end of these catastrophic processes because in many instances it's the very tops of the mountain the Dolan lights of the Alps there these beautiful Cliffs and you have a Windward and a leward side at the very top of the Alps there's Dolomite all through Nevada west of Las Vegas the tops of the mountains and it's layered with the shell Dolomite shell Dolomite shell as if it's being sort of ionically I I think by twiston berkling heart and then the other fascinating thing about do is that it's reported that that oil rained from the sky for days and nights by our ancestors again I winess accounts and Dolomite is where most of the oil that's been recovered prior to fracking has come from because it's Taurus so the oil in Saudi Arabia and Texas and California and all over the world prior to fracking the vast majority except for tar Sands and things like that has come from Dolomite formations because of porest and if you put a pipe in it you can suck it out as opposed to Shell which is a solid rock so it fits nicely with the hydrocarbons that are available from comets according to NASA and the Dolomite that's available from comets and it's all laid out in nature in the geologic column and it's where we get our oil from for the longest time I kept looking for electrically excavated canyons and I didn't really see them I was seeing what appeared to be fluvial things that got smaller as they went uphill and stopped before they got to a ridge and then started on the other side of the ridge back down again repeating what was on the previous side so it looks like it's a water event and then I stumbled on Zion Canyon which I had been to before but looking at Google Maps I noticed things that just weren't right and you can see that it's completely different than the Fluval excavations flu drainages it's electrical and I have a YouTube explaining all of this and then that opens up all these other doors because you can see what the electric process does and how it changes the color of the formations and then you can use this as a marker and look all over the place and see where electrical removal has taken place so it took six and a half years but finally I found what appeared to be electrical excavation that stand out that really ripped much of the Southwest at the very end of the process you can see that all the other layers have been deposited so that this process creating these electrical tants is the very end and it seems to create molten dust which downwind seems to create assault layers at the very top of the formations again the very end of the process so it took a long time but I found electrical removal on Earth it seems to be a a no-brainer there's just no way that water could explain these formations was no water available and they go through high points they don't stop at high points like something flui so yeah Zion Canyon is kind of the Rosetta Stone of electrical excavation to the planet Earth [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project at Thunderbolts.info The novelist Robertson Davies once stated, “The eye sees only what the mind is prepared to comprehend.” In the 21st century, scientists on Earth are observing and gathering data in unprecedented detail on the remotest phenomena in the physical Universe. Of course, as those who have followed this series are aware, what they actually find is routinely very different than what they expect. And what is the source of these surprises? Probably more than any physical science on Earth, in astrophysics and astronomy, where the essential tool is not a microscope but a telescope, data can be interpreted a number of ways. In the sciences, as in life, invalid interpretations begin with erroneous assumptions. In the 20th century's space sciences, one such assumption was that electric charges and currents cannot exist in the so-called vacuum of space. An intriguing insight into common beliefs on the subject can be found in the discussions of some popular websites. On the website Quora.com, the question is posed in the form of the query, “Does lightning exist in space?” The most viewed response attempts to answer as follows: “There is no lightning in space. Lightning is the result of ionization of air into a channel of plasma caused by strong electric field (in this context between a cloud and the ground). There is no air in space and nothing to get ionized. Strong electric field would produce nothing in space and there would be no lightning.” The notion that nothing exists in space to become ionized is of course laughable. Astrophysical plasmas, or “ionized gases”, have been a subject of intense scientific and laboratory investigations for nearly a century. And even the notion of so-called space lightning at the vastest cosmic scales has more recently been appearing in astrophysical literature. In 2011, radio astronomers reported their measurement of the electric current in a nearly 150,000 light years long extragalactic jet. As reported in the New Scientist article, “Universe’s highest electric current found”: “A COSMIC jet 2 billion light-years away is carrying the highest electric current ever seen: 10¹⁸ amps, equivalent to a trillion bolts of lightning.” As we’ve reported recently, new papers in peer-reviewed astrophysical journals propose that powerful electric currents flow in extra-galactic jets and that the jets themselves are “fundamentally electromagnetic structures.” However, if you follow science media, it’s likely that you’ve not noticed any attempt to contextualize the development as significant for astrophysics. One person who has noticed this disconnect is Thunderbolts colleague Chris Reeve, who has spent many years documenting the online discourse on scientific controversies, including the occasional “skeptical” polemics against the Electric Universe and Plasma Cosmology. Recently, Chris published a commentary exploring why the recognition of vast, cosmic electric currents has apparently yet to register either with science journalists or most online commentators. Chris’s initial comments were presented in an item posted by a Slashdot.org editor, entitled, “Can Electricity Travel Through Space on Astrophysical Jets?”. An October 2017 paper titled "Electric Currents along Astrophysical Jets" reports that "Several researchers have reported direct evidence for large-scale electric currents along astrophysical jets." A review of the citations at the end of that paper and others would seem to suggest that one of the great Internet science debates has finally been settled: Electricity does indeed travel through space over vast cosmic distances. What has been interesting to watch about this unexpected development is that science journalists have so far not explicitly reported this as a shift in theory, and commenters on sites like phys.org appear to deny that any change has even occurred: "The jets have been shown not to be electric currents, the energy and the physics involved are certainly not electromagnetic." This comment completely rejecting these new findings was highly rated by other phys.org readers, suggesting that the failure to explicitly report this as a change, in theory, has left this controversial topic in a highly confused state.” With Chris’s permission, we now present his full commentary, outlining the history of the controversy. I've been engaging people on these topics for around 12 years now. In fact, it was some peculiar interactions I observed here on Slashdot back in 2007 [slashdot.org] which greatly stimulated my interest in this topic. The idea that electricity flows through space is largely the brainchild of Hannes Alfven, who earned the Nobel for his creation of magnetohydrodynamics (the math which models cosmic plasmas using fluid equations). What has not been particularly emphasized by scientists or the science journalists is that Alfven realized towards the end of his career that the widespread application of MHD in astrophysics was a huge mistake. And he used the opportunity of his 1970 Nobel acceptance speech for MHD to explain to the astrophysical community why they should not be using MHD to model cosmic plasmas. The exact history of what happened is difficult to track down, and I've never seen it fully told in an academic setting ― which is really quite extraordinary, in a history of science sense. Quoting The Plasma Universe of Hannes Alfven, by David Talbott: "Alfvén's interest in magnetic fields laid the foundations of today's MHD theory, a theory widely employed by astrophysicists. In the original formulations of the theory, Alfvén spoke of magnetic fields being 'frozen' into neutral plasma, and the magnetohydrodynamic equations he formulated implied that the electric currents that create magnetic fields could be effectively ignored. Hence, the plasma activity on the Sun and in more remote space could be analyzed without reference to any larger domain of electric currents or electric circuits ..." To this notion, astronomers were readily attracted, and for a time they thought they had an ally in the brilliant electrical engineer. Although his 'fundamental work and discoveries in magnetohydrodynamics led to his Nobel Prize in 1970, the background to this occasion is paradoxical.' Through much of the 19th and 20th century, most astronomers and cosmologists had assumed the 'vacuum' of space would not permit electric currents. Later, when it was discovered that all of space is a sea of electrically conductive plasma, the theorists reversed their position, asserting that any charge separation would be immediately neutralized. Here they found what they were looking for in Alfvén's frozen-in magnetic fields and in his magnetohydrodynamic equations. Electric currents could then be viewed as strictly localized and temporary phenomena — needed just long enough to create a magnetic field, to magnetize plasma, a virtually 'perfect' conductor. The underlying idea was that space could have been magnetized in primordial times or in early stages of stellar and galactic evolution, all under the control of higher-order kinetics and gravitational dynamics. All large-scale events in space could still be explained in terms of disconnected islands, and it would only be necessary to look inside the 'islands' to discover localized electromagnetic events ― no larger electric currents or circuitry required. In this view, popularly held today, we live in a 'magnetic universe' (the title of several recent books and articles), but not an electric universe. The point was stated bluntly by the eminent solar physicist Eugene Parker, "No significant electric field can arise in the frame of reference of the moving plasma." But the critical turn in this story, the part almost never told within the community of astronomers and astrophysicists, is that Alfvén came to realize he had been mistaken. Ironically ― and to his credit ― Alfvén used the occasion of his acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize to plead with scientists to ignore his earlier work. Magnetic fields, he said, are only part of the story. The electric currents that create magnetic fields must not be overlooked, and attempts to model space plasma in the absence of electric currents will set astronomy and astrophysics on a course toward crisis. In accord with Alvén's observations, American physicist, professor Alex Dessler, former editor of the journal Geophysical Research Letters, notes that he himself had originally fallen in with an academic crowd that believed electric fields could not exist in the highly conducting plasma of space. He stated, 'My degree of shock and surprise in finding Alfvén right and his critics wrong can hardly be described.' In retrospect, it seems clear that Alfvén considered his early theoretical assumption of frozen-in magnetic fields to be his greatest mistake, a mistake perpetuated first and foremost by mathematicians attracted to Alfvén's magnetohydrodynamic equations. Alfvén came to recognize that real plasma behavior is too 'complicated and awkward' for the tastes of mathematicians. It is a subject "...not at all suited for mathematically elegant theories." It requires hands-on attention to plasma dynamics in the laboratory. Sadly, he said, the plasma universe became "...the playground of theoreticians who have never seen a plasma in a laboratory. Many of them still believe in formulae which we know from laboratory experiments to be wrong." Again and again, Alfvén reiterated the point: the underlying assumptions of cosmologists today, "...are developed with the most sophisticated mathematical methods and it is only the plasma itself which does not 'understand' how beautiful the theories are and absolutely refuses to obey them." There exists considerable confusion on this topic of electricity through space over cosmic plasmas, and it has been extraordinary to observe that this confusion is especially pronounced in the tech community. I have sought to document this bias in the tech community (and elsewhere) against electricity in space since I first observed it. Perhaps the most important untold story is about this mistaken assumption which formerly dominated astrophysics and cosmology, that space is basically empty (as in there is no interstellar matter). If you go back and look at what transpired, we can see that this mistake played an important part in the selection of theories and hypotheses. For example, Hannes Alfven's 1937 proposal of a galactic magnetic field was "met with widespread resistance (if not scorn), as it directly contradicted the prevailing wisdom that a vacuum filled interstellar space." A 1963 Popular Science interview with James Van Allen points out in big bold letters at the top of page 76: 'Space' was invented on Earth before we knew what was out there. The article explains: "I found Dr. Van Allen in Boston, at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was conferring with other space scientists. That evening, over dinner, I asked him about newly discovered phenomena of 'empty' space. 'Most people still think of space as a cold, black vacuum,' I said. 'Is it true that scientists shared this misconception until very recently?' 'Most scientists did think of space as a barren waste,' he said. 'When we started getting real information, it was quite a revelation.' The crucial turning point in our conception of space, of course, came in 1958 when we finally sent the first instrumented rockets up. These probes were pretty quickly recognized to be radioactive when they landed back on the Earth. This was a big surprise at the time, and within just a few years, the implications were openly discussed in the introductions to numerous astrophysical and plasma physics textbooks. For example: "Today it is recognized that 99.999% of all observable matter in the universe is in the plasma state, and plasmas are found at temperatures and densities far exceeding those that will support matter in the first three states." I've documented about 20 examples of these textbook admissions by now. Here's another one: "Plasmas can be divided into two broad categories: natural and man-made. It is an interesting fact that most of the material in the visible universe, as much as 99% according to some estimates, is in the plasma state. This includes the Sun, most stars, and a significant fraction of the interstellar medium. Thus, plasmas play a major role in the universe. Plasma physics is relevant to the formation of planetary radiation belts, the development of sunspots and solar flares, the acceleration of high-velocity winds that flow outward from the Sun and other stars, the generation of radio emissions from the Sun and other astrophysical objects, and the acceleration of cosmic rays." These more recent admissions by astrophysicists that electricity can flow through space, therefore, bear enormous importance, for it is today recognized that of the matter we can see, it is essentially almost entirely in the plasma state. So, if we are modeling that plasma incorrectly ― as observations of large-scale electrical jets seem to suggest ― it stands to reason that certain perplexing mysteries (like dark matter) are likely to be explained by this mistake. Perplexingly, the Slashdot community has been overtly hostile to this simple notion that electricity can flow through space. Attempts to even just convey new findings in this area are either completely ignored or treated as pseudoscience even when the announcements appear in established scientific journals. For example, here is another recent effort to inform the Slashdot community of a very important vindication for electricity in space: "The previously controversial claim that 'astrophysical jets are fundamentally electromagnetic structures' is becoming accepted by some astrophysicists. A summary of recent publications on the subject by Don Scott in particular notes the common presence of counter-rotating cylinders in black hole jets, a feature not expected by conventional models, yet a hallmark feature of Birkeland currents which was mathematically described in a 2015 paper. Counter-rotating cylinders are considered an important prediction for the Electric Universe claim that large-scale electric currents travel through space over plasmas. This recent acknowledgment offers additional vindication for the historical claim that the history of Birkeland Currents appears to be mired in politics. A 2007 Slashdot post titled 'Astronomers Again Baffled by Solar Observations' elicited a number of hostile reactions by Slashdot readers that the Electric Universe is obviously a 'crackpot theory', but what happens if astrophysicists start to widely acknowledge that large-scale electric currents do indeed flow through space?" It would seem that a mistaken bias against electricity in space continues to dominate conversations to this day, and will surely continue to do so for some time to come but it also increasingly appears that these convictions are today out of step with the current claims of the astrophysical community. So, in a sense, we now see the Slashdot community largely unaware that a huge theoretical shift has occurred, and that a lot of ridicule and dismissals in this community need to now be re-evaluated in the light of the recent recognition that electricity does indeed travel through space. If I had to guess at what will happen next, people will probably start suggesting ― as they tend to do ― that everybody actually already knew that electricity travels through space. But, the only way to find out how people are going to react is to finally start reporting on this situation. This conversation is way past due at this point.

welcome to space news from the electric universe brought to you by the thunderbolts project at Thunderbolts dot info in part 1 of this presentation physicist Eugene Baga Schaaf began his analysis of the ongoing mysteries surrounding the first-ever so-called interstellar asteroid Oh wah-wah Eugene scrutinized the rather surprising hypothesis that the object is not natural but rather a kind of alien technology that hypothesis arose primarily from Obama's peculiar acceleration as it moved away from the Sun but as Eugene will explain this is certainly not the first instance that the velocity of an object in our solar system has puzzled astronomers only one of several enigmas Oh mwah mwah presents based on the limited available data eugene continues his analysis of this intriguing celestial traveler so it seems that so far there is no clear consensus on the possible sources of Omar Moore's acceleration nor there is a consensus on whether this object should be considered a comet or an asteroid or even an alien spacecraft just to be clear I would like to draw here a baseline a ground zero so to speak representing the actual raw observations to clearly show what is inferred on top of that and to take it with a pinch of salt by default and actually we know really not much firstly we saw a moving dot in the sky only a few pixels across even as observed by the best available telescopes multiple observations from various facilities during few months indicate that this is not some kind of visual artifact but a real celestial body the object also demonstrated somewhat irregular but still periodic changes in brightness the ratio between maximal and minimal optical energy flux being roughly equal to 10 and the period of brightness change being roughly 8 hours and that is pretty much it everything else is speculation so should be critically evaluated and not taken as fact especially I might add with a bit of humor the things that would be proposing a bit later in this video and then the next one by the way the analysis of the changes in brightness of Omaha as for example is shown in the paper the excited spin state of Omaha could also lead to a conclusion that it is very Oblates rather than very oblong so it could as well be bang cake shaped so to speak rather than cigar shaped as it is almost uniformly acknowledged now in the media and even the research papers this is one of the reasons why one should be careful with the infamous artist's impressions of various objects and processes that might be depicted totally wrong depending on the correctness of the assumptions that they are based on in previous videos I myself have used the initial assumption about the probable oblong shape yet I've clearly stated that it is a conjecture obtained from modeling assumptions about the albedo etc and what is really observed is only changes in brightness we don't really know yet and maybe we would never know what the actual shape of the object is the cake shape obviously would be somewhat more consistent with the solar sail scenario that was described in the previous space news video on the topic I should note that there was another piece of observational data that was collected by various facilities and that is the spectrum of the object although with a caveat that since those were mostly earth-based telescopes only visible part of the spectrum was recorded the spectrum seems pretty dull and not too different with respect to the spectra of the small bodies in the solar system some authors have suggested see four examples paper called Omaha is hot imaging spectroscopy in search of meteor activity that the smoothness of Omaha mower spectrum means that it should have been formed in some relatively warm conditions but then again we know that even cometary dust contains high-temperature silicates so that really doesn't change anything at least in the EU perspective by the way I'm really baffled by the fact that none of the available x-ray telescopes in space have performed any observations of the object I personally believe that if there was some electrical activity on the surface which is not guaranteed given all the objects peculiarities yet still possible then it could have been detected in the x-ray frequency range I'll remind the viewer that it is quite typical for their bodies in the solar system to demonstrate potential differences of few hundred volts between their surfaces or atmospheres and the ambient solar wind around them such potential difference was observed at Saturn's moon Hyperion when it's at the Cassini space probe with a stream of electrons accelerated by a potential difference of about 200 volts the same negative potential of 200 to 500 volts was observed by Rosetta space probe at the comet 67p and there have been detection of x-rays from Pluto's atmosphere in the same energy range which I've already reported in the video called Pluto's x-rays baffled scientists at the Thunderbolts project YouTube channel the detection of these x-rays accompanied by the focusing of the solar wind ions at Pluto as if attracted by the electric field in my opinion seems to indicate the negative charge of Pluto's atmosphere with the appropriate potential of about 300 to 600 volts which seems entirely consistent with the previous measurements done at other bodies as well as modeling of the behavior of asteroids and the moons of Mars where it is also suggested that even the solar wind flow itself should cause potential differences of the order of hundreds of volts across the surface so it wouldn't be unexpected if Oh mwah mwah would actually emit in the soft x-ray range with energies of photons of about 3 to 700 electron volts just because of the electric discharging between the surface and the solar wind plasma yet given the somewhat unique character of this body it would have been even more interesting to see whether that would actually be the case unfortunately since the object cannot be seen any more it is possible that we will never know now I wish to dive deeper into a hypothetical area and discuss some of the ideas I've had in the recent weeks while trying to figure out the peculiar behavior of Omaha in the light of research papers mentioned in the previous video first of all I should note that the radial acceleration away from the Sun that was supposedly observed while tracking Omaha's position is not very different from the inwards acceleration of the Pioneer ten and eleven probes widely known as the Pioneer anomaly obviously the direction of acceleration is the opposite but the effect is pretty similar and there is only one order of magnitude difference in terms of its intensity if one uses the simple one over R squared law and corrects for the much farther position of pioneers at the time of the detection of the anomaly now the scientific community for the most part agrees that pioneer anomaly might be explained by the anisotropic heat emission by the probes themselves so supposedly they were decelerated by the infrared photons emitted by themselves roughly in the direction of their motion that is away from the Sun and thus slightly decelerated it is quite peculiar that the acceleration remained roughly constant even though the heat output from the probes radioisotope thermal and quite significantly to be honest I haven't found any explanation of how this fact fits in the accepted scenario yet I cannot claim that such an explanation does not exist what I can claim is that the same anomaly was also observed at Ulysses and Galileo space probes although the later assessment seems to have raised doubts about it as some scientists believe that the accuracy of the measurements of these probes trajectories and velocities was not enough to make a clear conclusion unfortunately it is also not clear whether pioneer anomaly was observed or not for Cassini the two voyagers and New Horizons probes voyagers and Cassini periodically fired their thrusters and changed attitude so it would definitely hide the possible anomalous acceleration signal and New Horizons team comments on this subject are pretty vague and ambiguous so I have not seen any explicit statement about whether they even checked for the possible pioneer anomaly with their probe however one presentation I saw once claimed that New Horizons team simply did not have the money to perform Doppler tracking of the spacecraft and thus no data with enough precision was available in the first place but anyway over the years many different alternative explanations of the Pioneer anomaly appeared such as for example the one proposed by modified Newtonian dynamics Ormonde developed by Mordecai Milgram or the one proposed by the modified inertia theory developed by Mike McCulloch I would not describe these in detail I would just note that the anomaly itself indicates that there might be something wrong in the way we understand the behavior of bodies in the outer solar system that is roughly from the orbit of Jupiter and beyond generally speaking perhaps our misunderstanding of the behavior of these probes out there is caused by the inherent extremity of the conditions in the appropriate areas but the degree of removal of these probes from the everyday experience of humankind so that their motion can no longer be described by the simple laws that we are quite satisfied with looking from where we are I would briefly touch on this subject again in the next video but right here I just want to say that maybe Omaha was unusual acceleration is also caused by the extreme trajectory it was traveling along maybe our understanding of the motion of celestial bodies is already being tested at this kind of motion in this regard I'm very interested if there would appear some anomalous acceleration of a parker solar probe which is going to orbit the Sun faster than any previous spacecraft did before who knows maybe it would also detect some unusual acceleration or something like that now going a bit closer to the electric universe interpretations there is an interesting paper that among other things considers a possible impact of Lorentz force on the motion of spacecraft it is indeed possible that the two pioneers actually have had some electric charge and thus the magnetic fields in interplanetary plasma could have altered their ocean the authors of this paper do not think it would have a big impact since they place the upper limit on the charge of the Pioneer probes on the order of 10 to the minus seventh coulombs it's possible that they underestimate the charge or the magnetic field strength in the interplanetary medium I should also note that even the ambient solar wind has an electric field to it the so called motional electric field because it is a flowing magnetized plasma and technically might be considered as a moving conductor in a magnetic field of its own which would create an appropriate electric field through induction and it is not impossible that such a field would also impact the charge space probe in some way obviously the same line of reasoning applies to overarm or another thing that might be of importance is a simple electrostatic attraction or repulsion if an object such as pioneer space probe or omoi has some electric charge and there is a non zero net charge of plasma around it it would be subjected to acceleration by electrostatic forces usually such possibility is ignored because it is considered that the large-scale electric fields in plasma are shielded by the redistribution of charges in plasma itself the so-called Debye screening it might be the case that some other mechanism is responsible for overcoming this screening one idea that's been circulating in the U community for quite some time is that the cosmic plasmas including obviously the solar wind plasma might have an array of the so called plasma double layers embedded into them so that on large scales the fields might be damped yet locally there might be observed layers of positive and negative charges traveling together something like a train of capacitors following each other one by one if you like so in my opinion it is not impossible that these double layers with the electric fields associated with them is what might cause the accelerations that we observe aside from pioneer anomaly there is another known but yet unexplained phenomenon that I should mention here and that is so-called flyby anomalies the matter is very spacecraft have experienced unexplained accelerations while performing flyby maneuvers around the earth and possibly other planets the most recent reported case being the apparent anomaly in Juno motion during its closed approach to Jupiter the additional speed gained during these anomalous events is generally pretty small of the orders of millimeters or centimeters per second yet the precision of our measurements allows us to detect this discrepancy and so far there is no consensus about what might be the reason it is not impossible that this could also be explained by spacecraft electric charge that interacts with the magnetosphere of a planet and/or with the electric fields and plasma currents present in it after all both Earth and Jupiter has quite strong dipole or magnetic fields and the studies of the flyby anomalies seem to indicate that it is connected to the asymmetry in the inbound and outbound equatorial angles which might be explained by an asymmetric interaction with the planet's magnetic dipole during the flyby anyway my point is that perhaps something like that might also be observed in case of Oh mwah mwah now obviously for this object the acceleration was not an event more or less localized in time as with the flyby anomalies but rather continuous but at the same time one might consider all of the heliosphere as being the domain of solar magnetosphere and plasma currents so it is possible that the same effect have manifested itself as a continuous acceleration in this case going into even more hypothetical areas at this point I wouldn't rule out even various shady quasi relativistic effects such as the Woodward effect for example a hypothesized acceleration of bodies due to the energy transfer this effect as far as I know is not yet acknowledged as experimentally proven yet it is not impossible that it would be at some point so perhaps it could also serve as an explanation I have some even more shady idea that the acceleration outwards might be caused by some quasi centrifugal force due to the rotation of the Sun and thus of the plasma in the heliosphere but that is a vague intuition rather than a coherent theory at this point in general it seems that Omaha moas unusual acceleration if it indeed has one could lead us to reconsider many of the theories of how bodies behave while interacting with cosmic plasmas I believe it is an important matter to be researched in the electric universe done since at the moment there is a definite lack of explanations in the astrophysics community or rather the lack of consistency of these explanations with the observations so it is a good opportunity to propose an alternative explanation and to improve the EU agenda at the same time having a new set of observations available to refine the existing theories [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project at Thunderbolts.info Today, we begin a series of reports that will discuss the latest scientific papers on the European Space Agency's Rosetta mission to Comet 67P. In addition to countless unresolved puzzles facing comet scientists, we have discussed in previous episodes the problem of the comet's double-lobed shape, however that particular form of a comet nucleus is apparently not unique. Several other of the comets imaged to date have displayed similar forms. Multiple asteroids, including this one imaged on July 25th of this year, have displayed distinct peanut-like shapes with a marked narrowing at the body's neck. And recently, NASA's New Horizons mission has revealed that the Plutonian moon Hydra also has a double-lobed form. Why do so many of these different types of bodies in the solar system display this particular shape? The Electric Universe theory states that comets and asteroids were electrically excavated from planets and moons in a relatively recent epoch of planetary instability, as discussed in previous episodes. Plasma scientist Dr. C.J. Ransom produced these familiar double-lobed forms in experiments with electrical discharges to samples of Heamatite. In fact, Comet 67P has revealed countless distinctly planetary features, including wind- streaked rocks, fields of boulders and rubble, mountainous terrain that appears to have been uplifted from a planetary body and even sand dunes. However, as Wal Thornhill explains, the only explanation that Rosetta scientists can offer for the comet's shape is a remarkably improbable low-velocity collision between two comets. A report by the European Space Agency published on 28 September titled, "How Rosetta's comet got it's shape", concluded from some important research published in the journal Nature (the same day) that, "Two comets collided at low speed in the early solar system to give rise to the distinctive rubber duck shape of Comet 67P Churyumov–Gerasimenko". Earlier, there were two competing ideas: Did two comets merge or did localized erosion of a single object form the neck? Now, scientists have an unambiguous answer to the conundrum. They have shown that the shape arose from a low speed collision between two fully fledged, separately formed comets. Matteo Massironi - lead author from the University of Padova, Italy, and an associate scientist of the OSIRIS team said, "It is clear from the images that both lobes have an outer envelope of material organized in distinct layers, and we think these extend for several hundred meters below the surface ... This points to the layered envelopes in the comet's head and body forming independently before the two objects merged later", concludes Matteo. "It must have been a low-speed collision in order to preserve such ordered strata to the depths our data imply". Co-author Bjorn Davidsson added, "In addition, the striking structural similarities between the two lobes imply that despite their initially independent origins, they must have formed through a similar accretion process. Layering has also been observed on the surface of other comets during previous flyby missions, suggesting that they also underwent a similar formation history". Holger Sierks, OSIRIS principal investigator at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Göttingen said, "How the comet got its curious shape has been a major question since we first saw it. Now, thanks to this detailed study, we can say with certainty that it is a 'contact binary'." So much for the reports, but how exactly do you get two widely separated bodies experiencing similar primordial stratified accretion? And why primordial? That's simply an assumption, and the mechanism of gravitational accretion has never been shown to work! Notice also the emphasis on gentle and low-speed collisions. Just how slow does it have to be, so the result is not mutual fragmentation and dispersal? And how does a collision form a neck between these two lobes?! On top of that, what are the chances of collision of two tiny bodies of a few kilometres cross-section in a volume of space in the outer solar system that is unimaginably huge! The explanation requires so many post-hoc and unlikely conditions that it is unbelievable. It only passes the critical faculties because it's a story that is being repeated and repeated until we no longer think about it. The Nature paper refers to the stratified rocky-like material, seen on the comet's surface it shows how experts can become blind to what the untrained eye can plainly see - that Comet 67P is rocky. The selective blindness occurs because it destroys a cherished belief in the centuries old story of the primordial solar system, but that story has failed repeatedly. It is not predictive. Each new discovery is a surprise - the most recent being Pluto and it's moon. And now that we have information from more than 2,000 XO planetary systems, our solar system seems like the odd one out. But modern specialization and fragmentation of science allows such disconnects to exist, and spread, which must lead to an inevitable crisis. The history of science shows this to be the case with centuries of stagnation followed by sudden breakthroughs and often the breakthroughs have come from outsiders who look at problems with a beginner's mind. Old beliefs die hard. The astronomer, the late Tom Van Flandern, in his 1993 book "Dark Matter, Missing Planets and New Comets" made the comparison between comets, minor planets and asteroids and suggested they are the same basic types of rocky bodies. Comets are dark, reflecting a few percent of sunlight which is not expected for icy bodies. And radar echoes from Comet Encke implied a non-porous, probably rock surface material. An expert in celestial mechanics, Van Flandern is perhaps best known for his exploding planet hypothesis which he proposed as the origin of asteroids and comets and which is supported by showing that the orbits of comets and asteroids could be understood in terms of an origin in a late explosive event in the asteroid belt. His exploding planet hypothesis is discounted, of course, by the lack of a plausible mechanism to cause a planet to explode. And now, by the onion-skin layering in the two lobes of Comet 67P, which implies formation by accretion rather than fragmentation in an explosion. But his arguments are compelling for a cataclysmic event in the asteroid belt to produce tens of thousands of asteroids and comets. What's most persuasive is, that he's unusual hypothesis predicted stable asteroid satellites, which was surprisingly confirmed. So, what was the explosive event and how did it form peanut-shaped comets and asteroids? The chances of direct collisions of tiny rocks in the vastness of interplanetary space to produce the peanut-shapes are negligible. Multiply that by the odds of the colliding rock sticking together and forming a neck and the chances are about zero. Gravitational capture and tidal forces do not enhance the odds significantly. The serious nature of this problem was highlighted in July this year when Lance Benner, who leads NASA's Asteroid Radar Research program said that, "Radar imaging has shown that about 15 percent of near-Earth asteroids larger than 600 feet (or 180 metres) ... have this sort of lobed, peanut shape. There must be a process that forms the double-lobe shape naturally." A clue comes from experiments done by C.J. Ransom using an electric discharge striking Haematite powder to simulate the red Martian surface. The Martian "blueberries" were replicated in color and shape by the laboratory discharges. It was also found that interlocking blueberries are a property of spherules formed during an electric discharge. It may also be significant considering the apparent low density of Comet 67P, that the Haematite spherules were hollow with thick walls. It seems that the catastrophic event required by Van Flandern's research was of an electrical nature. There is a cosmic electric discharge - an interplanetary thunderbolt - which has been graphically depicted many times in our Space News. Van Flandern, an expert in orbital dynamics, traced his exploding planet event to the asteroid belt beyond Mars. So, it is highly significant that Mars was identified with the cosmic thunderbolt and was reported to have received a scar, visible at the time from Earth, following a battle using this favored weapon of the planetary gods. The great canyon system of Valles Marineris, which stretches a third of the way around Mars, is that scar. Almost four billion cubic kilometres of rock and dust was excavated from Mars within the memory of mankind - a great deal of it accelerated into space by gigantic plasma arc. Meteorites from Mars are still arriving on Earth today, and in 1988, I published a paper arguing that of 17 mysteries associated with common meteorites a plasma arc process could explain all of them. The discharge attracts and heats matter along the discharge axis. Repeated lightning strokes along the same path will produce layering of matter accreted along that discharge axis. The appearance of that discharge could be likened to bead lightning - a string of glowing rocky beads. Matter is also accelerated along the axis giving a high probability of forming lobed asteroid and comet precursers. The spatially and temporally confined nature of this process is also ideal for forming stable asteroid and comet satellites. So, when Rosetta project scientist Matt Taylor says of Comet 67P, "This result adds to our growing knowledge of the comet - how it formed and it's evolution", he is dead wrong. The accepted story of the slow formation and evolution of the solar system over billions of years is fictional. The story I have told here is one of chaos and violence in the solar system within the last ten thousand years or so. As one philosopher has written, Newton on consciously religious, rather than scientific grounds, gave currency to a new form of the old belief that the celestial order is altogether superior to the terrestrial and cannot, in particular, be the scene of any catastrophic change. That belief has not changed much in 350 years. When researchers are met with endless surprises in space exploration, they must be open to re-examining old beliefs and assumptions - only then will mankind benefit fully from their remarkable space engineering and exploration feats.

Mars in Ancient Myths and Religion All right, so we've got the planet Mars up on the screen and I think most of us here know that the modern name for Mars comes from the latin, God of War and so let's take a peek at him real quick. Mars was known as a furious warrior, as a God who brings pestilence, as a wolf God, and as a god of the spring. So those are probably four of his primary attributes. And the leading scholar of Roman religion is a guy named Georges Dumezil and his masterwork is called Archaic Roman Religion and it's his ideas that kind of dominate the modern field. And so, he believes that Latin religion is based upon three different structures of society in early Indo-Eropean culture and that Mars represents the warrior class. So Mars is the God who presides over the exercise of physical prowess. He's the god of warriors and soldiers. Mircea Eliade, who we've cited many times, congratulates Dumezil's showing that only by deciphering the basic ideological system underlying the social and religious institutions can a particular divine figure, myth or ritual be correctly understood. And another leading scholar calls Dumezil's achievement among the (most) foremost scholarly achievements of our time. And so, Dumezil is without question a world-class scholar. The guy was a master of dozens of languages, produced countless books and manuscripts. He is indeed an imposing figure. But here is his ultimate conclusion that the Latin God Mars represents the warrior class, strictly a social metaphor, and that Mars does not have a naturalistic aspect. His area of influence, the place of his signs is not the atmosphere. Another leading modern scholar, after acknowledging that Dumezil is the top expert, asks the question whether a pattern uniting the apparently incoherent details of Mars's cult can be discovered. For a possible guide to this question we would turn to leads from Babylonian astronomical traditions which obviously predate Rome by a while. And so if you look at how Mars is represented in ancient Babylonian texts; he's described as a furious warrior, as a bringer of pestilence, and as a wolf star. Now, that's kind of a coincidence. So in one of these astronomical texts that says, "Mars is said to bring pestilence or deaths in an astrological report... Mars is said to have caused a fever..." But this is exactly the way the Latin God Mars is described in the very earliest Latin passages that we have. So they said, "Mars confers blessings but is prone to anger. He sends harvest failures and cattle plagues." A very famous Latin ritual was called the Arvale Carmen and their Mars is invoked as a wild and potentially destructive power who can afflict crops with disease. So there's almost a one-to-one correspondence between the way the Latin God Mars is described as an agent of pestilence and the way the Babylonian planet is. So now if we turn to the Mesopotamian cult of the god Nergal, who was widely acknowledged to be the planet Mars, we find him described as a raging warrior, as an agent of pestilence. He's a raging storm God and a ruler of the underworld. So one ancient text from about 2000 BC says, "Warrior! Raging storm-tide, who flattens lands in upheaval. Warrior! Lord of the underworld." He's consistently described as a furiously raging storm but a constant adjective is at the bottom he's called 'hus' which means the fiery red, furious or rage. So we're gonna see this motif again and again and in descriptions of these ancient warriors or warrior gods they're always going to be a fiery red and they're going to be described as raging. But of course, the Mesopotamian scholars have no idea where Nergal comes from either. He's just a complete mystery. So this is arguably the top guy in Sumerian studies and he says, "To take an absolutely fundamental question, who or what is Nergal?" Well, this is an early description of Nergal. The vanguard whose strength is sublime... whose divine splendor is sublime in heaven. Star ever shining. Sublime of features. It sounds like they're describing a star, maybe. So at the bottom it says, Nergal warrior of the gods... Who takes his place in the height of heaven... Whose features ever glow in heaven. I mean, anybody that can read can understand that they're describing something in heaven. Whether it's the planet Mars, as the scribes themselves maintained, remains open to question I suppose. But there can't be any question that they're describing a celestial power. So back to Dumezil again. Here's the way he describes the warrior god Mars in Latin cult. "The ambiguous character of Mars, when he breaks loose on the field of battle, accounts for the epithet caecus, blind, given to him by the poets. At a certain stage of furor he abandons himself to his nature, destroying friend as well as foe." So this indiscriminate slaughter associated with Mars is going to be a recurring theme and it's found around the world. So in Arab texts it just so happens that the planet Mars was described as the blind one. And so it says, "They give to Mars the name Mara-Samya, which means the blind lord, and they call him blind because of (its) his extreme violence and because in his rage he strikes without regard." So here you have almost the exact same description as we found in the Latin God Mars. This is a recent book talking about literature and it just says, "The battle fury of warriors... is traditionally the quintessential subject matter of heroic verse. The wrath or furor (of warrior) of heroic warriors is, as Milton acknowledges, the salient theme of both the Iliad and the Aeneid. So to take Achilles for example. This is the top, one of the top scholars of Greek myth is a guy named Gregory Nagy. So here's the way he describes Achilles. "Achilles himself, in his climatic moments of rage, and Bill Mullen will confirm, the first word in the Iliad is rage, by the way, describing Achilles. But it says Achilles himself, in his climactic moments of rage, is described as equal to Ares. Ares is the God of War but he is also more specifically the God of martial fury. In war, a warrior who is possessed by the God Ares experiences this kind of martial fury which is typically bestial. The Greek word for this martial fury is lussa, meaning 'wolfish rage' and of course we know Ares was represented as a wolf just like the Latin God was. To experience such a martial rage is to be beside oneself, and to be beside oneself is to be possessed - possessed by Ares." So there's a recent book on Germanic warrior types. It's just a fascinating book and it discusses these early warrior societies where young men would, would drive themselves to ecstatic prowess and they'd just head off looking for the nearest war. And it says, "Warrior styles have much to offer to our understanding of history. They tell us how long ago, when war was still welcome, fighting men reached the state of ecstasy that led them to do astounding things. They lead us into the heart of Vedic, Indian, Homeric, Celtic and Germanic civilizations, where fighting prowess was still the measure of a man." And again, this is obviously that tradition went on for many thousands of years. Here's how Macrobius describes the Latin God Mars, "And to the glowing heat by which the spirit is kindled and roused, sometimes to anger, sometimes to deeds of valor, to a temporary madness... to this property men have given the name Mars." Pretty much the exact same description that George Dumezil gave to the blind warrior. As those of you will know who have read my books, it just turns out that cultures all around the world said that they imitated the planet Mars when they went into battle. They were trying to incorporate his rage or to emulate his rage or fury when they took to the battlefield. So this is a quote from the leading ritual of the Pawnee Indians in North America. So it says, "This is the way I do when I am imitating him, the planet Mars, when I become angry, when I am imitating him." Move to South America, "At times of battle, the planet Mars had to endow the Toba warriors with fighting spirit." As a Polynesian god of war who is known as Maru, flaming with wrath and full of anger. Australian Aborigines, "The planet Mars is Bilyara, the eagle... he was warlike, and much given to fighting." Early Indian astronomical texts as in Asian India, "Mars has blood-red eyes, is fickle-minded and given to anger." Now when you go out tonight and look at the clear Phoenix skies, look at the planet Mars and see if you see an angry planet. The nature of Mars... This is Roger Bacon from the Middle Ages. "The nature of Mars is fiery... to excite men to anger, discord, and wars." And this is the leading scholar on ancient astrological ideas, Franz Cumont and in this he points out that these ideas are basic to language. "There can perhaps be no more striking proof of the power and popularity of astrological beliefs than the influence which they have exercised over popular language. All modern idioms preserve traces of it, which we can no longer discern except with difficulty, survivals of vanished superstitions. Do we still remember when we speak of a martial character, that it must have been formed by the planet Mars? That one of these 'astra', stars, which, if hostile will cause me a disaster?" So he's admitting that the word disaster has, has a direct relation to stars. Turning to leading Irish hero. He's a fascinating character because he offers just a crystal clear image of this raging warrior. And so it says, so when this guy went into battle he became distorted with anger and battle fury. He grew gigantic in size and, like Mars, he fought indiscriminately, killing friends and foes, right and left. Now the interesting thing about that Irish hero is he was blind and all of us will remember the classic example of the blind warrior is the biblical Samson. And how was he described? Well, he was characterized by a hot anger. The red-hot anger. So Judges describes his anger being kindled. Interestingly enough, Samson has been identified with the planet Mars. The ancient Celtic term for Cuchulainn raging hot anger is 'f' 'e' 'r' 'g' Ferg and in my opinion that's a cognate word with the furor belli of the Latin God Mars. Back to the Irish God again. It says, when he was undergoing his furor, he became crimson all over, shook violently and assumed a swollen form. The top Irish scholar of ancient warriors said that the key to figuring out these figures is that all words for 'hero' expressed the notions of furor, ardour, tumescence, which means swelling, and speed. The hero, the warrior hero, is the furious one, possessed of his own tumultuous and blazing energy. If you turn back, now again to the cult of the Mesopotamian star God Nergal clearly described as the planet Mars, one of his epithets describes him as the sweller but the word sweller also means anger and fury. So you get this image of this giant planet-god, red, clearly red, that takes on a massive form when he's angry and starts causing disasters. So very early on, this is an image that Dave and I drew up or actually simulated it with a computer with life-size planetary models. So the polar configuration is over on the left. The yellow body is Saturn and the green body is Venus and the red body is Mars, just for the sake of illustration. And what this shows is that with just the slightest displacement of Mars towards the Earth, it grows massive in size. And so the Polynesian name for the planet Mars, interestingly enough, is 'the quick swelling one.' Again, if you look at Mars in the sky today, see if that idea would ever occur to you that Mars is a quick swelling planet or warrior. So we all know that the Greek Hercules was identified with the planet Mars by the Greeks themselves. Less known is the fact that Hercules was identified with the Mesopotamian God Nergal. Very well-known is the fact that Heracles served as a young male's role model as a warrior and as an athlete. And so again, archaic warriors everywhere re-enacted in masked dances the deeds of the gods and ancestors. They did so to gain the divine ecstasy of 'the beginning of time,' the time of creation. In battle, when it mattered most to live in these mythical times, warriors bodied forth gods and ancestors by fighting in their style. They wanted to emulate the gods. So, according to this text it says, the Batavii going to battle sang of Hercules. The Spartans did the same thing when they went into battle and of course Spartans were known as being among the greatest warriors of the ancient world. They invoked Hercules, they wanted to be like Heracles. It's very well known among Greek scholars that the Greek Heracles was identified with the great god of ancient Tyre, a Phoenician cult and Melqart in turn was identified with the Mesopotamian God Nergal of the planet Mars. So the characteristic rite described in the Old Testament about this Phoenician God Melqart is that every year he was burnt to death on a great funeral pyre. So how did Heracles meet his end? He was burnt to death on a funeral pyre. And so, Sophocles describes this at great length in one of his plays. (But back) so it says, "At the precise moment of agonizing death, a flaming thunderbolt from his father Zeus strikes Heracles. He goes up in flames, in a spectacular explosion of fire." As he mounted the pyre, we are told in this tragedy I was just talking about, came a terrible outburst of anger. The bodily pains which he felt, united with that disease of the heroes, their fits of rage, which is never very far from madness." Interestingly enough, Australian Aboriginal tradition relates of the planet Mars that he died in a fire, that he died on a funeral pyre and changed into the planet Mars. It is said that he was burnt to death on a mountain where he had kindled the fire. Back to... this is an early Greek vase showing at the bottom Heracles, his funeral pyre. At the top he is flying off to heaven where he's going to receive his apotheosis. And so the top scholar of these ancient vases, James Boardman says, "On two of the three Attic vases with the pyre, Heracles is shown as a young man." So he's been burnt to death but now he's rejuvenated. So it says, "The young Heracles has clearly been rejuvenated by his experience," being burnt. So this, the early writer Nonnos specifically describes Heracles as the Phoenix in a comparison with the Phoenix bird for regaining his youth in fire. Turning back to the Latin cult, one of the most exciting discoveries of the last hundred years, was that they found these Etruscan vases depicting the Latin God Mars as getting a fiery bath here at the hands of Minerva. And again Dumezil and the other guys discuss all this stuff and they all, they discuss these vases and they say, well it's clear the little guy is being rejuvenated but we really don't have an explanation for why that might be the case. He's being rejuvenated by means of fire. So the first meaning says this means that Mars is intended to be reborn from death and a clear description says he lived to be a 123 years old and he died two or three times and came back. So he's a resurrected God, the Latin God Mars. The Mesopotamian God was resurrected as well. Josephus, the writer on early Jewish stories, keeps using the word Egersis in connection with Heracles but that word also used, is specifically used to describe resurrection, the resurrection. In ancient Iranian myth there was a really curious little figure named Batraz and like Heracles he is burnt on a giant funeral pyre. He's again a, one of these raging warriors that kills anyone indiscriminately right and left. He's the greatest warrior of the Iranian warriors. And so it says, this guy will henceforth live in the sky from which he will descend in a blast, in a burst, sorry, incandescent as at his birth, whenever some danger or scandal threatens his kin. And interestingly enough, he descends from heaven as a furious red ball periodically descending to Earth like lightning. So again, this is an image you're gonna see again and again that this fiery red star is going to grow massive, descend from heaven as a raging form but in a lightning-like shape or as a meteor. So turning back to the Mesopotamian cult, the planet Mars is specifically described as fire falling from the sky. This Semitic term 'miqit isatu'. But that same word also means lightning and it also means the fall of a meteor. Pliny the Elder said that these thunderbolts come from the planet Saturn and much as the inflammatory ones come from the planet Mars. So the planet Mars was clearly associated with lightning and/or thunderbolts. Again, the image from yesterday we showed with Mars descending slightly from Venus, on the left, and then the one from today showing it as a massive form... I think it's easy to see that if something like this actually transpired in the skies overhead, you might think of a massive red ball or meteor descending from heaven, causing disaster. So, earlier we talked about the Pawnee traditions. Where they emulated the fiery warrior, they clearly called him the planet Mars as they went into battle. And yet they claimed that that this guy, the Pawnee Mars, came from a meteor. The Latin God Mars. It was said that on the first day of the year, that his shield fell from heaven. So at the base of the screen it says, "Worship of meteorites was easily extended to ancient monoliths... Mars' ancile," the shield, "is the best known instance." Back to the Iranian figure that was burnt to death on the pyre. He was, an interesting story told about him was that he was described as an abscess. And so you see this a lot in the text that the Martian warrior is described as a pus-filled little guy, as an ulcer but often as an abscess. Interestingly that Semitic word describing Mars as fire and lightning and meteor, it also means abscess. The Mesopotamian God Nergal himself was known as the pimply one. But the same word also means lightning or ecstatic. Well, this is a current picture of the planet Mars. I think it's easy to see that if this object appeared in the northern circumpolar heavens, that you might easily say that that looks like a pimply formed god. We noted that the last characteristic of the Latin God was that he was the god of the spring. Now, that doesn't quite jibe with the others at first sight. And yet, Australian Aboriginal tradition also remembers the planet Mars as the god of the spring. So this little guy was the head honcho of their warrior societies. They painted themselves red as they headed into war but they said the red star was seen to be responsible for spring and he personified sexual activity and fertility. Interestingly enough, a very similar tradition is found in an early Chinese text where the red star is associated with the arrival of spring, the beginning of the year, the exact same thing as the Latin God Mars is associated with the beginning of the year. And it's in the beginning of spring. So this is my conclusion. The sacred traditions attached to the Latin God Mars, far from reflecting the different class structures of archaic Indo-European culture, encode the remembered history of the planet Mars, albeit much humanized and historicized. A radical rewriting of history is in order. We've only just begun. And I think, if you think about these images and think about Mars moving close to Earth, look at the physical structure of Mars now. What would you expect? I mean, Mars looks like a destroyed planet, a scarred planet. If it engaged in these catastrophes well within the memory of man, would you expect to see something like that? Would that help explain why Mars doesn't have an atmosphere? Like most other planets. Why Mars' oceans of water have apparently been ripped off? Why rocks from Mars have been ripped off the planet and deposited on the planet Earth? If Mars participated in these disasters, like Dave and I have been talking about for 30-some years, what would that tell you about the likelihood of current life on Mars? I mean, it'd be pretty tough to imagine anything other than single celled animals or primitive, you know, primitive organisms living up there now. Certainly, these folks talking about the pyramids being up on Mars and Martians invading us every now and then, they're pretty unlikely to be right, I would suggest. Thank you very much, I appreciate it. 
[Music] Not so long ago, the whole of North America across to Siberia and Europe, were shattered and destroyed in nights of  hell. In a series of deadly catastrophic events, mammoths together with the Clovis Indian people were wiped out. These memories are still retained in cloudy mythology. What agent of destruction rendered them extinct? Did it happen just once, or was it a series of events that determine these mass extinctions? Siberia, Alaska, Malta. Three mass-slaughter  sites. Sites littered with carcasses and skeletons. Some are petrified as rocks, others invaded and buried in limestone. Some are entombed in bitumen, still  more buried in ice and peat bogs. Their instantaneous end was horrific. Some are impeccably preserved, but the vast bulk are shattered and dismembered by forces so potent, they are not evident today. We are naive to these mysterious powers. The last mass extinction was not so long ago. Perhaps only three and a half thousand years ago and it's etched in mankind's mythology. Let's chase this mystery. There are numerous sites all over the world that illustrate the spectrum of mass destruction. Larry Agenbroad's charts pinpoint the megafauna sites right across North America. Then spreading right through to Europe, Russia and even into Japan. Here at the La Brea tarpits in Los Angeles. You can see the gases bubbling up through the water and bitumen. Like much of Los Angeles, it is rich in petroleum products. This bituminized area stretches extensively and conceals the bones of not only mammoths, but saber-toothed tigers, short- nosed bears, camels, horses and all extinct. But not only large animals, mice, birds, flora and insects, all preserved within the tar to a depth of 60 feet. The most detailed site is in South Dakota where Dr. Larry Agenbroad invited us over to check his excavation of a limestone bolus on a hilltop. The site is around 100 feet by 120 feet across and some 70 feet deep, and  contains a wide variety of extinct animals in this calcium bolus, packed with  bones. The bodies have lost most of their collagen and are part of a huge calcium deposit that is micro-layered to its bottom. Species include yesterday's camel, short- faced bear, coyote, antelope and altogether some 84 species, most  of which are primitive micro-fauna. Carbon dating of the site places it  at around the 26,000-year mark. I was also intrigued by the minute layering of the calcium in the sinkhole as it progressed through the bottom of the hole. These layers actually went through the bodies, so could not be caused by slow deposition. Layering however, can be caused by electrical discharge. Were these forces involved in the destruction at this site? Larry's explanation of the death of all these species revolved around drowning in this sinkhole as they fed around its edges. This is similar to the explanation of the La Brea tar pits. However, mythology does not support this theory. We already discussed with Adrienne Mayor The Mythology of the First American people. She found it amazing the part that the cosmic thunderbolt played in the destruction of the megafauna. According to legend the creator killed the giants with a cosmic thunderbolt. She emphasizes this was not the ordinary lightning, but a world shattering event. The Lakota nation had sent hunting tribes down here for many, many years. And they had a different interpretation on what had caused the fossil- izations of these great beasts. Here is an excerpt from the Lakota mythology. ”The creator sang the song of destruction and sent down fierce Thunderbirds to wage a great battle against the other humans and the giant animals. They fought for a very long time because the evil humans and animals had become very powerful. And neither could gain an advantage. Finally at the height of the battle, the Thunderbirds sent down their most powerful thunderbolts, all at once.” ”The fiery blast shook the entire world, toppling mountain ranges and setting forests and prairies ablaze. The  flames leapt up to the sky in all directions, sparing only a few people at the highest peaks. It was so hot that the world's lakes boiled up  and dried before their eyes.” ”Even the rocks burned red hot and the giant animals and people burned up where they stood. A great flood followed and when the survivors went out they found bleached bones of the giant animals in mud and rock all over the world.” What were these cosmic thunderbolts? A revolution occurred when plasma physicist Anthony Peratt discovered a relation- ship between rock art petroglyphs and electromagnetic plasma instabilities. These  rock art figures and geometric scribblings mimicked the images produced in government laboratories, whilst the mythology of thunder- bolts such as Zeus's weapons reflected these very same formations. These were mythologically tied to many destructive episodes. Not only lightning, but earthquakes and other natural disasters such as comets, creation myths, and plagues. I strongly suspect that massive discharges from Peratt’s plasma instabilities hold the key, not only to mass extinctions, but  even species changes after such an event. I want to discuss the ramifications of the mass extinction of the megafauna and the mythological evidence with physicist Wal Thornhill. As an advocate of the Electrical Universe, he is adamant the plasma instabilities, whatever their origin, were the fundamental cause of these massive upheavals. I met with him in the grounds of the Australian National University some time ago to discuss the evidence. (Wal) Once you look at it from a forensic point of view of, for instance, even going back pre-history, you look at petroglyphs, the carvings on rocks, the formations that we see and we think are strange looking stick figures, or maybe aliens, are actually all forms of plasma discharge instabilities. And these are the instabilities we see in laboratories in plasma tubes. That's right and these are the sorts of things that the ancients drew and sculpted when they talked about Jupiter's thunderbolt. And these  are actually cut in what and I might add painted by anything from the Australian aboriginals to the South American, North American, all around the world. And this comes down to fine details like the Australian aborigines have the lightning brothers, where you have a figure with their arms out raised like this and their legs spread and they've got the lightning coming from the knees and the elbows. And this is exactly where you'll get the  discharges from, a sharp curve in a plasma discharge. And of course, this is backed up by mythology. I'll be interviewing Adrienne Mayor who's an expert on let's say early American fossils and one of the claims of these let's say early Americans, was the lightning bolts, these things we're talking about now, it actually destroyed the megafauna or mammoths, dinosaurs. And not so long ago, I might add. Well, particularly in the case of the dinosaurs, you need far more than just a simple impact. It requires a global change in the Earth's gravity and this comes back to what is gravity? It really isn't understood. All we've got is an equation which describes it, and it includes a so-called physical constant, the universal gravitational constant which is the most inconstant thing in any textbook. Every time they measure it, it's different and it's got people scratching their heads. But once you understand that gravity itself is a very weak electrical force between all matter, then it all becomes clear. Because if you change the charge with one of these cosmic thunderbolts on the earth or another body, the first  thing that changes is the gravity. Right, and so what some of the effects, so let's say we're getting a discharge, we could get a number of things. I mean for instance we're talking about maybe a localized reversal of the magnetic field, we can get according to let's say yourself and Dave Talbott, we can get electrical geological etching of the landscape, such as carving out river valleys and building of mountains, and flattening of mountains. For instance, some of the old literature talks about in these catastrophic events, the land, the hills skip like lambs. Yes, I like that. Literally. Yes, and unfortunately everyone misinterpreted it as metaphor. Well there's  so much that seeming metaphor which they certainly weren't saying it was metaphorically as they saw it. Well the very fact that all of these oral traditions and religious texts that come down to us over thousands of years, these were considered to be the most important message that the ancients could pass to their descendants. And what do we do? We misinterpret  them. Yeah and so much of this stuff, you can see they were living in fear. I bring up one of the topics. They used to give human sacrifices to try and control the planet. Absolutely. It's very hard actually to even imagine what they were experiencing. And this is the problem of course, and this is why we misinterpret these things. It's because it's beyond our imagination to have a sky that's riddled with colossal lightning bolts, millions or billions of times more powerful than anything we witness today, with puny lightning  sparks. And also, to consider that they were observing planetary objects in the sky up close and personal. I mean, you can understand why people hid in caves from the sight of the Lord. I wanted to talk to Rick Firestone from Berkeley National Laboratories. He is a nuclear physicist of the first rank, but he also has an impeccable belief in the validity of mythology and he matches it with his scientific studies. Rick wrote the table of isotopes which is used by scientific scholars throughout the world. This is the result of many years of being in charge of Berkeley's revolutionary cyclotron. Remarkable is the application of both mythology and nuclear physics in his groundbreaking book, The Cycle of Cosmic Catastrophes, in which he combines both modalities to unearth the causes of mass destruction. Rick's interest in archaeology began when he was sent samples from the ancient Ganey Clovis people's site, which was associated with mammoth  remains. This location showed radioactivity. The clovis people's use of stone manufactured spearheads revealed tracks of what he believed were cosmic rays, which seemed to indicate a cosmic cause of their demise. He replicated these cosmic ray tracks in the very synchrotron laboratory. The site itself looked very strange as if it'd been blasted. But even more curious, chemical discoveries were afoot. In related mammoth sites, it was  found that the tusks had suffered a shower of metallic spherules containing iron and titanium. In addition was the discovery of minute carbon spherules, a millimeter across and quite large compared to the metallic ones. The carbon spherules were reticular and when cut open revealed millions of nanodiamonds. This was important as they are often seen at an impact site. Was this product the result of high energy discharges? Similar sites were discovered and they lay below a layer called the “Black Mat,” a sort of clay- vegetation ensemble. Above or within this mat no Clovis evidence was discovered, and more remarkable, no megafauna remains. This Black Mat was a termination point to recording a mass extinction. To Rick Firestone this was as if the megafauna had been destroyed overnight. An actual example, witnessed by mankind, illustrates precisely the type of destruction and rebirth Earth has undergone in quite recent times. Israel's city of the plains (Strabo claims 13 cities) were hit by just such a cosmic thunderbolt. Sodom and Gomorrah were entirely destroyed, and the Dead Sea depression some 720 meters below the Mediterranean was created, together with mountain building and hill flattening. The resultant geographical carnage probably extended right along the entire African Rift valley. Immense electrical discharges rent the air with vast deposits of sulfur (that's brimstone) falling from the skies. Vast transmutation of elements occurred, with vast cliffs of salt (sodium chloride), nitrates and  other compounds being created. Mythology attributes this to the activity of Jupiter, also known as the Zedek, Zeus, and Amon. Other upheavals in more distant times are attributed to other planets and comets. In future episodes we will delve into these claims and attempt to place a date on these world-changing events. [Music] 
[Music] In 1993 Egan Bach wrote a treatise on the ejection of strange donut-shaped fireballs from volcanoes. Historically they're known as gorgons, but science was unable to explain their curious formation. As he delved deeper into their unique structure and properties, it  became apparent their behavior mimicked most of the sightings of UFO’s. Sixty years ago, Winston Harper Bostick found that an amorphous mass of high velocity plasma, has a natural ability to convert a large proportion of its kinetic energy into magnetic energy contained in an organized toroidal structure. He termed this structure a “plasmoid.” It has become apparent that these curious volcanic doughnut ejection structures are electromagnetic plasmoids. Bach's book examines in minute detail their bizarre behavior. Going back to 1956, a milestone in plasma physics was reached, when Bostick reported experimental results which showed that plasma, when created and accelerated to high velocities by a batten type pulse source, is shaped by its own magnetic field into  a compact toroidal structure. Terming this structure a plasmoid, Bostick was careful to distinguish his own definition of a plasmoid as a generic term for all plasma magnetic entities. Highly structured, from its  definition as an amorphous blob, he subsequently clarified his definition as a self-generating shaped body, and a force-free, minimum free energy structure, taking the form of a plasma vortex. According to Bostick, “A rather surprising result occurs when the source is placed in a vacuum in an externally applied DC magnetic field and fired across the field.” The plasma apparently has no difficulty in crossing the magnetic field, “...it forms an ever-elongating hollow cylinder as it proceeds across the magnetic field... Subsequent investigations were to prove that the plasma crosses the magnetic field in a train of paired oppositely rotating diamagnetic vortices.” Kubes et al. recently demonstrated a similar conversion effect in a laboratory Z-pinch. The points of maximum pinch serve to accelerate plasma actually away from the zone of maximum compression. The high-velocity plasma then forms ”...toroidal, helical and plasmoidal structures within the dense plasma column in the lower pressure regions along the axis.” A Z-pinch is apparently an efficient way of generating the initial high velocities, which result in the formation of self-contained plasmoids by the mechanism which Bostick identified. The volcanic plasmoidal ejection occurs at a specific point in any new eruption, with the plasmoid size varying vastly. Is this the classic dark-glow-arc stages of excitation of plasma, signaling the timing of ejection? For instance, reports  mentioned some only 20 centimeters diameter, while others cite these plasmoids at over 100 meters long. The plasmoid color also varies greatly, with witnesses up to 100 kilometers from the volcano, such as mount Redoubt  in Alaska, noting dramatic color shifts. From brilliant, whitish violet, to bluish, greenish, gold, orange, and finally to red and infrared. They fly at a rapid speed, reportedly at above the speed of a jet plane. But they seem also to descend and rise, often in formation or swarms, and can fly thousands of kilometers from their origin. They can both attract and repel each other. So how do these plasmoids UFO’s manifest at eruption time? The following is quoted on the Redoubt eruption in Alaska on February the 15th, 1990 by captain Richard Swain some 35 kilometers away. “The top of Redoubt lit up with an incredibly bright flash. The Cook Inlet and the mountains behind it lit up in daytime brightness. A fireball  grew above Redoubt with huge tongue-like projections - quite unlike the concentric fireball of nuclear explosions. Right on the heel of that fireball an innumerable multitude of fireballs began to jet in all directions. They streaked really fast in the two opposite directions of Homer and  Anchorage. Their speed was such that the eyes had a hard time following the flight. They appeared like tracer bullets, not perfectly round as they disappeared along the inlet, at perhaps three times the speed of a jet plane. Those balls went on for about eight minutes, at first many hundreds, then becoming smaller and fewer as time progressed. At the beginning they were huge and many, but after about ten minutes an abundance of common lightning strikes began in the eruption cloud.” Important in the Swain video is Bach's comment. ”The sequence shows two huge discs hovering close to the horizon. They gradually divide into four and then eight and finally sixteen discs, all in intimate linkage! These objects seem all aglow from the inside. They clearly fly northeast along the magnetic meridian and back to the volcano.” But by what mechanism are these plasmoid UFO’s created? If we look at the volcano from an Electric Universe interpretation, this may help. The massive  production of molten magma, steam, and possibly transmutation of elements, and formation of new compounds, suggests the possibility that we're dealing with a high-energy Z-pinch situation. Now a pinch is the compression of an electrically conducting filament by magnetic forces. The conductor  is usually a plasma, but could also be a solid, or liquid metal. Pinches were the first type of device used for experiments in controlled nuclear fusion power. This pinch effect is the self-constriction of a cylinder of an electrically conducting plasma. When an electric current is passed through a plasma, a magnetic field is set up that tends to force the current-carrying particles together. This force can compress the plasma so that it is heated, as well as confined. But such a self-pinched plasma cylinder is unstable and will quickly develop kinks or break up into a series of lumps, resembling a string of sausages, or in  this case plasmoids, ready for ejection from a volcano or earthquake. Ejected plasmoids often form cylinders which shear apart, like stacks  of coins into flat ellipsoids. By what criteria are we convinced that most UFO sightings are in fact these very plasmoids? Well, firstly they seem to possess an intelligence, and they  being heavier than air, they rise and fall to the ground as though being flown. They seem to fly in the direction of either of the magnetic poles. They can readily change shape, and pulse and blink with rhythms shorter than one second, with light often several colors. This is a ubiquitous property of these plasmoids and this observation is often recorded during UFO sightings. Similarly, the  plasma property of developing colored portholes in their equatorial plane, is classic flying saucer mythology. The normal plasmoid body is a sphere, which  often bulges into an ellipsoid with a short or long rotation axis, reflected as a saucer or cigar. They draw closer via an electromagnetic, but actual visible chain  link. These bodies often develop a mist which is drawn out during flight to a tail. Here the visual relationship between comets and images of Matsumoto's mini-plasmoids emitted out of electrodes, but also showing a cometary tail and jets, is interesting. This seems to link the concept of scalability of electromagnetic characteristics. Widespread witnesses from over the globe relate how volcanic plasmoids often then detonate after producing this tail. These plasmoid UFO’s are attracted to the Sun, but also other heat sources, such as reported at power stations and jetliner exhausts. Plasmoids for instance have arrived at different times to heated ducts at power stations. This would explain reports of pilots being tracked by a UFO. Bach interpreted much of the behavior of these UFO’s before the advent of the Electric Universe hypothesis and before the deeper understanding of plasma physics from researchers such as Anthony Peratt. To me this sharpened knowledge of plasma behavior seems to crystallize much of the behaviors of these plasmoid UFO’s. Regardless Bach's work clearly shows how these entities mimic the reported behavior of our classic UFO's. Whilst the Electric Universe enlightenment explains much of their seemingly intelligent, yet erratic behavior,  NASA has been slow to embrace plasma physics and its paramount status in the universe. It seems that they tend to explain UFO’s as extraterrestrial, when a simpler explanation exists. Nevertheless, strong evidence suggests that most UFO sightings can be clearly explained as errant plasmoids, or gorgons  as the ancients named them. Will NASA actually provide evidence that contradicts Bach? [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info A new scientific paper attempts to explain a mystery at our planet's South Pole. A team of investigators from the British Antarctic Survey discovered a localized area where the Antarctic Ice Sheet is melting surprisingly quickly. Using radar, they found that some of the ice in a 3 km thick layer appears to be missing. They have proposed that the heat source causing the melting is "unusually radioactive rocks" combined with unusually hot water from deep underground. Lead author Dr. Tom Jordan says of the investigation, "Our results were quite unexpected, as many people thought this region of Antarctica was made of ancient and cold rocks, which had little impact on the ice sheet above. We show that even in the ancient continental interior, the underlying geology can have a significant impact on the ice. But a clue to the actual cause of the anomalous ice melting might be found at the "surprisingly hot poles of other planets in our solar system." As we've pointed out in countless episodes, physicist Wal Thornhill made the seemingly outrageous yet successful prediction that the freezing cold North Pole of Saturn, which had been deprived of sunlight for more than a decade, would have a "hot spot" similar to the one at the planet's South Pole. In 2007, a surprising warm spot was also found at the South Pole of Neptune. The Electric Universe theory has always stated that the Sun is primarily an electrical phenomenon and electric currents flowing from the Sun to planets has implications for many atmospheric phenomena including the tremendous winds of gas giant planets and also jet streams and weather patterns on Earth. In recent years, professor Dr. Donald Scott has developed a model of the structure of a type of electric current called a 'Birkeland current' which can be identified visually by its unique counter rotation. Critically, this counter rotation has been seen at the poles of Saturn, Jupiter, Neptune, and in our own planet's Auroras. Of course, the question is speculative but we asked Dr. Scott if an incoming Birkeland current could be the cause of the anomalous ice melting at the South Pole. It's always interesting how relatively often new "surprising discoveries" are being made that might be explained better by the Electric Universe ideas. Much better than by accepted models of whatever it is being observed and I'm just sort of amused by the way that classic standard scientists will lurch and grab on to whatever is nearby except they never think about looking up and say gosh, could it be electrical? And so, using radar to look down through 3 km of ice, the British team found that some of the ice covered an area that's twice the size of the City of London. Now, this is a pretty big area, pretty big volume. And that ice appeared to be missing, there's a big hole in there. One explanation for the missing ice, their explanation, was that there may be a radioactive rock deposit there that is supplying heat from below. Now I guess it's certainly possible that there's a radioactive rock deposit below where the ice has melted but the Antarctic ice pack has been growing in recent years while the Arctic ice pack has been shrinking. So if there's any difference at all between the Arctic and the Antarctic then it seems as though the Antarctic is getting colder and that makes the melting of this ice even more anomalous, I guess. So and the question is, why is there a region deep down under the southern growing ice pack that's melting? Well, after, if you think about it a minute, we know that the polar regions, both north and south of the Earth, are regions where Birkeland currents are coming in from the Sun and they impinge down through the Earth's magnetosphere. Several years ago, NASA said that the amount of current was unexpectedly high, somewhere around 650,000 amperes. Now, 650,000 amperes is a lot of, to put it in the vernacular, a lot of juice. It's a lot of electric energy there. Amperes is not energy but it can produce a great amount of heat. OK, that's fine but why should that produce more melting at one pole than at the other? The answer may lie in the fact that the northern Arctic polar region is a layer of ice floating on top of a saltwater ocean. And salt water is an excellent electrical conductor, that's my main point. Ice is a good conductor and maybe it's not quite as good as salt water but it's a pretty good conductor. Well, the difference in the South, in the Antarctic, is that the ice pack is sitting right down a smack on top of a continent of Earth, Earth's material. There is a continent down there, there's no Southern Ocean. Instead of where the Arctic Ocean is, there's an Antarctic continent. And the material that the Earth is made of is generally not nearly as good an electrical conductor as salt water or ice. So if you think about what's going on, if you consider the path that maybe a Birkeland current might take as it comes in from the Sun, comes down through the magnetosphere down vertically into the Earth. And by the way, we've got some very nice video of the counter-rotating currents in the Aurora Borealis that is certainly supporting evidence that indeed that's what's happening so that Birkeland was quite right. Anyway, if that current comes down through the snow and ice and then into Earth and rock. Now in the North it flows through ice and saltwater. Now each of these cases we can think of the electrical properties of those two layers through which the current flows. Well, the current flows through one resistor of, if you think of those as layers as being resistances, and the current and each of those resistors is the same, the same amount of currents, the same amount of amperes. The two resistors both have fairly low resistance values when at the South Pole one of the resistors, the ice pack, has relatively low resistance. But the earth and the rock is a very much higher resistance. So just to get technical for a second, when electrical current flows through two resistors connected in series, energy is liberated in each resistor. The expression is familiar to many people who had physics course. Power equals I²R. The I²R is the amount of electrical power that's released in the resistor R. So the current is the same in both resistors but the resistance of each of these resistances is different. So the amount of heat, and this is the punchline, the amount of heat produced in each of the two resistors depends linearly on their resistance values. So if the current, same current flows through, one of the two resistors is the low resistance and one is a high resistance. The low resistor will not get very warm but the high resistance one will. And so, Birkeland currents have been passing down into the Earth for millennia. So is that the cause of the hotspot? Maybe, but the thing that makes me think that maybe it might indeed be correct, is that there is the difference between what happens at the two poles may well be explained by the difference between the electrical properties of the paths, the two paths that the polar Birkeland currents have to take. At least it seems like a more reasonable answer to me than just postulating and groping around and say, oh my god, what causes it must be a radioactive rock down there. 
The Sun is the source of all power on Earth. The SAFIRE Sun generates energy, comparable to the Sun's photosphere. Imagine being able to tap directly into the Sun for power. [Music] The SAFIRE technology was designed and built to replicate the atmosphere of the Sun in a laboratory on Earth, and to test the Electric Sun model. [Music] These are the factors we control. These are some of the things the SAFIRE lab is now capable of. [Music] [Music] These are some of our recent discoveries. [Music] In our tests and experiments, we have found no disparities with the Electric Sun model. In fact, all the evidence to date, indicates that electricity is the primal force in the universe. [Music] SAFIRE is a nuclear plasma reactor, designed to reproduce the atmosphere of the Sun in a laboratory. A wide array of instruments provides real-time data of the chamber conditions, allowing a level of control not available in most reactors. Optical spectroscopes, mass spec and Neutron detectors, bolometers, thermocouples, infrared and UV cameras, 4k digital cameras and patented gimbal-controlled Langmuir probes, which can monitor electrical conditions, while also recording optical and mass spec data. [Music] Telemetry can move the Langmuir probes throughout the chamber, accurate within 0.02 millimeters. [conversation] All data is sent to the SafCom Control where it is captured and catalogued for later analysis. [Music] The SAFIRE team has discovered the key to obtaining and sustaining high energy plasmas. SAFIRE can create, control contain, and repeat any number of plasma regimes. The hot plasma self-organizes and develops its own electromagnetic containment field. [Music] How does it work? [Music] We introduce hydrogen into the chamber. The anode is a metal alloy. The power going in is electrical. The reaction produces high energy levels, which translate to thermal heat. The heat creates steam to run a turbine, to generate electricity. The hydrogen can be reused. The output is electricity, the majority going to an external grid and the rest routed back to the power input. To date, after the reactions, all measurements and analyses show this to be a clean process, producing no negative radioactive side-effects. In fact, note that nuclear radioactive materials are not required. [Music] SAFIRE is mixing elements at the atomic level. What you are looking at is a patented design that uses atomic hydrogen in a self-organized plasma. [Music] The atomic hydrogen interacts with the other elements in the chamber, causing nuclear reactions that are transmuting elements, from one to another. And these are the elements that SAFIRE produced as a consequence of the nuclear reactions. What you are looking at here, is an experiment, run over several hours. We were adjusting the chemistry to get different results; the aim being to explore higher energy levels. On this day, the rise in temperature over time was what we were intending, and yet it still exceeded our expectations. Three separate analyses had been done by experts in computational fluid dynamics. All three predicted that with 100% input power, we would reach the thermal limit of the chamber, and for three years these predictions had been accurate. But with our new adjustments and using only 7% input power we very quickly reached the thermal limit. It was the elemental transmutations that were responsible for the rise in temperature over time, that was almost 14 times what was predicted. The Tokamak and ITER reactors draw many millions of watts of power, in an attempt to contain collisional plasmas to obtain fusion. At a cost of billions of dollars, huge international projects have been trying to contain plasmas, utilizing vast arrays of superconducting magnets. So far, this has been unsuccessful. Fission reactors split the atom and although they have an efficiency of around 35%, they also produce radioactive waste. This radioactive waste is being buried in the ground, or stored in facilities at enormous expense. None of it is benign; some of it is still deadly, even after a half-life of over a million years. So, how is SAFIRE different? Self-organizing systems are a natural process occurring throughout nature. SAFIRE forms its own electromagnetic containment field into a self-organizing, high-energy plasma and unlike fission reactors, SAFIRE is stable, controllable and has no environmentally dangerous or detrimental side effects. It uses hydrogen as the primary catalyst, the most abundant element in the universe. [Music] Studies done at MIT have shown that when radioactive waste is exposed to hydrogen isotope nuclei, the decay rate of the radioactive material can be accelerated, even to the point of neutralizing the radioactivity. SAFIRE creates an environment where hydrogen nuclei interact with other elements, creating double layer shells. Within these shells, electrons, ions and molecules are trapped by powerful electromagnetic fields. This is where radioactive material would be exposed to the hydrogen nuclei to remediate the radioactivity of that material. [Music] SAFIRE can also use radioactive materials as fuel. Elemental transmutation will remediate the radioactive waste back into base elements and render it benign. [Music] Right now there are 450 successful nuclear fission plants on the planet. Imagine if they could produce energy without creating radioactive waste. SAFIRE is an international team which has been collaborating with individuals from Orion Energy, Lockheed Martin, U.S. DoD, Los Alamos, Lawrence Livermore Labs, Space Propulsion Consultants, the University of Toronto and many more. [Music] SAFIRE technology is capable of releasing high levels of energy. To convert this energy into usable electrical power, is a relatively straightforward engineering project. Designs have already been initiated for a power generation prototype. Orion Energy will commercialize the SAFIRE technology into three key markets: 1) clean energy production, 2) heating and 3)remediation of nuclear waste. Each of these markets represents a trillion dollar industry over the next 10 years. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe brought to you by the Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts. info [Music] Today, physicist Wal Thornhill is joining us to help us play catch up on a number of highly significant space science stories from the last few months. We now have a wellspring of a half-dozen or so extremely significant headlines relating to stars. These are discoveries that confound or are irreconcilable with the standard ideas about the very nature of stars, including how stars form, where their energy comes from and why they sometimes explode as supernovae. Now of course the purpose of this series is not merely to share space science headlines, but rather we like to use some of the most significant discoveries today as an opportunity to illuminate what the Electric Universe Theory (EUT) is; what it actually proposes and how it explains space discovery. As you know, if you followed the EU over the last couple of decades, in many instances some of the most surprising space science ”discoveries,” (I use that word in quotes) were actually explicitly predicted by the Electric Universe. In fact, the first item we're going to discuss provides a beautiful contrast between the predictions of Standard Theory versus those of the Electric Universe. On February 20th of this year, the European Space Agency issued a press release entitled ‘XMM-Newton reveals giant flare from a tiny star.’ It states “A star of about eight percent the Sun's mass has been caught emitting an enormous ‘super flare’ of X-rays - a dramatic high-energy eruption that poses a fundamental problem for astronomers, who did not think it possible on stars that small. The culprit is a kind of star called an L Dwarf. This is a star with so little mass that it is only just above the boundary of actually being a star. If it had any less mass, it would not possess the internal conditions necessary to generate its own energy.” Well, that last sentence reveals an assumption that any star ”generates” its own energy, which astronomers probably don't even realize is an assumption. However, the Electric Universe has always stated that stars are formed along, and are ultimately powered by, external Birkeland currents. The ESA press release goes on to state ”In a matter of minutes, the tiny star released more than ten times more energy of even the most intense flares suffered by the Sun.” Concluding on the real nature of the conundrum, the press release states that this type of star “...has a low surface temperature for a star... Astronomers did not think such a low temperature would be capable of generating enough charged particles to feed so much energy into the magnetic field. So the conundrum is: how a super flare is even possible on such a star.” and the lead author of a paper on this finding says “That's a good question. We just don't know - nobody knows.” So Wal, we've talked about this discovery over the last couple of days and I think you'll agree it's not actually accurate to say that “nobody knows how this type of star would produce such an energetic flare.” That's right. For many years, astronomers have been astonished by seemingly powerful outbursts from stars they have considered to be dying or dead and just cooling off and that is, the infrared Red Dwarfs, the L Dwarfs and M Dwarfs and those kinds of stars. And the fundamental problem for astronomers is that they base their theoretical expectations on the thermonuclear model, and the thermonuclear model has the energy developed by the thermonuclear reactions in a core gradually percolating to the surface over hundreds of thousands of years. And the reason for that slow percolation of course is because they have to find some means of reducing the radiation from the thermonuclear bomb at the center of the star, to something which is merely shining in the visible spectrum and producing heat and light. Now Red Dwarfs hardly produce any heat and light; they're more like an old-fashioned bar-radiator, electric radiator. Of course it's rather ironic that that's precisely the best model for the star, that it is an electric star under low power. Anyway, the problem that this last recorded one presented, is that its outburst was ten times stronger than the most powerful outburst from our own Sun, which is a main-sequence star and is supposed to be functioning at the peak of its performance. Once again, we have this fundamental belief in the idea that a star is like a campfire in the sky, you know. It has to fuel itself, it burns itself up in these thermonuclear reactions in a hypothetical core. We don't know anything about what is inside a star, because to begin with, there is no physical theory of gravity. And so, the very idea of the accretion of stars gravitationally, to form something that can even produce thermonuclear reactions in the first place, is merely a complicated story that was invented at a time when nuclear power was first discovered. And Eddington put forward a story which is based on a gravitating ball of hydrogen gas and then assumed that, somehow or another, that could initiate thermonuclear reactions in the core of the star. We are dealing with a plasma, not a neutral gas. The Electric Universe looks at brown dwarf stars not as failed stars at all. There is no such thing as a failed star. In the case of the M Dwarfs, I wrote many years ago now, that they are not actually dwarfs in size because all red stars are gigantic. For instance, Jupiter could quite easily be a brown dwarf star, if it was taken out of the solar system and existed independently. Its entire magnetosphere, which is huge, in fact at opposition it would look the same size as the moon in the sky, if we could actually see it. You can imagine that lit up and it glows red in the case of these dwarf stars, the energy is therefore being provided to the star from the galaxy itself. Now all red dwarf stars, and all red stars for that matter, are unable to control the light output based on a variable power input. It's only the bright stars that can do that. So, if the power suddenly changes for any reason at all, the red star will change with it, and this is being observed with the red giant Betelgeuse right now, which is puzzling astronomers at the other end of the size scale in stars. That huge star is so big that we are actually able to see the surface, not in great detail but in recent years, the star has been changing in size, and even the redness or the light output from the star varies over its surface, which is what we should expect if it's being powered externally, but not if it's being powered internally. The idea that the energy has to be stored by the star and generated by the star, once again, this view of stars as isolated objects; whereas the Electric Universe model points out the stars are lit. And all their characteristics are formed by the electric current they're receiving from their environment; and if there's any change in that environment, then the star will be variable in some fashion. Our own Sun for instance, shines steadily both in the visible spectrum and in the radiant heat part of the spectrum, while its power input is changing, as can be seen in the X-rays. In X-rays our Sun is a variable star; it almost winks out at some point in that solar cycle and is quite bright in the maximum part of that cycle. A red star doesn't have that luxury; it doesn't have a bright photosphere which acts like a transistor action on the current. And so the red star, the only thing it can do is to suddenly eject material, charged material, in order to try and establish equilibrium again with its environment. In the case of a red star, since the power is low, that comes out in the form of sudden outbursts. And those outbursts can be as powerful as a bright star, simply by the change in the input power. It's like a supernova where the circuit is suddenly broken and in that case it's like opening a circuit breaker in an intercontinental transmission line. Energy stored in the magnetic field of that long transmission line is suddenly released at the point where you've opened the switch, in this case a star. Red dwarfs flare, supernovae explode. They're both driven by the same process. Very good. In fact you just very nicely laid the foundations for the next story we'll talk about, which I can tell you has garnered a tremendous amount of behind-the-scenes discussion in the Electric Universe community. Late last year a team of scientists published a paper on the “mysterious disappearance” of a hundred stars, which they uncovered through a comparison of old data and new observations. A hundred stars apparently have literally vanished from the sky. The lead author of a paper on this finding stated, “Unless a star directly collapses into a black hole, there is no known physical process by which it could physically vanish. The implications of finding such objects extend from traditional astrophysics fields to the more exotic searches for evidence of technologically advanced civilizations.” This item has generated some sensational headlines, which speculate that alien technologies could be blocking the stars from view. Now I'm certainly not someone who is on principle allergic to theoretical discussions of the existence of alien civilizations. But for a number of years my cynical observation has been that astronomers, and certainly popular science media, are more willing to entertain speculations about aliens than they are to give any meaningful attention to the principles of plasma cosmology and the Electric Universe. Now Wal, it happens that in 2007 you wrote your own peer-reviewed scientific paper on the electrical nature of stars and of supernovas, which was published in the very prestigious IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science. Why don't you explain, in your opinion, why alien technologies are not necessary to explain the “disappearance” of these stars. That's right. In the case of electric stars, they can be expected to suddenly disappear if their power is switched off; just like any electric light. As for the speculation about aliens doing it with something called a Dyson Sphere, which is supposed to encompass the star at some distance and pick up all of the energy that it's radiating, shows that scientists making such a claim have no idea how stars work. Stars pick up their power input, part of it at least, from their environment. So, if you were to build a Dyson Sphere, even if that were possible, you would not have a star any longer. Astronomers categorize stars by their brightness and color on what's known as the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram; but it's not an evolutionary plot over billions of years of a star's progression from youth to old age; it's simply a scatter diagram. But stars, in the standard theory, are supposed to spend billions of years in more or less the same location on that chart. Yet some have been seen to change their position on their diagram in a few days or weeks. The fact that the overwhelming majority of stars shine so steadily, is unexplained by the thermonuclear model of stars. That hypothetical model is highly unstable, so the night sky should look like the 4th of July. After more than 60 years and countless millions of dollars, scientists have not been able to produce fusion power like the Sun, because their fusion model and consequently their experiments, are highly unstable. The fact that stars shine so steadily was one of the key features that convinced the engineer Monty Childs that the electrical model of stars was one that made sense of the steadily shining stars and could be tested by engineers, and it's based on the transistor current control effect in the photospheric plasma, that maintains steady radiant energy more than X-rays. The Sun is a variable star. Monty's successful implementation of the SAFIRE experiment proved the model: the experiment is very stable. Astrophysicists don't recognize clear electrical engineering evidence that the Sun exhibits the features of an anode in a low pressure gas discharge. If we find it the smartest way to produce a tiny intense source of light in a searchlight, which is an electric arc equivalent, why would nature do it in any less efficient way? Remembering that stars are infinitesimal specks of dust in the vastness of space. While returning to the subject of stars that go supernova, you have always argued against the belief that type 1a supernovae can be used as ”standard candles” which have supposedly affirmed the acceleration of the expansion of the universe. And so along those lines, a recent report on phys.org is extremely telling. It states ”The most direct and strongest evidence for the accelerating universe with dark energy is provided by the distance measurements using type 1a supernovae (SN 1a) for the galaxies at high redshift. This result is based on the assumption that the corrected luminosity of SN 1a through the empirical standardization would not evolve with redshift. New observations and analysis made by a team of astronomers show however that this key assumption is most likely in error.” Now the report goes on to say “Other cosmological probes, such as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) ,are also known to provide some indirect and circumstantial evidence for dark energy, but it was recently suggested that cosmic microwave background from the Planck mission, no longer supports the concordance cosmological model which may require new physics.” So Wal, very simply, in your opinion, why are astronomers incorrect in their continued belief in the expanding Big Bang universe? The very assumption they make, of course, is incorrect; that the standard or the corrected luminosity of SN 1a, through the empirical standardization, would not evolve with redshift. Because the research of Halton Arp showed that the redshift does evolve, but not with distance but with age. As for proposing new physics, this is the standard response every time fundamental ideas are being challenged by observations. But the Electric Universe has shown that we were closer to the truth in cosmology more than a hundred years ago. What we need is not new physics but a revisit of old physics. [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info Science headlines today show signs that elements of the Electric Universe paradigm are becoming increasingly mainstream. With leaps in technology and data have come the definitive refutation of the notion of an electrically sterile universe. But the basic premise of a cosmos dominated by the gravitational force remains the backbone of standard cosmology. In this episode, Bishop Nicholas Sykes forecasts the perhaps inevitable paradigm shift towards Electric Universe concepts. This series of videos has claimed that the existing paradigm of physical science, accepted and taught in the halls of academia as barely challengable, has actually become unfit for purpose. If, as we have claimed, the Sun and other stars are actually powered electrically from outside their own cores rather than being powered by nuclear fusion within their cores, this would be a significant instance of the failure of the existing paradigm. Electric Universe proponents will not think it strange when the time comes for the whole line of dominoes, representing the presently accepted structure of supposedly hard physics together with those other sciences dependent upon it, to come crashing down. To be sure, such a state of affairs is not altogether new in the world. In the epilogue to his last book, "The Discarded Image," professor CS Lewis writes about the medieval model of science and its succession by the currently accepted model, in this way: "The old astronomy was not, in any exact sense, 'refuted' by the telescope. The scarred surface of the Moon and the satellites of Jupiter can, if one wants, be fitted into a geocentric scheme. The old scheme... had been tinkered a good deal to keep up with observations. How far, by endless tinkerings, it could have kept up with them until even now, I do not know. But the human mind will not endure such ever-increasing complications if once it has seen that some simpler conception can 'save the appearances'. Neither theological prejudice nor vested interests can permanently keep in favor a Model which is seen to be grossly uneconomical. The new astronomy triumphed not because the case for the old became desperate, but because the new was a better tool; once this was grasped, our ingrained conviction that Nature herself is thrifty did the rest. When our Model is in its turn abandoned, this conviction will no doubt be at work again." Electric Universe researchers contend that the EU [Electric Universe] paradigm is far more economical than the currently accepted model, which has been endlessly tinkered with to keep up with observations, but would also, in my view, judge that the entire case for the Standard Model has reached the point of desperation. Let us now return to the issue of relativity. Some justifiable excitement appeared in the media over some experimental results that gave the possibility of showing that neutrinos could travel faster than light. Yet the whole of the theory of relativity is dependent upon light or rather electromagnetic radiation, in which light is a part, being the fastest possible messenger. Moreover, the theory of relativity has by now become a core principle that informs the working of the Standard Model. If relativity falls, then much of what we thought we learned in the last century about the physics of the universe we know no longer. Inevitably the question arises: "Is relativity like some banks in some countries too big to fail? With what shall it be bailed out so that academics and their supporters can again live with some semblance of normality? Of course, this is not a scientific question at all but it is a question with which Electric Universe researchers have become all too familiar, for not a few years. Nevertheless, there is an increasing number of independence of scientists, who have proved to the satisfaction of many that the theory of relativity is groundless, in spite of the awe in which it is generally held. I would now like to supply my two cents worth to that voice. The celebrated lecturer Richard Feynman noted: if the Sun is exploding right now, it takes 8 minutes before we know about it, and it cannot possibly affect us before then. His reason for that assertion is the doctrine, that the fastest message that travels between the Sun and the Earth does so at 3 x 10 ^ 8 (300 million) meters per second, the speed of light through space. At that lightspeed, the Sun, viewed from the Earth, appears to be where it actually was some 8 minutes ago and not where it actually is when it is being viewed. However, if the Sun by its gravitational pull is causing the Earth to maintain an orbit around it, the pull of the Sun on the Earth has to be from almost exactly where it is and not from where it was 8 minutes beforehand. If the pull of the Sun upon the Earth came from an 8 minutes-back position behind the Sun, the Earth would be slung out of orbit in short order. Moreover for each planet, the gravitational pull upon it of the Sun would come from a different point ― a different virtual Sun, so to speak ― and no coherent solar system of planets could be maintained. It follows that there must be a much faster messenger than light, namely gravity, that travels between the Sun and its planets at a speed that makes the transmission of light seem like a doddle. We don't need any experiment with neutrinos, therefore, to tell us that something can travel faster than light. We just have to take into account all the observations from which we infer that the Earth and the other planets have been moving around the Sun in stable orbits for an extended period of time. This requires the "gravitational message" to be sent from the Sun and received by the Earth as well as other planets almost instantaneously. Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity should, therefore, have been repealed long ago. Now, Wal Thornhill has applied this near instantaneous transmission of force to the level of the fundamental particles of matter, such as the electron, providing the possibility of an electrical explanation of gravitation at the sub-atomic level. We will consider this exciting scenario in future presentations. For continuous updates on Space News from the Electric Universe stay tuned to Thunderbolts.info. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info Throughout our solar system, on rocky planets, moons, asteroids, and comets we see evidence for events never discussed in standard geological textbooks. We see carpets of highly circular, cleanly cut craters and crater chains, in defiance of the notion of periodic bombardments shaping these rocky topographies. We have suggested that these features have been carved by high-energy electrical discharges, a hypothesis supported by decades of laboratory experiments. On our own planet, we also see abundant evidence for the geological influences of a kind of cosmic lightning. In these episodes, we are considering that the complex processes in electrical discharges may help to explain the extraordinary geology of the American Southwest. In the previous Space News, Thunderbolts contributor Andrew Hall proposed that a process known as sputtering discharge produced the amazing features in Utah's Canyonlands called the Arches. Today, Hall presents his case that the same electrical processes produced countless of the spectacular, sharply cut features seen throughout the Colorado Plateau. In Part 1 of Sputtering Canyons, we discussed Arches National Monument and evidence it was formed by a complex sputtering discharge process. That process involved a thermal spiking, barrier discharge in a layer of wet sandstone. In Part 2, we'll take a broader look at some regions on the Colorado Plateau where similar sputtering discharge took place. One of these is Monument Valley. Monument Valley was formed by sputtering discharge that almost completely etched a layer of the original dome away. What is left are the lonely pinnacles and buttes iconic to Western movies. The reason these pinnacles and buttes are left standing, while the same layers of sandstone etched away around them, is due to preferential sputtering. Preferential sputtering is normally associated with sputtering an alloyed metal where one element in the alloy sputters more efficiently, eroding away faster than the other alloy metal. In Monument Valley, the buttes and pinnacles left standing were portions of the dome that resisted sputtering because of a difference in charge density. They were like the inefficient alloy in the metal. The part of the dome that lifted away, did so when the wet layer -- the icing in the layer cake -- became a charged, hot ionized mud. A sheet of high charge density developed at the base of the mud with an attraction to the clouds above -- and like an electromagnet picks up a junk car -- the storm's electric field lifted away the overburden to dissolve in electric winds. The buttes and pinnacles are remnants that didn't have the same charge in their wet layer, so they didn't get pulled away by the electric field. The reason is: they were struck by lightning. In the dark mode, drifting plasma current that causes sputtering, there's always the potential to spark. Manufacturers are careful to avoid this because it will flaw the finished surface, it leaves imperfections. The pinnacles and buttes are these types of imperfections. They were parts of the dome where an arc or many arcs struck and dissipated built-up charge. It altered the ground charge beneath the strike zone so the electric field couldn't pull the material away. Therefore, the buttes and pinnacles were preferentially -- not sputtered. In the parlance of the semiconductor industry, the charge layer was doped by the presence of water and minerals, which gave it an excess of electrons. When lightning struck, it depleted the charge and left an excess of "holes," or the absence of electrons which canceled the attractive force of the sputtering discharge. The evidence for this is manifold. To begin, consider the cap rock formations and spires found on buttes. Butte tops aren't flat. They generally have something like a step pyramid, dome or pinnacle on top, which is where lightning discharge struck most intensely. Notice in the images below the pyramidal caps. The rock below the caps is darkened significantly more than the adjacent stone. Not only is there black patina, but there is also more redness to the rock itself in streaks below the caps, with deep vertical fracturing. The charge depletion from lightning, and the subsequent recombination of the most severely depleted zones beneath where it struck, heated, shocked and hardened the rock more in these areas than in others. The step pyramid structure or terracing on canyon walls and buttes is another evidence of sputtering. Each sedimentary layer has different compositions of minerals and moisture, differentiating the dielectric property of each layer. The zone of charge depletion under lightning strikes spreads out in a conical diffusion pattern, but the cone is stepped or terraced because there is a step voltage across each dielectric layer. Where there are towering cliffs with sheer vertical walls, it's because a monolithic layer with a consistent dielectric caused a single large voltage step. Where there is very hard rock, the edges we'll find are torn in chunky blocks. The flat, smooth breaks are not the result of millions of years of erosion of any type -- wind, rain, ice, exfoliation, or flowing water. Any of those actions would have the opposite effect, roughening the surfaces and rounding the edges. These rocks have such smooth, flat faces, and sharp, angular, undercut edges because they were broken by mechanical shearing as the neighboring rock was ripped away. Evidence of shearing is especially evident on monolithic walls. Sharp-edged breaks are everywhere, leaving smooth, flat faces, hardly roughened, or rounded by any act of erosion. Arching fissures are evidence of spalling, where the material tore away in flakes, cupped upward in the direction of shear. The arches often show concentric creases where flakes broke away in smaller sections deeper into the rock. One can see the same type of concentric flaking in broken glass. In some places, the canyon walls have that look of broken glass but in others it looks more like the broken end of a brick of hard cheese. Perhaps a well-aged Parmesan -- stiff, dry and flaky, but with a low shear strength. There is almost always a thin layer of hardened rock at the interface between each terrace. This is where charge accumulated at the boundary layer of the strata and the current hardened the charged sheet of rock more so than the surroundings. Each dielectric layer spreads charge to the interface of its layer, driven by the electric field, to balance the voltage drop across that layer. So a charged sheet develops at the interface of each layer, and a step voltage to the next layer, which creates a surface tension at the interface, which makes the rock hard and dense. What is sandwiched between is often loosely consolidated. Pinnacles in this region, Monument Valley, occur in two different types. There are fulgurites, like the burnt shard of Agathla peak which are the direct result of lightning striking the earth and boiling up the crust in an electromagnetic blister. These types of pinnacles were discussed in Lightning-Scarred Earth, parts 1 and 2. Sandstone pinnacles are where lightning struck and altered the charge in the rock beneath it, creating an electrical 'shadow' to sputtering discharge. They are literally the shadow of lightning strikes. Now, the footprint of a brief strike, comparatively speaking, produces a narrow cone of protection. How the cone slopes and steps depends on properties of the rock layers and the electric field potential, but more sustained, or potent striking begins to diffuse charge depletion outward from the cone, forming nodes or star-like breakouts, formed horizontally. Still larger accumulations of strikes diffuse charge further, and these nodules break out into 'wings' or dikes of charge depleted rock. The shadow footprint grows as arcing continues, elongating charge depleted zones into wedges with dikes growing out the tips and edges. This is actually the beginning of a fractal dendrite, as lightning bombardment soaks the charge from the ground diffusing outward in branches and creating a depleted zone protected from sputtering. If the process were to continue before the surrounding sputtered away completely, the dendrite nodules would grow and branch in ever smaller fractal repetitions, like branches of a tree. As adjacent rock is struck, the depleted zones connect into networks of wedges, ridges, and pinnacles. Generally, the pinnacles and buttes left on a dome are layered flat, but in some areas buttes display a dip, a slant to their slope, indicating horizontal winds influenced the deposition. Sputtering follows the voltage gradient, and so carves away from the lightning depleted zone in alignment with the strata because the voltage gradient follows the dielectric layers, cutting at 90 degrees to the dip angle and leaving a straight-edged, non- vertical wall like this mountain. If this mountain were eroded by conventional notions of wind rain and mass wasting, the rock would obey gravity and erode in a vertical wall. It's in details like this that prove electrical formation. What we see in the stepped pyramids and terraced canyons is the result of two types of charge transport in a solid-state matter. One is called drift ionization caused by the external electric field of the storm, and the other is called diffusion current caused by differences in charge density within the material of the dome itself. Drift current is the flow of charge created by the external electric field of the storm, which primarily drives the ionized region downward, vertically through the layers of sandstone. Drift currents obey Ohm's Law. Diffusion currents obey Fick's Law, which is related to Ohm's Law but accounts for variations in charge density that causes ionization to migrate from a region of high charge concentration to a region of lower concentration. No external electric field is needed for diffusion current because the difference in charge concentrations creates a gradient between those regions that results in a local electric field. And that's what this diffusion responds to. It's the primary process that migrates charge horizontally -- spreading through each layer of sandstone. What gets carved away by sputtering leaves distinct scalloped edges in very dry, low conductivity material? The scalloping is a fractal phenomenon of electrical diffusion that repeats the scallop shape in ever larger scallops. In wetter environments, it's not as apparent, or it may be totally absent, because water diffuses charge more evenly, which creates smoother, rounder surfaces. Compelling evidence the scalloped and terraced walls are a result of charge diffusion is shown in this image, where the archetype of all fractal shapes emerges -- the Mandelbrot Set. Although it's not a computer perfect rendition of the Mandelbrot Set, it's nearly so. It's a naturally generated fractal based on the same mathematical relationships of iterating three-dimensional motion that governs electrical charge diffusion in solid-state electronics. It appears on this canyon wall with nodes and vine-hair-like structures growing outward in exactly the same formation and orientation as the Mandelbrot Set does. The implication is obvious. The shape of the canyon walls, the terracing, the fractal repetition of form -- everything known about applied physics dictates this is the result of electrical current diffusion on a continent-scale semiconductor under the influence of a gigantic electric field. The physics is not only laboratory proven, it's been used to make every semiconductor device ever manufactured. In fact, geophysicists and even Hollywood CGI artists, simulate geologic forms like watersheds and river systems, canyons and mountains, using the fractal geometry of electrical diffusion. So, what is being described here has been acknowledged by consensus science. The scientific conclusion that these landforms are the result of electrical diffusion caused by an intense electric field influencing Earth's crust, in an event and the manner Electric Universe theorists have described since Immanuel Velikovsky is scientifically unavoidable. Yet avoid it they do -- consensus science, that is. To quote from a Wikipedia article on diffusion, "Analytical and numerical models that solve the diffusion equation for different initial and boundary conditions have been popular for studying a wide variety of changes to the Earth's surface. Diffusion has been used extensively in erosion studies of hillslope retreat, bluff erosion, fault scarp degradation, wave-cut terrace/shoreline retreat, alluvial channel incision, coastal shelf retreat, and delta progradation. Although the Earth's surface is not literally diffusing in many of these cases, the process of diffusion effectively mimics the holistic changes that occur over decades to millennia." Let me just repeat the last sentence. "Although the Earth's surface is not literally diffusing in many of these cases, the process of diffusion effectively mimics the holistic changes that occur over decades to millennia." So, what they're saying is they think it's just a coincidence. Rather than conclude in a proper scientific fashion that electrical current diffusion has a role in shaping the landscape, they conclude it's just an amazing coincidence. One hates to be critical to hard-working geophysicists but to have an empirically proven answer staring you in the face and ignore it in favor of a preferred narrative, is what a politician does, not a scientist. The idea that diffusion "mimics the holistic changes that occur over decades to millennia" is really absurd. Diffusion is caused by charge transport from higher to lower concentrations. Conventional erosive forces of water, wind and ice act on the land from the outside in, not from the inside out. Diffusion is an inside-out process from the atomic level outward as charges migrate from atom to atom. So there are notions that violate physics but they call it a coincidence instead. Fortunately, in the EU we like to deal in truths. So in Part 3, we'll examine a few more examples of sputtering canyon evidence. Thank you. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info A new scientific study has provided a jolt of surprising data on what was thought to be the largest and oldest impact crater on the Moon. The lunar South Pole Aitken basin is roughly 2,500 kilometers in diameter and 13 kilometers deep, which makes it one of the largest so-called impact craters in the entire solar system. Scientists had theorized that the basin contain minerals from the moon's mantle, since a tremendous kinetic energy from the hypothetical impact would have pierced the lunar crust and brought the materials to the surface. However, a team of scientists studying data from the Chinese spacecraft Chang'e 4's rover have found that in reality, the predominant mineral in the basin is common in the lunar soil. Thus, they have not found the materials required of such a tremendous impact site. The co-author of a new scientific study published in the Geophysical Research Letters, says of the findings, "We are not seeing the mantle materials at the landing site as expected." A Phys.org report on the discovery states, "The new study complicates theories about how the oldest, largest crater on the Moon formed, adding to the body of knowledge about the Moon's history... The new study complicates the certainty of earlier findings and points toward a need for continued research on the far side's lunar surface..." Of course, the complication of scientific theories is inevitable if only one theory is considered. A striking example of so-called settled science, which was settled prematurely, is the question of how the Moon got its craters. As we entered the Space Age, the debate among geologists and astronomers had only considered two hypotheses: impacts and volcanism. After Apollo astronauts returned lunar samples to Earth, analysis revealed a tremendous portion of the material was composed of shocked and welded minerals. Thus, the impact origin of lunar craters became the consensus scientific theory and remains so today. But like so much settled science, the dilemma was settled without the successful resolution of countless anomalies. Why the Moon is so heavily cratered is itself a puzzle which still demands a satisfactory answer. The Moon and some other bodies in the solar system are so heavily cratered that astronomers invented a violent epoch called the late heavy bombardment, a period when disproportionate numbers of asteroids supposedly collided with planets in the inner solar system. One reason for the hypothesis is that isotopic dating of Moon rocks seems to imply that the so-called impacts caused rocks to melt over a relatively short time. But problems with the late heavy bombardment hypothesis abound, and mainstream science continues to debate where the impacting bodies could have come from? Astronomers have long believed that asteroids were the source of the hypothetical bombardment. However, in 2017, the scientific paper modeling the historical flux of planetary impactors acknowledges that "asteroids were probably not responsible for the late heavy bombardment. The authors instead call on planetary migration in the early solar system and propose that "Comets and leftovers of the terrestrial planet formation provided additional, and probably dominant source of impacts during early epochs." Unfortunately, mainstream scientists today seem unaware that a sound scientific foundation exists for an entirely different hypothesis of cratering on the Moon and other rocky bodies. In fact, in 1965, the amateur astronomer Brian J. Ford published his laboratory experiments suggesting that craters on the Moon were carved by cosmic lightning bolts. In the cited experiments, Ford used the spark machining apparatus to reproduce in miniature some of the most puzzling lunar features, including craters with central peaks, small craters preferentially perched on the high rims of larger craters, and craters strung-out in long chains. He also observed that the ratio of large to small craters on the Moon matched the ratio seen in electrical arcing, and as with craters seen elsewhere in the solar system, Ford remarked on the mystery of their typical extreme circularity. He noted that over 90% of lunar craters cannot have been produced by side-swiping impacts. So planetary scientists concluded that the kinetic energy of an impactor must simply be converted into powerful surface explosions. However, highly circular craters are routinely produced in the industrial process of electrical discharge machining. Many years before Ford's published experiments and long before the Apollo missions to the Moon, Dr. Immanuel Velikovsky had made the outrageous prediction that remanent magnetism would be found in the lunar rocks. Astronomers had completely rejected the idea, since the Moon today has only a very weak magnetic field and is believed to have been geologically dead for a billion years. But Velikovsky based his prediction on his hypothesis of recent planetary catastrophe, involving interplanetary lightning between celestial bodies. Of course, like several other outrageous predictions by Velikovsky, it was proven correct. Velikovsky's colleague, the engineer Ralph Juergens also provided a remarkable analysis which should have been included in the scientific debate on the Moon's history and geological features. One of the most puzzling features of the Moon is the sinuous rille, which is a long and winding valley, usually with steep walls and often emerging from a crater. This feature is pervasive on the Moon at dramatically different scales. Prior to the Apollo missions, astronomers' early hypotheses suggested that the rilles were "cracks" on the Moon's surface. Later guesses included flowing water until scientists settled on flowing lava as the agent. Today, the accepted theory is that the Moon's sinuous rilles were created either by lava flowing across the surface or beneath the ground to form a "lava tube," portions of which eventually collapsed. Juergens compared the respective point-by-point requirements of various competing theories, versus the actual observed characteristics of the rilles. Unlike planetary scientists, Juergens included among the possible agents, high-energy electrical discharge. On every evidentiary point, the electrical discharge hypothesis is either permissible or predictable, and unlike every competing hypothesis, in not a single instance does the evidence preclude electrical discharge as the cause of the rilles. Even prior to Juergens'investigation, several scientists had noted that flowing liquids, whether water or lava, could not have caused the observed features of the lunar rilles, including the strings of craters along the rille's floors. These points are dramatically emphasized when we examine the Moon's famous Hadley Rille. Today, planetary scientists agree that the rille is a "collapsed lava tube." However, the rille does not match the required characteristics of lava tubes on numerous points, most importantly the collapsed areas of a lava tube will be rubble filled depressions. High-resolution images of the rille reveal no rubble and no collapsed tubes. It is simply an empty, sharply cut channel which matches the expected characteristics of an electrical "breakdown channel." Perhaps the greatest problem for the volcanic hypothesis of lunar rilles is their tremendous length. On our own planet, the longest lava tube reaches only 65 km. That is about half the length of Hadley Rille, which is 130 km. However, the exact opposite should be true. On Earth, the atmosphere is insulating, allowing lava to retain its heat. In the near-perfect vacuum of space, heat will be much more rapidly radiated away. On our planet, as lava flows over distances no more than tens of kilometers, the cooling at the surface causes a roof to form. It may then continue to flow as a tube beneath the surface. That is the only way the lava tubes can achieve even their modest lengths. Consider then the most prominent lunar rille, called Schroeder's Valley, 185 kilometers long and up to 10 kilometers wide, with its depth at points reaching up to 1,300 meters. Flowing lava, eating away surface material to cut a deep channel, would have to show up somewhere. We should see either breaches in the deep walls or evidence of abundant outflow. Instead, the channel simply dwindles until it disappears. Curiously, the flow of rilles on the Moon and other worlds isn’t limited to downhill, like lava and water-carved channels on Earth. All fluid erosion theories for Schroeder's Valley have chosen to ignore that the apparent mouth of the "stream" is on high ground, and the narrowest part of the channel is on low ground. We also note that within Schroeder's Valley is a much more narrow secondary rille whose defining feature is a chain of small craters. If the Moon was indeed ravaged by high-energy electrical discharge, nothing found in decades of lunar studies is inconsistent with the hypothesis. This includes the discovery of glass spherules, chondrules and minerals formed at high temperatures, typically associated with volcanic lightning found in abundance in the lunar soil. It includes the stunning disparity in cratering between the Moon's far side, which is massively cratered, and the Earth-facing near side, which is far less cratered, and with considerably less crustal thickness, a disparity which calls to mind the equally baffling Martian hemispheric dichotomy, and similar dichotomies seen on many other rocky bodies, and it includes the many types of craters seen throughout the solar system which are difficult or even impossible to explain through the impact hypothesis. From the aforementioned puzzle of smaller craters consistently appearing on the rims of larger craters, to crater chains, weird hexagonal craters, and craters with cleanly cut floors free of any ejecta from an explosive impact. As we've exhaustively outlined for seven years on this series, all of these types of craters are routinely seen in experiments with electrical discharge. In the early Space Age, the Moon was a symbol of mankind overcoming his physical restriction to Planet Earth, as well as extending the reach of his knowledge of the cosmos. Yet today, as in all of the theoretical Space Sciences, we see an immense disconnect between popular theory and the revelations of discovery, a disconnect which can only be resolved by willingness to explore entirely new possibilities. More than half a century has passed since the first footstep on the Moon. And the possibility still exists for a "giant leap" toward a truer understanding of the Moon's history and origins. 
[Music] In recent years, there have been unprecedented opportunities to learn about the nature and origins of one of the most mysterious celestial objects: the comet. For nearly three-quarters of a century, mainstream astronomy has held to the theory that comets are dirty snowballs, that is loose aggregates of ice and dust, that accreted billions of years ago in the solar system's infancy. It is believed that comet activity, including the production of a comet's tail and coma, is the result of sublimation of ices and outgassing as a comet moves close to the Sun. Prior to the earliest space missions to comets, astronomers expected the surface of a comet nucleus to be relatively smooth and covered with abundant water ice, as illustrated  in this artist's depiction prior to the mission to comet Halley in 1986. However, for over 35 years, increasingly fine close-up images of comet nuclei have revealed just the opposite: desiccated rocky surfaces with shockingly complex features, including characteristics remarkably familiar to planetary geology. Unbeknownst to most in the general public, as illustrated by the remarkable research of author and historian Hannes Tager, various astronomers, physicists, and natural philosophers began proposing electrical theories for comet activity as early as the 18th century. In the early 20th century the Norwegian experimentalist Kristian Birkeland, presented a theory of comets based on his experiments with gases in a discharge tube. He proposed that comets interact with what he called ‘corpuscle rays’ from the Sun, and the comets become negatively charged and produce explosive cathode jets, causing them to erode. A photograph of these experiments can be seen on your screen. in the later 20th century, the engineer Ralph Juergens proposed in the 1970s that the Sun was the anode focus of a glow discharge. This simply requires the Sun to be a positively charged body relative to its galactic environment. In this view, a comet moving toward the Sun from the outer reaches of the solar system, develops a negative charge relative to its environment. Physicist Wal Thornhill, the chief science advisor to the Thunderbolts Project, later developed and modified Juergens model of the Sun and of comets. An electric comet means that the assumption of charge neutrality for all celestial objects, cannot be correct. An assumption that has guided the space sciences for over a century. A new scientific investigation provides a remarkable predictive success for the electric comet theory. A scientist from the Swedish Institute of Space Physics, named Sofia Bergman, has recently published a doctoral thesis in which she outlines new methods for observing low-energy ions around the Comet 67P. In the past, measuring and interpreting the origins and behaviors of these ions, has proved extremely difficult. As the author explains, ”A spacecraft interacts with its environment, which leads to an accumulation of charge on the surface of the spacecraft. This is problematic for the measurements of low-energy ions, since the ions are affected by the spacecraft before they are detected, changing both our energy and travel direction.” ”We want to know the original properties of the ions before they were affected by the spacecraft, which is now possible with the method that I have developed in my thesis. The Rosetta spacecraft was equipped with an ion mass spectrometer and the data from the technology have been analyzed." Sofia Bergman describes her findings, ”For the first time, we have now been able to determine the flow directions of low- energy ions observed by ICA (the Ion Composition Analyzer) at Comet 67P/ Churyumov- Gerasimenko. The results were surprising. We see a large amount of ions flowing inward towards the comet nucleus, instead of outward as we had expected.” As noted in the summary of the thesis, ”The Ion Composition Analyzer of the Rosetta Plasma Consortium measured positive ions in the cometary environment with energies down to just a few electron volts.” The flow of positive ions toward the comet nucleus is an emphatic confirmation that the nucleus is negatively  charged. This electrical relationship between a comet and the solar environment is the  predictive foundation of the Electric Comet model. Of course, if a negatively charged body moves suddenly into a more positively charged domain, it will discharge electrically. From the Electric Universe perspective, this is the cause of most comet activity, including the explosive collimated jets which have puzzled astronomers for decades, but which, as mentioned, were replicated by Kristian Birkeland in the early 20th century. It also explains sudden cometary outbursts, and even the explosion of comets, often at remarkably vast distances from the Sun. In recent years, other scientific findings have also affirmed the electrical activities of a negatively charged comet nucleus. Consider scientists’ baffling discovery in 2007, that the comet McNaught was somehow able to modulate the solar wind. Nasa's Ulysses spacecraft encountered the comet when it was passing close to the planet Mars. Scientists detected that the comet's tail had slowed the solar wind to half its normal speed. Space science professor Dr. Michael Combi said of the discovery, ”This was very surprising to me. Way past the orbit of Mars, the solar wind felt the disturbance of this little comet. It will be a serious challenge for us theoreticians and computer modelers to figure out the physics.” Until recently, astronomers believed that the material in the comet's dust tail would be too heavy for the solar wind to push  around. However in 2019, scientists studying images of comet McNaught found surprising effects on the quote ‘weird striations’ in the comet's dust tail, as it crossed the heliospheric current sheet. This electrical interaction was summarized by planetary scientist Geraint Jones who said, “For us, this is strong evidence that the dust is electrically charged, and that the solar wind is affecting the motion of the dust.” The model of a negatively-charged comet, moving through regions of different electrical potential, can begin to resolve numerous comet mysteries, including the production of comet X-rays, the collimated jets of comets, and  dramatic comet activity which does not rely on the sublimation of abundant water ice which has never been observed on comet nuclei. And the electrical activity we see on comets, mirrors in many ways the powerful jets seen exploding hundreds of kilometers off the surfaces of planets and moons, including the Saturnian moon Enceladus, Jupiter's moon Io, and even the surface of Mars. The celestial bodies in our solar system can no longer be assumed to be electrically neutral objects. An unavoidable  realization in our Electric Universe. [Music] 
I want to introduce dr. jerry Pollak from the University of Washington where he's a professor of bioengineering for the past 10 years he has been looking at electrical structures in water as his presentation last year was extremely compelling and I I'm hoping that he'll review some of that territory as he also brings us some of his new work and and brings us up to speed on what he's doing and the implications of his work for the future so please welcome to the stage dr. Pollock well thanks thanks David actually I got a prop here they gave me some water but but the topic the topic of the day is not water I love to talk about water it's so interesting it's so full of charges and it fits so well with with the electric universe but I want to talk about something else today I want to talk about the Institute for venture science a few of you may remember I don't know how many of you are new or not new and we talked about this last year at the meeting and this is really a kind of progress report though I will start with some rationale for those of you who were not here because the first thing you may be wondering is what what's the Institute for venture science and what's venture science and why bother with all this so what I want to do today the agenda is as follows first of all is it really true as martin lopez Cordura says in his recent book that this is the twilight of the scientific age I'm not sure how you feel about that but okay and and and then the issue of is there really a chronic decline in science as we see it compared to say a hundred years ago with the Einsteins and the plunks and people like that is the chronic decline curable and how can the Institute for ventures science bring a cure to this this syndrome and I want to tell you the current status of the Institute for venture science okay so we start with an idea an idea that you may have and the idea is a let's a round earth idea so you come up with this brilliant idea that the earth is round and everybody around you knows for sure that the earth is flat you think well you know this is a pretty cool idea and it's it's awfully important that the earth is round and the question is if you if you do this today if you were to come up with this idea what chance would you have with this revolutionary idea to gain some traction again some success you might think you might think an idea as compelling as this would would have attract a lot of interest and perhaps trigger some kind of revolution but you know if recent experience is a guide it doesn't happen that way because we haven't seen a whole lot of revolutions in the past 30 or 40 or 50 years so consider think about the number of revolutions that we've had since let's say 1970 or so that's a pretty arbitrary date now what I'm asking you to think about is in terms of revolutions we're talking about a conceptual revolution we're not talking about technological revolutions which are supported by industry and there have been quite a few of those I mean everything related to the Internet and and such that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about a conceptual revolution some new idea that has never really been considered before that that changes our outlook of the world and I'm looking at realized revenue you read in New York Times or even Wall Street Journal it tells you about the new promising drug that has the capacity to cure cancer it has the capacity it's promised but is not realized you hardly ever come they hardly ever come to the realization so what I'm talking about is something like for example the splitting of the atom but that's a conceptual revolution that was 70 years ago another one is this structure of DNA that was 1953 so that was I think 60 61 years ago and it led to all kinds of interesting things about the human genome and such and and and so that that's what I mean by conceptual revolutions a new concept that changed our ability and led to so many new technologies in the future so I ask you to think for a moment how many modern conceptual realized revolutions can you think of I give you 30 seconds you're having a difficult time yes okay now I know that some of you can actually think of one or two I asked this question to many people and I get a blank look that's the response I think there has been one and I'll mention it later I think only one that I know of and it's in the medical sciences will come to that a bit later but you know the editors of science in their hundred 25th anniversary edition in 2005 decided to do exactly that they tracked the revolutions that have occurred in science from the time of the Greeks to 2005 and this was done in a kind of fold-out page that well it was kind of like a played Playboy fold-out page except the pictures were less interesting you know the picture of Einstein and and what he did and Max Planck and so on so I I conducted an exercise I made two lists I took the names of people and what they contributed from 2005 back 40 years and I did the same thing a century ago from 1905 back 40 years and this is a sampling of the of the old list now I bet you that everybody in the audience knows every single one or almost every one I took the full list in fact and I gave it to many peoples scientists and non-scientists and almost everybody was able to identify almost everybody on the list no question and then I took the modern list and here's again this is a random sampling from about 15 different people how many of you can identify zero of these people okay something is something is the matter here how come now we're talking about from 1965 right so we're talking extending back half century you know so you might say well some of this stuff you know just takes a lot of time for revolutions to a car you know but since we know that political revolutions can take place overnight practically how come it takes 50 years for this to happen something is is something is different it really is true that there are very few revolutions that have occurred these people actually have done important things Kary Mullis for example was involved in developing the pcr method of amplifying DNA it was not exactly a conceptual revolution it was a a technological revolution and another of these scientists figured out how to culture stem cells which made possible a lot of interesting experiments but they're not really the kinds of the kinds of discoveries that are comparable to Einstein or plunk or Curie or what have you okay so so why why challenge conventional thinking with revolutionary ideas aren't we making great progress we're making huge progress the number of papers that are published exceed the number of papers ever published in history it's a it's amazing how many but the question is you know what are we really what new understanding we do we have from all of that that knowledge of course we advance through revolutions this is just a few examples but the problem now is that revolutions are really sparse there's something wrong something is going on we had lots of revolutions a hundred years ago but it's really hard to really hard to identify a revolution in in the past year so why so few revolutions well there's no revolutionary ideas challenge the status quo and these threaten the the stakeholders in the prevailing paradigm and threaten the grant reviewers and you know what happens when people get threatened they respond and so most scientists understand that if you if you threaten the these stakeholders you have to be careful and particularly in the institutions that I deal with all the time the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation most most scientists with revolutionary ideas keep it secret they don't apply once they apply they know they won't get the money and also they develop a reputation as being the kind of person who you stay away from so some revolutionary a change is suppressed as a result I think largely of the institutions that we have that fund science is a modern science made the tree of knowledge may look something like this but the modern dwelling place of most science is up here at the periphery of the of the Tree of Knowledge this this place is is safe you don't shake the tree you don't pull off a big limb and it's non-disruptive so everybody's happy you know a lot of papers are being published the news releases press releases from every institution show great progress and real promise for the future but not many revolutions so the revolutionary progress comes when a limb when someone discovers that you know one of these limbs is not really as sound as we expect and you prune the limb and and come up with some brand new growth and so one example of that that is very familiar here is the heliocentric solar system once that happened then everything changed this was a new a new limb on the on the tree of knowledge another one in the medical realm is the one by Semmelweis who found out that if you wash your hands before you deliver babies or conduct surgery the patient is more likely to survive and of course he was brushed aside and he died insane from all the pressure that that was that was put upon him so the new growth is really what we're looking for and which gives you a revolutionary advance it's kind of like a you know you look at something and this looks great it's obviously this is a rectangle but you know you look at it from another direction and it's a different reality a different a fresh perspective teaches you something different so today this is the issue we have a huge amount of money that is put into science if you add up just in the US the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation it's approximately 40 billion dollars if you add defense and such it's probably up to hundred billion dollars just in the u.s. it's a lot of money but very few revolutions and if you compare that to a hundred years ago almost no money there was some it's that kind of paradox isn't it I'm glad there's some humor in this but something something is wrong here because we got a lot of input but no output a lot of promise but no no real revolutions so why is this the case well I I kind of alluded to it you can think of a few few ideas maybe maybe a scientists are stupider than they were a hundred years ago it could be you know the environment is having some real negative impact on us maybe we're eating the wrong food or the electromagnetic pollution or something so that I guess that that's one idea we hope that the the increase of stupidity is somehow compensated by the larger numbers doing it maybe maybe the problems are harder I don't know but I've seen no evidence that the problems are harder now than then they were a hundred years ago or another another possibility as well everything is already known therefore you know there's nothing to know no revolutions to occur and I know what you folks think about that so I think that there what I alluded to before is it's the culture of science today that is is the culprit the emphasis the emphasis on productivity producing lots of papers competing to get into the prestigious journals and such and and so it's a culture where power is really important that power is given to the experts and power is given to the vested interests we need money to do a research the experts are the ones who decide whether the revolutionaries get the money or don't get the money this is not a system to encourage radical thinking and fresh ideas so you come up with a fresh idea and the typical response from the establishment is something like this you know you're proposing what yuck so this is this is the kind of you know I think many of you have been there this is this is the kind of response what I've discovered is that there actually are plenty of round earth ideas out there I I study water but I've been in several different fields during my my career and I used to think the first field that I entered which was actually cardiac cell electrophysiology I kind of started in biology and I thought I thought they were their prevailing views but there were challenging views out there and nobody took them seriously and I thought this is a problem and then I entered into cell biology and I saw the same problem and then I entered into muscle contraction and I saw the same problem a theory that has been around since 1954 believed by everybody but the evidence is so clearly against it and the people who have evidence against have no ability to make any inroads against the establishment so I came to realize that this is true in numerous fields I think the people around here some of you may believe it's true and the electric universe area but this is endemic it's it's just all over all over science usually what happens is the response that I've seen among many people is the response to around earth idea and the Flat Earth environment well if the idea isn't good it would have been discovered earlier and everybody would know it's true and blah blah blah and so your idea can't be any good because obviously that hasn't happened the case closed just to give you a couple of ideas of of some of the when I think are kind of interesting ideas out there of course the the energy idea tapping energy from the environment starts way back from from Tesla but there was a particular invention that I came across which kind of interesting because it it it capitalizes on the Earth's electric field and it's looks something like this it looks complicated but the principle is really simple if these are balloons way up and they're actually there to suspend a metallic ring and since the electric the electrical potential in the atmosphere is something like a hundred volts per meter you have a potential difference between this metallic ring and ground and if you put a motor in between the potential difference between here and here is enough to drive that motor and there were a lot of electrostatic motors that ran on low current high voltage many years ago and are still being developed and can produce on the order of 75 to 100 watts of mechanical energy which is you know pretty pretty substantial and these have not really seen the light of day and here's another example this is a lifter and some of you know about lifters it's just a u-turn you you have one electrode here this aluminum foil and the and the other electrode is a wire up at the top which you can barely see you put a potential difference of ten thousand volts between them and this lifts up we have one in my laboratory it lifts up easily to a meter is just putting the potential difference of 10,000 volts that's all and you get lifting as a result of that my estimate is that nobody knows how it works of course we have some ideas but this is the kind of thing that you'd seem it would seem to to demand some development and some understanding but I bet many of you have never heard of these lifters and in the area of health also my favorite is always this one that it's it's a book that's called the doctor who cures cancer and this is Amelia ravit who died about 10 years ago the age of a hundred and he had the reputation of if if someone was really sick and cancer and they were just about gone they go to Ravi ji and Ravi T was able to do this is a quote from the guy who was the retiring president of the Sloan Kettering Cancer Research Center which is the most perhaps the most distinguished one in in the u.s. in New York and he said that quote on the back I don't know how he does it but people walk in dead and walk out alive I come into contact with a lot of people who deal with alternative health and I'm amazed by the the by the progress that these people have made and and the ability of these people to actually cure people with cancer who can't be cured by the standard chemotherapy radiation surgery that's been used effectively for 50 years just mine or technological improvements so another area that that that needs to be dealt with with new fresh information and fresh ideas so problems remain unsolved they want the two I mentioned Plus understanding how our brains work and Alzheimer's disease function dysfunction combating global warming if you believe in it or establishing that it's not true which some colleagues I just spoke at NASA there's a big group of people who are absolutely certain that there's no warming this needs to be straightened out eliminated starvation and many others okay so I've given you the background I've given you the problems and I've given you some maybe some evidence about that new book I mentioned that the decline of the twilight of the scientific age we're not producing what we used to produce in science so we decided to see if we can do something about it and we decided to put together a foundation that funds promising ideas that challenge conventional thinking now obviously we have no we have no building or no this is just a sort of dream for the future we call it we call it the Institute for venture science or IV s and this institute is a funding a see it funds promising ideas that challenge conventional views and there are a few twists to it and I want to tell you about it that I think make it will make it operate effectively so how will we foster the kind of revolutionary advance that we know is missing now we need it we need it badly to solve our problems so the first is that we invite groundbreaking proposals it doesn't matter what field anybody who has an earth-shaking idea around earth idea and the Flat Earth environment send it to us and we of course put it through a vetting process and I won't go into detail about the the initial entry we don't want flaky proposals obviously we want substantial ones we asked the Flat Earth people to please tell us what's wrong with this round earth proposal and you can guess how scathing their review is going to be we know that okay so you have the round earth applicant and you have a bunch of Flat Earth people feeding back and saying this is the biggest I ever it but give us some reasons why you think it's not right and so we establish a debate between the two and the people who listen to this debate are outside the field they don't care whether the earth is round they may care but they have no bias as to whether the earth is round or whether the earth is flat they want to listen they want to hear how well this applicant can defend himself against those tigers and lions and and then what happens is we make judgment as to how well they did and how important their subject is it's the product of those two that determines their score we fund the selected proposals liberally because you know people who venture into the real unknown they need often they need substantial funds and they need to have the confidence that they're going to be funded for some years at least otherwise it's too risky to go into there are human issues that need to be taken into into account now here's the key I haven't told you the real key the real key is next the real key is that we fund multiple groups pursuing the same theme so we get the rounders idea we fund the rounders idea and we try to identify around the world 10 or 12 different groups who also think that the earth might be round but they're using different techniques to to to check it and so what what that does is it creates a critical mass you know it's it's easy it's easy to dismiss one person as a crackpot oh you know stay stay away from that person because their ideas are really weird then you'll never get anywhere but when a dozen groups come to the the annual meeting of the shape of the Earth Society and hey what's going on here there are a dozen groups reporting that the the earth is round instead of flat then they have to pay attention so the single one is dismissed but the multiplicity is really the critical factor that can make a difference and that can bring revolutions you know if if the round earth really has the goods within two or three or four years people will it'll be obvious that that the evidence for this is convincing and I think within a few years there'll be a phase transition a new way of thinking revolution on the other hand if the rounder if people don't really have the evidence and the earth is flat they don't have to defend themselves and then we'll know for sure that the earth is flat but we'll be more certain of it so either way the investment is good investment because both sides are put on the same platform to debate and then we learn which one is correct and I think many of these will lead to two revolutions okay so how do we do this well we have a funding goal and the funding goal is it's sort of arbitrary but we think of an endowment an endowment say on the order of ten billion dollars and from that endowment we could use the interest which at 5% is something like well 500 million dollars now for five hundred million dollars if you think of that each project let's say arbitrarily gets 1 million dollars per year just arbitrarily some need less others may need more that's enough to fund 50 revolutionary ideas time say 10 labs per idea simultaneously now it sounds like a lot of bucks but it's less than one percent of the u.s. annual research budget this annual budget less than one percent and for that we anticipate out of this will come multiple revolutions and the present course has produced almost no revolutions at much higher annual budget so if you think about what happens you get revolutions and from revolutions you get fresh insight about the workings of the world new solutions to all the problems that plague the world and a bright future and for those who are you know more practically minded think about what revolutions can do every revolution every new concept leads to many new technologies inevitably and economic revitalization and again a bright future so if you think about about the the prospects what what this can bring and think about well how do you get people to donate we're looking for private donors it's very easy to to donate to something like the Gates Foundation which by the way is right around the corner from us this guy was actually the boss of my son when he was young so Bill Gates formed the Gates Foundation and you know if you put in money to the Gates Foundation or other foundations they do good and you all know that Gates Foundation has been making real progress producing vaccines that some of us think are good and others think our not so good and producing sanitary conditions and toilets and such so so so people are tempted to donate now what's different about us is we promise something beyond that it's a kind of amplification effect you put in a small amount of money and you can get potentially huge dividends out of it I just give you one example so you know a few few scientists were playing around with with impurities and semiconductor materials about 60 70 years ago and that of that came transistors and diodes and photo diodes and they'll digital cameras and solar cells and integrated circuits microprocessors laptops smartphones basically everything we do today came from a discovery of physicists and the engineers working at the fundamental level and that's what we're talking about funding some capsule of an idea and who knows what that can lead to it's unpredictable but it can be awfully big now there are quite a few billionaires out there some of you know that many of them signed the Giving Pledge that was suggested by by Bill Gates which means that ultimately many many people will be donating a large or substantial amount of various charities many want to give back to society and many want to to leave a legacy they want to be remembered Bill Gates I would guess wants to be remembered not for being the richest guy in the world but for having founded the Gates Foundation which did many good things so so that's an idea and of course if someone is willing to donate a couple of billion bucks it's possible that this could be part of the legacy now why can we make this happen well I think we have a we assembled a very interesting and capable group of people so let me tell you about our advisory panel the people who we ask for advice and they come back and give us advice and I've just read to you to give you some idea of the distinction of these people and Michael Crosby was the executive director of the National Science Board which runs the NSF he also was a vice chancellor of a university Peter Katonah was the president of the Whitaker Foundation which funds funded bioengineering John Strauss was the CFO of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and he's been president of four universities I guess they didn't like him so much Alexander Coyne avala was the is is was the rector of Kazan University in Russia that's the third ranked university in all of Russia and was also the head of a large chemical Institute and for those of you interested in homeopathy he has brilliant results now that can explain how this really works Barry Marshall you may not recognize his name Nobel laureate from Western Australia he's a guy who I think was responsible for one of the few revolutions that is finding out that ulcers were not necessarily caused by worrying but by bacteria he had a difficult time of it and maybe you know that eventually he swallowed the bacteria he got an ulcer and they cured himself with an antibiotic and then they gave him a Nobel Prize astonied Petrovic is a was the rector and just retired Ljubljana University and a member of the National Science Board Doug Randall and Don Miller is a guy who I know in Seattle and he was chief of cardiovascular surgery and also a well-known philosopher of science very deep understanding of the scientific processes so that's the advisory panel and the core group or the executive staff I think is a group or committed with complementary skills and you may know some because there are some people are floating around here and that James Ryder who used to be the vice president of Lockheed Martin and Frank Costanzo who's around here today and who's been a senior-level political adviser and has turned around many businesses Susan she wrote you know was an HMO executive and and myself and and so I think with the devotion of this executive staff and the advisory panel I think we have a chance to to make it happen the website is under construction and we hope that it will be up and you can look at it within the next few weeks that's really our starting point something that we need in order to launch realistically the campaign to to get funded so the Institute for venture science we're talking about unthinkable ideas today and received wisdom tomorrow thank you you 
Welcome to Space News  from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts. info In part one of this presentation, our guest Andrew Hall began the seventh installment of his Eye of the Storm series. A series devoted to exploring some of the most  dramatic and puzzling geological features on planet Earth. As Andrew has explained, the lifelike emanations of electrified plasma tell us much about mysterious dendritic and filamentary geological patterns. Nor is it coincidental that plasma filaments find a stunning analog in a global mythical archetype, that is the sinuous form and fiery breath of the cosmic dragon. There are several junctions and other features along the Colorado and its tributaries highlighted in the next image. We're going to explain each feature. But first, some explanation of what kind of current flows in the earth. It's alternating current and direct current  both. Alternating current is super-positioned on a direct current carrier wave. Voltage difference is relative, with no absolute positive or negative. This is true of the mineral water, plasma, and solid-state matter that conducts electricity throughout the system, too. It's important to understand because Nature doesn't work with the kind of tidy insulated circuitry and constant voltage, battery-operated predictability that your cell phone uses. AC circuits oscillate in voltage, current and impedance as frequency changes. Everything is dynamic, with feedback and noise adding complexity. But Nature manages to make order from the chaos. The reason is resonance. The beauty of Nature is that it allows malleability in its shape  to find the path of least resistance and therefore balance itself out, like water filling a lake. When balance is reached there is resonance. So dragons have rules. They have  to play their part in the circuit and the type of circuit they are part of is what defines the rules. The type of circuit the Colorado River follows is called an RLC circuit. An RLC circuit combines the fundamental elements of resistor, inductor and capacitor connected across a voltage supply. Nature has to comply with physics. So, logic  leads to choosing an RLC circuit model since Nature has all three fundamental elements in its makeup. There are parallel and series RLC circuits, and hybrid combinations of those. In the case of the dragon that carved the Colorado River, a parallel circuit is required. The full explanation for why that is will take us into another chapter in Eye of the Storm, but we'll start with discussing the geometry of junctions. The image below highlights nine junctions in green where the Colorado joins its major tributaries. You'll  note they all have a distinctive shape. Power in an RLC is not consumed by line resistance alone, but impedance which has reactive, vector components. The inductor and capacitor elements of the circuit have reactance, which opposes current flow like a resistor, but occurs 90 degrees out of phase with resistance. Inductive current is at a vector rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise to the supply line current. Capacitive current is at a 90 degree rotation clockwise to the line current. The  resultant current is not the arithmetic sum of currents, but the vector sum, which produces current at a resultant angle from the original line current. In a parallel RLC circuit, the  voltage across each element remains the same and current gets divided. Current  shifts vector in a parallel RLC circuit, which is what we see: the river channel splits in two directions at, or near 180 degrees apart. Keep in mind, rivers flow downhill, but the dragon travels upstream, so a junction is a bifurcation, not a confluence. This indicates the currents bifurcated because line current went to zero, while capacitive and inductive currents-- the reactive currents-- initiated current flow along the new vectors. The new vectors are at 180 degrees opposed to each other, with the inductive current angle 90 degrees counter-clockwise from the supply line current, and the capacitive current at 90 degrees clockwise from the supply line current, creating a junction that looks like a “T”. This is precisely what happens when a parallel RLC circuit achieves resonant frequency. Supply line resistance goes up with frequency. As resistance goes up, line current is restricted in reactive current increases. You can visualize reactive current as leakage from a perforated pipe, where more and more fluid or current escapes through the perforations, shooting out perpendicular to the direction of supply flow if the pressure is allowed to build with resistance inside the pipe. Resonant frequency causes line resistance to go to infinity. Well,  it doesn't actually go to infinity, but it goes just as high as it needs to stop the line current. When line current goes to zero, reactive current shoots out like fluid under pressure, perpendicular to the conductor. This is because of Kirchhoff's current law that says the sum of all currents entering a junction is equal to the sum of all currents leaving that junction. Therefore, when resonant frequency is reached, line current cannot overcome resistance and goes to zero. All the current then shoots out as reactive current at vectors 90 degrees from the line current. That is  what causes the river to bifurcate in a “T” shape. Reactive power is commonly considered to be stored power in transmission systems. Inductive  reactance stores in a magnetic field and capacitive reactance stores in an electric field. On power grids, we use capacitors and generators to provide these fields to capture the energy and return it to the system. Nature doesn't have ready-made devices to store energy, so reactive power simply squirts out at new current vectors, it's energy consumed by impedance. Of course reactive power is much more complex than water in a pipe. The  comparison is meant to illustrate for those who aren't familiar with the concept. This isn't the place to review equations, but the basics of RLC circuits and the geometry of reactive power can be found in any circuit fundamentals textbook. There are a couple of other things to note about the shapes of these junctions. First they rarely make perfect “T” junctions. Most reactive discharge appears at less than 90  degree rotation from the line voltage, producing a “Y” shape instead of a “T”. This is most likely due to the DC bias in the current. Resonance causes AC line current to go to zero, but not DC. So the resultant current vectors are the vector sum of the total reactive current with the remaining DC line voltage, producing a “Y” instead of a “T”. The second thing to note is that the inductive current path (the branch rotated counterclockwise, or north in  the case of the Colorado River) continues in that direction more or less straight to the next junction, following the north pointing magnetic field. The capacitive current does something completely different, however, and it does this consistently at every “T” junction: it shoots south a short distance and abruptly curls east, back to the original supply line vector. Capacitive current discharges clockwise, to the south of the line current in a direction 90 degrees from the prevailing electric field in response to a far-field charge  buildup. The far-field charge builds in a capacitance response reactance to the charge building in the supply line as frequency rises and chokes off supply line current. But once it discharges, it equalizes charge differentials and the far-field voltage it is responding to, disappears. The current immediately turns back to align with the prevailing electric field - the original supply line current vector. That is why the southern branch always makes an immediate sharp turn eastward and realigns, at least briefly, with the supply line current. This is really important because Nature following precisely a form expected from electrical discharge and repeating it over and over again, is hard to call coincidence. If we look at the big picture and we draw lines to represent the prevailing electric field aligned with the supply line current, it's easy to see that the Colorado River and its tributaries, or more precisely, the dragon that carved the river, is a discharge that follows the electric field in a stepwise manner, with resonant reactive surges that bifurcate into inductive current branches that moves the discharge north into the strongest voltage lane which aims it to the Eye of the Storm in the four corners region of Northern Arizona and Utah. The electric field is between the accumulating material on the Colorado Plateau, and the San Andreas Fault, marked in red in the image. Why this is will be discussed in the next few chapters, but it's the reason the Colorado is a parallel RLC circuit. The capacitive current branches all make a brief step to the south and turn abruptly back east to realign with the prevailing electric field, first  producing the Gila tributary, which I mark in A, and then the Bill Williams tributary in B  and when it reaches the resonant RLC discharge at lake Mead, it finally found the lane of maximum electric field potential mark C, and thereafter shoots east to the Eye of the Storm centered at Monument Valley, carving some amazing canyons  and other features along its way. In the next chapter of Eye of the  Storm we'll discuss these canyons, other types of branching, other features and their likely causes. But before we close this chapter, let's consider what a dragon looks like. In myth, references to dragons can be confusing, because sometimes they boil  the sea, sometimes they ravage the land and sometimes they take wing. The discharge that scraped the land in surface conductive arcing, also created its own weather and  induced following jet stream winds. Depending on perspective, one might describe a dragon as a submarine, serpent, or flying demon. Following jet stream winds choked with dust, swirling from cyclone to cyclone, had to look like animate serpent bodies glowing with internal lightning. In its early path it scraped the earth's surface, following surface water laid down by storm and tsunami. Water is its  conductor. Just as in the atmosphere, water is the conductor. Like it is in our bodies,  and plants and pretty much all of Nature. Water is dipolar, and in the field of a strong electric potential, the polarity of its molecules align coherently and facilitate current. It is liquid, so flows through pores and rocks and soil, providing electrical continuity across vast stretches of Earth. Earth's crust is saturated with water, even deserts, but for the very shallow top layer of sand and mountain. Water provides the “surface conductance” for the ground-to-ground discharge. So that's another rule, the dragon to follow  water. But it doesn't always follow surface water. The storm that drew forth the Colorado, the storm over the Colorado plateau was laying down layer upon layer of dry sediments, burying lakes, inland seas in their drainage. The dragon burrowed into the ground beneath these dry deposits and followed the water like a tree root. All along its jagged path, on either side the land was pummeled. A dense magnetic field surrounded the current as it pulsed and sparked. And this drew lightning from the raging plasma clouds above, inducing a following storm system of winds, whirlwinds, and mesocyclones that conflicted with the ambient winds, creating shockwaves all around. On the ground, whirlwinds at the maw of the beast sucked tons of billowing dust to wrap around  the plasma at the core of the arc, filling its body within the confines of a magnetic sheath. It formed a lion's mane or feathered appearance at its head as it drew in streamers of dust. The arc advanced in explosive, staccato bangs, jumping from node to node, connecting dots across the landscape. But heavy ionic matter moved more slowly, being either pulled with, or drawn against the current, as dictated by charge polarity. These horizontal whirlwinds might have looked like ultra- high-speed trains racing across the land. It likely wore an inner vest of elemental conductors, and molten silica around a super-heated plasma core. An outer coat of ragged dust, drawn to its maw as it advanced, wrapped tight to its body by ferrous material caught in the magnetic field. Shock waves patterned this cloak into diamond-shaped scales that pulsed with light and X-rays. It spit lightning and flames in  70-mile arcs, while shockwaves boomed from its flanks. Sounds just like a dragon,  huh? But why take my word for it? Listen to an eyewitness account: “I will not conceal his limbs, his mighty power as graceful proportions. Who can remove his outer coat? Who can approach him with a double bridle? Who can open the doors of his face, with his terrible teeth all around? His rows of scales are his pride; shut up tightly as with a seal; one is so near another that no air can come between them. They are joined one to another. They stick together and cannot be parted. His sneezings flash forth light; and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. Out of his mouth go burning lights; sparks of fire shoot out. Smoke goes out of his nostrils; as from a boiling pot and burning rushes. His breath kindles coals, and a  flame goes out of his mouth. His undersides are like sharp potshards. He spreads pointed marks in the mire, he makes the deep boil like a pot. He makes the sea like a pot of ointment. He leaves a shining wake behind him; one would think the deep had white hair. On Earth there is nothing like him, which is made without fear. He beholds everything high. He is king over all the children of pride. That's  Job 41 in the bible folks. And it's not talking about a fish or a whale. Leviathan in the bible is a dragon, much like the other demigods from the  sea in every ancient tradition. So I committed to Thunderbolts ten chapters for the Eye of the Storm series. This is chapter Seven. Chapter Eight will discuss more about dragons and the rules they live by. Chapter Nine will delve under the crust of the earth to see what's there, and Chapter Ten will summarize  all that we have discussed and conclude this examination of the Colorado Plateau. In the end, if you read and comprehend all ten chapters and study up on circuit theory, you will have the tool, wisdom that is, to evaluate your part of the world on your  own. Come join the club. Thank you. [Music] 
The Electric Universe -- Why Should I Care? -- Many people today are asking, what has happened to science? Early in the space age, a President inspired a nation to put a man on the moon within the span of a single decade. "We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things..." But where's that sense of new frontiers today? The passion for discovery? For youngsters, it seems science has lost its meaning. Meaning comes from the things that we value, and what is the value of discovery? How could we lose interest in that? We've invited disinterest in science by our claims to already know the important questions and their answers. Just look at the picture given in the scientific media. All the great mysteries have already been solved. How the universe began. How gravity drove everything across billions of years, the birth and death of stars, our Sun emerging from a gaseous cloud, planets on predictable courses for a billion years. And a thousand other settled questions, or so we're told. Well, here's a surprise; our universe is electric. It's animated by charged particles in motion. The electrically sterile cosmos we so long imagined does not exist. The Electric Universe will re-inspire education and science. Electricity will open new pathways of discovery, a new picture of galaxies, and all the stars in the sky, our Sun included. Every organism will come alive electrically, and we will begin to remember the electrical dramas in the sky above our early forebears. Take the time to discover this for yourself. A profound scientific revolution is already underway. Join in at Thunderbolts.info 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts. info Welcome to Space News. This is Andy Hall and over the course of the past year I've been presenting a multi-part series called Eye of the Storm. In chapter 5, we looked at coronal storms. We  looked at the San Rafael Swell and Capital Reef, as well as Monument Valley and the San Juan River basin as sets of dome and crater piers, produced in the eye of the great primordial storm that created the Colorado plateau. The weather that produced these domes and craters essentially consisted of a thunderstorm producing updraft winds, paired with a cyclone producing a downdraft at its core. Electrically, it  formed a ring current between them, with its lower half being currents in the  ground. Its upper half consisted of the mesocyclone and cyclone connected by a jet stream wind from updraft to downdraft, forming an arch of condensate. This loop is what would be under calmer circumstances the thunderstorm anvil cloud, a layer of positive charge forming the top half of the mesocyclone. But when mesocyclone and cyclone come together in a turbulent intensely charged climate, the anvil is swept into a filament that feeds the downdraft of the cyclone. The  cyclone and mesocyclone then becomes one circuit. This is how fractals grow. Circuits connect together and pairings become groupings and groupings become networks. And that is what we see on Jupiter. The Great Red Spot is a  network circuit of coronal storm loops. We also looked at direct visual evidence of coronal loops on Jupiter and they happen to be in almost the exact same pattern in the Great Red Spot as the dome and crater appears on the Colorado Plateau, because the storm systems are fractal and driven by similar circuitry. Also, like the ground current loops discussed in chapter 9, these ring currents had DC input from lightning and plasma winds and current junctions with ground. So they could act as op-amps, using the  DC current to amplify the ring current. That realization was a pretty good egg. But it gets better. The big Easter egg was finding this type of storm system depicted in ancient art. In fact it's depicted on the oldest most controversial and mysterious megalith ever discovered, the Vulture Stone at Gobekli Tepe. The stone T-pillar depicts arch clouds across the sky, or upper portion of the pillar. Yes, the mysterious Handbag of the Gods. And this is just my theory of course, but the handbag depicts the box-like shape of mesocyclone seen at a distance, with the arch receding from center to behind, where it downdrafts into an unseen cyclone. A distant viewer would only see a squall line of thunderstorms surrounding the cyclone with instead of an anvil cloud, the jet stream to the cyclone arching away just as it's depicted on the pillars. Note  the odd figures above the clouds. I believe these represent the type of  thunderstorm discharge we call sprites and gnomes. In a coronal storm, plasma  discharges from the cloud tops would not be as rare as they are today and not that they are all that rare today. But in this past environment, they  would have been lit up like Christmas. Above and below the clouds is space patterned in triangles, cut across by a thin layer of rectangles. This represents the triangular pattern of rarefaction and compression in supersonic winds, the narrow layer being a faster jet stream or lenticular layer between conflicting winds, with interference patterns making  the box-like segregations. The vulture or thunderbird is a stylized representation of the Peratt instability, also known as squatter man, which in rock art is often depicted with a bird's head. It would have presaged the storm, appearing in the sky as an aurora bringing the portent of doom to come. The legless birds also depict aurorae that are fractal repetitions, at least in partial image of the central plasma column. Below the birds in the base of the T are depictions of a wolf, representing the howling wind, a salamander, representing the tidal floods and a scorpion, meaning ground-to-ground discharge, depicted as a dragon in other myths. Arrow-headed snakes appear here  and there, representing lightning or currents. The T-pillar itself represents Earth in heaven: as above so below. A popular theory about this stone is that it actually depicts a comet or meteor strike. And that's because the bird is holding a ball. Go figure. I like my interpretation better. Gobekli Tepe is dated earlier than 9000 BC,  or the time of the Younger Dryas. It is also when Plato said Atlantis  disappeared. And it correlates well, all things considered, with the time we recall as Noah's flood, or Gilgamesh, if you prefer. So, is this a shrine made by survivors? Or  did it have utility in surviving the storms? They must have hid underground to survive. Even if they are in a region of calmer winds, radiation, lightning and fouled water would have surely killed them if they were unprotected. The implication is clear however. At Gobekle Tepe, as in every ancient myth, there was an electrical storm the likes of which do not appear today, caused by some solar system event. Now the final Easter egg. These handbags are depicted all over the world in ancient stone work. The earliest known depictions are in petroglyphs that can't all be dated, but are believed to be from before 9,000 BC. The following is an example from Australia. If you read this petroglyph, right to left, like a storyboard, it first shows a small coronal storm on the right, the rightmost handbag apparently  forming. Next to it is a larger one, above streamers rising from the ground. These would be plasma streamers, like what forms in a lightning  connection, only visible in glow mode. Next, the cloud forms something  below, while something else rises to meet it. They look like hoops or semi-circles. These would be plasma clouds, reaching  to meet, also visible in glow mode. And then there's some kind of squiggly figure, after which the clouds appear again. Never mind the kangaroo. The squiggly figure is the plasma afterglow of a super-sized lightning bolt. What I believe this depicts, is the cloud. The entire mesocyclone of a thunderstorm, collapsed in a Z-pinch, and then reforming. That would be like a hydrogen bomb going off. But I'm  pretty sure that's what we're seeing. I wonder if there isn't a large crater  a few miles in front of this rock. The entire colloquy is represented in stylized form in the Anunnaki figures in ancient Sumeria; the handbag and the vine of “pomegranate”  that looks like the Australian squiggly figure. They are often holding pine cones, and  that's I think represents the supersonic winds thrusting forward at the head of the storm and the fractal pattern of rarefaction and compression they would display. In fact, the entire  figure represents aspects of the storms, from the bird's head of aurora discharge to the legs flat-footed on the ground - one uncovered and billowing muscle, like the winding up draft to a mesocyclone and the other covered, unable to  be seen, like the returning airflow down a cyclone. It's as if the gods - the winged anthropomorphized aurora that presaged this storm - are delivering the storm,  presenting handbags of terror, pine cones of destruction, and  massive thunderbolts of lightning. It even displays a sense of hierarchy between heavenly and earthly phenomena, as in the gods and demigods  endemic to all ancient religions. I know people will disagree because everyone has a theory about the “handbags.” Some think they are for a drug stash as if the ancient gods munched psilocybin all day. And others say they carried pollen, but who collects pollen, and why? It makes more sense to me that these figures symbolically commemorate the most Earth-shattering event known to man. Whether you agree, or not, I want you to understand. The events I describe are in our history. They influence us today. We are just confused by liars and lazy thinkers in our midst, from academia to media, to politics, science, to culture, to power. Break the bonds of the brainwash they feed us and think for yourself. Do it and you will find answers. Nature makes itself known. It's up to us to raise our consciousness to its level. Once done, truth is self-evident. At least this is my experience. I have no special talent I'm just keenly aware of what's around me and eternally curious as to how it got there. Ask  the right questions and nature shows the answer. I refer to this feedback circuit as God. I present  these conclusions for your consideration. I won't deny other possible answers exist, and we need to consider everything. But there is a bit of urgency in the message I get from all this, which I'm compelled to share. Earth's  internal circuits are warming up. Volcanic and seismic activity is increasing all along plate boundaries that define the sub-surface currents. Weather has become a bit strange and at the same time the Sun is entering a minimum period of energy output. Solar minimums have direct correlation with colder weather on Earth, but also higher seismic activity. The Earth has to respond to the change in solar energy by releasing some of its stored energy in order to maintain its balance. A reduction in solar wind means a reduction in energy-induced  by Earth’s magnetic field. With less input energy, internal [currents] wane  and the magnetic field weakens and expands. But as the magnetic field expands, it captures more solar wind, creating an increased induction. This tug-of-war plays out as Earth  tries to keep pace with the Sun, but it oscillates Earth’s circuitry as currents ebb and flow creating resistance and heat that has to release. This happens in the transient phases, shifting from maximum to minimum and vice versa. It's the rate of change that matters. We may see dramatic increase in the frequency of earthquakes and volcanoes and severe weather as we go down into the minimum and rise back out. We are also experiencing a  magnetic pole shift. The magnetic pole shift is related to changing crustal  currents. I don't know how yet, but I know there's feedback between  them, because there has to be. It's physics and it is happening. If  there is one thing that should be evident from reading Eye of the Storm, it's that Earth is an electric circuit driven by whatever is in its core. We don't know what the “core” is. It's not a spinning ball of iron. The surface effects we experience outside of the crust are driven from within as a result of how the core reacts with the solar system. The  surface effects are a capacitive reaction to changing energy levels in the core because Earth is a spherical capacitor. Crustal boundaries surround the Indian Ocean, and above segments of these currents are some of the most active volcanic regions, including the indonesian islands and Madagascar. They are very active right now. These are likely the largest currents on Earth and the closest together producing magnetic flux between them. There is already a large gyre in the ocean, deep off the coast of Madagascar circulating between these currents. Does this mean there are catastrophic storms in our future? Damned if I know. Check what the ancients say. All I know is we  better get off the dime and understand this Earth as it really is and stop listening to the academics. Thank you all for reading.

Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info The picture of the formation, evolution and death of stars is changing with each new discovery. The Electric Universe theory has offered predictions for stellar phenomena that have proved far more successful than those of gravity-centric cosmology. Stars do not form in a process of gravitational collapse but rather they form from the electromagnetic pinch effect along vast filaments of remarkably constant width. Stars are not powered by internal thermonuclear reactions. Rather, the Sun is a positively charged electrode at the focus of incoming electrical currents. Stars do not collapse and explode when they "burn up their nuclear fuel". Rather, electric stars have internal charge separation and can relieve electrical stress by fissioning or blowing-off charged matter. In fact, the standard theory of a supernova which has never been shown to work experimentally, has grown more severely challenged with each new discovery. In November of 2017, a paper published in the journal Nature reported the observation of a star that exploded, somehow survived, then exploded again more than half a century later. A phys.org report describes the discovery as follows, "The finding, published by Nature, completely confounds existing knowledge of a star's end of life... somehow this star exploded more than half a century ago, survived, and exploded again in 2014." A co-author of the paper stated, "This supernova breaks everything we thought we knew about how they work." In part 1 of this three-part presentation, the chief science advisor to The Thunderbolts Project, physicist Wal Thornhill, will begin our discussion on the nature of stars with an examination of so-called neutron stars, hypothetical entities which were invented in the 1960's after the unexpected discovery of pulsing electromagnetic emissions in space. But as Thornhill explains, like the standard theory of supernovas, the hypothetical neutron star is a questionable proposition at best. It was argued in a recent Space News, that bizarre whirling neutron star lighthouses are not needed to produce rapidly flashing pulsar signals. Conventionally, neutron stars are believed to be the remnants of a supernova explosion but supernova explosions are said to be 'not fully understood'! Which means ― keep sending money. So, exploding stars are a good place to begin exploding theories. Neutrons are only seen to exist outside an atomic nucleus for a few minutes before they separate into an electron and a proton. So we can't just assume they can be packed closely together to form the bulk of a stable star. Insisting that neutrons exist in atomic nuclei, forces an unconvincing nuclear model upon us with positive charges held together by an ad-hoc strong nuclear force. There appears to be very strong statistical evidence that an atomic nucleus is made up of protons in a rapidly revolving geometric structure where electrons are in sufficient numbers to occupy, on average, the midpoint between pairs of protons. The attractive force to the closer electron overcomes the powerful repulsive electric force between pairs of protons. This greatly simplifies many subjects in atomic and nuclear physics. So we can forget neutron stars, they don't exist! It's far simpler and more likely to suggest that a normal stellar body subjected to abnormally high electrical stress, is the source of the steady flashing signals from pulsars. The disturbing fact is that plasma physicists have shown this both theoretically and experimentally. The electrical model of stars is real evidence-based science. Further support for the electrical model recently came from the discovery of gamma-ray flares coming from the Crab Nebula which encloses a pulsating supernova remnant only 6,500 light-years away, in the constellation Taurus. In Physical Review Letters of November the 24th, there appeared a letter titled 'Inductive spikes in the Crab Nebula - a theory of gamma-ray flares' by John Kirk and Gwenael Giacinti. They report: "The detection of powerful gamma-ray flares from the Crab Nebula by the AGILE satellite and the Large Area Telescope on the Fermi satellite has provided theorists with three major puzzles: How are particles able to emit synchrotron radiation well above the ~ 100 MeV astrophysical 'upper limit?' What is the geometry and location of the source, given that it varies on a time scale of hours, whereas the nebula has a light-crossing time of months? By which mechanism can such a small source achieve a power of only one order of magnitude less than that of the entire nebula?" On November 27th, it was reported in more popular fashion in the New Scientist under the banner, "Mysterious gamma rays in Crab Nebula traced to pulsar winds". It says and I quote: "Waves of charged particles slamming into gas and dust may be responsible for unexpected super-bright flashes in the Crab Nebula ...in 2011 two telescopes observed unusual short-lived gamma ray bursts in the Crab. These exceeded 100 MeV, hundreds of times brighter than the nebula's normal emissions. The source of the flashes was a mystery. Some suspected it had to do with the pulsar's magnetic field splitting or becoming knotted as they move away from the star and into surrounding material. Now, new research pins the gamma ray emissions on charged particles like electrons and positrons that flow from the neutron star at near light speed, like a constant breeze." Here we see the blind spot of astrophysicists toward electrical effects in space. They can't see beyond explosive winds slamming into slow-moving matter and mysterious magnetic fields which are tied in knots and magically cut and reconnected to somehow produce what are clearly electrical effects. What we are not told is that physicists in the 21st century have no physical understanding of the magnetic force, just equations! Magnetic field lines are a graphic representation and not a real thing. Magnetic field lines must always terminate at a magnetic pole. They cannot be disconnected and reconnected in empty space. The only electrical reference in the report is to the gamma ray energy measured in excess of 100 MeV. This voltage is easily exceeded across a cosmic plasma double-layer which form in a Birkeland current in a stellar or galactic circuit. But astrophysicists don't do circuits in space because they are taught electricity doesn't do anything in space. Back in 1986, the pioneering Nobel Prize winning plasma cosmologists Hannes Alfvén said, "Double layers in space should be classified as a new type of celestial object. It is tentatively suggested that x-ray and gamma-ray bursts may be due to exploding double layers. In solar flares, double layers with voltages of 10 billion Volts or even more may occur, and in galactic phenomena, we may have voltages that are several orders of magnitude larger." Alfvén was right, it is the simple mechanism behind all of the mysterious gamma-ray bursts in deep space. He explains further, "If the current density is too high, an exploding double layer may be formed. This means that in the plasma a region of high vacuum is produced: the plasma refuses to carry any current at all. At the sudden interruption of the [circuit] inductance produces enormous over- voltages, which may be destructive." The result is a high-energy flash of X-rays, gamma rays and cosmic rays. Here we see the dramatic release when a circuit breaker opens, of the electromagnetic energy stored in a long distance 500,000 volt transmission line. A voltage pulse across the opening circuit breaker, rises to millions of Volts causing a powerful arc several meters long. That same voltage pulse in the stellar circuit accelerates charged particles to energies capable of generating the observed gamma-ray flashes. It shows how a small source can achieve a power only one order of magnitude less than that of the entire nebula. The astrophysicists' conceptual blind spot is evident when we look at the explanation for the gamma-ray flashes offered by scientists where they actually describe the exploding double-layer effect without recognizing the electrical cause. "...new research pins the gamma ray emissions on charged particles like electrons and positrons that flow from the neutron star at near light speed, like a constant breeze. 'We propose that at some moments you have pockets inside this wind' where the density of electrons and positrons drops, says Gwenael Giacinti at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, Germany. Lines of electromagnetic force usually maintain a constant current. When they encounter these lower density pockets ...that current is disrupted. Some of the energy in the particles gets converted into kinetic energy, causing the electrons and positrons to accelerate and smash into the nebula's gas and dust. The effect is similar to the behavior of a circuit containing an inductor. Should the current in the circuit suddenly drop, the inductor ― which acts to smooth out the electric current ― will try to rapidly counteract the loss with a huge pulse, often resulting in a spark." The effect is not similar, it is precisely that of an exploding double layer. As for the wind with its pockets and lines of electromagnetic force maintaining a constant current, the concepts are adrift from any real physical model involving electricity supplied by a galactic circuit. Instead, the Crab Nebula is treated as an isolated, closed system. So the descriptive words are either misleading or meaningless. Of course, there is no reference in the paper to Hannes Alfvén and his 31 year old explanation for high-energy gamma-ray bursts based on the tried and tested physics of electrified plasma.

Solar System Formation, Quantum Vibration and Natural Disasters Good morning everybody! So today are we talking about a very interesting topic of solar system formation, quantum vibration and natural disaster. What motivates me into this research is mainly the topic of natural disaster. I would like to be able to predict when all those major natural disaster will occur in the future. And that leads me to understanding the connections between space weather and all the climate change and many other activities on Earth. And that also leads me to conducting more intensive research on how solar activities arise. And also go all the way into how the solar system would form. So hopefully this will be an interesting topic to discuss and be beneficial to everyone here. So I would like to start with the term simplicity. So in order for human to understand anything and be able to implement what they understand, it starts with really simple concept such as, if we understand how the bird flies we can actually imitate birds and build a flying machine. If we understand the wheel, how the wheels work, we create can create a vehicle. So in this case we want to understand how natural disasters occur and we have to use the simple concept to understand this. So what means simple? It means it's simple to be observed. Anyone can observe what I observed. Through all the perceptions that everyone has. And also in terms of natural disaster observation, it just apply simple observations such as rain, floods, tornado formations, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions. And these are natural observations. There's more artificial observations that human have come up with. Such as fluctuation of magnetic fields, electric fields and all kind of stuff which are the secondary observation that not many people can observe such change by themselves. It relies on scientific instruments. Same thing for the Sun. The natural way to observe the Sun, well, back like hundreds of years thousands of years, is (to) sunspots. And of course, using really simple instruments, scientists and astronomers can generate a sunspot index. It's called sunspot number. And that can be highly beneficial to understand the Sun, simple as that. In addition to a more complex index such as solar flares, geomagnetic storm or coronal hole, coronal mass ejections and so forth. And of course, it has to be simple to reproduce and verify it. Just like I have mentioned. It has to be natural. Something everyone can do. It's not too expensive to do it. So we don't need billions of dollars to prove something the way it is. It's just how we see things. And of course, what we see is what we get. It's a direct conclusion based on direct observations. We can also conduct physical experiments just to confirm that we understand the behavior of what we tried to observe. And of course, this is based on personal experience that began where, you know, from our child ages to now. So in order to work in the right direction, we need the right perceptions. And in order to do that I need to rely on the teaching from great philosophers and scholars around the world that's living today, in this room, as well as those, you know, that lived in the past thousands of years. And they all come to really the same conclusion when we want to observe something. That everything has to happen for a reason. They have to have cause and effects. And of course, how did you find cause and effects? In general sense, we use the term "Dependent origination", that all things arise in dependence upon multiple cause and condition. Not a single one. For example, I was born. I cannot be born by myself. I relied on my mother and my father. And of course my father and my mother cannot be born if they don't have air, food and water supplying to them. So everything depends on each other. There's no single isolated island of anything that's causing something. So everything is all-conditioned. And of course we want to study something and to be pretty much neutral or not biased. We always, we always see something in dualities, just like we see a coin. These always have two sides. And of course, we see things the way it is. Simple to say, but what I mean is, everything is subject to change. For example, this universe. The assumption that this universe is electrically neutral is also impermanent. Same thing for an electrical bias. It's also impermanent. There's nothing really constant or staying the same way without changing. And of course, since everything is conditioned, there's no something dictating everything ultimately. So there's no true essence in what we actually observe and that, in general sense, is called concept non-self. So next... Okay, so now we go to the topic of quantum vibration. The simple concept of this term. I refer to the minimum amount of physical entity involved in an interaction. So in in this case, what we can do in this universe is all about changing. Depending on what we are actually looking at and pay attention to, there's always at least two states that we can define of what we observed. For example, if we look at charge, we can see positive charge and negative charge. If we want to look at electricity, there are electromagnetic and electrostatic. You want to study wave, there's two type of waves. There's transverse wave and longitude wave. If you want to look at (how) matter movements, it can be perceived as contractions or expansions and also can arise from chaos into order and vice versa. And this is just some example of what you can see and perceive in reality. And all this exists in all state of matter; plasma, gas, liquid, and solid. And of course, all these properties exist in space or someone can call this vacuum. It's an ever-changing environment. So next we're going to the main concept of this presentation. So I need to get, obtain some guidance from one (of the) great scholar here, which is Nikola Tesla. One of his quotes is, "If you want to find the secrets of the universe, (we) think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration." And of course, in this conference we refer energy, want to focus on electrical energy. So we're going into the, the first experiment of how we try to create a plasma ball, okay, using electrical potential. This is a brute force way to create a plasma ball so we can learn and understand how we, how the plasma behaves as a spherical shape. So in this case we have a tube, vacuum tube. We supply 9 kilo-volts AC power into the one electrode at the center, and there's one side on another plate. And then we start by vacuum the tube out so we create an easy condition to produce plasma. So from here just pay attention to the video here. So the power is already supplied to this tube and of course, once the condition is right you have a plasmasphere created in the center of the chamber. So this looks very much like the Sun. But of course, the Sun has more complex behavior than this. So one I want, the one I want to show you is, you can see the plume that's showing up here? And that's, kind of, similar way that we observed in this plasma ball. So the point I'm trying to make here is that, if you wait a little bit longer, we want to change the conditions surrounding this plasma ball and see how the plasma ball behave according to this change. In this case we leak the air, you can leak the air inside this plasma ball, this plasma chamber. And if you wait a little bit more, you'll notice something change to this sphere. So right now, it's not changing yet. Let's keep observing a little bit. Now started to change. See how activities start to increase so that's when we have more massive gas leaking into the system (and) so the different plasma density in the chamber. And you could also notice the uniform glow at the edge of the plate. So from here we go into conclusion. This is just not the whole complete picture of the Sun but I, the point I try to make here is that the Sun is not the Sun by itself. The activity of the Sun was not dictated from the thing that's come from inside. But in this case it does have the outside influence of the activity. So during, the high vacuum pressure chamber, it looks like high solar activity. And there's more filaments like it because there's more gas inside. It's more electrical discharge, activities become more frequent. And of course, you have more magnetic fields -- you have more currents. And this called is solar maximum, in pinyin, of course and of course we produce high X-ray emissions, more frequency and of course high number of sunspots. On the other hand, in doing the low vacuum pressure, the plasma will become more uniform and it's really similar to the low solar activity cycles. And it looks they have less filament- like electrical discharge activities, weaker magnetic field, all those flux lines are less present. Would be, we can define as a strong electric activity. Solar minimum, low X-ray emission. So of course, in this we find a low number of sunspots. So this is going to one of the factors that I actually used for understanding how this plasma density affects the Sun as well as the Earth in general. So next slide... Of course, if you want to compare this to the outer edge of the solar system, this is what I believe, something using a really cheap way to generate it. It looks like a heliopause to me. I believe, this is very similar to what Ralph Juergens maybe had visualized, maybe. And he, what he said is the Sun itself is the focus of cosmic electrical discharge. So we just do just that. But this is a brute force way to fuse the plasma into the center of the sphere. And of course, there's more efficient way to do that. It's the resonance system So now we move through... going through more factor details of how we can create a system that mimic the Sun through quantum vibrations. Now, I introduced the terms frequency and vibration. And of course to do, to understand this and maybe hard to do in plasma, plasma medium. I choose to learn this type of behavior from the work from dr. Hans Jenny, which is, what he does is, he made an experiment on a membrane full of very fine powder. He put acoustic wave perpendicular to this mat diaphragme so it created vibrations on this diaphragme. So from here, you start to see that material started to condense at the center of the things and you see it looks spherical, just like the Sun. And of course, if you zoom inside, you start to see circulations, convection that is occurring in this half-sphere shape. If you look carefully, you see that kind of look like nanoflares as well. And of course, once we increase the frequency, the sphere cannot sustain by just being, remaining static, it starts to spin. And of course, once the frequency changes, there's an alteration in frequency, you start to see eruptions. Some chaotic process going on in the sphere. It could happen over a short period of time as well. And of course, the spin can change when the frequency changes. And of course anyone (who) interested in learning more about this video, you can find it on YouTube. So from here, we learn the properties of what happened in space using the vibration of sound. And I will tie this later back to how the electric properties work later on. So in this case we look at internal behavior of this sphere. We started to observe that through quantum vibrations, its arising of the spherical shape with circulation and convection properties. And if you look at the Sun, we see this acting the same way. We see meridional circulations inside the Sun. And of course it has, this things seem to have explosion and ejection. It's really similar to the way the Sun behaves, that is, having active regions and coronal mass ejection. So I believe what happened is there are some frequencies that tie into such activities of the Sun. And if you look into external behavior, we see that the sun spins, just like the way this spherical ball had rotation. And of course it produces, it seems like ejecting mass, just like the Sun does. And of course, it looks like a Parker spiral in the larger scale. And this can be compared to one of the ALMA telescope that observed the red giant star R Sculptoris. Of course, last but not least, one of the properties that we can observe is standing wave. And this is the mode that I would like to talk about today and this mode really resembles the orbital plane of the solar system. And if you want to look back into time to other star systems, you start to see a resonant ring that was observed in HL Tauri protoplanetary disk. And of course, we go into conclusion here. Observations Of course, changing vibration frequency creates various types of activities That's applied to objects in space. Such activity matches with the characteristic of the Sun and the solar system, part of it. And of course, organisation of matters is resulting of vacuum vibration. It could be done at resonant frequency, so that's how we reinforce the energy into condensing it into the matter. You can call that order arising from chaos. And of course, energy used to create and sustain the sphere alone, ultimately comes from the surrounding. And of course, there's two types of wave patterns that we can observe from the previous experiments. One is a spin which is a spiral wave and the other is a standing wave. And I will pay more attention to the standing wave behavior. So such standing wave behavior can be observed by experiment. Simple experiment just as this one which is plasma discharge tube. So by having vacuum and producing ejecting high-voltage into the electrodes, you start to see columns of plasma. And that looks pretty much like a subperiodic structure when it starts to stabilize. So now it will become stabilized in the video. You start to see a lot of columns just like we observed in the HL Tauri protoplanetary disc. So next, we extend this understanding but it may be a little harder to do in plasma so we go back to solid prop, solid model using soundwave again. So now we take a look at how we can create organized system using soundwave. And this is a, this is experiment called center, Circular Centered Chladni Plate which you can check online as well. So in this case we have a plate, a solid plate. A center of it ties to the speaker below. It puts a lot of small particles. As we change the frequency, those particles they automatically organize around the center of the focus point. And this looks pretty much like the Asteroid belt. So by increasing the frequency, you start to see that the matter or that scattering around this plate start to be more fine and create a more defined circle. Such as the one shown here. So the more frequency you put in, the more rings it creates. So it, for me it looks pretty much like our solar system. So we move to the next slide. More three-dimensional wheel relies on Argonne National Labs using acoustic levitation. In this case of course, we see that, put a spherical foam and it seems like it's suspended over the air. So you see, notice the vibration that occur in these spheres. Of course, the sphere will be in the node where it's the most stable. And of course, it moves with frequencies. So it looks pretty much like our Solar System. In our case we want to study about how the Sun translates power, transmits power into the Earth. And of course, if it looks really similar to these things, what we should observe is that, if the Sun vibrates then the planets will vibrate. Simple as that. But what kind of vibration is this? We talk, we all talk about longitude wave for all along. So I want to continue in this mode of propagation so we construct a model of resonant coupling in the solar system. We assume the Sun is the center of solar system and of course, through standing wave effects the Earth's probably in the third node of vibration. So we assumed the distance is about 149,600,000 kilometers away and assume this mode of propagation travels about speed of light so that's eight times, 3 times (eight) 10 to the power of 8 m/s. So that turns out to be about 3 mHz of vibration. So what's important about this frequency? If we take a look at the helioseismic activity, this is using GOLF instrument. This instrument is installed in Soho, so what we measure is the p-mode. It's acoustic pressure wave of the Sun at the surface of the Sun. And at that time the scientists wanted to look into interior of the Sun and what they have found is the resonant frequency of such mode occurs right around 3 mHz. And in general terms, few physicists like to call this "5 minute oscillation". So, and of course what happened on Earth? It might be really difficult to detect such frequency vibration. It has to be excited to a large event such as earthquake. So in this case, we look at the earthquakes. The great Chilean earthquake happened in 1960. And of course, what we observed is about the same frequency spectrum occur when the earthquakes occur. So we have helioseismic monitoring station spread across the globe and measuring the, how the Earth is vibrating according to the stimulation. And we found one of the fundamental modes falls between 1 to 5 mHz. And of course, such vibration doesn't end here. It goes into the comet as well. In comet Hale-Bopp, scientists have observed interaction of comets with the surrounding plasma right around the same frequency. In this case, the coma will have the same vibration frequency around about 3, 2 to 3 mHz. Actually, it should be like 2 to about 4 mHz with the center around this frequency. So next, if we understand that how vibrations actually interact, I mean how the energy interacts, among the objects in space in the solar system, we should be able to construct a model of energy transmission based on resonance system. So it relies on Tesla invention. One of the power transmission of his patent, it's filed in May 15, 1900. So it consist of two spheres, two balls of spheres, conductive spheres, inside can be dielectrics. And of course, it ties to great spiral, to the pole of this thing. So we call this the Sun and the Earth. And of course, by having a generator tied to the primary, start to see, I can, I did a laboratory experiment on this. So in this case we have the generator. We should see it at the center of this video here. I cannot simulate 3 milliHertz vibration so I use 3 megahertz, about 1 billion times higher in frequency. 50% duty cycle is in an square wave and of course, this thing connected to the primary side of the transformer which in this case can represent something coming out from the galactic, from the galaxy. Of course, there's a spiral, flat spiral core connected to the core of the sphere. And of course one side goes into the secondary and go to the pole of another sphere. And of course, we tap the power from the outside core. And that's go to a LEDs. In this case I use 6 LEDs. Please notice the brightness of the LEDs because we're gonna do some, playing some interaction gears. There's 4 different types of things you can do with the system to modulate the power. One is to modulate the potential or power of this generator. Second, see the LEDs when we change the frequency. Of course this LED doesn't light up. It's only lit up when it's peaked. So at resonance. At 3 megahertz. At other resonant frequency, at other frequency it doesn't match with this characteristic. So another way to modulate the power is to detune the capacitor which is the spherical ball here. I used my hand as a demonstration. So when I have a hand or something that moves approaching this spherical ball, you see the LEDs start to dim. So it can modulate the power of the transmitter side. For example with this ball, if hand represented a CME, it passed through the Earth, you start to see fluctuation of these LED lights as well. So this ball can represent an open plate capacitor. If you have some secondary effects, secondary plate will be formed automatically in space. And of course, it can be outer from, from the external environment. From all these observations... So four major approaches to modulate Earth's electrical environment. One is to modulate the entire solar system, galactic generator amplitudes. Second is to modulate the galactic generator frequency and that ties to how, (to) the variation of 11-year solar cycle. The third is to change plasma environments around the local generator sphere, it's called Sun. Either through celestial body passage, just like how the comet approaches the Sun... Of course, we also observed some heliocentric planetary alignments seem to have some effects on solar activities. As well as other types of alignments of bodies in space. And the third, sorry, the fourth is the change in the plasma environment in the local receiver sphere through wave propagations. One is the longitude and transverse wave We can also have particles propagation that modulates the upper atmosphere such as coronal mass ejection and solar wind. And also of course, if there's a heliocentric alignment, they have to be geocentric alignments. Because the Earth is considered another resonant cavity And of course of some significance, celestial body passage could affect some electrical properties around the Earth. So that's called a local change in plasma environment. From here, and this is another just something I ensure you that when the comets approach the Sun, of course you got the eruption occur. So I believe this is something due to the cavity being detuned due to the plasma environment change, so just like the way I put my hand close to the spherical ball so the capacitor is detuned, the whole circuit is detuned. So from all these observations, now all the properties allow all types of plasma waves to exist in space in addition to an electromagnetic one; which is electrostatic and of course the thing that I want to address is the one that has no magnetic field. So for the electromagnetic wave propagation it's called B, vector B here, is none for electromagnetics or light wave. But for the electrostatics now, there something exists that could explain a lot of phenomenons which cannot be explained using conventional understanding such as Ion acoustic wave, Plasma oscillation. And I believe this exists in space as well. And I'm going to show you some evidence of existence of such wave in terms of, the connection with natural disaster, the thing I've been done in the past 6 years. First we go to the case study of the Nepal earthquake, magnitude of 7.8, occured on March 21st, sorry March 25th 2015. During that time, if you track the sunspot number, we see that the sunspots reach 10 weeks local maximum. On March 19, approximately. March 20 or 19. And of course, we observed changing climates during that time. Those who live in equator attract, the temperature during the time is extremely hot. Near equator, about 24 to 48 hours before the earthquakes. And those who have observed such thing, they know that earthquakes have a strong ties to sudden change in the weather. Of course, in the inner epicenter we see extreme cold and windy condition. If you ask the Nepal people, before, right before the earthquakes. If you look in space, what we see is a strong coronal mass ejection occuring between March 20 to March 23rd. We've got M4 X-ray flares on March 21st. And of course, low level of geomagnetic storm. If we understand such connection, that geomagnetic storm can be either ineffective in terms of understanding the disconnection. And of course during that time we observed geocentric alignment between Earth, Mercury and Mars. We look into the timelines of how this natural disaster arise. We start from April 21st. We observed non-Earth-directed coronal mass ejection. So again, the coronal mass ejection in this model is a symptom of a fluctuation in resonant frequency. It's happened to be right at the peak of the sunspot. So it highlighted in the arrow area here. Of course, during a time we have a Nepal foreshock magnitude of 5.1 earthquakes, we have a great volcanic eruption in Chile, largest eruption in many years, and of course (we) followed by another CMEs. You can see that all this events happen almost simultaneously. Just like a travel at speed of light. And of course, about 3 days later we observed the main shock, earthquake in Nepal magnitude of 7.8. A 3 days period, it matches with the speed of the solar wind travel from the Sun to the Earth. So the next case study is one of the really famous case. It's a Japan earthquake between March 7 to March 11, 2011. What's special about this case is that if you look at the sunspot number graph on the top, you see that's the highest sunspot number in the last two years. And it's also not only that. It rise up rapidly almost expensed exponentially in the past 30 days. So this is highly significant events to pay attention to. And it reached the maximum on March 8th. During March 7, of course, we see a massive coronal mass ejection as well as we see expansion of coronal holes starting from March 7 through March 10. If many of us have read some literature, we also see ionospheric heating around this time- frame before the earthquakes in Japan. Of course, there's a foreshock, happens almost simultaneously within the day of the high solar activity events in terms of sunspots. You see Japan foreshock around 7.1 magnitudes and then about 3 days later you got a main shock of earthquakes. Magnitude's 9.1. So again, it matches with the speed of solar wind. But again, if we pay attention only to the direction of CMEs, some must may have missed such an opportunity to predict the earthquake. And the last but not least is if something happened during the maximum, there's always something going to happen during the minimum. In this case, on December 23rd between December 23rd 24th, 2004, sunspot has switch to 10 weeks extreme minimum. Around December 17 to December 28. If we look at the coronal mass ejection, it became the most extreme and the most intense on the 23rd of December. Again, it's not (an) Earth-directed CME. And of course, if we looked into the coronal hole data, you see a sudden expansion of coronal holes facing the Earth during that time. And it started around the 24th of December. You zoom into the graph, you see the same thing, same pattern repeated. You got CME precursor, global foreshock occuring on the 23rd and of course the main shock followed two and a half days later. So we've got two effects here. One is a simultaneous reaction between the Sun and the Earth, pretty much approaching the speed of light, and the other is the propagation that takes about 2 to 4 days afterward. So conclusion here is that I propose a theory of quantum vibrations and in relation to solar system formation. Such theory may help explain various characteristics of the Sun and its surrounding space as well as understanding how the Earth interacts with the surrounding. The evidence of quantum vibration can be found in helio-seismic activities and geo-seismic activities as well as in comet interaction with Solar wind. Of course, it suggests that the longitude wave is, exists in space in both vacuum and plasma. And there's an engineer that has proved that the speed of light, the longitude wave has trouble at speed of light which are going to be mentioned later in the next slide. And of course the earthquake, I'm talking about a very strong significant earthquake, or high frequency earthquake that happened during one, some days. It seems to be a direct evidence of longitude energy vibration in space. And of in course longitude power coupling, strong earthquake can occur without the presence of geometric storm. And it solved the mystery of why we see strong earthquake when there's no geomagnetic storm in some cases. I would like to (give) thanks to The Thunderbolts Project for providing me the opportunity to present this work and Mitch Battros who's the first person who made me aware of the connection through his website -- Natural disaster reports.

And thank you very much for your attention! 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info The myth of an electrically sterile universe is dead. Only those who paid little attention to discovery could think otherwise. But close attention must be paid indeed since institutional science has made no attempt to contextualize the development as significant. As we've reported many times, electric currents in space, long verboten in the astronomical literature, is now acknowledged with increasing frequency at all scales of cosmic investigation. Scientific papers propose that colossal electric currents flow through the light years long jets exploding from active galactic nuclei. Some radio astronomers estimate the strength of such an electric current as comparable to a trillion bolts of lightning. In our own solar system the electric currents that connect the gas giant Saturn and Jupiter to their respective moons is also now recognized in science literature. However, like the spectacular electromagnetic cosmic jets, space scientists heretofore have always proposed that the electric currents are the result of strange magneto-fluidic processes. Yet rather than affirming these interpretations, finer technological data increasingly challenges standard theory while confirming the Electric Universe prediction of electrical circuitry connecting the bodies in our solar system. In fact, the Saturnian moon Enceladus displays some of the most dramatic electrical discharge activities seen on rocky bodies in our solar system today. Well over a decade ago, prior to the arrival of NASA's Cassini spacecraft at Saturn, planetary scientists had expected Enceladus to be "geologically dead". Instead they found explosive filamentary jets shooting material at tremendous velocities up to hundreds of kilometers from the moon's surface. Adding to the surprise, the jets were seen at the moon's South Pole, the last place they expected such activity. As reported by space.com in 2005, "The finding flipped everything scientists knew about Enceladus on its head, because what should have been a dead moon appeared to be geologically active and what was supposed to be the moon's coldest region turned out to be its warmest." Astronomer John Spencer said of the discovery, "This is as astonishing as if we'd flown past Earth and found that Antarctica was warmer than the Sahara." Since their discovery, scientists have interpreted the features as so-called 'ice-geysers' which they view as a form of cryovolcanism probably resulting from Saturn's gravitational forces producing tidal heating within the moon. Over a decade ago, Cassini's plasma spectrometer discovered evidence for electric currents in the jets that compose the plumes of water and dust. In recent years, a number of papers have been written on the presence of negatively charged dust grains in the so-called plumes. Today, scientists studying data from the Cassini spacecraft are reporting that the electrical circuitry connecting Enceladus and Saturn is more "powerful and dynamic than conventional theory had proposed." The NASA press release from July 9, 2018, states, "New research from NASA's Cassini spacecraft's up-close Grand-Finale orbits shows a surprisingly powerful and dynamic interaction of plasma waves moving from Saturn to its rings and its moon Enceladus. The observations show for the first time that the waves travel on magnetic field lines connecting Saturn directly to Enceladus. The field lines are like an electrical circuit between the two bodies, with energy flowing back and forth." Planetary scientist Ali Sulaiman says of the findings, "Enceladus is this little generator going around Saturn, and we know it is a continuous source of energy. Now we find that Saturn responds by launching signals in the form of plasma waves, through the circuit of magnetic field lines connecting it to Enceladus hundreds of thousands of miles away." It remains the position of planetary scientists that cryo-volcanic activity on Enceladus releases the spectacular filamentary plumes which then become ionized. However, when we consider the latest scientific data and juxtapose the respective predictions and interpretations of standard theory versus those of the Electric Universe, we see a consistent and stunning victory for the electrical viewpoint. Consider first a scientific paper published earlier this year based on data from the Cassini Langmuir probe which suggests that negatively charged dust grains have previously "blocked the signal of the powerful electric currents in the Enceladus jets." For a number of years Standard Theory has proposed that electrically neutral water molecules are ejected from the moon's surface where UV rays from the Sun and interactions with plasma in Saturn's magnetosphere strips electrons from the water molecules forming positively charged water ions. In theory, these ions are then free to be "picked up" and merged with co-rotating plasma, supposedly generating an electric current. Cassini scientists had estimated the strength of the jets' electric currents based on disturbances to Cassini's magnetometer instrument. But as noted in the summary of a scientific paper in the Journal of Geophysical Research, "...when Cassini flew through the icy plume, its instruments sent back vastly different readings. According to the craft's Langmuir probe, which measures particle density, there were enough ions present to generate a current of 10 million amps. The magnetometer indicated a current more than 20 times weaker." The authors provide experimental evidence that ions like those in the Enceladus plume are, "attracted and trapped within the sheaths of negatively charged dust grains." They conclude that, "Cassini's Langmuir probe is measuring the entire ion population (free and trapped ions), while the Cassini magnetometer detects the magnetic perturbations associated with pickup currents from the smaller population of free ions, with this distinction possibly reconciling the ongoing debate in the literature on the ion density in the plume." Simply put, these results are anomalous for the standard "pick up ions model" but they are expected if the surface of Enceladus is being etched by electrical discharge machining. As physicist Wal Thornhill has always proposed, "Electrical discharge machining works by stripping electrons from high points on a surface. In this process on Enceladus, positive ions generated on the surface are heated by electric discharge and electrostatically attracted to follow the electrons into space. This does in fact explain the high loading of positive ions that the Langmuir probe measured. Let us also consider the hypothetical processes that planetary scientists must invoke to try to explain the explosive plumes generation. Given the icy cold temperatures of the moon at its vast distance, nearly 900 million miles from the Sun, it seems preposterous to suggest that solar warming could produce the plumes. So it's believed that Saturn's gravitational influence produces tidal heating within the moon creating the explosive outbursts. However, science discovery continues to challenge the tidal heating explanation both for Enceladus as well as for the so-called volcanism on Jupiter's moon Io. In 2013, scientists reported that the locations of the so-called volcanic plumes on Io are completely incompatible with the moon's internal heat signatures. The lead author of a study on the finding stated that it "...can't be reconciled with any existing solid body tidal heating models." Likewise, on Enceladus, in 2016 scientists were amazed to discover that when the so-called geysers on the moon are producing the most water and dust the accompanying gas output was anomalously low. As reported by space.com in 2016, "The researchers expected quite a lot more gas expelled at the far part of Enceladus's orbit, to help explain the outpouring of dust, but they found the gas output had bumped up by just 20%, far less than expected." The leader of the study said of the findings, "We had thought the amount of water vapor in the overall plume, across the whole south polar area, was being strongly affected by tidal forces from Saturn. Instead, we find that the small-scale jets are what's changing." A recent article by Thunderbolts Picture Of the Day managing editor Stephen Smith succinctly summarizes perhaps the most obvious objection to the tidal heating model, "Although the South Pole of Enceladus is warmer than 'it should be' it is still 261 below zero Celsius... So-called 'tidal kneading' from Saturn fails because the theory has no explanation for why the effect is limited to the southern hemisphere." A fundamental challenge to conventional theory is the belief that celestial bodies cannot carry net electrical charge separation. The Electric Universe however, recognizes charged bodies that are connected via electrical circuits across the vastest cosmic distances. The electrical connection of the sun to the planets is one of the great and ongoing surprises of the Space Age. It is a concept that was proposed well over a century ago by the electrical pioneer Kristian Birkeland, a concept that was confirmed by the discovery of Birkeland currents in the Earth's upper atmosphere which power the earthly Auroras. More recently, over a decade ago, while investigating the Northern Lights, NASA's THEMIS spacecraft made the completely unexpected discovery of so-called magnetic ropes which rapidly form and unravel and are connected to intense auroral displays on Earth. Nearly a decade later, in 2016, scientists reported their first-ever observation of similar magnetic ropes traversing the 880 million miles between the Sun and Saturn and connecting the two bodies. The lead author of a paper in the Geophysical Research Letters said of the findings, "Contrary to previous ideas about Saturn's magnetosphere being unlike its terrestrial counterpart, these findings reveal that Saturn at times behaves and interacts with the sun in much the same way as Earth." The term 'magnetic ropes' is used to describe twisted filamentary pathways traversed by charged particles. We have suggested many times that such terminology is misleading and inappropriate. The so-called 'magnetic ropes' stretching from the Sun to Saturn are electrical Birkeland currents. The rope-like form is the structure taken by current flow due to the long-range attraction and short-range repulsion between current filaments. As outlined in numerous episodes, in recent years professor Donald Scott has developed an original mathematical modeling of a Birkeland current whose structure is identified visually as counter-rotating coaxial cylinders of current filaments. It is then not a coincidence that this counter-rotation is clearly seen at the north poles of both Saturn and Jupiter. The electrical interaction between Saturn and Enceladus may be comparable to that between a comet and the sun. Comet jets, like the plumes on Enceladus, are electrical discharge phenomena that heat and eject surface material. In fact, over a decade ago scientists were astonished to discover a "comet-like chemistry" to the material in the Enceladus plumes. As Cassini investigator Hunter Waite stated, "A completely unexpected surprise is that the chemistry of Enceladus, what's coming out from inside, resembles that of a comet." But like the jets of comets, the matter is coming from the surface and not the interior. It has always been the position of the Electric Universe that water molecules detected in cometary comas is the result of electrochemical processes. A fact which resolves how desiccated rocky comet nuclei can still produce prodigious amounts of water, sometimes even at great distances from the sun. We note again the recent NASA press release which states, "...plasma waves travel on magnetic field lines connecting Saturn directly to Enceladus. The field lines are like an electrical circuit between the two bodies, with energy flowing back and forth." Electric currents in filamentary jets exploding from Enceladus's surface, electric circuits connecting Saturn and Enceladus, electric currents over hundreds of millions of miles connecting Saturn and the sun. Such dynamic electrical interactions between the sun, the planets and the planets' moons were never anticipated in gravity- centric cosmology but they are only to be expected in our Electric Universe. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project at Thunderbolts.info. In 2014, astronomers puzzled over the unprecedented discovery of an asteroid with its own ring system. The asteroid Chariklo, which is 250 kilometers in diameter, and orbits between Saturn and Uranus, displays two rings that are said to be similar in nature to those of Saturn. The leader of a 2014 study said of the discovery, "We weren't looking for a ring and didn't think small bodies like Chariklo had them at all, so the discovery -- and the amazing amount of detail we saw in the system -- came as a complete surprise!" Today, scientists performing computer simulations are suggesting that only two possibilities can account for the continued existence of Chariklo's perplexing rings. They say that either the particles, composing the rings, are much smaller than models have predicted or that a hypothetical shepherd satellite around the asteroid must be gravitationally stabilizing the rings. In fact, the scientists are surprised that the rings haven't already disintegrated since their simulations suggest a much shorter life. A Phys.org report on the team's research states, "...the density of the ring particles must be less than half the density of Chariklo itself. Their results also showed that a striped pattern, known as 'self- -gravity wakes,' forms in the inner ring due to interactions between the particles. These self-gravity wakes accelerate the breakup of the ring. The team recalculated the expected lifetime of Chariklo's rings, based on their results, and found it to be only 1 to 100 years, much shorter than previous estimates. This is so short that it's surprising the ring is still there." Chariklo is a member of a family of asteroids, between the orbits of Saturn and Uranus, called the Centaurs. In the past, the Centaurs have occasionally surprised scientists with their comet-like behaviors and created some confusion as to their classification as either asteroids or comets. The Electric Universe theory has always stated that the only real difference between comets and asteroids are their respective orbits and both can discharge electrically when moving through regions of changing electric potential. This theory, as proposed by the chief principals of The Thunderbolts Project, also states that comets, asteroids and meteoroids were recently electrically torn from planetary surfaces. The late astronomer Tom Van Flandern proposed his own theory of the birth of comets and asteroids suggesting they are the remains of an exploded planet. Van Flandern argued that the characteristics of the orbits of asteroids, particularly those between Mars and Jupiter in the Asteroid Belt, show all of the features of material having been recently ejected into space. Van Flandern made the seemingly outrageous prediction that asteroids would tend to have natural satellites. It was almost universally dismissed by astronomers. However, in more recent years, many asteroids have been found to have their own moons. In the case of Chariklo, physicist Wal Thornhill has agreed with the notion that the asteroid likely has shepherd satellites maintaining the rings. Astronomers have assumed that the material, composing the rings, was removed from the asteroid by a violent collision. But the kind of fine dust in the rings is not what one would expect from a mechanical collision. Indeed, as reported in this series, in more recent years scientists have increasingly acknowledged electrostatic dust-raising events on both comets and asteroids. Nevertheless, the cometary behavior of some asteroids continues to pose a great mystery for astronomers. In 2013 the asteroid P/2013 P5 astonished investigators when it suddenly sprouted six comet-like tails, forcing scientists to eventually reclassify the asteroid as a main-belt comet. Researchers suggested that the force of sunlight, hitting the asteroid, may have caused a mysterious and sudden increase in its spin rate, causing dust material to fly off into space. It was then suggested that radiation was able to "stretch and confine the removed material into tale-like forms." However, both the machining of the dust from the asteroid and its confinement into comet tails could more easily be explained as electrical discharge phenomena. Chariklo's ring system has led to the reinforcement of the idea that the dust material in the rings might eventually coalesce into a small moon. But the notion, of colliding particles accreting into planetary sized bodies, has never been shown to work. In fact, experiments on earth suggest that collisions will tend to disintegrate material exceeding mere centimeters. Indeed, among the many problems with the collisional theory of the formation of moons; if the satellites in our solar system were formed by collisions, one would expect to find a neat gradation of their properties. However, the respective satellites of the gas giants Saturn and Jupiter are so different that it seems doubtful they were formed in the same way and by the same body. It is surely telling that the consensus story of the origins and behaviors of asteroids and comets continues to be challenged by science discovery. The evidence simply does not support the notion that these bodies are billions of years old, tracing back to the solar system's infancy. But how many asteroid and comet mysteries will be resolved if scientists will finally entertain a recent catastrophic history of our solar system?

Welcome to the Electricity of Life, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info The connection of the mind to the body is an arena of constantly growing scientific investigation. To an unprecedented degree, mainstream medicine today acknowledges that the mind has a profound effect on one's physical well-being. The mind affects matter, whether it's the so-called placebo effect where the mere belief that a person has taken a particular drug causes a physical benefit, to the increasingly evident impact of emotional stress on physical organisms and individual cells. However, as mainstream science acknowledges, the very nature and source of the mind itself remains a mystery. A remarkable scientist who has explored the mind-body connection is Dawson Church, the author of dozens of scientific papers as well as the recent book 'Mind to Matter' which suggests vast untapped abilities of the mind to affect healing. In part one of this two-part interview, we asked Dawson to begin with an introduction to his earlier book entitled 'The Genie in Your Genes' which presents voluminous scientific evidence that thoughts and intentions can trigger one's genes with potentially great consequence to one's health. Well, I became interested in energy healing at an early age and when I was 15 I joined a spiritual community and began to learn tools like meditation, like energy medicine and in that community I saw some really remarkable rapid healings occur. But I always thought about energy medicine, energy healing, as being a very fringe endeavor. And so, in the 1990s, 1980s it was regarded as being part of complementary and alternative medicine or CAM, C.A.M. and there was no real thought that CAM could ever become part of the medical mainstream. We knew the medical mainstream involved things like drugs and surgery, interventions by skilled medical professionals and there was no real place for CAM in conventional medicine. But what we had happen in the late 1990s is, scientists turned their attention to using some other tools developed for diagnosis to looking at altered states of consciousness. And so we, for example, for the first time found at altered states of consciousness. And so we, for example, for the first time found people meditating, getting put inside MRIs or having EEGs attached to their heads and actually I was actually reading things like brain waves that were the result of consciousness and awareness, consciousness should send in energy. And what we found as we used these modern methods, was that a lot was happening that enhanced the bodies of those kinds of people. So at a certain point, I moved from psychological research looking at anxiety, depression, PTSD, to biological research. And around 2008, 2009, I began to look deep into what was happening inside the body when people shift their state. And so I wrote this book The Genie in Your Genes about the epigenetics of personal change, how when you change your consciousness, you're literally shifting gene expression inside your cells and this is easy to prove. When I wrote the book, there was no direct proof of this but there was lots of indirect proof of this because for example when you get scared or startled or frightened your adrenaline level rises and there is a gene that codes for adrenaline, a gene that codes for cortisol, but when you then go and tell your best friend or your wife or your husband about being scared or startled or frightened, say you had a bad experience at work and you had a high level of cortisol, high level of adrenaline in response to a threat at work. Now you're telling your spouse about this after you get back from work, and your adrenaline is now rising again. So there's no direct threat to you at this point, only a shifted awareness, only emotion, only a sense of changing your consciousness, changing your energy to relive that threat, but your body is now taking that imaginary situation as though it was real threat and producing those same stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. So I did the first large-scale randomized controlled trials actually a triple blind randomized controlled trial published in the oldest medical journal in the U.S. and it showed that when you use an acupressure based technique, EFT, that in one hour you're literally bringing the levels of those stress hormones down far more than talk therapy or simply resting. And so that was really a landmark study showing that indirectly I was showing that we're changing the gene expression because we're changing the byproducts of gene expression like cortisol and adrenaline. I then went to study a step deeper than that and actually looked at gene expression and with the conclusion of the human genome project, we now have tools that allow us to much less expensively sequence genetic sequences and actually see what's happening, which genes are being turned and which genes are being turned off. So I worked with a group of veterans, people mostly Vietnam veterans, some Iraq veterans, Afghanistan veterans, and we looked at their levels of gene expression before and after ten sessions of this acupressure based technique EFT. And we found that their levels of anxiety dropped, depression dropped hugely, their levels of PTSD, their levels of symptoms like flashbacks and nightmares, intrusive thoughts and so on, all of these things dropped dramatically, over 50% over those 10 sessions. We hit pay dirt, we found that their genes actually were shifting dramatically, several of their genes to do with stress, to do with inflammation, to do with the byproducts of the metabolic signatures of stress were being shifted by this psychological intervention, so now as you change your mind, as you change your awareness, as you change your emotional response, as you use an effective therapy like EFT to get rid of those emotions so you're telling the story of the terrible experiences in Afghanistan or Iraq or civilian ones like a car crash or a divorce, so now you're telling all those same stories to people but they're no longer laden with emotion and so now your body is no longer getting that epigenetic signal to make those stress hormones. So those veterans then, after those 10 sessions were telling those stories, remembering those events and they were no longer triggering those stress genes and so that has led to a several other studies like that. The big take-home message of this was that, as you shift your awareness, as you lower your stress level, you're literally turning genes on and off in your body. And in the gene, in your genes, I map that whole process from start to finish, how both actual threats cause changes in gene expression and imaginary experiences like meditation. Meditate for a while and you shift your gene expression. Do EFT, you shift gene expression, do Yoga, do Qigong, take a walk in nature, any of these things are literally turning genes on and off and as we've used these elaborate tools like MRIs and EEGs to look at how much, we're finding that the answer is, a huge amount, that we're not seeing trivial or minor shifts in gene expression, we're not seeing trivial or minor shifts in brainwave activity. We're seeing major shifts, radical shifts in the way the brain processes information based purely on these energy and consciousness techniques. So, that work in the 'Gene in your Genes' made an argument really early in 2004, but the newer editions now have many studies showing directly that our awareness, our consciousness, our energy level, our way of seeing the world, our worldview, our mental picture of reality, all of these things are turning genes on and off. I will leave you with one of the final studies, an amazing study, and it shows the cumulative effect of this which you see in longevity. So people make a lot of little choices in their lives; should I drink tea or coffee this morning, should I get up on the left or the right side of the bed, and you know, those choices are minor but when those choices are about emotion, when those choices are about spirituality, when those choices are about stress, they may seem minor. Just that five minutes you spent obsessing about the bad thing, some of the things last week might seem like a trivial thing, but cumulatively over a year and then five and ten and twenty years, they make an enormous difference to your gene expression which shows up in the form of longevity and so this one really stunning study I talked about, shows that optimists, people who think positively, people who have a positive worldview, people who see others in a positive light, optimists live on average eight years longer than pessimists, that's the cumulative effect of all that negative thinking. Think negatively for a moment, you don't see any big change, think negatively for a lifetime and you get eight years less on it, so these are the profound shifts that these kinds of emotional states are producing epigenetically in ourselves. The scientific evidence that thoughts and emotions affect one's genes carries another extraordinary ramification that genetic changes caused by emotional trauma might be passed on to future generations. That study, showing that emotional trauma is intergenerational is stunning, because we always thought that if a bad thing happened to me well, it was going to affect me, it might produce PTSD, it might produce trauma in me, but how could that really be passed along to my kids or my grandkids because they're  going to have a fresh set of genes, going to be born with these genes that are unaffected by that. But in the study of Holocaust survivors, this is the first big study done in the late 1990s, they found that the gene expression patterns of the children of Holocaust survivors looked similar to those, mirrored those of actual Holocaust survivors. We've now shown in animal studies with rats and mice that those kinds of epigenetic tags we passed along for seven generations so we're now realizing that stress and trauma is not something that affects just one generation of people, that affects people in a limited way locally. We're realizing that it affects them over time and they then literally pass these epigenetic molecular markers onto their children and their grandchildren. A parallel field of investigation to the mind-body connection is the study of consciousness itself. We asked Dawson for his thoughts on the perspective that consciousness is not generated by nor confined to the brain. The old view, the materialist worldview was that mind is what's called an epiphenomenon of complex brains. And the idea is that originally there were single-cell organisms, then multi-celled organisms, then complex organisms as they got more and more complicated, they got bigger and bigger brains, more complex brains and eventually went throughout this phenomenon called mind. That's a result of brain activity. But there's no actual proof for that point of view and in my book Mind to Matter, I quote many, many neuroscientists, many many authorities who say, point this out, who say that there's really no proof, no empirical proof that mind is the epiphenomenon of a complex brain. And what the brain seems to do more accurately is, it seems to be receiving and transducing information and then manifesting it on a physical level so the brain is much more like a receiver of information than it is like a producer of information. Just the way someone is listening to this podcast right now and they're listening to it on a device so the words I'm speaking and the words you're speaking and this interaction isn't happening inside of their smartphone and that's the conceit of the materialist worldview, we think that because there's this broadcast coming out of the smartphone well, then the smartphone has to be the source of a broadcast. We don't realize that the broadcast was coming from a distant location and so there are lots of examples, there's lots of science now behind distant mental effects and the distant phenomenon of consciousness. And so, what the research does show is that there's far more evidence for the idea of consciousness being something that permeates the universe, there's something which I talk about in the very beginning of Mind to Matter, I talk about non-local mind and our local minds are anchored in our local brains. So if for example I, talk about me, Dawson, I'm talking about an individual and an entity that's anchored in a local sense of self which I associate with my body and my circumstances so that's the local me. But there's far more to me than the local me. There's far more me than the local sense of self and so when meditators for example enter a deep meditation, a part of the brain called the parietal lobe which locates your body in space, that part of the brain shuts down, the prefrontal cortex that that constructs the self, shuts down, there's a massive drop in the consumption of oxygen and nutrients by those two parts of the brain and so people literally begin to have a non-local sense of self. They describe a feeling of oneness, they feel a sense of peace, they feel a sense of connection with the rest of the universe. In these states of consciousness, all kinds of non-local phenomena occur so people who are in this non-local space report experiences of precognition, knowing the future what's happening in the future before it happens and there's really, really good evidence for precognition, telepathy. The EEG is one of the most pervasive instruments used by modern science, the electroencephalograph, and there are thousands of things now that plot our brain waves using EEG. But when I was writing Mind to Matter, I became interested in the guy who invented the EEG, whose name is Hans Berger and he was a German doctor in the late 1800s, early nineteen hundreds and he had, he got his big insight about inventing a device to measure brain waves when he had an experience of non-local reality. He was actually a German military officer and one day he was on his horse and he was part of a horse team towing a huge big field gun in the late 1800s and his horse reared up and threw him right in the path of this rolling gun and just as a gun was about to crush him, his friends managed to stop the gun and he wasn't crushed. That night he got a telegram of his father saying, I've been concerned about you, how are you? And he never got a telegram from his father before. It turned that his sister that day, at the very moment he is, he was about to be crushed by the gun, she had this premonition of a terrible thing about to happen to him and told the father to send the telegram. So there are always examples of people, even in science, Einstein said that all great scientific discoveries come from these states in which you're letting go of the local self and connecting with a non-local self. That's where inspiration comes from, that's what creativity comes from and so the brain is the anchor of that non-local mind in local experience and that's really where the evidence is pointing. When I began to write my book Mind to Matter, I thought I would find a chain of evidence linking our thoughts to manifestation in things but I didn't think I'd find a complete chain, I think, I thought I would find that science would reveal a number of links in that chain and there'd be some big gaps in the chain as well. And I was amazed when I got to the end of the book, that there are no missing links to the chain. They're all there, they're all there scientifically and so that was one big surprise to me in writing Mind to Matter. The other was the scale and the size of some of these phenomena and in the first chapter I tell the story of astrophysicist turned TV reporter called Graham Phillips and he has a show in Australia called Catalyst and he'd heard about meditation and the meditational health benefits so he thought well, I should give it a try. He wasn't a believer, he was a bit of a skeptic but he went into Monash University, a very distinguished university in Australia and he had a complete workup of his physical function and his brain. So they measured the volume of every single point of his brain and also tested his neurological function. He then began to practice mindfulness and up in just two weeks he found that his whole way of reacting to stress had changed. He could feel and see the difference in his behavior. When he went back to the University after eight weeks, now again this is only two months of practicing meditation and mindfulness, they did this complete battery of tests on him again and they found that things like his reaction speed, his memory and learning capacity had increased exponentially and a part of the brain that regulates emotions and its job is to regulate emotion across different brain regions, it's called the Dentate gyrus, it's right in the very center of the brain, the center of the hippocampus, the memory learning center of the brain. The Dentate gyrus spreads out through it, it actually helps different parts of the brain regions coordinate their regulation of emotion. So in eight weeks, the volume of neural tissue in Graham Phillips's brain in the Dentate gyrus had increased by 22.8%. Now, that's an enormous difference, that's more than a fifth growth in that one brain region in less than two months so just a remarkable shift and not just in brain software activity but in brain hardware as well. And so, what I'm arguing in Mind to Matter, what I'm showing in these studies, they reveal that our brains are changing substantially, remarkably, and quickly in response to consciousness, when our awareness changes, when we destress ourselves, when we tap, when we meditate, when we do all these things that help us feel better, those subjective feelings of well-being translate into objective changes in measures like the volume of neural tissue in different parts of the brain. So if you've been for example a kind of a person who's been angry and stressed and upset and resentful for a long time, you've been growing those neural circuits for a long time and they get worse and worse and worse. PTSD, people with PTSD they get worse over time generally speaking, but if you fill your mind and heart with love, with compassion, with kindness, you can make that choice over and over and over again as Graham Phillips did, you are then building up those circuits that have to do with all of those phenomena and you are a resilient human being, you have this core of resilience that can really help you when times are tough or when you have life setbacks. So I was intrigued by his case history of how we're literally turning the software of consciousness, of mind, into the hardware of brain. 
[Music] In the early 1920s, Alexander Gurwitch in Russia was experimentally exploring the idea that all life emits, and is embedded in, a morphogenic field. At one point he took two onions out of the ground careful to preserve their root tips. Because the root tip has the highest rate of mitosis, the cells are dividing fastest at the tip. He pointed the tip of one root at the middle section of a second root. The cells in that middle section of the second root then started to divide much faster. He further experimented with blocking the effect and found that if he put a barrier between the two, he could stop the effect, if the barrier blocked ultraviolet wavelengths of light. Here was the first modern experiment, showing that living cells emit light, and that this light can directly change the behavior of other cells. Today you can verify that your eyes emit light, by purchasing a Hamamatsu photo- multiplier and going into a completely dark room and pointing the photomultiplier  at your eye. Living systems emit light from ultraviolet to very low frequency  radio waves. Different tissues emit different wavelengths at different times and at varying intensities. Why is this not more obvious? Well, I would argue that it is, since we've  all noticed the light in someone's eyes. Or have said things like, ‘she has a glow  about her’, or ’you were simply radiant’. If we would all trust our own experience more,  then science could progress much faster. The amount of light given off by creatures varies quite a bit - from a few photons per second to tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands per second. That places the intensity in the range of walking in a dense forest at night when things are really dark. But somehow plenty of nocturnal animals  do just fine. What is this bio light doing? Here are a few examples. Over the  winter a seed will not emit any light. As the rain falls and the temperatures rise, in the quiet darkness of the soil the seeds start emitting light, green light, up to ten thousand photons per second. Another example. Put someone in a dark room. Shave off a bit of the hair on the scalp, and place a photo detector against the area of the  visual cortex. Take a baseline reading. Ask the person to imagine a bright light - the photon count will immediately shoot up. Your brain gives off more light when you imagine light. The light emissions from the entire human body were recorded periodically over the course of a year. The entire body brightens in the summer and is darkest in the winter. Within a single day the body brightens as the Sun goes to its zenith, then the body gradually dims, as the day moves to night. The light emitted from the center of the body stays the most constant, while the hands and the head show the most variation. The colors emitted are centered around green, but go to blue and yellow. But the light from the center of the palms is shifted slightly more to the blue. Our blood is constantly emitting light. Blood that had a higher immune response, in this case carrying more neutrophils, had a measurably higher photon count. To our alert biomedical viewers: this is probably the best area to look for new diagnostic techniques, as you can be absolutely certain that the complex rainbow of colors given off by our blood perfectly reflects the ever-changing physical and emotional state of our  organism. Diving into individual cells, biophotons travel from mitochondria through microtubules. When I was in graduate school, it was just observed that microtubules were used by cells as highways to actively transport materials to where they were needed in the cell. And now we know that those tubules are also carrying light. We've also found that single neurons act as wave guides for visible light photons. Neurons not only behave as electrical wires, but also act like fiber optic cables. Light and electricity are really two sides of the same coin, so we probably  should have seen that one coming. In the old picture, any light present in biological systems was just the random thermal energy. And yes, there's plenty of that. But  now we see that specific biological processes are initiated by specific frequencies of light which are emitted at specific times and places. The biology of light is just as regulated as the biology of molecules. We're down to the final two experiments. My runner-up favorite is based upon the fact that when you are in bright light, your brain emits more photons. Take two people. Place them in the same room along with an antenna which emits a weak oscillating magnetic field. Person  One then stays in the room while Person Two goes to a second room which is completely dark. Shine a bright light on the first person. The second person's brain will immediately emit more biophotons. This only worked if the two people first shared the experience of being in the same oscillating magnetic field. I  read this paper over six months ago and I'm still wondering what it means. Before looking at my favorite experiment, let's discuss things a little. Light emits light. In some cases we see the light is doing specific work, such as initiating mitosis. If humans were nocturnal creatures this would all be obvious, as the luminosities are roughly that of a forest on a moonless night. We have light shooting out of our eyes; the ground below us is radiant with the ultraviolet light of root mitosis. For those  with a classical bent, you might be saying, ”Plato was right, once again?” Plato said that in human vision light goes out from our eyes and blends with the light coming from objects and the combination results in what we see. Now  we have proof that our eyes emit light. To a physicist this was always an obvious possibility since all receivers are also transmitters. A radio antenna can send a signal, or receive the same signal. It has to work both ways. The rhodopsin molecules in the retinal cells can absorb visible light. Therefore they must also be able to emit the same visible light. Why might the light coming from our eyes blend with the light coming in? To answer  this, we can look at how the ears work. Decades ago, it was found that our ears emit  sound. This was shelved as an interesting oddity, until someone wondered if  there might not be some purpose to it. They found that the ears emit sound for the purpose of actively producing signal canceling and signal enhancement. Ever wonder how it is in a crowded room you are capable of focusing in on one conversation? Even someone else's conversation, several feet away? It's the same principle as the noise- cancelling headphones but several light years more advanced, as your auditory system somehow knows where is the voice you want to hear. How far away is it; how long does it take for the sound to travel the distance between your two ears. And then in real time, as the sounds in the room keep changing, your eardrums emit a sound signal that will reduce everything else and enhance the particular voice you want to hear. The same is happening with your vision. I've not found the research yet, but it will come along soon enough. How is the biology of light different from the biology we learned in school? One hundred years ago, people did not  much think of biology as a chemical process. Yet everyone listening to this lecture was educated inside the biochemistry paradigm. We were taught that biology is only a chemical process. What do we mean by biochemistry? Take the example of a cell needing to build out some new bits of its machinery, such as a new ribosome. Ribosomes are the primary machinery that cells use to build all the other proteins the cell needs. This requires raw material, enzymes and an energy source. Imagine the new ribosome is almost completed and just a final bit needs to be attached. The final required bit of protein  is there, hanging around. The precise enzyme needed for just this final attachment also happens to be there, and the ATP molecule is also hanging around, and then they all come together. Energy is released from the ATP molecule, travels through the enzyme and the final bit of ribosome is added. Biochemistry is great because biochemists have worked out all the players in this construction story and a thousand others, and have measured the amount of energy needed in each case. Now  let's retell the story adding light and electricity. What do we mean by ’energy is released’ from  the ATP? Electron orbits are broken, rearranged. This is a change in electric currents. This change in electric currents emits light, just as the radio antenna emits light as the electric current is changed. This bit of light emitted by the ATP travels through the optical conductor called enzyme, and is used to rearrange electric currents on the almost finished ribosome. Think arc welding. These changes would look like sparks and rippling rainbows, if we had the eyes to see it. You cannot have chemical changes without light. When electric currents change, light is produced. When light is absorbed, electric currents  change. Light and electric currents are two sides of the same coin: they are the energy and the matter corresponding to each other. To better understand organic life, we need to see it as a hierarchy of worlds within worlds. A piece of light is not the same as a molecule. A molecule is not the same as a cell. A cell is not the same as a human body. these are all worlds of vastly different sizes and properties. Yet, all these worlds interpenetrate one another and influence each other. We could not have organic life without cells, or  without chemicals, or without light and electricity, nor could cells live without ecosystems, and the whole earth and the Sun. This hierarchy holds together because all the levels communicate, and exchange energy and information. Starting  with the onion, let's step our way down the ladder. An onion is living. Inside the living onion, the root is growing. Inside the growing root, cells are dividing. Inside the dividing cells, loads of chemical changes are happening. In those chemical changes are electric currents, and from those changing electric currents, ultraviolet light is emitted. When this ultraviolet light is absorbed by a second root, this initiates the whole process in reverse, causing rapidly changing electric currents, needed for rapid chemical rearrangements, needed for rapid cell division, and the root of the second onion begins to grow. Root cells are both transmitters and receivers of everything roots are capable of doing. In general, if there's a problem at any one level, it affects all the levels. If some- thing goes wrong with a molecular process in my cells, I experience that as ill health. The molecular world makes itself known to a person. Or the whole person might engage in unhealthy behavior such as persistent negative thoughts, or useless fears, which will inevitably trickle down to cause disordered molecular activity in some  cells. With this picture of interconnection up and down the ladder, we now widen  our view and look further up the scale If a large number of people are engaged in unhealthy activity, this must work its way up to cause ill health in whatever larger groupings exist, be they families or countries, or even all life on earth taken all together. Going the other way, if we can imagine it, if there were something gone wrong at a planetary level, then this must find its way down to humanity. Not necessarily to make each person sick, but certainly cause changing trends of illness that appear and disappear across the globe. Our ladder now stretches from the  entire earth down to individual photons, and we are ready for my number one favorite experiment involving the biophotons of DNA. The lab of Luke Montagnier was studying radio frequencies emitted by DNA. In the last of a series of truly boggling experiments, they placed a string of DNA into a vial of water and stimulated the vial with various radio frequencies. Then filter out the DNA. This leaves just water, but the water is now emitting radio frequencies, which it somehow got from the DNA. Place  an antenna around the vial of water and send that signal to a second lab, several miles away. In this other lab, you have a second test tube that contains water and all  the individual building blocks of DNA. Broadcast our signal into the second vial. In a few hours the original DNA strand will be constructed in the second vial. Sounds like magic and I guess it is, but it is also experimental data. Water can hold the radio frequency signal, which can be used to rebuild the DNA sequence from raw materials. I would hope that entire new research labs will be set up to further explore these results. Luke Montagnier has many admirers and many enemies. As often happens with people who achieve a great deal in life, shortly before his death last year, he had the distinction of being canceled for daring to point out some obvious problems with a novel medical treatment that was being rolled out around the  world. Hence it is possible that anything connected with him will be erased from future history. What frequencies worked best in this experiment? The results were clearest when the initial strand was energized with 7 Hertz, 14 Hertz, or 28 Hertz radio signals. Of course, these are the resonant frequencies of the entire electrical body of the earth known as the Schumann resonances. That is worth saying a second time: the entire electrical body of the earth vibrates loudest at 7, 14 and 28 Hertz. These are the same frequencies that allow DNA in the experiment to best convey  its information through water to rebuild itself. It is absurd to think this is an accident. This obvious connection between the electrical body of the earth and the DNA in each of us makes me.... quiet. Like, I sometimes get quiet in church, or  in an overwhelmingly beautiful landscape. At this point poetry meets experimental science. The bridge between the two seems long but is also undeniable. Antennas work both  ways. The entire electrical body of the earth is both the sender and the receiver of all the vibrations in all the DNA in all the living creatures. over all the eons that have unfolded within  her. Inside you, are a trillion antennae that are both the senders and receivers of all the love and wisdom contained in the long body of our Mother Earth. This would be enough, but we're not done  yet. In simple physics, the length of an antenna is comparable to the size of the wave it absorbs and emits. The AM radio antenna on your car is one-fourth the size of the AM radio waves  that are being sent out from the radio stations. Since we have already verified experimentally that our DNA is an antenna that both absorbs and emits, we might ask what is the length of our DNA and is there any station broadcasting that wavelength. The DNA in one  of your cells unrolls to roughly your own height that's a notable connection an organism the size of a person needs an antenna roughly its own size to adequately send and receive all the information required for an entire life, from conception to death. But what about the combined length of all the DNA in all your cells? That combined length is the size of our entire solar system. We have within us antennas whose combined length happens to be the right size, to resonate with the entire body of the Sun, the planets, all the comets, even out to the heliopause. Who could believe such a thing? How could there be a connection with the life of a person in the entire solar system? Yet the connection must be there, because the ladder is unbroken. Whether  or not any one of us can knowingly receive these signals, or is capable of intentionally broadcasting up to the whole solar system. It's a good question I dare say it's a very important question. [Music] 
give a brief hypothesis fundamentally that the earth has been influenced by electrical discharge it's not the only thing that's been influenced by but how can we quantify that so with that background I'll have to talk about the geological effects of running water it's an important component of our past and it still is measured today electric discharges on dielectric media is something we can do in the lab and as you've seen in the past few talks electric discharges are scalable it's a fundamental aspect of these studies is that what we do in the lab if we have a source for it at the Galactic scale or at the earth scale it can occur and we can measure it you can't do that with water that's the only drawback to water you can only scale it a few orders of magnitude in the laboratory and the fractal analysis is a tool with which we'll use to to measure these items so I'll take you through how I measure some of these landforms and compared them to existing electric discharges so really what is water water flows all over the earth you can find many pictures of it we know we can measure it to measure what it actually does on the earth electrical discharges however a little bit different they have fractal patterns they're somewhat chaotic but also ordered in their discharge patterns I'll show a few other pictures from capture lightning they do a lot of great work with these Lichtenberg patterns in polyacrylic type resins and you get these beautiful dendritic patterns so we can actually measure these these items in the lab and we'll talk about that a little bit more so let's be honest how many of you flew here right you look over the earth you see some pretty perplexing landscapes and now we can view that on our laptops and we can measure things on our laptops okay and and myself as a chemist I'm a chemist I'm not a geologist but I understand the concepts behind some geology I was wondering if the current geological paradigm was missing something as I flew over the earth I saw these tremendous dendritic patterns and cratering and mountaintops right next to flood plains and other different topological features so I I was wondering okay we can talk all we want about other mechanisms but if we don't have a quantitative way to measure that no one will hear us so is there a quantitative relationship to various topological aspects of the earth and I believe there is and that's what fractal analysis will tell us I'm from New Jersey northern New Jersey it is more than Newark Airport there are some beautiful regions in New Jersey where I live there are a lot of granite outcrops a lot of very strange log backs that run from the north to the west or north northwest beautiful Lake Region that's about ten square miles there on Google terrain as we back out an order of magnitude we see some interesting aspects to to the topology we see our Appalachian Mountains here that run folded patterns supposedly these are ancient mountains that have been eroded away but right up butted against them are dendritic patterns and cavern of extensive canyons in central Pennsylvania formed by water presumably this butts up against the coast which has been thought to be a floodplain and there's beautiful Newark down there if you back out more on the East Coast it then comes up to the flood plains of the Mississippi region Ozarks are down here New Hampshire the Granite State granite outcrops everywhere fairly high mountains up there but again the Appalachians stretch down throughout Virginia and you have your Chesapeake Bay there so in terms of scaling when we back out from our small ten square mile aspect we see some very unique features at different scales we've already seen in the past number of presentations haven't been that many already that we we can assume at least for the hypothesis that the earth was bathed in equilibration of electrical energy from sun from the galaxy from other bodies we don't know that was the past that is an origins question that is a different conversation but what we can do is we can measure what's left over and we can see if we can draw any conclusions from that so in that sense this is a slide borrowed from from wall if the current is coming in on our galaxy we are just a very small subset of this again it goes back to scale michael Claridge showed that so well goes back to scale we are just a very very small speck of dust on one of these arms and if there is electric current flowing through these arms it is reasonable to assume that we've been influenced by that in the past again from walls presentation this is just a local hypothesized environment of the plasma solar system and where our incoming charge is coming from from our plasma pinch currents again look at the scale the Sun is still but a small speck on this overall space of things and then from a size scale from a NASA view our little blue dot of Earth here we are very small compared to the Sun so it's reasonable to expect that large changes in the sun's output could influence us dramatically now that we know were tied electrically to it we know that in recent years 1850s late 1850s a tremendous corona affected telegraph lines blew out many of them if such a corona what happened these days we'd be in loads of trouble but we also have to realize that electrical effects are not the only effect many years of very hard work by very smart people have established certain aspects of fluvial erosion erosion by glaciers it does occur we can't deny that but on what scale what is the order of magnitude of a fluvial erosion versus a massive electric thunderbolt brought about by discharge across the Earth's atmosphere so these discharges do exhibit daya discharges cross dielectrics do exhibit fractal type patterns and what is a fractal many of you might be familiar with a Mandelbrot set it's a very fun whirlwind through YouTube if you zoom in and it goes and in Peet repeats to infinity no matter where you increase your magnification on this set that's a fractal it is the same as it is near as it is from far so discharges across dielectrics a dielectric being some sort of later exhibit these kind of fractal characteristics so again the capture lightning folks do this Marvis lee this is a discharge across polycarbonate and as if you zoom in to infinity you could theorize down to the single electron path in these dendritic patterns now interestingly enough when when fractal analysis started coming about Mandelbrot pioneered this in the 70s and the 80s published a book for fractal shorelines and shorelines were the first to be analyzed they did exam it's some sort of fractal characteristics in this case it's Chesapeake Bay we see our dendritic pattern here and also some could be brought about by flow of the rivers from rainfall from constant season changes but what are the main effects how much of an effect does the flooville erosion of a riverbed have versus an electrical origin can we quantify that so that's what we'll explore if you go walking down the street or in a on a muddy path and it rains the rain is going to fill in the path it's that simple we can see that every day so the hypothesis is what if the earth did experience these discharges which had a profound effect on the topology of the earth but now we're in under the influence of a quiescent state of rain snow erosion could these processes that had already sculpted the earth influence what we see in the rivers today now we do know that floovio erosion happens we can measure we've seen it in the earth these are pictures from Alaska where you see the snowfall actually freezing and then melting and carving river channels and then you have what's called Louvre eel fans towards the bottom as the water decreases its energy and dissipates as energy it spreads out so this can be measured but there are other places where it does not happen so clearly especially on Mars when you look at craters the last electric conference we had a wonderful tour of the Mars geology and the big discrepancy here is that these alluvial fans actually go downhill so it's the wrong direction this is the problem so this is the edge of the Victoria crater so we would expect these alluvial fans actually increase as your fluids run down to the bottom of the crater but that does not happen there must be another mechanism in place because it does not account for flooville creation of these dendritic patterns floovio patterns we know happen again Google Earth thank you so you can increase your magnification this is Canyon Lake down in Texas they had a river dam breach or not a river a lake breach and you can see what happened to the limestone the surrounding limestone region you can then pixelate that and visualize that and do some measurements on it it's fairly linear go straight downhill to the river where it feeds into the river we know it's a flu view pattern in the same way you can do that on a Great Mississippi or I'm sorry this is Mount st. Helens I'll get the Mississippi another slide the Mount st. Helens the eruption happened the pyroclastic flow flowed down to the near the lowest region you can also quantify that pixelate it and look at the flow of where it where it occurred it also had some side channels here that I forgot to put in now I get on to flooville patterns right this is like our Mossad down in Texas this has been dammed so this has restricted the flow of the river over the course of time and what we see in stark contrasts to an existing river flow is the dendritic pattern of occurring why does this occur because you're changing the base level the base level is an important fundamental aspect of geology that says well water's going to flow to the lowest level and if there's an erosive layer there it's going to eventually wrote it away and create a new base level if there is a level there that cannot be eroded away that will be your base level so my question is if this is an existing base level and this is the river how did these existing dendritic patterns form if you increase your base level it's going to fill in to what was already there but those should have already flowed from somewhere else into the base level of the river so it's kind of like a cat chasing its tail now and we're trying to figure out how to do found these factors in the same way you can look at the Mississippi floodplain this is a part of the Mississippi River here in terrain mode and you see extensive arrays of dendritic channels especially in the Ozark region rolling channels we have a rent driven through Missouri it's just constant constant up and down the problem here is if these were all flooville as a result of flooding they would also have the similar drainage pattern to a base level but they do not in the same way of this had a base level we would see the same dendritic patterns brought about by constant flooding of the Mississippi in the near pat and in your past we don't see that these dendritic patterns further do not drain to anywhere they are they're on their own so this begs the question what a brought brought about these dendritic patterns and how can we measure them in the differences between them and the fluvial patterns as I mentioned this concept of base level in reading through some of the basic textbooks on geology written by Tarbuck say if you take an introductory geology course over and over he says running water is a single most important agent sculpting the Earth's land surface that is a constant mantra of current geology and that's to be said because they have come up with hypotheses as to how this water erodes and some models that are validated by experimental research the major factors include your slope your bed your some suspended loads the types of materials your depth your width your physical barriers and your rainfall these can all be measured and modeled this is introducing the concept of design of experiments you have factors which you can control or at least monitor and then you have your responses including your sedimentation what's being brought down this slope by rainfall or some sort of flood that gets deposited on this new bedrock layer the river flow the flow rate the erosion rate how fast this sedimentary layer is deposited in the new area so all these factors can be measured and you can come up with models this in particulars from the Department of Agriculture a general technical report that people can use to measure stream characteristics and because of these extensive stream characteristics and also rivers this applies to rivers as well but it's not as many character classifications because it's pretty difficult to classify larger systems but uh but you can see that the larger slopes lead to straighter channels it's a very fundamental sense lower slopes lead to what's called meandering and stream capture so these guys can capture over here and then you can form other circular regions and that happens all the time along the floodplains and also Delta's where the river runs out to its current oceans and base levels so we have these pictures and we also can study what kind of erosion rates happen with different types of sit of gravel or base material but again it all goes back to a certain base level it all has to eventually flow to the lowest point where it can get to so right now 47 plus streams I think the the classification of rivers is around 30 what does that do for us for electrical discharges so now on to discharge is simplified in one slide so the charge build-up here if we have two plates powered by an electrical source we have an electric field that builds up across the dielectric the blue being a dielectric whether it be solid liquid gas eventually it's going to discharge if you get enough charge built up that's why capacitors eventually break the charge of cooler rates by discharging across the path the factors again we go back to the design of experiments and monitoring what we know in the system many things can influence how this discharges your electrode materials the type of electric the potential of electricity there the surface topology of these two electrodes surface morphology etc etc small points will increase the local electric field there now the response is what do you get out when this occurs much like a lightning bolt you get magnetic fields the current flow you get a full spectrum of light anywhere from x-rays to visible light you get heat manifested in heating up the local surroundings and possible nuclear interactions if it's strong enough and you have pinch effects it's a very very simplified version of discharges but it enables us to measure things in the laboratory so we can monitor our factors we can measure our responses and build models from them and because electricity is scalable we can assume that things scale up now a lot of work has been done on fractal analysis of dielectric discharges because this is very important for the wiring cable industry for those who make transformers and power supplies okay so early on you can see as early as 1990 1984 people have been doing work on the fractal dimensions of dielectric discharge and and fundamentally what they found is that they all possess a certain fractal dimension that's characteristic of the material so some of these include this is actually an internet picture of a discharge across a transformer unto the insulator but these are from the papers that I studied from cudos paper where he measured them and he then measured the diode the fractal properties of those items typically they were performed in high voltage discharges across solid plastics or gaseous medium so now it's quiz time some of you have seen this already so don't cheat so I can tell you there are three pictures here that I've pixelated and turned into a binary picture to illustrate the scalability of electricity assuming that the Grand Canyon was formed by electric discharge probably not the only thing it was formed by but let's just for the moment assume a certain part of it is try to match each letter with the particular picture I'll give you a minute here so we have orders of magnitude scale here centimeters from a polycarbonate discharge to meters of a discharge on cement and then kilometres for the canyon so everyone got their choices all right oh I heard some off how many people got be proud of yourselves how many people got it right just free cures all right okay it's it's not that easy when things are pixelated and you normalize everything so what you're doing is you're normalizing all of your particular topography only that which you can see in terms of what was formed by the discharge and we'll come back to that in just a moment so you can see here that scalability is in effect so I thought about how rivers are formed how discharges could affect the surface of the earth and I kind of dug it down to the main effects here so what this is cause it caused a diet this is a cause-and-effect Ishikawa diagram they call it we use this a lot to identify problems in industry or whatever we're working with so on the left here is riverbeds how are they formed well the hypothesis we know they're formed somewhat by floovio events but they could also be formed by electrical discharges ignore this for the moment technically you're not supposed to have characterization tools in with this diagram but I wanted to share this to run parallel with these so the floovio factors again the factors that influence the floovio erosion of rivers include the following you can have age consistent in sufficient rainfall etc you can read through these high slope slope slopes at Cognex dissolve low your suspended load all these factors and then what I did is I kind of assign categories color categories to those that are measurable and testable by what we can do in the lab or in the field also red which is not testable it fails the requirements to be a scientific study you cannot repeatably measure it and also historical accounts because there are a lot of historical accounts of certain electrical plasma discharge phenomenon which we now know so in terms of the rivers I don't know if this color is going to show up enough but but really what I saw and you know we can talk about this afterwards we disagree but really tectonics and pre-existing geology are the assumptions they're not testable but nearly everything for fluvial existing rivers can be measured but you can't measure that which has happening past so that automatically eliminates some aspects of this for electrical discharge we had a few different items here either a large solar outbursts or close earth encounters with various items you could probably come up with some other factors here right but for the most part we now know that there is evidence of current in space right we've talked about that a few times even in the popular press I shouldn't say popular but academic press there is measurement of electric current and scale Jets for coming from about galaxies so it does occur in space we can now use that as part of our toolbox to say electric current is scaleable we know what happens at the Galactic scale for one component of this jet we obtain for the first time a determination of lactic scale electric current and its direction this is an Astro fixes physics journal okay so that's encouraging so from a factor we know that compositional changes can affect how electric discharge occurs so you can see that all these things add in to electrical discharge making it somewhat of a feasible phenomenon we have some historical sources from the ancients and interplanetary distances being less than they were than presents I could be debated but but I do believe we have some historical accounts of that but anything that's inferred without any drawing on any references it's inferred breakdown in the atmosphere Thomas gold and some others have said that you need a flux of about greater than twenty Gauss to have that discharge occur across the earth so it could have happened in the past now for characterization the only things we're missing here anything that in terms of that draws on the past geologic time scales and non measured or kind of present is key to the past because we don't know if that riverbed was flowing as fast as it is now especially if we can't find the sediment load that it left over that's an important aspect so that's one way we can break down the problem trying to visualize it as to what factors are most important I mentioned measurement methods here so now we're going to get into what I looked at a fractal is a self-similar pattern in other words it's same as a nearer as they are nearer as they are from far very few things are perfectly self similar in nature that means if you increase your magnification all the way they look the same as you back out most of the time they're they're known as self a fine in other words they're scaled by different amounts in certain directions that's more the case with riverbeds but certain at certain of them can be are known to be self similar and there's some separate tests you can do that that I have not done yet now it's interesting in all the research with riverbeds is that it's really only confined river networks that exhibit self-efficacy regular flowing networks of rivers such as a Mississippi and other large river networks do not exhibit that so already we're looking at the landform confounding our analysis of this so the landform is dictating how the river flows so could we tested this similarity between these measured fractal dimensions of electric discharges and what we know in the lab with landforms that we know on the earth so taking it back to the to the picture think about the picture you can think about any picture here that has a hole and then rain or some sort of flow rate moving in it's going to be captured so measuring the fractal analysis of the earth as I mentioned Mandelbrot did a little bit of this in his book it's a great book I think a trendsetter there he did a lot of analysis of the coasts and now people are taking that into three dimensions and measuring some aspects of geomorphology most recent I came across a paper that I think is very powerful in that it studied ISO lines at varying altitudes and I'll show you what I mean by that in just a moment so basically they're taking fractal dimensions at varying altitudes on the whole Earth's surface because they have data for that I'll read you a little bit of this the quantitative analysis of natural relief represents an objective form of aiding in the visual interpretation of lands games as studies on coastlines River networks and global topography have shown still an open question is whether it clear relationships between the quantitative properties of landscapes and the dominant geomorphological main wind water that originated them can be established in this contribution we show that the geometry of topographic isolines is an appropriate appropriate observable to help disentangle such a relationship I haven't totally disentangle it but they're getting they're really into conclusions though as I found it's kind of surprising a more detailed inspections points to a relationship between the observed features and the geological processes that shape the planetary surface we suggest that the erosive action of a solid or viscous phase the erosion of a flowing liquid phase or its action through wave breaking and tectonics are geological agents which work towards increasing roughness increasing roughness in the landscape on the other hand agent scalding sediment deposition formation and pronounced smooth slopes or erosion through hydrostatic pressure glacials caused by large masses of liquid or ice represents smoothing agents is able to decrease the characteristic fractal dimension the rougher you are the higher the fractal dimension the smoother you are the lower the fractal dimension the problem I have with this is that they're referring to water doing the same thing that's how I interpret that so typically what they get on a map function of fractal dimension D as you can see that 1.8 from 1 and you can see that mountains obviously are the highest fractal dimension ok drawn by the coastlines which are fairly smooth due to wave action and sediments on the layer and then your Intercontinental I guess sea floors and your trenches they also were able to resolve I'll go and draw some Cluj ins from this with the next graph but really a study of isoline so what basically what they're doing is they're measuring a box counting relationship so the measurement of your fractal dimension D is a relationship a logarithmic relationship with the number of boxes that they can fill into a certain area that's scaled the scaling factor being ADA so on this map of New Jersey okay another beautiful region the congleton preserve can fill in an area at a thousand meters say in height you can fill in that ISO line with a certain number of boxes count them you then do the same thing with a larger box larger area or the different ISO line a larger area of a different number of boxes you can then get a plot so this is from Baldessari's paper which I just showed you and you can see that at different elevations you have an increasing the level as you increase your elevation up to about 4,500 meters that D level is that slope of this line and interestingly below the C and right at sea level you have very low fractal dimensions brought about by flooville erosion so again the the the fractal dimension increases with your increasing height and elevation I think that says something about the mechanism of how these mountains were formed so what did I do in my spare time I took image J which is a microscopy analysis software a little bit worthy of a chart here I apologize but I took the fractal dimension by the box counting method typically between 1 and 2 the areas of each image was between 500 and thousand miles squared I was able to get a resolution of about one pixel per 125th of a mile so you may say okay well these are three-dimensional figures how can you project them in the 2d in some of the electrical studies they said that hey this is valid as long as this projection on a 2d plane has D values of 1.7 so the color coded datasets are from flooville which are blue known electrical events from the laboratory and from literature papers and then unknown structures from terrain mode captures the image processing you can accomplish fairly readily requires a little bit of footwork to get rid of some of the roads and whatnot on Google Earth but you you binary you grayscale it than you binary it and you get this binary pattern which you can then do your analysis on but furthermore I skeletonize it because I knew we were dealing with different elevations so the pattern that this follows right can be of elevation of about 600 meters from the centre of this channel up to the side so a way to kind of normalize your overall patterning and distribute it to only the branched pattern is to skeletonize that so you can do that with your software so eventually what you're getting is only a skeletonized pixelated version of only the pattern and then you can measure your your box counting Mint through your box counting method your fractal dimension so here's a picture of Mississippi that was talking about numerous floodplains here can pixelated binary it you get a D value of 1.3 this is up in Newfoundland you're getting a value of about 1.7 even just with the standard binary image a lightning bolt again we're projecting this onto a 2d which is valid again about 1.3 and again this is limited resolution this is far away you can't get all the little dendrites that are coming off this so that's one aspect that I think the electrical analysis is missing and now we can't resolve all those fine dendrites except with some of the laboratory tests that I took so a little bit of statistics here so if you all remember your students t-test 95% confidence interval I'm confident that this is different than that what this is doing is because I have different values of population sets it's a different kind of students t-test so when I did that with just the straight pixelated version nothing was different and with the skeletonized version some differences that appear namely when you skeletonize the landforms you don't have that drastic of a drop in d value as opposed from your river values and indeed you get a very big significant difference with that skeletonized value because you're normalizing all the elevation and what happens here is the effluvia l've al you decreases to about the same value that Baldassare found in all the fluvial erosion studies between 1 and 1.2 your unknown structures that i measured on the earth are equivalent to electrical structures so statistically speaking the unknowns are more statistically dissimilar to flooville events than they are from electrical events in the laboratory so really what that skeletonized value is doing is it's normalizing the depth ok and we can say that these structures are self self-aligned these new values are fairly high enough to be cell to fine so really in conclusion the present data set limited right now only 33 counts i think i had i'm working on getting more is uh I think electrical patterns are better match towards our land forms and the flooville patterns but we have to realize that other data includes flooville erosion because rivers have been flowing for some time so we have to account for that we have to know the systems that we're measuring very well to account for the fact that some floovio Rochin may have occurred so it's consistent with the literature trend there's a lot to do there always is but really what do what effects do such discharges have on in the environment right I'm interested in shock induced changes that's something I do all the time what is what does that do to Rock and what does that do to populations of organisms around that if it did occur could that account for many mysterious losses of populations of ancient cultures was that do the temperature and also radioactive decay that was already mentioned earlier some profound implications on geological sciences here that we have to explore more so again hopefully that further augment that data set with more analysis and we'll have a better picture of what's going on I'd like to acknowledge a Michael and Montgomery also for their discussions got a copy right Google or so we won't get sued and if anyone wants to contact me there's my contact information you happy to take any questions Thanks you 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info A new picture of the cosmos is emerging. A vastly different picture than the one astronomers have been painting for over a century. But a picture that was drawn many decades ago by specialists in plasma and the electrical sciences. In this picture, antiquated notions of charge neutrality in space have been erased, replaced with theoretical models which recognized the pervasive conductive medium or fifth state of matter called plasma through which electric currents flow throughout the cosmos. For many decades, electric currents were, and in some instances remain, verboten in the space sciences. But with improved instrumentation and ever finer data, cosmic electric currents at all scales are now undeniable. Nevertheless, a strange dilemma is unfolding in astronomy and astrophysics. Scientists attempt to explain electric currents in space through theoretical models in which electricity does not cause anything. But as we will see, electric currents in space are not just a curious byproduct of gravitational and magnetic phenomena. From the Electric Universe perspective, the measurement of electric currents in space is in the inevitable recognition of the electrical circuitry that connects celestial bodies across interplanetary, interstellar and intergalactic space. It's essential to remember that electric currents are only visible when they meet regions of dust and gas where one sees the unmistakable filamentary structure of electrified plasma. As in the vast star-forming networks in our own Milky Way. Measuring the strength of cosmic electric currents is of course no easy matter for scientists on earth and is even vastly more challenging than estimating the strength of cosmic magnetic fields. A good recent example can be found in our own solar system and scientists' investigation of the Saturnian moon Enceladus. As we outlined in a recent Space News, prior to the arrival of the Cassini spacecraft at Saturn over a decade ago, planetary scientists had expected Enceladus to be "geologically dead". Instead, they found explosive filamentary jets shooting material at tremendous velocities up to hundreds of kilometers from the moon's surface. Adding to the surprise, the jets were seen at the moon's South Pole, the last place they expected such activity. As reported by space.com in 2005, "The finding flipped everything scientists knew about Enceladus on its head, because what should have been a dead moon appeared to be geologically active and what was supposed to be the moon's coldest region turned out to be its warmest." Since their discovery, scientists have interpreted the features as so-called "ice geysers" which they view as a form of cryovolcanism probably resulting from Saturn's gravitational forces producing tidal heating within the moon. In 2008, Cassini's plasma spectrometer discovered evidence for electrical currents in the plumes of water and dust. In recent years, a number of papers have been written on the presence of negatively charged dust grains in the so-called plumes. And now, based on data from the Cassini Langmuir probe, a new scientific paper is providing evidence that these dust grains have actually "blocked the signal" of the powerful electrical currents in the Enceladus' jets. For a number of years, Standard Theory has proposed that electrically neutral water molecules are ejected from the moon's surface where UV rays from the Sun and interactions with plasma in Saturn's magnetosphere strips electrons from water molecules forming positively charged water ions. In theory, these ions are then free to be "picked up" and merged with co-rotating plasma supposedly generating an electric current. Cassini scientists had estimated the strength of the jets' electric currents based on disturbances to Cassini's magnetometer instrument. But as noted in a summary of the new scientific paper in the Journal of Geophysical Research, "...when Cassini flew through the icy plume, its instruments sent back vastly different readings. According to the craft's Langmuir probe, which measures particle density, there were enough ions present to generate a current of 10 million amps. The magnetometer indicated a current more than 20 times weaker." The authors provide experimental evidence that ions like those in the Enceladus plume are, "...attracted and trapped within the sheaths of negatively charged dust grains." They conclude that, "Cassini's Langmuir probe is measuring the entire ion population (both free and trapped ions), while the Cassini magnetometer detects the magnetic perturbations associated with pick up currents from the smaller population of free ions, with this distinction possibly reconciling the ongoing debate in the literature on the ion density in the plume." Simply put, the results are anomalous for the standard "pick up ions model" but they are expected if the surface of Enceladus is being etched by electrical discharge machining. As our chief science adviser Wal Thornhill has always proposed, electrical discharge machining works by stripping electrons from high points on a surface. In this process on Enceladus, positive ions generated on the surface are heated by electric discharge and electrostatically attracted to follow the electrons into space. This would in fact explain the high loading of positive ions that the Langmuir probe measured. And as we reported in great detail in a recent Space News, the notion that the gravitational influences of the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn produces tidal heating at their respective moons, resulting in cryovolcanism, has never been more questionable in light of new discoveries. As we noted, in 2013, scientists reported that the locations of the so-called volcanic plumes on Io are completely incompatible with the moon's internal heat signatures. A finding which, according to lead author Christopher Hamilton, "...can't be reconciled with any existing solid body tidal heating models." Likewise, on Enceladus in 2016, scientists were amazed to discover that when the so-called geysers on the moon are producing the most water and dust, the accompanying gas output was anomalously low. As reported by space.com, "The researchers expected quite a lot more gas expelled at the far part of Enceladus's orbit, to help explain the outpouring of dust, but they found the gas output had bumped up by just 20%, far less than expected." The leader of the study said of the findings, "We had thought the amount of water vapor in the overall plume, across the whole south polar area, was being strongly affected by tidal forces from Saturn. Instead, we find that the small-scaled jets are what's changing." Both scientists' new insights into the strength of the electric currents in the Enceladus plumes and the failure of the tidal heating models to explain discovery, are stunning victories for the electrical interpretation of the phenomenon. Of course, given scientists' difficulties in accurately measuring the electric currents at Enceladus, this naturally emphasizes the present technical and observational constraints on quantifying the electromagnetic energies at the vastest cosmic scales. However, as we've reported in many recent episodes, the evidence for cosmic scale electric currents is being more and more routinely presented in mainstream scientific literature. One of the most spectacular electromagnetic phenomena in space is the many light-years long collimated jets produced at active galactic nuclei. Today, standard astrophysics offers no explanation for the phenomena that does not involve a hypothetical black hole producing tremendous magnetism. However, with increasing regularity, mainstream scientific literature has proposed that the jets are composed of powerful electric currents. From radio astronomers estimating the current in an extra galactic jet, supposedly the equivalent of a trillion bolts of lightning, to more recent scientific papers which describe a "battery mechanism" close to the hypothetical black hole producing electric currents. As a recent paper by Gabuzda et all states, "...astrophysical jets are fundamentally electromagnetic structures." Nevertheless, in every case astrophysicists can only envision colossal gravity producing magnetic fields which are somehow primary in the creation of the spectacular "cosmic lightning". A recent Phys.org report describes new findings that can only confound the standard interpretation of so-called black hole jets, "As matter is broken down around a black hole, jets of electrons are launched by the magnetic field from either pole of the black hole at almost the speed of light. Astronomers have long been flummoxed by these jets." But this view is not supported by new research into the magnetic fields surrounding a "black hole" that is believed to be in our own Milky Way, within a micro quasar in the constellation Cygnus. The phys.org report summarizes the findings, "The team observed the magnetic field of a black hole within our own galaxy from multiple wavelengths for the first time... They discovered that magnetic fields are much weaker than previously understood, a puzzling finding that calls into question previous models of black hole components. The research shows a deep need for continued studies on some of the most mysterious entities in space." However, the real deep need may be for astrophysicists to finally consider actual theoretical alternatives to the black hole's existence. As stated many times by physicist Wal Thornhill, what these increasingly problematic discoveries highlight, is the problem of over specialization in the sciences. Far removed from the spotlight of popular science, for decades, plasma cosmologists have presented experimental evidence that the spectacular electromagnetic phenomena that space scientists attribute to black holes, is in fact a high-density energy storage phenomenon demonstrated in laboratories, called a plasmoid. In several episodes, we have briefly described how a plasmoid is a kind of load in a galactic electrical circuit concentrating and storing energy. When a plasmoid reaches a threshold density, it will discharge, usually along a galaxy spin axis, producing the stupendous galactic jets whose electric currents are now increasingly recognized in mainstream scientific literature. All astrophysicists who seek an answer to the mystery of cosmic jets, should be acquainted with the experimental research into the plasmoid's applicability to cosmic phenomena. We encourage viewers to consider the landmark research of the scientific pioneer, the late physicist and MIT scientist Winston H. Bostick, whose experimental research on the plasmoid led to the development of the dense plasma focus device. Bostick simulated many astrophysical phenomena through plasma physics experiments including galaxy formation and spectacular cosmic jets. The jets' collimation over tremendous cosmic distances, the knotted structure seen in many jets, their nearly light speed velocity, their emissions of synchrotron radiation and now the inferred measurements of electric currents in the jets, are all the predictable features of a discharging galactic plasmoid. Since the plasmoid's jets are part of a vastly larger electrical circuit, this can also resolve an enduring intractable problem for astrophysicists which is the mysterious source of the energy to the most distant parts of the cosmic jets, sometimes over many hundreds of thousands of light years. Occam's razor states, the simplest explanation is the most likely. Standard astrophysics tells us that electric currents in space are the product of extremely complex and strange gravitational and magnetic processes. The Electric Universe states that electric currents flow through the conductive medium of plasma which composes more than 99% of the visible universe. Celestial bodies moving in electrified environments, are electromagnetically connected and will discharge electrically when experiencing dramatic voltage spikes. As we see on our own planet in the form of spectacular blue jets, elves and red sprites above the clouds reaching toward space. Electric currents in space mean only one thing, we live in an Electric Universe. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info A new scientific study is again reshaping planetary scientists' ideas about the planet Venus. An enduring mystery is why the surface of Venus has so few craters since it's believed that Venus is billions of years old and since astronomers believe that craters formed from random impacts over eons of time. For decades, the consensus belief has been that the planet must have been radically "resurfaced" thus removing all evidence of the inevitable impacts. One theory is that the planet's surface simply sank for some reason then was replaced by a surface with no craters. However, a recent paper published in the Journal of Geophysical Research purportedly falsifies that hypothesis. A July 30th article on astronomy.com describes the research as follows, "Using numerical models to see how material in the planet's mantle circulates, the results found that the planet couldn't have undergone what is called mobile lid convection - a process where the surface rapidly sinks into the interior and is replaced by a fresh, crater-free surface. The results will help scientists understand how Venus evolved and may even help us understand how the planet's runaway atmosphere came to be." The major objections the research raises include the absence of a significant offset between the planet's center of mass and its actual center, and Venus's exceptionally weak magnetic field since the theorists believe that mobile lid convection would leave enough heat in the planet's core to create a dynamo, the hypothetical source of our own planet's magnetic field. The research thus appears to favor the conventional theory that massive volcanism must continually remove Venus's craters. However, the author of the paper states, "While I think my work more or less disproves the mobile-lid convection, I don't think that is the same as proving the volcanic resurfacing event. There could be some other mechanism, possibly even as of yet not discovered. So I want to leave the door open." Indeed, since the dawn of the Space Age the planet Venus has been a proving ground for competing hypotheses in planetary science. From the 1950's to 1970's Venus was at the center of a blazing scientific controversy. In 1950 in the best-selling book 'Worlds in Collision' the scientific heretic Immanuel Velikovsky proposed that the planet Venus is a very recent addition to the inner solar system and threatened the Earth as a terrifying comet. By studying the ancient accounts of far-flung cultures Velikovsky constructed a thesis of celestial catastrophe. The converging ancient imagery includes Babylonian, Aztec, Peruvian and Egyptian representations of Venus using the unmistakable language and symbols for comets. As we've outlined many times based on his thesis of Venus's recent cometary birth Velikovsky made the outrageous prediction that Venus would be found to be extraordinarily hot and dry. This was in stark contrast to the predictions of many noted astronomers including the originator of the dirty snowball comet model Fred Whipple who proposed that Venus would be covered with oceans. Of course, Venus was found to be the hottest planet in the solar system with an average surface temperature of 864 ºF The consensus belief in planetary science today is that Venus's dense, mostly carbon dioxide atmosphere, has caused heating through a runaway greenhouse effect. However the fatal objections to this hypothesis have never been resolved. As the astronomer Victor A. Firsoff noted, "Earth's seas are not boiling hot, despite the total greenhouse effect of water and average sunlight stronger than at the ground level of Venus. Nor is it at all clear how such a condition could have become established." Physicist Wal Thornhill addressed the issue in a 2003 article on his website holoscience.com "Venus receives 1.9 times more solar radiation than Earth but its clouds reflect about 80% of that sunlight, so that Venus actually absorbs less solar energy than the Earth... Even with the maximum greenhouse effect, the effective surface temperature of Venus should be low enough to freeze water. What is being asked of the 'runaway greenhouse effect' is equivalent to expecting a well-insulated oven to reach a temperature sufficient to melt led by having only the pilot light switched on!" In the electrical hypothesis Venus's recent electrical birthing from a gas giant and its recent capture do explain the stunning absence of so-called impact craters. The surface of Venus is covered with extraordinary networks of filamentary scars. In Venus's spectacular near-Earth cometary displays electrical discharging heated its crust and produced the filamentary patterns. As Thornhill notes, "Lightning occurring in a high-pressure gas causes this filamentary 'Lichtenberg' pattern. At low atmospheric pressures, cratering is more common - as we see on the Moon." In fact, most of the features that planetary scientists interpret as "volcanoes" and ancient lava flows are electrical scars which can be uncannily reproduced in experiments with electrical discharge. Of course, this can be applied to so-called volcanic features throughout the entire solar system In our 2017 interview with Garrett Hill, he showed the results of applying electrical discharge to particulate matter. On your screen the top image is the famous Martian "shield volcano" Olympus Mons. The bottom feature was produced by electrical discharge. In similar experiments, we also see stunning formations of both radial and lateral patterns which planetary scientists typically attribute to fluidic processes such as lava flow. Now consider this side-by-side comparison of the electrical discharge features to the Ovda region on Venus. Thornhill also proposes that scientists' detection of sulfur dioxide in Venus's atmosphere need not necessarily imply ongoing episodic volcanism. He writes, "It is also possible that another simple nuclear reaction is taking place at the surface of Venus, involving the combination of the two atoms of oxygen in an oxygen molecule to form one atom of sulphur. It is a process occurring today in plain view on Jupiter's moon, Io. In any case, volcanoes are an electric discharge phenomenon so that the discovery of active volcanoes on Venus cannot be used as a distinguishing test for or against the electrical model of Venus." Institutional science dismissed Velikovsky's evidentiary case because it disobeyed Newton's law of gravity which has no means of restoring order from chaos. But as Thornhill explains, science today functions with no physical explanation for the force of gravity which Newton himself admitted and Einstein avoided the problem by discarding the force without explanation. So what astronomers have are mere mathematical descriptions of gravity's effects. In the Electric Universe as developed by Thornhill, the 19th century concept of gravity as an electrodynamic force between all subatomic particles in the universe is reinstated. This thesis proposes that order in the solar system was restored by charge exchange between planets aided by slower charge exchange between a planet and the solar wind in the form of a cometary discharge. There can be no question that Venus's recent cometary origins resolve countless enduring mysteries of the planet including its orbit which is the most circular of all the planets in the solar system, its odd rotation, its superhot temperature, its vast cometary tail, its electrically agitated super-heavy atmosphere, its tremendous networks of filamentary scars, and its lack of so-called impact craters. The comet Venus, first proposed nearly 3/4 of a century ago, is a challenge to the very foundations of planetary science and the mythical 4.5 billion year history of our solar system. It is past time for scientists to meet this challenge and to finally seek new answers which await in our Electric Universe. 
welcome to space news from the electric universe brought to you by the thunderbolts project at Thunderbolts and dot info astronomers today are puzzling over the unexpected brightening of a recently discovered comment on October 20th an observer in Japan noted that the brightness of comet x1 linear was over 100 times greater than astronomers expectations on October 21st astronomers in New Mexico confirmed the surprising outburst other cometary displays have captured the world's attention in recent years in 2007 the periodic comet home 17p stunned the science world when it abruptly brightened by a factor of about half a million making its coma temporarily the largest object in the solar system astronomers attribute these cometary outbursts to the sublimation of ices from solar heating but does this explanation fit with the facts why are we surprised when comets flare up unexpectedly I think the answer lies in the fact that we don't understand comets it's as simple as that the story of comets is associated with the story of the formation of the solar system and the story of the formation of the solar system is that once upon a time story dreamt up centuries ago which has merely been patched as new information comes to light you would have expected that close flybys of comets and the capture of material from the tail of a comet would have been sufficient evidence to make people consider some other alternative ideas but this hasn't happened so we continue to be surprised by comets now comets in the electrical model flare up simply because they are suddenly caused to discharge either by a sudden change in their environment brought about by charged particles from the Sun suddenly arriving or by a gradual change in voltage as the comet approaches the Sun or receipts from the Sun and that voltage is impressed across the interior of the comet because the comet in effect acts a bit like a capacitor and if you over stress a capacitor it explodes they can quite dangerous this is why capacitors have a voltage rating on them so this gives a very simple explanation for these flaring x' and so on of comets but it also explains why just recently an asteroid produced a coma and a tail as it swung around the Sun and asteroids are not supposed to produce cometary displays and the question there was how do you machine all this head you get this dust to come off the comet there's no good answer to that in the standard theory because that relies on evaporating sublimating ices and so on buried out of sight inside the comet nucleus I say out of sight because when you look at comets from images sent back by spacecraft flybys and so on beginning with Halle you see a surface which is extremely dark darker than soot there's no sign of ices generally there are some white spots but the question is what are those white spots they don't necessarily mean ices and you also see sculptured surfaces now if a body is just evaporating in sunlight you would expect to see a object that looks a bit like a melting ice cream or you would expect to see material coming off it in a cloud Comet ologists also struggle to explain the highly collimated Jets of material that sometimes explode from cometary surfaces what is seen from comets thin filamentary Jets and there's some good examples which are shown here now to get guests to expand in a filament requires a very finely machine nozzle so the suggestion that material is being shot from beneath the surface by expanding gases doesn't make much sense the standard explanation for these Jets is that material is being sublimated turned from solid ice to a gas beneath the surface it punches a hole in the surface and then emerges as a jet but these Jets should be misshapen instead of that we see highly collimated Jets ones that are obviously under the control of some external force to maintain their integrity over vast distances none of this fits any explanation involving just heat and an icy substance in the sunlight why is it assumed that the material that is sublimating from comets according to theory is water ice the answer is the hydroxyl radical it's an oxygen atom in a hydrogen atom are found in the comas of comets now the standard explanation for that is of course that the ultraviolet light from the Sun which is quite intense breaks up the water molecules into its constituent parts one of which is the hydroxyl radical the O H however ultraviolet light will split water up into positive ions it strips and electrons often leaves positively charged parts of the water molecule behind but some of the earliest observations of comet nuclei showed that very close to the comet nucleus and this was found at comet Halley there is an abundance about a hundred times anything that was expected of negative ions now negative ions are produced in an electric discharge from a cathode surface and this is what's been discovered cathode Jets also create highly collimated filaments all of these things fit the observations none of the standard theory fits the observations an opportunity to test the explicit predictions of the electric comet Theory came in 2005 with NASA's Deep Impact mission to comet Tempel 1 the test of a new hypothesis is successful prediction the more unexpected the better using the electrical model of cometary activity I predicted almost 4 years in advance that is when it was announced that the Deep Impact mission to comet Tempel 1 would produce two flashes a small flash before impact as the nucleus discharged to the projectile rather like the spark sometimes as you reach for a metal doorknob amongst other things I also predicted an unexpectedly energetic flash to follow the impact I wrote back then the energetic effects of the encounter should exceed that of a simple physical impact in the same way that was seen with Comet shoemaker-levy 9 at Jupiter after the event nasa expert Peter Schultz suggested that the initial flash indicates a layered structure for the comet and I quote my guess is there was soft layering on top the impact that went down and finally got in contact with Isis this ad-hoc hypothesis of unbelievably fragile outer layers is now treated as an observational fact a confirmation in the words of deep impact investigator Michael Ahern notably however the impact released very little water however when temple one was revisited by the Stardust spacecraft on February 15 2011 the expected crater showed no sign of deep penetration the crater was almost indiscernible as if the impactor had hit solid rock or partially vaporized before impact once again the ad hoc explanations were weak by quote stuff went up and came back down and I quote again the crater partly healed itself presumably by some magical effect but a hard surface might have been anticipated both from the Comets appearance and much earlier evidence from radar returns from comet Encke II that implies a non-porous probably rock surface material this gets down to the fact that comets show a sculptured surface the puzzling erosion of an escarpment on comet Tempel 1 is simply explained by the tendency of a cathode spark machining to initiate on a sharp edge and electrically edge or sputter extremely fine material progressively back from the edge the extreme fineness of Comet dust was first remarked upon following the encounters with comet Halley because it wasn't expected of interstellar dust grains I suggest that the unexplained white spots which are observed to a favour such locations are active cathode arcs and there's prior evidence for this suggestion the prediction was made based on the electric universe that the outburst would be much more intense than would be expected from a purely mechanical impact and the discharge was so intense that the expected images that would be sent back of the comet crater just did an event rating these detectives were overloaded they just could not film the surface of the comet after the event the electrical model says that if you introduce an object which is at a completely different charged state to the comet itself then you will get an electrical outburst so there was a large amount of electrical energy involved also a few splatter highly conductive copper vaporized copper near a charged object than the other jets that happen to be on the surface of that object at the time will suddenly concentrate in the area of high conductivity so I also predicted that the Jets would move the ones that existed before and that was also borne out for continuous updates on

in the course of the Rosetta mission to comet 67p the electric comet hypothesis will face many scientific tests and the tests can be continually reviewed as Rosetta reports now to long-delayed see the light of day the core concepts of the electric comet involved two levels of evidence one relating to the look and behavior of a comet as we observe it the other relating to a comet's origins we've emphasized the electrical behavior due to a comet's motion through regions of different charge in the plasma domain of the Sun Comet origins on the other hand require a good deal more than observation in our own time the electric comet requires us to look back in time to an epoch of planetary catastrophe avoiding this would only mean losing the opportunity to understand what a comet really is this includes the connection of comets to our own planet and to the most awe-inspiring and terrifying events in human history both levels of evidence are strongly fortified by laboratory experiments and it's these experiments that help us to unify present observation of comets with the extraordinary ancient descriptions of these bodies we understand that this subject will bring discomfort to many the idea of planetary catastrophe and geologically recent times will never fit comfortably with the overarching assumption of theoretical science today we call that assumption the uniformity principle the idea that we can understand the past through things we see occurring now as today so before in contrast the electric comet idea forces us to consult the astronomical testimony of our early forebears we're independent accounts told with different words and different symbols and in different parts of the world convey a story of planetary catastrophe glimpses of that story are told in the documentary symbols of an alien sky and a second episode the Lightning scarred planet Mars consider the latter documentary and you'll understand why we see the red planet as the first and most logical candidate to investigate on the matter of comets borne and planetary catastrophe the ancient astronomical traditions direct our attention to the red planet as the source of fire and stone hurled by a cosmic warrior God a thousand different traditions present this warrior figure in ways unique to each culture but one feature in particular consistently stands out the identification of this warrior archetype with the planet Mars we've said this many times don't believe in coincidence the subject here is a global human experience whose logical implications can be tested down to innumerable details in this way consistent human testimony will give us the answer to the question how were comets born the electrical investigation has been underway for decades and the converging lines of inquiry bring us face to face with the planet Mars massive evidence points directly to the excavation of surface material and bedrock from the planet comets are recent additions to the solar system they were born in events remembered around the world as we intend to show clearly and definitively the planet Mars was immersed in electric discharge removing material up to several miles deep and REE sculpting the entire Martian surface with no regional exceptions yes the claim is outrageous but in the end everyone concerned with the truth of the matter will be required to look at the full range of facts as evidence that means across all of the disciplines that hold potential answers as we continue to review the rosetta mission will not lose sight of the human story reminding us why comets were anciently feared around the world as symbols of planetary catastrophe 
Rosetta Mission Update Jets of Comet 67P ― Failed "Explanations" Continue It seems that the puzzle of cometary jets continues to haunt comet science. The mystery has been stated and restated for decades. But it's possible that a resolution is now within reach through the Rosetta mission to comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko. As a comet moves into the inner solar system, surface activity creates a cloud of gas and dust to form a roughly spherical coma. With a closer look, we see radial jets erupting from the surface at remarkable velocities to feed gas and dust into the coma. What is acting on the surface to create the jets? And what is holding the accelerated gas and dust in its collimated form, a persistently narrow and filamentary structure in the vacuum of interplanetary space. Rosetta investigators have calculated the speed of the 67P jets at their source. They give the figure as 700 meters per second. That means gas and dust departing the comet nucleus at a speed of 7,5 football fields in one second. Theorists have offered an explanation of a comet's jets. Uneven warming of an irregular surface creates pockets of sublimating gases beneath the surface. These pockets of gas become the reservoirs of geyser-like activity. "Gas and dust bursts forth like a geyser... An area below the surface warms up and punches through the surface with explosive force due to its gas content. In comets, the emerging gas carries a stream of dust along with it." But the theory offered cannot be reconciled with data now in hand. The speed of 67P's jets is significantly greater than the speed of gas escaping through a small hole in a high-pressure gas line. But the shallow surface layer of dry dust on 67P, offers nothing like the resistance necessary to build up such pressure. And if the jets do indeed point to subsurface pockets of gas breaking through a dusty surface, it seems quite clear that the signature of such activity would be readily apparent. An energy curve suggestive of an explosive release of gas pressure. And an explosive expansion and dissipation of the released gas across a short distance in the vacuum of space. And of course, we would also expect immediate exposure of the supposedly sublimating ice beneath the dry surface. Do we see any sign of these expected signatures of jet chambers below the surface? It's fair to say that to date nothing of the sort has been observed. And yet, the creation of comet jets, the acceleration away from the nucleus and the structure maintained across vast distances, must have a reasonable explanation even if we have to look beyond standard theory to find it. It was just a few years ago that the spectacular jets of comet Hartley 2 placed a huge exclamation point on the need for new perspectives. Powerful jets were seen not just from the sunlit side of the comet but from the region in shadow and the persistent energies of the jets offered no support for the standard idea of exploding pockets of gas. All we've actually seen at the source of comet jets, is evidence of electrical activity on the surface, extending valleys by eroding away cliffs, mesas and ridges. We saw this on comet Tempel 1 where such activity had eroded a mesa cliff some 35 meters. Considering the simplicity of the standard model of cometary jet activity, one wonders why no experimental verification has ever been produced. One of the simplest experiments conceivable would simply use a laboratory vacuum chamber, place into the chamber the ideal concoction of ice and dust just to see if remote warming would produce anything like the jet activity imagined. We unhesitatingly predict that when the obvious required experiment is performed, it will leave every comet investigator in a state of profound disillusionment. Cometary jets are not driven by thermodynamics. They are electrical phenomena naturally occurring in the transaction between a charged body, a comet, and the electric field of the Sun. 
Welcome Space News from the Electric Universe brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info How old and how stable is our solar system? On this question astronomers have grown more uncertain year by year. The actual history of the planets could be a far cry from anything we learned in school. Here's our reporter Cameron Mercer, with excerpts from his conversation with the electrical theorist Wal Thornhill. We have always lived in a very interesting solar system, however, we've never been able to pin down just how interesting it is. First it was entirely special, with no equal anywhere else then, a century ago, sentiment gradually shifted and people started to understand our solar system as a common occurrence. There were bound to be other solar systems out there, just like ours, waiting to be found. Less than two decades ago we started making our first observations of other solar systems and the more we find the stranger our seems to be. The solar system has actually been described as weird, when compared to planetary systems around nearby stars. We seem to have the gas giants much further away from the Sun then similar planets are around nearby stars. Around nearby stars those giant planets orbit very closely to their star and the answer to this problem is another ad hoc addition to the theories of how the solar system formed and that is that the giant planets were not form where we see them now they must have migrated because all the exoplanets that we've discovered are large planets even larger than Jupiter orbiting their central star in days or even hours in some cases. So, those systems of planets are quite different to anything that we see in our own solar system. This raises the issue of how exactly did our solar system form and why are our gas giants so far from the Sun? As straightforward a question as this seams this is actually proven very difficult to answer. Astronomers quickly learned that the general theory of solar system formation couldn't work for our own solar system since it postulates that planets form in more or less their current orbits. Uranus and Neptune are far out, too far out to a form where they are today. So, in 2005 some French astronomers came up with a brilliant idea. What if the planets orbits could move? Maybe then, they could migrate from some earlier state to the improbable arrangement that we see now. This idea had been entirely untested, until recently. In 2005, Nature magazine published a paper, which has become known as the Nice paper, because it came from France, and that paper was trying to find the early stage of the solar system and finding that nothing worked for Uranus and Neptune, the outermost guest giants. The guest giants simply couldn't have formed at a great distance, because it takes far too much time for them to have accreted from a cloud of dust and gas. So, the Nice model was proposed which supposes the gas giants formed in close where they are more likely to form. Now, this recent paper is the first simulation of the Nice model and it's tried to simulate changes which could produce Uranus and Neptune at their present distances and also Jupiter and Saturn in their present far-flung orbits from the Sun. The simulations of the Nice model show that Uranus and Neptune remain a problem, we still cannot make a planetary system that looks like our solar system theoretically. David Nesvony, of the Colorado Southwest Research Institute, ran over 6,000 simulations of the Nice model in his searching for a viable early stage of the solar system. He had 4 target criteria that, if met would qualify the simulation as a potential early state the solar system. In only 2.5% of cases were they able to satisfy just the first 2 criteria out of 4. This is a huge problem for the current theory of solar system formation, it means the early solar system could not look like it does now, with Neptune and Uranus in the outer reaches. The paper concludes with the formation of Uranus and Neptune, the outermost gas giants, and say that it's just long-standing problem in planetary science and the paper finishes with 'future work will be needed to address these issues'. Astronomers are heading down the right path, starting first with a theory of static formation which hadn't the slightest to performing our system they proceeded to then consider planetary migration. David Nesvony took this yet a step further and considered planetary ejection in which case he found his chances of producing our current solar system increased almost tenfold over the Nice model. It seemed certain that the solar system required rearrangement of the planets to explain their present placing and characteristics. The Nice model wasn't enough, just rearranging planets, so the next thing was ejection, but that also hasn't been enough. Did something more dramatic occurred to produce the solar system we see today? In all the theoretical work that has taken place, we have assumed that all of the matter that's in the solar system right now began their. No one, except in the very early days, considered capture of objects from beyond the solar system. There was good reason for this, to do so the object coming into the solar system has to lose energy and gravity doesn't offer any simple way of doing that. In the Electric Universe, there is electrical exchange which can take place and captures very much more likely than it is in the gravitational model. So, the very fact that we do have gas giants like Neptune and Uranus at distances from the Sun where they could not have accreted suggests that they were captured. Not only that, the motion of Pluto and some of the outer moons do suggest capture, rather than having been formed in place.

[conversation] . I hear people talking about “we have disruptive technology.” Our position on it is, maybe a little more gentle, in the sense that technology doesn't have to destroy economies. We don't believe they should. We believe that they should be transformative, to how people migrate, or progress from one level to the other. Disruptive technologies - well, they just don't typically work very well. So transformative technology works like nature itself. It considers all the factors: functional, economic, environmental, social and political. It doesn't produce toxic waste, antithetical to life. It doesn't attempt to bankrupt an existing system, or put humans out of work. Why would you want to bankrupt your customer? It’s transformative, it transforms it doesn't trash. [Music] Montgomery Childs and his wife, Tracy are on their way to Baltimore. Monty is going to deliver his third presentation to the Electric Universe group. [Music] For two years, he has been developing a way to test the Electric Sun model. [Music] In my professional life, one of the things I do, is diagnose systems and make them stable. Stable systems are often the consequence of a stable process. [Music] There are billions of stars in our galaxy. For as long as we have been watching them, their luminosity, spectral nature, and thermal characteristics have remained relatively constant. Statistically, it points to a very stable system. A supernova, or a pulsar, is so rare an event, as to be considered an outlier, and not that relevant in the overall equation. [Music] In industry, if you have something as statistically stable as the stars appear to be, this suggests a relatively simple process. And we have a tool for studying process. [Music] In January of 2012, David Talbot invited Monty Childs to give a presentation at the Electric Universe conference in Las Vegas. Monty introduced Design Of Experiments (DOE) as a methodology for testing the Electric Universe model. Of the 300 people in the audience, few had heard of the concept of Design Of Experiments. But one person, Scott Mainwaring, became very intrigued. “...SAFIRE, Stellar Atmospheric Function in Regulation Experiment. So what we want to do, is we want to validate the EU model, as it relates to the Sun...” At the next conference, in 2013, Monty  suggested a number of experiments that might be done to test the Electric Universe model, by focusing on the Sun. The Electric Universe group asked him to write up a formal proposal for a project designed to do exactly that. [Music] I can't imagine, how you could ever test the thermonuclear fusion model of the Sun. To my knowledge, we've never been able to replicate sustained nuclear fusion on Earth. But the Electric Sun model is different. Electricity is something we've been experimenting with for centuries. And electricity, in the form of plasma even though the word “plasma” is relatively recent, we've been aware of this phenomenon for over a century and a half. Two years of research, has led me to the conclusion that the Electric Sun model might be boiled down to a fundamental process: charged plasma, affecting matter of a different electrical potential. Now charged plasma, matter, and electrical potential; these are things that can be experimented with in a lab. Scott Mainwaring gave me a paper written in 1879 by Sir William Crookes. [Music] Michael Faraday was 24 years old, when he coined the phrase “radiant matter” to describe, what he believed was the fourth state of matter. Sixty years later, Sir William Crookes was one of the first to truly experiment with this fourth state of matter. [Music] He placed rubies in a vacuum tube, filled with a rarefied gas. There was an anode at one end, a cathode at the other. He introduced sufficient voltage to ignite the radiant matter. The rubies started glowing red. Crookes talked about radiant matter and phosphorescence. The radiant matter is now called “plasma”. I read Crookes work and studied the photographs and work of Kristian Birkeland, created between 1896 and 1913. [Music] In his “terella” experiments, Birkeland used an electrified globe in a vacuum chamber. The images he produced, are remarkably similar to modern photographs of the Sun. Robert Quinn and Ralph Fiorito, produced similar images in 1967, while attempting to generate plasma stability. [Music] [Music] The Electric Universe people had already seen a similarity between Birkeland’s terella and the interaction between the Earth and the Sun. I suspect the underlying process is, charged plasma, affecting matter of a different electrical potential. I'm wondering, if it might actually be the process that makes stars shine. Possibilty, feasibility, viability and capability; and that doesn't just apply to whether or not we can replicate the phenomena in a laboratory experiment, but it also means, the means by which we measure, are they capable? No theoretical models, no extrapolations, no interpolations, no mathematical adjustments of the data. Do we have a ruler that we can actually all agree on that's a standard. At the Albuquerque conference in 2013, Monty Childs presents a detailed proposal for how to proceed with the tests. “...and if the experiment is feasible. So all these things have to be addressed right upfront, before we even start spending a nickel.” “...it means that we have the ability to modify or adjust its potential relative to its environment.” Okay. You're saying yes. These guys may want to go to a megawatt or something, and then do you might null the whole show...” Key people from the Electric Universe group offer questions and suggestions. ”...I can take a look at the chamber design and its boundary conditions...” Then give it their support. Bruce  Mainwaring and Scott Mainwaring, of the Mainwaring Archive Foundation, agree to finance the project under the auspices of the International Science Foundation. It will be called the Stellar Atmospheric Function In Regulation Experiment, the SAFIRE project. The aim of SAFIRE is to explore the electrical nature of the Sun's environment and by implication, the processes involved in the functioning of stars. “... it's going to go from hydrogen here, mixing with iron, to helium and it's going to be a series of pretty...” Over the next six months, I spent a lot of time on the phone with a number of the Electric Universe people. “... ten trillion degrees like...” Bit by bit, I could see a potential team slowly taking shape. Monty and Tracy  Childs arrive in Baltimore. The Natural Philosophy Alliance is holding their 20th annual conference at the University of Maryland, College Park. They have invited the Electric Universe group to contribute presentations. ”...and asked ourselves now the question that has never been asked in 70 years of solar physics, is the Sun truly an island in space. With no electrical connection to billions of stars and the sea of plasma that constitutes the Milky Way...” “...what we want to do is capture in real time, not just a qualitative...” Monty offers a summary of the SAFIRE project. ”...see if we can pick up any ion acceleration occurring just outside the sheath...” Given that the Electric Universe hypothesis is challenging current conventional theory, “... so you can imagine electron temperatures of 10 million...” I was expecting a bit of resistance at the NPA. But NPA people didn’t seem at all intimidated by what we were proposing to do. Quite the contrary. ”...over 40 kilowatts so get fusion...” I found them very helpful and very encouraging. “...you'll have these charges, yeah...” [Music] ”....so can transformative technology work on future itself..... it considers all the factors, functional, economic environmental, social, and political. It doesn't produce toxic waste, antithetical to life. It doesn't attempt to bankrupt an existing system, or put humans out of work. Why would you want to bankrupt your customer? ... it’s transformative, it transforms, it doesn't trash...” These are some of the capabilities of the SAFIRE Lab. I won't list them out loud; this is just to give you an idea of the potential of the lab, and we keep adding to the list. To be pragmatic in the real world, we had to select a few to take forward into commercial applications. Here are the capabilities we have chosen - A fully functioning plasma laboratory for experiments - An energy generating reactor for producing clean energy - An energy generating reactor for remediating nuclear waste. [Music] 
in the next eight to ten minutes i want to preview the presentation i'll give on the opening night of the eu 2014 conference in albuquerque march 20th to 24th the electric discharge formation you see here rising above easter island was originally outlined to me by plasma scientist tony peratt in 2002 at the time he was the leader in his field heading up projects at los alamos laboratories but let's start with just one question has the sky changed completely in recent millennia today's theorists in the physical sciences and in the study of the human past are addicted to projecting our sky onto the ancient landscape as today so before in our investigation this uniformity principle will never work here's a brief video sequence highlighting the reason why it happened just a few thousand years ago when we lived in the presence of the gods powers ruled the celestial theater in the lost age of gods and wonders planets gathered in close congregation as if alive engaging each other electrically but then the gods grew violent and they went to war driving human witnesses to take shelter in caves and rocky enclosures humans left to remember to remember the powers of the gods formations and cosmic events not to be forgotten and so the question if anything like the event suggested here did indeed occur how could we know my own inspiration on this question came from emmanuel velikovsky one of the most controversial theorists of the 20th century i published a 10 issue series on velikovsky in the early 1970s transforming a local student journal into a popular international journal and leading directly to a highly publicized debate between velikovsky and astronomer carl sagan in 1974 we know now that velikovsky was wrong on many details but what about the deepest questions that he raised he found in ancient testimony the undeniable echoes of planetary catastrophe making clear that the modern idea of billion-year stable planetary motions cannot be correct and the centerpiece of his argument was evidence repeated around the world that the planet venus approached the earth as a devastating and frightful comet it's indeed ironic to find a reliable footing in this field we have no choice but to plunge into the origins of ancient myths and symbols and magical practices that's because this is where we find hundreds of converging human memories globally fitted together like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle the world altering fall of heavenly bodies the dying god and the dark clouds of ensuing chaos the universal goddess venus including her frightful or terrible aspect the cosmic warrior mars and the warriors defeat of the improbable dragon who imprisoned the goddess figure or threatened to destroy the world the celestial serpent whose own body came to form the steps of a cosmic stairway or tower of heaven and of course the story of a former stationary sun or central luminary of the sky why did the world's first astronomers name this primeval power as the planet saturn saturn a planetary god said to have presided over a lost paradise and identified as the primeval son the central son the true son or best son ruling before the present age but enigmatically this exemplary power was also the displaced god and the devourer of his own children exiled to remote realms it's all truly a ludicrous fabrication unless we've misunderstood our past completely such that we can neither comprehend nor explain the stunning convergence of ancient testimony i had the privilege in 1972 have seen an outline of velikovsky's claim unpublished at the time that the planet saturn was originally seen as an immense sphere in the sky in close connection to earth for me that claim cried out for exploration and it led directly to my own life's work and to publication of my book the saturn myth in 1980 when the publisher double date was the largest publisher in the world as the reconstruction stands today it goes far beyond velikovsky's claims it encompasses virtually all of the archetypal themes of the ancient world just consider the global image of so-called sun wheels this form has nothing to do with our sun today carved on stone everywhere it was central to all ancient cultures but what did it signify all lines of evidence point to a dynamic and evolving configuration of planets planets that are named close to the earth and immense in the ancient sky when we place the configuration in three-dimensional space the demands of perspective are extraordinary then we must take into account the respective sizes of the bodies the relative motions systematic changes in the number and appearance of discharge streamers and the shifting position of earth as these changes occurred seen in three dimensions it's not even possible to just make up explanations whatever provoked the ancient images they are historical fact irrespective of any modern interpretation and the facts include the stunning astronomical identification of saturn as the ancient sun definitive patterns stand out above the carnival of later forgetfulness localization fragmentation and cultural invention the bedrock of fact will not allow for mere guesses at things beneath the carnival of cultural confusion lies a global substructure of human memory the archetypes the points of agreement this is why my own convergence with wal thornhill in the mid-90s was so important to us he was just beginning to emerge as the premier spokesman for the electric universe when he stepped forward to support the reconstruction in electrical terms then came the convergence with the leading plasma scientist tony peratt in 2000 a convergence that forever changed his life and my own spectacular forms in the sky i had reconstructed were suddenly illuminated by tony's expertise the turning point came instantly when i sent one prehistoric pictograph to him from cayenneta arizona he immediately recognized what could have no other explanation in fact the research team at los alamos had named this highest energy discharge form after him a parat instability what i did not know at the time was that this form in the laboratory collapsed into another more commonly recorded form in the ancient world what tony came to call the squatter man then a series of mysteries fell into place in terms of a known discharge sequence including the mythic chain of arrows over which i'd puzzled for years the stairway or ladder of heaven and the eye mask or allied goddess all finding clarity and well-documented electric discharge forms in the plasma laboratory i'm hoping that these bearish glimpses of a very large story will attract you to the upcoming thunderbolts project conference in the course of this event i'll show much of the content scheduled for episodes four and five of symbols of an alien sky and if you've not seen the original episode the full documentary is available on the thunderbolts project youtube channel hoping to see you in albuquerque you 
[Music] This is a short talk about yet another ”here we go again” moment, when I came across an article in Scientific American from March 2018, entitled, The Sun is Spitting Out Strange Patterns of Gamma Rays - and No One Knows Why. I did not know much about the subject, but I silently made a bet with myself that 1) The existing theory of gamma rays from the Sun would be based upon gravity and random motions, 2) The new improved data would completely contradict the predictions of that gravity model, 3) The article would bring in dark matter and a few quotes to the effect of “we are completely surprised by what we are seeing, maybe there's new physics here,” and 4) Of course nothing would be said about a possible electrical explanation. This  was admittedly a somewhat cynical wager, yet I did win the bet on all four accounts. I reviewed Don Scott and Hannes Alfven models of the Sun's electrical connections to its larger environment and I had some discussions with Wal Thornhill about the gamma-ray data. The Sun puts out very few gamma rays. It seems there are very few gamma rays in the entire universe, at least in comparison to the number of photons that we see with our eyes. Gamma rays are a type of light which is very, very energetic, billions of times more energetic than the photons of light that power photosynthesis and average biological processes. The  recent papers from 2018 and 2019 summarize ten years of gamma ray data from the Sun taken by the Fermi Telescope. Let's see how well the Standard Model prediction stacks up against the published data. I made a little chart - on the left are the basic questions and then the Standard Model and the data. How  many gamma rays would we expect to see from the Sun? The Standard Model predicts a certain number that would be observed, the data shows we see anywhere from 10 to 100 times more than was predicted, based upon the energies. Where should we see the gamma rays come from? The Standard Model says that the rays should come from the Sunspot regions. What do we see? Well, the rays come from the entire disk, and also from around the Sun and also from above the poles of the Sun. What distribution of energies would we expect? The Standard Model says that the spectrum should be smooth, and weighted with very few high energy gamma rays. The data shows far too many high energy rays, and a clear gap in the 40 to 50 giga electron volt range. When during the solar cycle would we expect to see the gamma rays? Standard Model says there should be more gamma rays during solar maximum when there's more sunspots. The data shows just the opposite. And would we see gamma rays from solar flares? The Standard Model says no, and the data says yes. To quote a few of the authors and reviewers, Brian Fields, a particle astrophysicist from University of Illinois says, “It's amazing that we were so spectacularly wrong about something we should understand really well: the Sun.” Tim Linden a particle astrophysicist at Ohio State who helped analyze the data said, ”The forty to fifty giga electron volt dip just defies all logic.” And Mehr Un Nisa at Michigan State University said, ”Analysis of nine years of data collected by Fermi-LAT from the Sun revealed a very bright steady emission of gamma rays at energies above 100 GeV that contradicted all theoretical expectations.” What is this standard cosmology model that is so spectacularly incorrect? It is a model built upon isolation and random destruction. This model says that our Sun, like every star, is energetically isolated from all other stars. It says that stars like ours cannot produce any gamma rays of their own from their surface, and hence any observed gamma rays coming from the Sun must be coming from somewhere else. In this model, if the Sun cannot make its own gamma rays then where can we look? The phenomenon to the rescue are cosmic rays. Cosmic rays are a bit of a mystery. We observe very high energy particles impacting the earth from all directions and we call these cosmic rays. They are known to come from pulsars, like the Crab Nebula, but that one clear observational fact is usually greatly downplayed in favor of the Standard Model description of cosmic rays, which says that they come from the most cataclysmic events imaginable, like dying exploding superstars and colliding black holes, and colliding and exploding magnetars and colliding, exploding galaxies. You get the picture. The Standard Model paints a picture of our isolated Sun in a sea of debris generated from random destruction. Occasionally a stray bullet from this mayhem will ricochet through a sunspot magnetic field and be flung towards the earth. As already said, every prediction of this model was incorrect. The data is fascinating. The solid circle in the middle is the disc of the photosphere; the outer dashed circle is the outer limit of where they collected the  data. Each dot is a gamma ray detected. The left two panels are from solar maximum when there's many sunspots and during which the previous model predicted there'd be more gamma rays. The right two panels are from solar minimum, where there are few sunspots and the previous model predicted there will be fewer  counts. I am struck by how little data there is. Over 10 years and we have only a few hundred data points? These solar gamma-ray events are very rare. I admit the telescope is very small and very far away from the Sun but still, compared to the gazillions of visible light photons coming off the Sun every second, gamma rays are rare events. How  might this data make more sense if we include electricity in our cosmology? If we pull back and look at the filaments of the interstellar medium, all stars and planets are very, very small specks on much larger filaments. The distance scales here are difficult to comprehend. Do you remember those comparisons, if the entire atom were the size of a football stadium, then the  nucleus would be a golf ball in the center? Those are the sort of sizes we need to imagine for stars in galactic filaments. I will try a metaphor, using cities here on Earth to understand the sizes involved with the filament model. Imagine the galactic filament is the high tension power lines connecting entire cities on Earth. If we zoom into one city, that is the region of the filament where our Sun  lives. Zoom in further to a football stadium in that city, that is the full body of our solar  system and then all the planets and the bright disk of the Sun what we usually think of as our solar system are all contained in that little golf ball  in the center of the stadium. From this, how then do we get 10 billion electron volt gamma-ray bursts? Does this mean that the galactic currents have this kind of voltage? No, not at all. Think about lightning on Earth and about the upward shooting sprites and elves. The Earth's global electric circuit only sustains a few hundred thousand volts between the ground and the upper cloud layers. Yet, in a strong thunderstorm, we see gamma rays corresponding to many millions  of volts. How do we explain this apparent contradiction? Where did the energy come from, since locally there is only a hundred thousand volts between the cloud and the ground? As Alfven pointed out, in a distributed electrical circuit, such as the electrical grid for a town, the energy from the entire grid can be released at one small point during an explosive breakdown. The transformer might only have a thousand volts across it, yet when it explodes, it releases electrons with millions of volts. How? Because the transformer is just a  small piece of a much larger circuit. The same explains how sprites and elves above storm clouds can send gamma rays out into space packed with billions of volts. If you read the existing literature about elves and sprites, the explanations are stuck on exactly this point. They are not including that the burst is part of the entire electrical circuit of the Earth. The same applies to the Sun. The surface of the Sun and the corona of the Sun are all connected to a much larger circuit that includes and reaches beyond our visible Sun. Explosive releases in the form of gamma rays can happen inside of that photosphere surface. They can happen above the surface, or even several radii away from the Sun, because the electrical body of the Sun extends out to the heliopause and is connected to a circuit that reaches to the neighboring stars. The filament model predicts that we should see at least some high energy events analogous to the strongest lightning on Earth. Studying  the Earth gamma rays will teach us how to better understand the Sun's electrical environment. What about the polar component? The authors say that there is a steady source of gamma rays coming from the polar regions of the Sun. In the Standard Model this is unexplainable, because the Standard Model says that above the poles are weak magnetic fields that are relatively straight. Hence, they would  be unable to bend cosmic rays. But in the electrical model, stars are connected through their poles to larger filaments that stretch for many light years, connecting multiple stars into one larger circuit. Charged particles flowing towards stars, would have a very long running distance along these smooth magnetic field lines and be capable of picking up very large energies. In the electrical model, we would expect to see a relatively constant source of high energy emissions coming from the polar regions, which is exactly what the data shows. The authors further describe an equatorial component of the data. I do not see that so clearly and I think maybe they are holding on to the Standard Model which says that there should be something special about the Sunspot region. It looks to me that the rays are coming from a sheath that surrounds the photosphere. It looks to me that the gamma rays are not at all limited to what we would call the surface of the Sun. The data  is spread out around the Sun. This region around the photosphere is where atoms become stripped of their outer electrons, which is usually interpreted as thermal heat. Contemporary astronomers look at the ions around the Sun and say that the corona must have an enormous heat and temperature of millions of  degrees. But this stripping of electrons could have an electrical, or even a chemical cause and not be related to anything, like temperature as we have defined it on our cold, wet planet. Remember, you can strip electrons off of water with a 5,000 degree oven or with a 9 Volt battery at room temperature. According to Don Scott's model which builds upon the model of Hannes Alfven, our star is powered primarily by a DC  current that flows into both poles of the Sun. This DC current also has a ripple, where the current rises and falls slightly over a 22-year cycle. This 22-year ripple in current is connected to the 22-year solar cycle where sunspots come and go and the polarity of the Sun's magnetic field flips. The 22-year cycle is not necessarily coming from the outside, nor coming only from the Sun, but is more likely a result of the interaction between the Sun and the larger filament. We can draw a simple graph of the electrical current powering the Sun. The blue wavy line represents this current feeding the Sun. The current does not go positive and negative like an AC current in your  house. The current is one-directional but has a strengthening and a weakening. In  other words an AC ripple on top of a predominant DC current. For example, the Sun might have a current oscillating between 10 billion and 11 billion Amps. On the diagram I have circled in red  the maximum and minimum of the wave. Here the current to the Sun is steady - it does not  change much. We are in solar minimum. The magnetic field of the Sun is smoother. Now there is longer running room for particles to be accelerated towards and away from the Sun. We would expect higher gamma ray output. I have boxed in green the places where the current of the Sun is changing rapidly. Here we are in solar maximum. The magnetic field of the Sun is agitated by the quickly changing current. Electrons flowing towards the Sun at this time are caught up in the smaller circuits and cannot so easily reach gamma-ray energies. The electrical model agrees with the Fermi Telescope data. What about solar flares? according to the Standard Model, solar flares cannot reach the 100 GeV energies that are seen by the Fermi Telescope. Yet, several of the data points happened exactly during large solar flares. The authors are perplexed by this coincidence. I would again point to what we know about lightning on Earth. If the earth can produce gamma rays in electrical discharges, solar flares can easily reach hundreds of times those energies. What about the number of gamma rays we see? The Standard Model is short by a factor of about a hundred. Remember,  the Standard Model says that the gamma rays are only produced when a background flux of cosmic rays randomly interacts with the surface of the Sun. For this model to so clearly get the numbers wrong means to me that the gamma rays are simply not being produced in this way. This again is clearly better described by the filament model, where stars are fed by concentrated rivers of energy and not some random background. We will have to build out different solar electrical circuit models and see which circuits give the observed number of gamma  rays. Lastly, we can ask about the dramatic absence of gamma rays in the 40 to 50 GeV range. I do not have much to say about this one. Usually, when we see a missing energy range in an emission spectrum, we look for some specific process that would absorb just that energy. This energy is tantalizingly close to the mass of an iron atom which we know has a special place in nuclear transmutations. But I really think that this gap will point us to something that no one has yet imagined about basic solar physics. I can understand if you did not closely follow all my explanations. Like me, you probably had never before looked at gamma ray data from the Sun. So, you are still wrestling with the vocabulary and how pieces fit together. The existing model used by astrophysicists predicts everything incorrectly. But the journals and the reviewers cannot come out and say such a simple fact and instead must contort themselves around dark matter and possible new physics. I think some old physics, called electricity, can  help us think through this gamma-ray mystery. It seems to me that the electrical filament model of stars does a particularly good job of explaining why we see a hundred times more gamma rays than the random model and why there is a steady polar component. I also think the filament model explains the distribution of gamma rays in a sheath surrounding the photosphere. There's plenty of quantitative work to be flushed out in all this. I'd be happy to help someone tackle that. Thanks again to Wal and Don for helping me think through these ideas. [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by the Thunderbolts Project™  at Thunderbolts.info iIt's one of many enduring mysteries in solar physics, ”Why is the Sun's lower corona hundreds  of times hotter than the Sun's photosphere?” For many decades, scientists have sought an answer to the puzzle, though always doing so within the confines of the standard thermonuclear model of the Sun. Recently the ESA and NASA Solar Orbiter spacecraft returned to scientists on Earth the closest images of the Sun taken to date. Some mission scientists are speculating that the images may reveal clues to the problem of coronal heating. A  principal investigator, astrophysicist David Berghmans points to what he describes as ”campfires” in the images. He states, ”The campfires we are talking about  here are the little nephews of solar flares, at least a million, perhaps  a billion times smaller. When looking at the new high-resolution EUI images, they are literally everywhere we look.” A NASA press release on the images states, ”It's not yet clear what these campfires are, or how they correspond to solar brightenings observed by other spacecraft. But it's possible they are mini-explosions known as nanoflares-- tiny but ubiquitous sparks, theorized to help heat the Sun's outer atmosphere, or corona, to its temperature 300 times hotter than the solar surface... To  know for sure, scientists need a more precise measurement of  the campfires’ temperature.” Ironically a 2016 phys.org report entitled, “The Mystery of Coronal Heating” emphasizes how wildly inappropriate the campfire analogy is in any attempt to explain the Sun's hot corona. The article states, “Imagine standing around a roaring campfire, roasting s'mores. You feel the warmth of the flames as the marshmallows crackle. Now back away. You get cooler, right? That's not how it works on the Sun. The visible surface of the Sun has a temperature of 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Backing away from the inferno should cool things down, but it doesn't. Instead the  Sun's upper atmosphere or corona sizzles at millions of degrees- a temperature 200 to 500 times higher than that of the roaring furnace below. For more than a half century, astronomers have tried to figure out what causes the corona to be so hot. It is one of the most vexing problems in astrophysics.” As he's done in previous episodes, we asked Dr. Donald Scott to explain why the Sun's super-hot corona has always been a predictable feature of the Electric Sun model. It is as if just about every couple of weeks recently, some official arm of the astrophysics community issues a press release that reveals just how far off-track the mainstream really is. it's almost getting to be like a press conference where the interviewers throw out softball questions to the speaker, who's waiting for them and hits them out of the ballpark. Now, I don't know if I’ll be able to hit this one out of the ballpark, but it's not exactly like that, because we here in the Electric Universe Thunderbolts Group never know what these folks are going to say next to demonstrate how uninformed and uneducated they are in the areas in which they claim to be experts. So, we have to be ready for just about every anything that the “Fortress astrophysicists” put out. And they really do live in a fortress; it's a closed shop and they refuse to acknowledge we exist. So, anyway, for example there have been a couple of these press releases in recent days, and I think it's crucially important that we respond to them. About two weeks ago on July 16th, ABC News, and I said, oh ABC News. No, that's the Australian Broadcasting Company, not the American Broadcasting Company, released a press release entitled, “Solar Probe Snaps Closest Ever Pictures of the Sun Revealing Campfires on the Surface” and I thought that, when I said, you got to be kidding. Well, let me quote from the press release. ”...the discovery of thousands of tiny solar flares that scientists have dubbed ‘campfires’, offering clues about the extreme heat of the outermost part of its atmosphere.” Let me end the quote there. Of course, I want to talk about their use of the word ’campfires’, but also, this  last gratuitous comment that they hung on the end of that first sentence, about ‘clues’ that they see about the extreme heat of the Sun's outer atmo- sphere, which of course is its corona, the lower corona, shows they still haven't figured out the cause of the lower corona's extreme temperature. For decades they wondered why there was this extreme jump in temperature as you came out of the Sun and up into the corona. Well one of the most basic and important contributions of the Electric Universe is Ralph Juergens’ Electric Sun model which was published back in the 1970’s. Juergens’ model inherently explains the high temperature of the lower corona, and many other phenomena about the Sun that the gravity-only mainstream still finds enigmatic, because it's electrical and they can't explain it electrically. They refuse to. Juergens and the rest of us in the Electric Universe have been, and  continue to be, completely ignored by the power structure, called ’accepted astrophysics’ or I call it ’fortress astrophysics’. We have presented dozens of Space News videos, just like this one, that discuss and explain the temperature anomaly that worries them so, as  being completely understandable as the result of the acceleration of positive  ions, electrical acceleration of positive ions, leaving the Sun, that collide with more static ions and neutral atoms just below the corona. Their use of the word ’clues’ to me is very interesting, because it sticks out. It implies to me that they see this still as a mystery. If it wasn't a mystery, you have clues to mysteries, but you don't have clues to things that are very explainable by accepted theory. Juergens published his paper back in the late 1970’s. Where have they been for about 40 years? This was a 28-page paper containing much evidence that the Sun's photospheric surface is, was, is highly electrical in nature. But astrophysics’ public relations people certainly love quaint and whimsical phrases like, ’campfires on the Sun’. Maybe they think of themselves as being so much more informed than the rest of us, that they have to talk down to us as if we were children. Or do they actually think there might be big campfires burning up there on the Sun? Anyway, they included several images, and one is a multiple image. It does  indeed show some bright points on the main photospheric layer. But Juergens discussed these, back in 1979, saying they were fountains of electrons called spicules, in the Sun's chromosphere, being ejected upward in a self-regulating plasma mechanism, to maintain a strong electric field at the photosphere, that produced that self-same change in the temperature that bewilders them so. Anyway, it involved creation of what is now called a ‘double layer’. Irving Langmuir, scientist, an American scientist had discovered and published his work on the double layer requirement back in the early 1930’s, and been awarded actually the Nobel Prize in 1932 for doing it. But these guys have never heard of it. Anyway, many images of the Sun obtained over many years, many decades actually,  show bright spots just like this, and in many diagrams of the various  solar layers, you see these spicules, these  fountains of electrons. What we see on the Sun, are the  various forms that plasma creates there. Nothing more. Anyway, many photographic images that have been taken over the years, show bright spots, and were  these people unaware of it? These new photographs were taken, I guess, very close to the Sun, but they're no better than many other photographs we have of this same phenomenon. Spicules are thin, elongated jets, a few hundred kilometers wide. They reach up to six thousand kilometers in height, and they can move around at speeds of more than 100 kilometers per second. And spicules are found  all over the solar surface, but they can be observed and photographed most easily near the limb of the Sun. The bright spots also may just be locations, where the streams of incoming electrons, are stronger,  denser. But wait a second. Didn't they realize the word ‘campfires’, that that was actually seriously used by astronomers in the 19th century in another embarrassingly long period of time, when they had no answer to the question of why the sun is so hot? And why it doesn't burn out? These were the years around the beginning of the 20th century, when atomic energy was being developed; you know the Curies and all that. So, they desperately latched on to this atomic fusion process, in a last-ditch effort, like a drowning man grabs a life ring, to explain the Sun's tremendous and apparently ever- lasting stream of output power. But why do they reuse that word again now? You would think they'd be embarrassed by it. They ought to be. [Music] 
I am talking about “Science Set Free” and what  science is being set free from, is the science delusion. The science delusion is the belief that science has already understood the nature of reality in principle, leaving only the details to be filled in. This is very widely believed in our society. It's one of the reasons for the dogmatism that all of us encounter, and which is so annoying, but it's because people think they already know the truth. They sincerely believe that, and this is probably one of the most widespread delusions in our society and we've now exported it to the rest of the  world. There's a conflict in the heart of science between science as a method of inquiry, about the testing of hypotheses, looking at the evidence, finding out what's really going on, open-minded, subject to correction, and so forth. The ideal of science which many people think of as what science is, now it's what science ought to be and I agree with that ideal. The reality as many of us have encountered through better experience is rather different. For many people science has become a belief system, a world view. This is sometimes called scientism where people take the dogmas of science to be a kind of religious  belief system, or quasi-religious belief system. And it's this dogmatic belief system which I think is now constricting and holding science back in a very serious way. In almost every branch of science  we see the law of diminishing returns. More expensive research yields fewer and fewer really new results. And I think the reason for all that is this dogmatic belief system. If science can be set free from it, new experiments and new possibilities open up in every area. What I do in my book “Science Set Free” is take the ten dogmas of institutional science which are part of the scientific worldview and turn these dogmas into questions, treat them not as beliefs or truths, but as hypotheses that can be tested against the evidence. I then look at them scientifically to see how well they stack up when you take into account the evidence. None of them do and in every case new possibilities open up. Sounds would become regenerated when we undergo this process. I don't have time to discuss all ten dogmas today, but what I'll do first is just say what they are. First and foremost, Dogma One is the belief that nature is mechanical, or machine-like. This has been the foundational principle of science since the beginning of modern science in the 17th century. Mechanistic Science is based on the machine metaphor. Nature is a machine. Stars are machines. Animals and plants are machines. That's why you can  have industrial agriculture, genetic engineering, factory farming, and so on. And they're just machines. And we're machines too. Lumbering robots, in Richard Dawkins vivid phrase, with brains  that are genetically programmed computers. The second Dogma is: the total amount of matter and energy is always the same, except at the moment of the Big Bang when it all appeared from nowhere. The third Dogma is similar to that: the laws of nature are fixed. The laws and constants of the world are the same today as they were at the moment of the Big Bang when they all suddenly appeared like a kind of cosmic Napoleonic  Code. As Terence McKenna used to say, modern science is based on the principle: give us one free miracle, and we'll explain the rest. And the one free miracle is the appearance of all the matter and energy in the universe, and all the laws that  govern it, from nothing in a single instant. The fourth Dogma is that matter is unconscious. The universe is made up of totally unconscious matter. Fifth, nature is purposeless. There are no purposes in nature and the evolutionary process has no purpose or direction. Sixth, biological inheritance is material. It's genetic, in the genetic material DNA, or possibly in epigenetic modifications of the DNA which are also chemical, or in cytoplasmic inheritance. But at any rate it's all material. Seven, memories are stored as material traces inside the brain. Everything you remember is somewhere inside your head as a stored memory, either in phosphorylated proteins, modified synapses, or some material form which has not yet been fully identified. Although the details are very vague, attempts to find these traces have failed over and over again. But nevertheless it's universally believed within neuroscience that they're all inside the brain. Dogma eight. The mind is inside the head. Mental activity is brain activity. Your mind  is nothing but what goes on in your brain. Dogma nine follows from Dogma eight.  Psychic phenomena are illusory. Things like telepathy can't really happen, because they would imply the mind can work at a distance from the body, and it can't do that because it's all inside the head. And Dogma 10, mechanistic medicine is the only kind that really works. Alternative and complementary therapies may appear to work, but that's only because people would have got better anyway, or it's all the placebo effect. But the real kind, the only kind that really works is mechanistic medicine, which is why in most parts of the world it's the only kind taught in medical schools. It's the only kind funded by government funding agencies and so on. Well, these are the 10 beliefs which are more or less the default belief system of most scientists and most educated people today. Wherever they are in the world, in India or China or wherever, this is the belief system which is predominant. Now, within science itself of course, people at the leading edge of research in many ways have moved beyond this belief system. Research scientists are not necessarily committed to this in every detail, but they're usually only at the frontier of one region. A physicist might be at the frontiers of cosmology and have gone beyond some of these dogmas of physics, but they wouldn't question the dogmas of psychology or biology. Those would remain more or less intact. So, there are various people who question bits of it, but there's very little that's been done to question the whole thing. This is essentially the materialist world view and it became the dominant view of science in the 19th century. Science was as it were hijacked by materialist philosophy, and since then has been a wholly owned subsidiary of materialism. There's no reason why science has to be materialistic. It wasn't materialist before the 19th century, it was dualist as I'll say soon. And I think we can go beyond that to a new, more inclusive, more organic, organismic paradigm for science. What I'm going to do first is look at the dogma that the total amount of matter and energy is always the same This got built into the foundations of science in the 17th century. It was not brought about by incredibly detailed observations using nanogram balances and so forth. It came about for purely philosophical or rather theological reasons. The founding fathers of modern science were all Christians who believed that the world was a machine, that God was a machine maker, an engineering mathematically- minded God, who'd created the world machine. And he'd started off the world machine in the first place by creating the matter that's in it, which he created in the form of atoms, taking the idea from Greek atomism. And these atoms by definition couldn't be destroyed, they couldn't be broken up, so once God had created them the total amount of atoms or matter must automatically remain the same forever. And God also endowed the universe with a certain quantum of movement or force which started it in motion. And thereafter, because this God-given force couldn't be changed by anything else, the amount remained the same. So, the principles of conservation of matter and energy were built into science from the outset. Not on the basis of detailed measurements. They've served as useful accountancy principles ever since, but they were formulated more rigorously in the mid-19th century in the law of conservation of matter and energy and in the first law of thermodynamics. So, it was assumed that that was the end of the matter and that they were fixed forever. And most people take that for granted today. They've learned it in high school and they never see any reason to question it. This was the dogma of science which I myself didn't question until quite recently. I'd questioned all the others but it was only when I was writing this book that I thought I should look at this one. I actually rather wanted it to turn out to be true because I thought if I said that all ten dogmas of science were false, it might sound a bit biased, so I thought it'd be quite nice if one of them held up and I thought this was the best candidate. But when I thought about it, it turned out to be a shambles. First of all, where physicists are above the law, they've found themselves quite free to invent or hypothesize forms of matter and energy which no one had ever thought of before. One of them is of course dark matter. Observations of galaxies and the way that stars moved within them and also the ways that galaxies interact with each other, suggested that the galaxies, if they were to be explained in terms of gravitation, simply wouldn't work. The whole thing simply didn't work. So, in order to make it work they hypothesized there was extra matter which you can't see; hence the name dark matter that accounted for all the phenomena of galaxies and their interactions. Well, how much dark matter was there? Well, simple. Just invent the exact amount you need to explain the observed phenomena. You can titrate the amount of dark matter at will to explain the phenomena you're trying to explain. If you find new phenomena, peculiar bulges in galaxies or something that one-size-fits-all dark matter won't explain, then you add a bit more where it's needed. The system works perfectly and you can explain everything with complete accuracy because you can change the amount at will. The only trouble is no one knows what it is and there's no independent evidence for it. People have been speculating about its nature ever since it was first postulated. Having created all this extra matter in the universe, then this meant there should be more gravitation. Physicists expected in the 1990s that the universal expansion from the Big Bang would slow down. The universe would stop expanding, then begin to contract under the influence of all this gravitational matter, until it ended in tears in the reverse of a Big Bang known in the trade as the Big Crunch. So, when in the late 1990s people observed that the universe appeared to be accelerating, because of red shifts in distant quasars and galaxies, then there was the problem how do you explain this acceleration? Well, the answer was ready to hand: a new form of energy no one had known about before which caused the universe to expand. How much is that, well just the right amount to explain the facts. So, we now have dark matter and dark energy as a huge amount of the universe. They currently make up about 96 percent of reality. Look, physicists have invented something like 20 times more energy and mass than anyone had ever heard of till the 1980s. And no one's said, oh you can't do that it's defying the law of conservation of matter and energy. And if you ask is all this matter and energy conserved? Is the total amount always the same? Well for dark matter nobody knows. For dark energy the most usual theory is that actually the amount is increasing. As the universe expands there's more dark energy. The universe is now a perpetual motion machine. So the idea it's all rigorously conserved doesn't really make much sense in those terms. Within quantum physics there’s also Zero-point Energy, a form of energy which is supposed to be there underlying the world we live in, which is like waves on an ocean of energy. And there's huge amounts of it. The amount in a teaspoon would be enough to power the United States for years. Not surprisingly, some people claim that they can tap this energy and have devices which tap unconventional or unknown forms of energy, including Zero-point Energy. If you go online, you'll find there are many people who claim to have above- unity devices, machines that produce more energy than you put into them. Well, these are immediately banned from regular science because they violate the first of science's taboos established by Galileo in the early 17th century, the taboo against perpetual motion machines. This taboo long predated the laws of thermodynamics and it's one of the most deep-seated taboos in science. So, things like Cold Fusion, or above- unity devices or free energy devices, whether they're based on Zero-point Energy or peculiar electromagnetic effects, or parametric resonance, or the various other theories that are used to explain them, are totally beyond the pale. Nevertheless, people claim they've got them and they exist. If they do exist of course it would totally transform the world economy and the world energy situation. So, do they really work? Well, right now it's very, very hard to find out because there's claims that may or may not be substantiated. There's  a universal rejection within orthodox science of this; a few people within the Department of Defense, a few people who are kind of maverick investors are interested in this. The Japanese government is interested, but basically they're not part of the normal discourse of science. I myself think the best way forward here would be to have a prize, say a million dollar prize for the best above-unity device. And those who claim to have them, could then have them tested. This is  not an attempt to debunk them, it's an attempt to see what really works. They'd be tested under fair, agreed conditions. And if any of them do indeed produce more energy than is put into them and that which can't be explained in terms of any known energy source, they'd win the prize. If several do, then the best one would win the prize. I think this would be the best way of bringing this whole thing out into the open and finding out what's really  going on. And I think that commercial betting companies could open a book on this as well and people could bet on whether the prize will be awarded. Then all those skeptics who say it's impossible could put their money where their mouth is and bet a million dollars that no one would win the prize. How much would they actually be prepared to bet? That would be a very interesting question. I'd be prepared to bet at least a thousand dollars that someone would  win it. So, I think this would put the thing totally into the public domain. The media would love it, everyone would be discussing it, and if someone won it, I think it would completely change the climate. I think investors would get interested, governments, how it works and the situation could move on. Right now we've been at a stalemate for years with these things. It turns out that in biology the whole question of energy conservation is much, much more questionable than most people assume. We all assume that the total amount of energy that we produce can be explained by the food we take in and this was assumed in the 1850s by Hermann Von Helmholtz who was eager to prove that living organisms were nothing but machines. He didn't prove it, he assumed it and since then it's been a basic dogma of biology. It wasn't tested in humans until 1899 by two American researchers called Atwater and Benedict and they were determined to prove that we're nothing but machines. They were mechanists and they started from the assumption this was true and they did the experiments not to find out if it was true or not, but as they put it, to demonstrate it in order to further the cause of science. They had people in calorimeters and measured all the heat produced, the carbon dioxide, the oxygen taken in, feces, urine, food consumed and so on, did a complete energy balance sheet. When they did it, the results came out wrong. So, they changed the correction factors for the value of food until they got the expected result, and this then became built into the foundations of biology as a certain fact. It wasn't re-examined until an independent-minded American nutritionist, Paul Webb, redid their experiments in the 1970s. He found huge discrepancies. People who were overweight, overeating and doing very little exercise seemed to have 25 percent or so of the energy just vanish. People who are not eating and doing exercise gained about 25 percent. Too much energy. Where was it coming from? Nobody knows. He called it X, the unexplained amount of energy that could either disappear or appear. He then re-examined Atwater and Benedict's results and found that they'd got similar discrepancies, but they'd made sure there were just as many people who had too much and too little so that, when they averaged them, it canceled out to give the expected result. There are people who claim there are other forms of energy: Chi, Prana, vital energies, and so on. These are usually treated as metaphoric, but they may be much more literal than we usually think. And this is a huge unexplored area. It's not as if nutrition science is the most successful branch of modern biology. And I think that this is something which bears re-examination. In my book,  I suggest several quite radical experiments that could be done quite simply and cheaply, to look at this. Well, now let me turn briefly to the idea that the laws and constants of nature are fixed. The idea that the laws are fixed is a hangover from Greek philosophy. Plato and Pythagoras thought that the world was governed by mathematical principles beyond space and time, eternal ideas. In the 17th century people thought these were ideas in the mind of a mathematical God and that God had these mathematical ideas and that scientists were actually finding out about the mind of God by finding out the math of nature. People thought Newton's laws of gravitation were not just human hypotheses, mere guessses or mere working principles. They thought this was a direct insight into the divine mind, superior to that of religion, much more precise, much less disputable. And this was really the basis for enlightenment ideology of science and reason. They thought science and reason transcended religion in giving a direct insight into the divine nature. Now, you don't hear much about that today, but there's still the strong enlightenment tradition and the idea of the laws of nature are fixed is a hangover from that point of view. But in a radically evolutionary universe which the Big Bang postulates, why shouldn't the laws of nature themselves evolve? In fact, why should there be laws at all? Law is a very human metaphor, only humans have laws and only civilized  societies. Why should we project this anthropocentric metaphor onto the whole of  nature? I myself think that the idea of habits of nature makes much better sense. This is the basis of my own idea of morphic resonance which is a memory principle in nature, but I'm not the first to propose habits. The American philosopher C.S. Purse, at the beginning of the 20th century suggested that in an evolutionary universe the regularities could be thought of as evolving habits. I think it's a much better way to think of it and it's a testable hypothesis. The theory of morphic resonance predicts for example that if you crystallize a new  chemical compound for the first time, it may be very difficult to crystallize because it hasn't yet got a habit to crystallize with a particular lattice  structure. But if you crystallize it again somewhere else, there'll be a resonance from the first crystals across space and time - morphic resonance - that will make it easier to crystallize. And the third time it'll be easier still because of resonance from the first and the second crystals. It'll get easier and easier to crystallize all around the world. There's a lot of evidence that that really happens. Chemists explain it by saying that fragments of previous crystals must have been wafted around the world as dust particles. But I'm predicting the same will happen even if you filtered dust particles out of the air. The theory also predicts that if you train an animal, say rats, to learn a new trick. If you train rats in Albuquerque to learn a new trick, then all over the world rats in New York and London and Tokyo should learn the same trick quicker, just because the rats have learned it here. Surprisingly there's already evidence from experiments, a long series of experiments with rats done at Harvard, at the University of Edinburgh at the University of Melbourne in Australia that this actually happens. The same applies to people. It should be getting easier to learn things that others have already learned. Well, I'm not going to go into detail on this because this is the theme of my own theory of morphic resonance. And my purpose in this lecture and in my book is not really so much to push my own ideas, as to show how questionable the standard ones are, and how much the field is open for different answers. But I'll turn just briefly to the constants of nature because this affects the Electric Universe, or indeed any model of the universe. It's assumed that the constants of nature are constant. The fundamental constants like Newton's gravitational constant, big G, or the speed of light c. Well, I began to wonder whether they really were constant, when I got into the Habit view of nature. And so I tried to find out what the actual values were. I started off by getting handbooks of physical constants and looking at old editions. Most people only look at the latest edition and they usually throw the old ones away. But in the patent office library in London I found they kept them all. And so,  I got them all out of the reserve stock at 10-year intervals. They wheeled in a trolley of handbooks of physical constants, dusting them off and I looked through these things to see how they changed. To my amazement I found that  the speed of light dropped by 20 kilometers per second between 1928 and 1945. I then looked up the data in more detail and found that all over the world people have been getting this much lower figure with very small error bars. The original thing was up there with little error bars and it goes down much lower with  little error bars. It wasn't as if the error bars were 20 kilometers per second. No they were point/decimal places of kilometers per second. I checked in the primary literature and found this indeed seemed to be the case and then they went up again after 1945. I couldn't understand what was going on so I asked the head of the Metrology Department (metrologists are people who measure constants) at the British National Physical Laboratory if I could go and see him and I went to visit him. He was very friendly and I said to him Dr. Petley, I'd like to know how you explain this drop in the speed of light between 1928 and 1945. And he said,  “Oh dear”. I said “...What”? He said, ”You've uncovered one of the most embarrassing incidents in the history of our country.” So, I said, “Well, could it mean that the speed of light really did drop, at least as measured on Earth during that period?” He said, “Of course not,” and I said, “Why not?” He said, “Because it's a constant.” So, I said, “Well then, I can't see any other explanation than that people all around the world were sort of fudging their results to get what they thought everyone else would expect them to get, and then discarding outliers and stuff and coming up with these very narrow error bars that agreed with everyone else. And so, it then it must have been produced by some kind of fudging process”. He said,  “We don't like to use the word ‘fudge’. So I said, “What do you prefer?” He said, “We prefer to call it intellectual phase locking.” So, I said to him, “Well, if it was happening then, how do we know it's not happening now?” He said, “Oh, we know it's not happening now” and I said, “Why?” “He said, because we fixed the speed of light by definition in 1972.” So I said, “Well, it might still vary.” And he leaned back, looking very smug and said, “Well, if it did, no one would ever find out, because we've defined the  meter in terms of the speed of light, so the units would vary with it.” So, I said “Well okay, you fixed that one, but what about the gravitational constant, that's  been varying wildly and even actually in the last three or four years, it's varied by more than 1.3 percent as measured in different Laboratories. The usual assumption is this is just error, it's experimental error, it's hard to measure, its error, so labs all over the world get quite different results. And the International Committee on Metrology fixes the results every few years by averaging ones from different Labs weigting ones they think are more reliable, discarding ones they think are not. And indeed, when I left Dr. Petley, thanking him for his time, he reached down to a cardboard box beside his desk, full of pamphlets and said, “By the way, these have just come from the printers. You might like one.” He handed me this pamphlet, the latest values of the physical constants. so, I looked at these data from different labs  on G, Big G. And the question that I was wondering, there's all these big errors, could it be that they're actually changing together in different labs, as the earth rotates around the Sun, as it rotates during the day, and as the whole solar system moves through different astronomical environments. To find that out, one would look at the day-by-day measurements from different labs and see if the errors, or so-called errors, are correlated. I've spent more than 10 years trying to persuade metrologists to do this. And they simply will not, because they say it's a constant, so there's no point looking for variations. But I say, you've got these huge differences and they say oh they're just errors it's hard to measure but they simply won't do it. An exercise in open science would be if they put their raw data with the dates online. And then anyone could try and look for patterns, and there could be a website where they're discussed. It would cost nothing, and  we might find something out. We'll find out nothing by pretending it's fixed. There are in fact already papers that suggest diurnal variations in accordance with the sidereal day. A group at MIT recently found a daily variation, and some evidence of annual variations. But there may be other, wilder fluctuations that happen in concert. I myself think the so-called physical constants may vary from time to time and possibly even chaotically within certain limits. I think the day may come when in scientific periodicals like Nature there’ll be a page, a bit like the stock market reports. You know this week's value of the constants. This week the G was slightly up; the charge on the electron held steady; there was a drop in the fine structure constant, you know and if that were the case then it would give varying qualities of time when different things could happen. The idea they're all rigidly fixed is a hangover from an old platonic point way of thinking. So there, right in the heart of physics, is I think a really open and interesting  question. The key revolution in the Scientific Revolution of the 17th century was the shift from an organic view of nature to a machine view of nature. It was a revolution because it rejected what people thought before. And what people thought before was a philosophy of nature taught in the medieval universities of Europe based on Aristotle as refined by Saint Thomas Aquinas in the 12th century. And it was a very sophisticated philosophy of nature. According to Aristotle and Saint Thomas all living beings had souls and the soul of a living being was not some metaphysical thing to do with life after death, it was what gave it its form, its structure. The body was in the soul, the soul was not in the body. And the soul gave each kind of plant its form, its leaves, its flowers, its roots, its shape. And the soul worked by attraction. As the tree grew, it was attracted towards the mature form by the soul of the plant. It was like the form. In addition, animals had, as well as the vegetative soul that shaped their embryos and growth of the body and maintained its health, there was the animal soul which was concerned with instinct, sensations and movements. And of course the word animal comes from the Latin word for soul, anima. Human beings had a vegetative soul that shaped the body, an animal soul that gave us our animal nature, our senses and instincts and so on, are very similar to those of animals. But in addition, the rational or intellectual soul to do with reason, language, the mind, consciousness. But nobody thought that the human mind was totally separate from the rest of nature. It was embedded in a psychic system which connected us to animals and plants. And the whole world was alive, the earth was alive, the planets were alive. We still call them by the names of the Roman gods and goddesses, and the stars were alive. They were intelligent beings. Each star in the sky as people looked up, it was filled with an intelligence. One of the levels of angels, the dominations, virtues and powers, the third three levels of angels in the hierarchy of the nine-fold hierarchy of angels were the spirits or intelligences of the stars. So when a medieval person looked at the sky, they looked at a living universe filled with the presence of God. Every star was a living intelligent being. Now, the mechanistic revolution replaced that with the idea that everything's a machine. A machine is a bit like an organism, except it no longer has its own design or purpose. Those are put into the machine from the human designer or maker. And this metaphor meant God was the intelligent designer of the machinery and through divine intervention that the whole world had been made in the first place. The organic view of the Middle Ages was really a form of Christian animism. Plants and animals had their own purposes, their own desires, the soul gave them their motivation and their goal. The whole of nature had a purpose. It was striving towards the being of God, striving towards perfection. God was the prime mover of the universe not by pushing it from behind, but by attracting it from the future. That view was destroyed and replaced by a machine view. The heavens became dead matter, the solar system became a mechanical clockwork-like system. Animals and plants became mere machines with no feelings so it was all right to vivisect them or treat them appallingly in factory farms. The only thing that was left that wasn't mechanical in the world was the human rational mind, that was the only thing left, except for angels and God which were immaterial spirits like the human mind. This was Descartes’ view and it created an extreme dualism of body and soul, matter  and spirit. So for Descartes, the whole world was mechanical, made of unconscious matter. Consciousness existed only in humans, angels and God, and were separate from the rest of nature by being immaterial, not in space and time. This created a radical dualism between people and animals, mind and body, and between religion and science because science got the realm of spirit: human minds, angels and God. Religion got that and science got the whole of the physical universe, including the stars and the heavens, which now became dead, unconscious and inanimate. Well that was the revolution, and matter in this view was defined as unconscious. They did experiments accurate to many places of decimals. It was simply defined as unconscious by Descartes and it’s remained so ever since in the view of scientists, without further  discussion. Now Cartesian dualism was unsatisfactory for many people. By the 19th century a lot of people didn't want to have two fundamental principles. They thought two was too many. They wanted to have just one. And dualism, this view that it's too many meant that they tried to collapse it into one of these two principles. The idealist said everything is consciousness. Matter is just a kind of dulled-down spirit or consciousness, or mind. But the more popular view was the materialist view. Everything's matter, there's no such thing as this mysterious non-material spirit of the human mind, and certainly not angels and God. So, at one stroke the materialists wiped out angels and God and said the human mind is nothing but the activity of the brain. They collapsed it down in into the brain. And that is the view that took over science by the late 19th century and it's been the standard paradigm ever since. Of course, it creates appalling problems and one of them is that it makes human consciousness inexplicable. If matter is unconscious, how come we are conscious? Well, some philosophers of mind, materialists philosophers, say well there's a simple solution to that. We're not conscious, the mind is just an illusion, we're just machines. That's called ‘eliminative materialism’ and in the  United States throughout much of the 20th century the official doctrine of academic psychology was behaviorism, which denied the existence of consciousness. It said, the only thing you can measure objectively and scientifically are muscular movements and glandular secretions and that's what scientific psychology should study, ignoring the folk belief in consciousness. Others take the view that consciousness is nothing but an epi-phenomenon, a bit like a shadow of the activity of the brain that does nothing. And others take the view that consciousness is an illusion produced by the brain to make us feel good and get out of bed in the morning, because it doesn't actually do anything. None of these views say that consciousness does anything. We don't have free will, it doesn't actually do anything useful, it might just well not be there, we might just as well be zombies or robots and it's irrelevant to science because it doesn't really exist. The trouble is that this isn't a very convincing view, even for materialists. I mean they'll argue it at work, but as soon as they get home in the evening they don't treat their spouses, their children and their dogs as if they're inanimate machines, and they themselves don't believe that they're materialist because their brain makes them believe it, they'd like to think they're materialists because they believe in science, reason and evidence. And yet their entire philosophical position undermines their belief in materialism. It's incoherent. That doesn't stop it being the dominant philosophy in  all our universities and in almost all philosophy departments, it's the dominant  view. But it's so incoherent and so difficult to square with observable facts, that within consciousness studies this is now very, very much disputed. There's been  a breaking away from materialism by leading philosophers. One of the first breakaways was Galen Strawson, a British philosopher who lives in America, who wrote a key paper a few years ago called ”Does Materialism Imply Pan-psychism”, to which he answered yes. Pan-psychism is the idea that there's a kind of mental aspect to all kinds of nature, even electrons. And although he didn't give any details, he said this was the only coherent way we could explain the emergence of consciousness in humans. Because if you try and conjure it out of totally unconscious matter, it's really just reinventing dualism on a kind of evolutionary  basis. More interestingly and I think more coherently, the American philosopher Thomas Nagel wrote a book a few months ago which I think is a breakthrough in modern philosophy. Nagel is a leading philosopher of mind in New York, and  his book is called “Mind and Cosmos - why the materialist near-Darwinian  conception of nature is almost certainly false” His book was hated by the materialist militant atheist crowd. He was denounced as going off the rails and that kind of thing, but it's a deeply thoughtful and fascinating book. But of course pan-psychism is not new as a philosophy. It's what people thought in the Middle Ages basically and in the 17th century, soon after Descartes, in the next generation of philosophers people were already exploring this possibility. One of them was Leibniz and Leibniz argued that the universe is made up of monads, units of organization including us, but also including atoms and that every monad, as well as having a body, has a mind and each monad reflects the universe from its own point of view. So every monad has a completely different point of view because it's in a different place, like everyone in this room has a different point of view. Because we're all in different places, we can't all be in the same place at the same time because bodies are impenetrable. So, that was one pan-psychist’s view. Another was Spinoza who said that the whole of nature is the body of God and it has a consciousness or mind (the whole of nature), it's God or nature it was a kind of pantheistic view. The most important philosopher in this tradition in the 20th century was Alfred North Whitehead, and Whitehead argued that all physical systems that are self-organizing have a mental aspect. Self-organizing is a key here. This doesn't apply to chairs, tables motorcars and so on. They're not organized, they're put together by an external force – humans. But things that organize themselves include atoms, molecules crystals, cells, animals, plants, ecosystems, planets solar systems and galaxies. Those are self-organizing systems and Whitehead argued that all self-organizing systems are processes in time. There's no such thing as enduring matter like little billiard balls. He was the first philosopher to appreciate the importance of quantum theory. And what quantum theory shows is that even electrons are waves. They're wave-like patterns of activity, they're processes, not things. And if they're processes, they take time. You can't have a wave at an instant. That's the fundamental reason for quantum uncertainty. You can't have an instantaneous wave at an exact moment of time because a wave takes time. That  means a wave has a future pole and a past pole, it's a process. And this philosophy is called process philosophy. And so, even an electron has a future and  a past pole. And Whitehead's most original contribution, in my view, was the way he understood the relation of mind and body. Usually people think of it in terms of spatial metaphors. The mind is the inner life, the body is the outer world, or the outer part. It's the inner and outer. He thought the relationship was a temporal relationship. The mind is the future pole, the body's the past pole. In an electron the Schrodinger wave equation describes all the possible things that electron could do. Those possibilities coexist. They're not physical, material, measurable realities, because they're possibilities. It’s a different kind of thing. But as soon as the electron interacts with something or is measured, then these possibilities collapse down to one physical observable fact. That's now in the past. The physical pole is in the past and now a whole new realm of possibilities develop. The same with our conscious minds. They're filled with coexisting possibilities. Our  minds are realms of possibility. Mental reality is a realm of possibility, about potential futures, virtual futures, things we could do. And our minds are involved in choosing among these possibilities. As soon as we choose to do something and do it, it becomes an observable physical fact, objectively measurable. But before that, it's a possibility and this gives a view of causation, a two-fold form of causation. The possibility-mental causation working from virtual futures towards the past and regular-physical causation working from the past towards the future and they overlap in the present. I think this is the best way of thinking of the relation of mind and body, the most fruitful. It has many implications and I don't have time to go into them for now, at this moment. What I do want to do is just explore what this pan-psychist view might mean when we look at big things. Most discussions of it are about atoms and electrons, but since we're here at the Electric Universe conference, what  about thinking about the Sun and the galaxy. The Sun is a self-organizing system. Indeed the whole solar system is a self-organizing system. It's not put together in a factory, it organizes itself and the entire galaxy is a self-organizing system. From that point of view, they're organisms and from Whitehead's point of view that would mean they would have a mental pole which did would be to do with potential futures, and a physical pole depending on the decisions or choices made among those possible futures. What we observe is the physical pole. But they have a great deal of indeterminate activity going on in them, particularly electrical activity. Electromagnetic activity, we know there's no dispute that the Sun is highly active electromagnetically, however one interprets the source of its energy, everybody agrees that highly complex electromagnetic patterns are going  on there. People also think that the interface between our brains and our minds are the complex electromagnetic patterns going on inside our brains. So, what if these electrical patterns in the Sun are an interface with the Sun's mind? What if the Sun thinks? Now, as soon as you raise that question you realize this is utterly taboo subject. You're not allowed to ask that question. Matter is unconscious. Since the 17th century, materialists have assumed and dualists had assumed that matter is unconscious. It's simply off- limits. However, all traditional cultures have treated the Sun as alive and indeed the planets and the stars. Children when they draw the Sun draw it with a smiley face. And so, this in itself is taken as evidence against the fact that the Sun can be alive or conscious, because if children see it that way, it shows it's a primitive or childish way of looking at things. And the fact that people all over the world say it that way until science comes along again proves it's primitive and superstitious. We've risen above it. I don't think we've risen above it at all. I think we sunk below it to a level of dogmatism which simply closes off a whole area of questions for no reason other than the fact that a French philosopher in the 17th century chose to divide up the world in such a way that he defined matter as unconscious. It's become a habit of thought with us. About ten years ago, with a few other people I organized a small Invitational conference in England held at Overby at the summer solstice in the countryside called, “Is the Sun conscious?” We spent several days discussing the consciousness of the Sun. Well, of course none of us could really prove the Sun was conscious, and you might say, well, if it's conscious, prove it. Well, my answer to that is, well you can't prove it's unconscious. It's actually an open question, but once we got beyond discussing what it might mean, we then got onto the question of if the Sun does think what does it think about? Well,  one obvious thing would be its body, which is the solar system right out to the  heliopause. And it knows what's going on in the solar system. It's pervaded  by the Sun's electromagnetic field. Everything in this room is within the Sun's electromagnetic field. The electromagnetic activity in your brain is within the Sun's electromagnetic field. So, the Sun in a sense, just through the electromagnetic field alone, would be able to sense what's going on in the entire solar system and beyond. Its decisions might involve when to send out coronal mass ejections, the timing of solar flares, whether to point them towards the earth or not. You know there's all sorts of things, and also the variable cycles of the Sun may be reflections of its psychic activity. So part of its concern may be with its body. Part of it may also be with its peer group, the other stars and the galaxy as a whole you see may have a mind. I'd love that talk yesterday by Michael Claridge where he conjured out this wonderful image of variable currents moving through the arms of the galaxy with more activity in some places than others, changing from time to time, like MRI scans of the brain change when you're thinking about one thing or about another  thing. The entire galaxy is a living organism. with a mind as well as a body. The Electric Universe aspect of this is the perfect interface between the physical activity of the galaxy and its possible mental life. Of course, if we start thinking and say, why stop at galaxies, you've got galactic clusters and then you've got the entire universe. What if there's a cosmic mind? Well, this is by no means a new idea, but I think that science itself can open up something. We're not talking now about supernaturalism, or blind faith. We're talking about a way of thinking about nature which gives us an organic coherent view of nature and opens up completely new forms of dialogue with spiritual and religious traditions. I want to end by just reflecting for a few moments on the location of our own  minds. The normal view is that the activity of the brain is inside the head. But this leaves a great many things unexplained, including vision. What's going on when you see something? What's going on when you see me now? Well, light moves from me through the electromagnetic field, enters the eyes, inverted images on the retinas, changes in the cone cells, impulses up the optic nerves, and changes in various regions of the brain which can be illuminated through brain scanning. We know more about  them than ever before. Does this explain vision? Well, no, it just describes changes in the  brain. The first thing about vision that isn't explained is the fact you're conscious of what you see. That's an example of the ’hard problem’ in consciousness studies or philosophy of mind. The very existence of consciousness is unexplained. But  then is the question of where are the images you're seeing? You're seeing  a three-dimensional colored world. The conventional view is that all that's inside your brain. You've got a virtual reality display somewhere inside your head, which includes me and the rest of this room and everybody else here. It's all in your head. If you look at the sky at night, or in the day, the sky you're seeing is inside your head. A key paper recently in one of the consciousness journals by a philosopher of mind was called, “Is your skull beyond the sky?” And the author of the article answered, Yes. He's a materialist, so he said the minds and the brain, everything you experience, is inside your head. Your skull is beyond the sky. This is only a virtual skull, but your real skull is beyond the sky. Everything you're experiencing is inside your head. Your whole conscious, subjective life is inside your head. I propose a much simpler view which takes into account our indirect experiences. So simple, it's hard to grasp, and that's that your image of things is in your mind, but not inside your head. Your image of me is exactly where it seems to me to be, outside your head where I'm standing. Visions are two-way processes. You project out images which coincide normally with what you're looking at. This means  that there's a kind of outward movement of the mind. The mind is not confined to the inside of the head. It's extended out through attention and intention, and that means we should be able to affect things just by looking at them. And that means, for example, that if I look at you from behind, and you don't know I'm there, you might be able to feel my gaze. Now could that possibly be true? Well, as soon as you ask that question, you realize it's a common experience. More than 90 percent of people have experienced being stared at from behind. You turn around, there's someone looking at you or, staring at someone and making them  turn around. There was an almost complete taboo on this in science until the 1980s because it simply ought not to happen. So, skeptics dismissed it. It doesn't happen, it's an illusion, it's just folk belief, superstition, it's coincidence, selective memory. Experiments however, show that it does seem to happen. There's now a lot of experimental evidence, people can really tell when they're being looked at from behind that can't be explained just in terms of signs or smells. It works through glass, it works through one-way mirrors, even works through CCTV. Now, this means that our minds reach out to touch what we're looking at. And I just want to leave you with this thought, as when we're talking about the extended mind. When we look at the stars, it means that our minds from this point of view are reaching out over literally astronomical distances, contacting those stars. Now the question then arises. The light takes, say ten light years to get from a star to our mind when we project out our image of the star, is it just stretching out in time and reaching the star ten light years after it was emitted? Or is our conscious mind working backwards in time and contacting it ten light years in the  past? I think it's contacting it when the light was emitted ten light years in the past. I think our minds are stretching out in time as well as space and I think our conscious minds work backwards in time as it were. So, this means that when we look at the universe, the Electric Universe, the stars, the planets, not only may we be looking at a living organism, the whole universe is a living organism with the galaxies and the solar systems within it as living organisms. Our minds are stretching out to contact it. It's not just something inside our heads of these ideas when we look at the stars directly or indirectly through telescopes, our minds are reaching out into the cosmos and may be interacting with it in ways we can barely begin to imagine. Not just with potential Little Green Men on other planets, but with the stars themselves, with the galaxy itself. So, I think that the Electric Universe which gives us an organic view of galaxies and solar systems as organisms held together by electric activities and plasma is completely consistent with the emerging view of nature, the post-mechanistic view of nature, as the universe as a living organism, made up of many levels of organism within it, each organism containing smaller ones. The galaxies contain solar systems. They contain planets, ecosystems, species, social groups. Organisms contain organs cells, molecules, crystals. A living universe with habits evolving in time and one of which we're living parts. I think is a few much more consistent with our experience of nature, a much healthier view of nature, one that breaks down that artificial division between mind and body, humans and nature, which the mechanistic theory gives us and contacts us with the traditional wisdom of all traditional societies which have all seen the universe as alive and organic. And I think we're rediscovering that at a higher turn of the spiral. I think as we move beyond the dogmas of materialism, science can be set free in almost every area. In medicine, in astronomy, in cosmology, in biology, in psychology, in chemistry, in our understanding of evolution. So, I think, instead  of knowing almost everything which is the common assumption, we know very little indeed. And the dogmatism we all encounter comes from a belief system, a worldview which has long outlived its usefulness. It long passed its ‘sell by date’ and as we move on from it, science will be set free in all sorts of ways. And I think we'll see a scientific renaissance, and I think this gathering is part of it. Thank You. [Music] [Music]

Welcome to the Electricity of Life, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info The Electric Universe and plasma cosmology have laid the foundations for a new understanding of our Sun and of all stars. Many decades ago, the father of plasma cosmology, the Nobel Prize winner Hannes Alfvén, proposed that stars form electromagnetically along vast networks of filaments, like pearls on a string. Later, the electrical engineer Ralph Juergen's went a step further and developed an electrical model of the Sun as an anode, a positively charged body powered by galactic electric currents. In the last year, the project scientists with the independent SAFIRE experiment announced a series of findings in agreement with the Electric Sun model. Indeed, we learn more everyday about the extraordinary electromagnetic connection between our planet and its parent star, including the discovery in 2014, that powerful outbursts from the Sun result in increased lightning on Earth. Perhaps even more remarkably, a number of scientific papers have reported an apparent correlation between surprising changes in radioactive decay rates and solar activity. But not only does our planet, and all of its complex atmospheric systems, share a remarkable relationship with the Sun, so too is all of life affected by the Sun in ways that science has only begun to recognize. And here the electrical nature of the Sun shines through with striking clarity. Consider the recent scientific discovery of a surprising correlation between solar storms and the beaching of grey whales and certain other cetacean species. The apparent connection was originally noted by a biologist and his team at Duke University, who found that when dark sunspots cover the Sun, the marine mammals are more likely to beach themselves. With the help of an astronomer, they were able to confirm the connection. Their findings have been published in the journal Current Biology in the paper “Grey whales strand more often on days with increased levels of atmospheric radio-frequency noise.” The paper’s abstract states that the findings suggest “The potential for magnetoreception in this species.” In fact, this is not the first scientific paper to demonstrate such a correlation. In 2016, Cambridge University's International Journal of Astrobiology published the paper “Solar storms may trigger sperm whale strandings.” The authors state in the paper’s abstract “... magnetic fields can affect terrestrial life such as migrating animals. Thus, terrestrial life is connected to astronomical interrelations between different magnetic fields, particle flows and radiation. Whales’ magnetic sense may play an important role in orientation and migration, and strandings may thus be triggered by geomagnetic storms.” Of course the concept of magnetoreception in some animals is not new. Many biologists have long proposed that the mysterious abilities of homing pigeons is resolved by the presence of magnetic particles in the pigeons heads. This apparent magnetic sensing has also been found in other animals, perhaps surprisingly, including cattle. As reported in a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA in 2008, “We demonstrate that domestic cattle across the globe and grazing and resting red and roe deer align their body axes in roughly a north-south direction. Direct observations of roe deer revealed that animals orient their heads northward when grazing or resting. Amazingly, this ubiquitous phenomenon does not seem to have been noticed by herdsmen, ranchers or hunters.” Other species that seem sensitive to Earth's magnetic field include frogs, lobsters, snails and perhaps most intriguingly of all, humans. While a human magnetic sense has long been a subject of interest and investigation, the most powerful scientific evidence to date came in 2019 with the publication of the paper, ”Transduction of the Geomagnetic Field as Evidenced from alpha-Band activity in the Human Brain.” In the experiment, conducted by a team of Caltech scientists, 34 subjects sat in an aluminum box which shielded them from electromagnetic noise. The box was lined with coils through which electric currents flowed, and the investigators created a magnetic field which sloped downward, similar to the geomagnetic field at the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. They then rotated the field, producing a measurable change in the brain activity of nearly 1/3 of the study's participants. In an article in Science Magazine, biologist Margaret Ahmad states in the findings ”I'm not surprised there's an effect. There's something in a cell that is different in the presence of a magnetic field. We see this effect in human embryonic kidney cells; you're not going to convince me that an effect in brain cells is of any greater or lesser significance.” And here, the great significance of the electromagnetic connection between the Sun and the Earth comes into focus. The Earth is a rotating charged body and electric currents from the Sun touch down at the Earth's poles, producing the aurorae and modifying our planet's magnetic field. Evidence of the profound biological effects of both electric and magnetic fields, increases with each passing year. So, the question is, do geomagnetic events impact the physiology of human beings? Increasingly, it seems the answer is yes. In fact, it was over a century ago that the Soviet era scientist Alexander Chizhevsky founded the field of heliobiology, the study of the Sun's effect on biology. As noted in an earlier Electricity of Life by Alex Fournier, Chizhevsky conducted exhaustive data analysis, which compared solar activity with prominent historical events in human society. Using a ”mass excitability” index, Chizhevsky found that the timing of these prominent events consistently linked to outbursts from the Sun, which led to Chizhevsky to propose that geomagnetic storms had a significant impact on the human mind and behavior. As a result of his scientific endeavor, after refusing to retract his findings, he was placed in a labor gulag for eight years by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. Today, scientific research into the Sun's effects on the human body and mind continues, with an emphasis on the role of electromagnetism. For example, a number of studies have reported data suggesting a connection between geomagnetic storms and dramatic changes in blood pressure and other effects on the heart. And as suggested by earlier research, some scientists have found an apparent linkage between geomagnetic storms and major changes in behavior. In 2006, the peer-reviewed journal, Bioelectromagnetics, published a paper, “Do Ambient Electromagnetic Fields Affect Behaviour? A demonstration of the Relationship Between Geomagnetic Storm Activity and Suicide.” The authors studied the geomagnetic storm activity, and the national suicide statistics for Australia, between the years 1968 and 2002. Their conclusion was that the data ”...suggests that perturbations in ambient electromagnetic field activity impact behavior in a clinically meaningful manner.” In February of 2020, another study, this time focusing on suicide statistics in Taiwan, reported similar results. Such findings might sound strange, but the purpose of this series is to explore the role of electricity in nature and biology, including the body's electrical circuitry. In fact, the connection between major health changes and geomagnetic activity might actually be predictable, in light of the remarkable scientific research of our previous guest, Dr. Jerry Tennant. Dr. Tennant has proposed that many health problems are essentially the result of a disruption of the natural voltage in the body's muscles and organs. Emotions, Dr. tenet suggests, are stored in and around our bodies in the form of magnetic fields. The treatment he's devised involves the use of other magnetic fields and scale our energy to restore the body's voltage and ”erase the residual effects of trauma.” In describing the relationship between celestial objects and the greater cosmos, we have stated that ”...no islands exist in our Electric Universe.” Of course, this applies not only to astronomical objects, but to all of life. And thus, it is unsurprising that the evidence of the electrical nature of the cosmos, continues to illuminate the interconnectedness of all things. [Music] 
[Music] A supernova was a star, then it  was transformed into something new that is capable of taking on greater responsibility within the body of the galaxy. Galaxies are very complex. They are not just a random collection of independent stars. In fact, the galaxy is just as complex as your body. In biology class, we learn that each cell in your body has very specific responsibilities. These cells are grouped together into tissues that have their own functions. The tissues are grouped together into organs that have more far-reaching responsibilities within the proper functioning of the body as a whole. The same structure, or hierarchy, is present in galaxies. The stars that we see in the sky are just one aspect of galactic intricacies. Stars are grouped together into larger structures that were particularly shown to us by the Planck and Herschel space telescopes. These larger structures are part of still larger, functional regions within the full body of the galaxy. Each of these levels of organization is doing something. None of it is pointless or  random. Where does a supernova fit into this larger perspective? For it is only with such a perspective that we can begin to understand the nature of supernova. I did not  invent the perspective. I was lucky enough to inherit the ideas and I’m doing my best to apply them to astronomy. I began studying supernova in the late 1980’s,  collecting data about the pulsar named 1913+16. We were looking at the spin-down rate to compare that with the theory of general relativity. As much as we know about supernova, it will probably not come as a surprise that we also know very little about them. We are confident that they start off as stars, and somehow that star undergoes a very rapid transformation which, for an instant, puts out as much energy as the entire galaxy of which it is a part. This brief, all-encompassing flash is what we call the supernova. After that flash, the star is gone, and we see in its place something very different. The very center of this new creature pulses very rapidly, hundreds, even thousands, of times a second. Each  supernova remnant has a unique pulse shape. Unique like your fingerprint or voice. Around this compact pulsing center is a rapidly expanding, larger electric and magnetic body. Here is a little portrait gallery of such transformed stars. What  strikes me, first, is their beauty and their individuality. There is  a bit of a classification problem for people familiar with the astrophysics. For  a long time, we classified the events as Type I and Type II. But then we found some that blended the features of the two types. Then we found ones that were neither type. Then we found more and more that were supposed to be impossible. I would like to change  the terms of the discussion. Let us stop describing supernovas as  dead, or dying stars. Let's stop describing them as Type I and II. Let's forget about the distinction with planetary nebula. Let's instead, start talking about transformed stars. About stars that are reborn onto a larger playing field. About stars that found some way to be conduits for a greater amount of energy, and hence are  able to take on greater responsibility. Our galaxy is filled with structures like this, which became visible to us only from the Planck and Herschel telescope data. One hundred lightyears across, composed of an enormous variety of organic molecules. Connected into a coherent whole by magnetic fields; electric currents flowing through the whole thing; complex vibrations traveling up and down the whole structure. Hundreds or thousands of stars might  participate in such a structure. It has very well-defined boundaries, membranes, actually, that are just as well defined as your blood vessels. These  plasma membranes are also, like all the membranes of your body, semi-permeable. At one lecture I showed this picture and a woman yelled out, ...”that looks like a Fallopian tube” which is certainly thinking in the right direction. We really do not know what this thing is, and never will understand it without acknowledging that it has a  function. It is doing something for the interstellar medium or for the galaxy. Supernova are connected with these sorts of larger structures. We do not know yet which comes first: the supernova or the larger structure, or if they arise together as part of some larger process. Now that we've spoken, very briefly, about these cosmological miracles, let us  turn the focus to a human level. What can we learn about ourselves by studying supernova? Supernova are extraordinary stars. Perhaps they can shed light on extraordinary people. I've always been fascinated with how some people, like a Mahatma Gandhi or a Saint Claire of Assisi, can affect so many people, over such a large distance and for such a long time. I'm  not talking about social media, I think that is a different discussion. Let us keep our focus on pre-internet circumstances. How much effect can one person have? Most of us affect only our nearest neighbors. Yet in history, we see that some people affect whole continents. Think of Gandhi in India. We see hundreds of thousands,  even millions of people, being moved physically, now here, now there. We  know that by the thousands, they're having new thoughts about themselves and their country. New hopes and wishes and that these new thoughts and feelings will persist for decades, and will be felt in the future by people who never met him. Well, I have  to admit I do not actually know what kind of energy can produce all that. I do know that it is orders of magnitude beyond what you and I are capable of in our current condition. Let us bounce back and forth between the world of supernova and the world of people, in hopes of understanding both better. A supernova becomes instrumental in organizing matter over much larger distances than it did while it was a star. Our star orchestrates matter over a distance of about a hundredth of a lightyear. That means, affecting mostly only the star's nearest neighbors. By comparison, the Crab Nebula supernova is organizing matter over at least 20 lightyears and is connected to structures that are hundreds, maybe thousands of lightyears across. That is a scale jump, comparable to how Saint Claire could change the life of the religious, not only in the small town of Assisi, but in all of Italy and then all of Europe. Claire did not yell louder to reach more people. I'm fairly certain she was soft-spoken. Some other transformation must have taken place in her, that allowed her to be connected to people over vastly larger distances. Another supernova characteristic is the quantity and the quality of the new energies produced. I've already mentioned that during its initial flare, the supernova can put out a quantity of energy comparable to the entire galaxy. That would be like one of your cells putting out as much energy as your entire  body. The average cell would be blown to smithereens by that much energy. The  Crab Nebula continues to put out at least a hundred thousand times the energy of our Sun. In the real world quantity is important, but also the quality of energy is important. As a physicist, our toolbox is very limited in distinguishing, describing, measuring different qualities of energy. Some physicists even believe that energy cannot have different qualities. But something can exist, even if I do not have a name for it. The  best we can do with current physics is to look at the frequency of the energy emitted. For example, the frequencies emitted by the Crab Nebula, compared to an ordinary  star. We see that for the supernova the frequencies are shifted very much towards  the higher, such as ultraviolet, X-ray, gamma-ray. The Crab Pulsar in fact has the distinction of being the source of the highest-frequency photons we have ever measured. Higher frequencies are more penetrating. Think about X-rays being able to give you a photo of the inside of the body, as opposed to the lower frequencies of visible light that can see only the very outside of your skin. Higher frequencies can also carry more information. Bringing  this over to the human realm, I'm not necessarily saying that Buddha emitted higher frequencies than you and me, though he very well might have. I am saying, that the energies he worked with, were much more penetrating and able to accomplish much more in a very short time. In the electric cosmology viewpoint, stars  are conduits for energy just as everything is in the universe. You and I do not really create energy, we take in material around us and we liberate that energy. Stars transform the galactic electrical energy into the light and heat that sustain us. Stars are conduits for the liberation or the transformation of energy. When a star goes supernova, it becomes capable of conducting millions of times more energy than the star it came from. In the human world, I am proposing that something comparable is possible for you and me, and was actual for the Buddha and perhaps on a smaller scale, for someone like Dr. Martin Luther King. Their lives and consciousness actually are more penetrating. They are working with a different quality of energy. They  found a way to conduct and transform, both a larger quantity, and a finer quality, of energy.  A third characteristic of the supernova, is that of changing time. In the compact  pulsar that we see in the center of the growing supernova body, the gravity is so intense that, according to general relativity, time flows hundreds or even thousands of times slower than it does for you and me. But there's more to it than that. I can have two events of equal energy, but the effects of one event will dissipate and disappear  very quickly, while the effects of the second event might last for years or centuries. What makes that difference? I wonder about that. I think it has something to do with working for myself versus working for others. Vain glory and self-importance generally do not lead to lasting and beneficial change. But even the worst tyrants have claimed they were working for the benefit of others, so we must be very careful when trying to answer this one. I do know that the soul of Martin Luther King Jr. really does reach across time to touch people who never knew him. I know that  many physicists tell us that cause and effect only work locally, and causes cannot stretch across time. But my direct experience tells me otherwise, and I must follow what  I know. That time is flexible and has other dimensions outside of a simple line, is actually ancient knowledge and I would daresay, a direct experience that many of us have had. Basic principles are expressed at all levels of the universe. The potential to really change, and become useful to something larger, is a  principle that is playing out at every level of the universe, in cells, in people, in stars which you can begin to see if you know to look for it. We can learn about such possibilities in ourselves by studying the comparable phenomena outside ourselves. Studying this possibility in the world around me, can help me work with the same in myself. If we did not see it with our own eyes, we would not believe that stars could become supernova. But they do. If we did not see it with our own eyes, we would not believe that caterpillars can turn into butterflies. But they do. And that level of transformation really is comparable to a transition latent within each of us. [Music] [Music] 
welcome to space news from the electric universe brought to you by the thunderbolts project at Thunderbolts dot info human beings around the world today are looking at planets in an entirely new light the electric universe offers new theoretical possibilities for planet formation and planetary science experimental research with electrical discharges and electric fields has created new horizons for understanding the visible features of planets our neighbor Mars is the source of many ongoing mysteries for planetary scientists as Professor and Mars investigator Phil Christiansen recently stated there's a lot of knowledge and not so much understanding the most stupendous feature on Mars is Valles Marineris the great trench stretching more than three thousand miles across the Martian surface in the 1970s the engineer Ralph juergen's first proposed that Valles Marineris is the scar left by a giant interplanetary lightning bolt if these events did occur can they be replicated in experiments on earth within the electric universe community this challenge is now being met by those exploring the theory of planetary electrical scarring recently geologic researcher Michael Steinbach ur an experimentalist Billy Albertson have collaborated to replicate the complex conditions that might have been present in an epic of planetary instability today Michael and Billy provide an introduction to their collaboration including Billy's recent reproduction of Valles Marineris it was some time ago that mark Spann gave me a call and told me about this friend of his named Billy Yelverton and how I had to contact him he was doing all these experiments it reflected well on what I was proposing so I called Billy we hit it off right away we just seemed to enjoy each other's company and talk and he's been doing experiments using electricity seventy thousand ninety thousand volts moving material and the idea is he can kind of replicate what's described in worlds in collision what took place sometime within the last 10,000 years and there's descriptions of all of this dust and how it's being blown around by incredible winds and making formations so Billy started originally removing material from the bottom of his chamber and it would reorganize it and it was really interesting it made what looked like circular mountain formations in many instances and I kept bugging him Billy can you please drop the dirt from above instead of lifting it from below so it might be more similar to what's what was happening he graciously figured out how to do this he got a box of dust and a screen fine screen and heat a vibrator and he vibrates the box and the dust falls from above in a very controlled manner while he has an electromagnetic event taking place both blow and the first one he did happened to be the day that Ben Davidson was visiting the suspicious observers Ben Davidson and lo and behold they start talking about how this reminds them of a barred spiral galaxy and it starts to have features that are fairly similar to Valles Marineris and it's creating one side larger than the other I think the a notice is concentrating the dust faster than the cathode it might be the reverse Billy knows and there's an area in between it's kind of resembles the canyon but it's not being excavated it's being prevented while this event is happening surrounding it and later if he did one with a water element that prevented accumulation while you have formations growing around it and I sent it to a friend of mine at Princeton actually the gentleman who introduced me to Velikovsky in 1970 and he saw this and he goes this guy Billy Alpert it's incredible you have to find him and meet him and I said he's my friend he's my buddy and he couldn't believe that of like 7 billion people on the planet I happened to somehow hook up with this savant who's able to do things on a shoestring in his backyard baking things that seemed to be replicating catastrophes and really recently and he's continuing to evolve and change and shift I make recommendations and he does him and it's just like a dream come true I can't believe how lucky I am Billy Albertson has been if I was religious a godsend he's been beyond my wildest dreams and everything seems to be pointing into a process of accumulation these catastrophes be caused by dusty plasma electromagnetically organized and concentrated it all started with the Thunderbolts without a contest or dendritic Ridge formations and up until that time had done quite a bit with electricity but not really into the geological realm there and so we started out with the lightning bolt and of course you know we create a perfect crater with a raised rim and you know all the features that you see with the with a collision we can perform identically if not better with a with a lightning bolt electric arc mode discharge however down the road as we continued I I noticed that the dielectric properties had more to do with it than conductive anodes and cathodes so to speak and so we tried some acrylic sheets and glass sheets laid down on top of a conductive iron cathode and we started with anodes above that with some material like clay we used told the mind and all different types of sand and in pottery clay as well as you know Georgia clay right out of the ground and we found that this dark mode discharge turned out to move and create more motion than any of the conductive type discharges over conductive areas and though that turned out to be quite astonishing we were in a lot of it in AC voltage and DC voltage and turns out that with with the with the AC voltage you can put one electrode whether be handled cap you know well the basis actually doesn't really matter with a single overhead electrode we could get incredible amount of motion across a sheet of acrylic with the that resembles you know what is described with the thunderbolts as EDM electric discharge machining and after that we went into the DC voltage and found that with just a single overhead anode or cathode we would not get those same type of motions so we had to play around there a little bit so we figured out that we if we placed anode and cathode above a neutral base then we got everything back youth all these motions start coming back to the table of you and yeah was until talking with Michael and of course if anybody knows Michael he's he's quite a persistent fellow there so you know it's if you want to get him off your back you just well go ahead and try some of these things he encouraged me quite a bit though and from there it was just very much incredible he was wanting to try and blow the dust up or maybe lift it up with a fan or some sort of you know blower to get the the dust up into the atmosphere and I thought well why don't we you know if he you know read worlds in collision if we just you know put it above it if we could place a reservoir above the discharge you know table and shake it out so made a little wooden box and put a screen on the bottom of it and we attached a little small vibrating motor or the speed control to you know control the amount of dirt that fell and lo and behold this uh this perfect death shape bar spiral will show up and it's very consistent that happens every single time there every time you put it down there it's pretty incredible for continuous updates on space

You've just entered the theater of an alien sky. If the words and images seem strange to you there's a reason for this. Our world was once a vastly different place. To experience this won't hurt you and there's nothing to fear. In our previous episode, we observed the critical role of a great crescent in the ancient sky. The placement of this crescent on the sphere of an enigmatic body called the primeval Sun is one of the unresolved mysteries of the ancient world. The first step in a resolution must be to honor the early historic descriptions of things not seen in our sky today. The crescent had nothing to do with our moon, and the great sphere on which the crescent appeared certainly was not our Sun. It was the sphere at the gas giant Saturn, appearing as a massive body visually dominating the sky. Yes, today's Sun was present. It was the Sun that cast the illuminated crescent on the towering form of Saturn. But, why the incessant contradiction of our familiar sky? Ancient astronomies place Saturn at a preposterous location, far from the orbit that we know today. Saturn occupied the celestial pole, the axial center of the turning heavens. This unthinkable idea, when taken with the seriousness it deserves, places stringent demands on our reconstruction - and an inescapable requirement that the crescent revolve around the polar center in a cycle of day and night. Descending to the left at sunset, below at midnight, rising to the right at sunrise, and standing inverted above at noon. Of course, in this description we're using the modern language of day and night. But the language is reversed in more ancient times. It's well established that the ancient counting of days was from sunset to sunset. We explain this language by an ancient reverence for that moment in the daily cycle when the planetary configuration exploded into life at the beginning of the archaic day. But there's much more to this story. The symbolism of the crescent takes on far-reaching implications with the emergence of the cosmic pillar, a form we noted only briefly in the previous segment. The pillar, linked to the movement of the planet Mars, arose with the descent of material from the red planet toward the Earth, creating a form universally interpreted, not just as a pillar, but as the axial World Mountain, the cosmic support and resting place of the creator himself, the primeval Sun. A mountain of fire and light, the mountain of creation, the mountain of assembly, an axial pillar around which the heavens visually turned, all meaningless in the absence of the original referent in the sky. A single cosmic column inspired the diverse images of the crescent at the summit. Suddenly things were seen imaginatively that were not imagined previously: the mythic mountain of the moon; the outstretched arms or wings of a divine celestial figure; shining horns, a horned pillar called the Bull of Heaven; a cleft peak, or twin peaks; twin supports of the sky, as extensions of the central column; a revolving crescent ship on its mooring post; and we can add countless ancient images and pictographs of the daily cycle. We explain the full range of mythic images by the placement and movement of the crescent. Each and every mythic form inspired by the crescent must have revolved in the sky - against all seeming logic, against all familiar human experience. And not just a revolving crescent form, but revolution in a precise relationship to an archaic daily cycle. A contradiction of anything and everything that could be said of a daily cycle today. Every mythic interpretation of the crescent thus becomes an acid test. That means, a test the reconstruction must meet and alternative explanations could not meet. A crescent form seen as the arms of a celestial figure. Upright and inverted arms in a predictable relationship to opposite phases of growing bright and growing dim. One phase seen as the twin or double of the other. The phase of brilliance, arms upright, produced the images of life and power, the phase of dimming, with arms inverted came to mean negation, or absence of life. This unique mythic role of a revolving crescent as outstretched arms in a daily cycle, can only open our minds to a much broader range of myths and symbols. What about the other mythic forms of the crescent, since they must also have rotated absurdly around a central star? We'll show that every predicted correspondence occurs in explicit detail, the more archaic the tradition, the more precise the correspondence, as we would expect, all with no explanations available under common suppositions about the ancient sky. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by the Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info. How and when did the asteroids and comets in our solar system form? For many decades, astronomers have embraced the story that these small rocky bodies are the primordial leftovers of our solar system's formation; supposedly from a nebular cloud, four and a half billion years ago. Of course, as viewers of this series have long known, science discovery has done little to nothing to support this view. In fact, one of the great surprises of the Space Age is that asteroids and comet nuclei appear remarkably similar. They have complex rocky and rubble-strewn surfaces. The Electric Universe has always proposed the “radical hypothesis” that comets, asteroids and meteoroids were torn from planetary surfaces by interplanetary lightning in an epoch of planetary instability. A major piece of this puzzle is the evidence for electrical scarring on planets and moons and one of the most dramatic examples of such scarring may be the enormous trench, Valles Marineris on Mars. In this episode, retired nuclear engineer Ray Gallucci offers an independent analysis of the specific role that Mars may have played in creating the asteroid belt. Today I'd like to talk on the plausibility of the electrical birth of the asteroid belt from the Electric Universe perspective. Some background on the asteroid belt. Traditionally the asteroid belt formed from the primordial solar nebula as a group of planetesimals form proto planets, and this is taken from the asteroid belt discussion in Wikipedia. Between Mars and Jupiter however, gravitational perturbations from Jupiter imbued the proto planets with too much orbital energy for them to accrete into a planet. The collisions became too violent and most of the proto planets shattered. As a result, 99.9 percent of the asteroid belt’s original mass was lost in the first 100 million years. Now, on the Electric Universe  Theory, the EU Theory of asteroid formation does not require that one object smash into another one for there to be craters; and there's a discussion video on Thunderbolts.info, Dawn Approaches the Asteroid Belt and I'll be taking some quotes from there. Electric arcs can gouge surfaces and scoop out material, accelerating it into space, leaving clean, deep pits. Comets also exhibit surface features that are the same as those observed on asteroids, so the conclusion is that the two are really one thing and not “dirty snowballs” versus “rocky bodies.” Let's talk about Vesta which is the second largest asteroid. Vesta with a diameter of approximately 530 kilometers, compares to Saturn's moon Enceladus or Mimas in size, again taken from that Thunderbolts presentation. There are indications that Vesta has experienced some powerful collisions in the past, since one of the craters near Vesta’s South Pole is 460 kilometers in diameter, which is more than 80% of the asteroid size. The crater is close to 13 kilometers below the mean elevation of the terrain with a rim about six kilometers above. There was an 18 km-high central peak as well. The question that's asked in the Electric Universe presentation is, why did an impact that removed more than 1% of the asteroids mass not blast it into pieces? Especially given that the size of the crater is almost the size of the diameter of the asteroid itself. Continuing with Vesta, other asteroids as well as small moons exhibit craters that should have exploded them into fragments when they were hit. According to gravity- based models, they are loosely compacted and act like big sand piles and absorb the impacts without shattering. They have no hard crust to begin with, so they haven't fractured despite repeated pounding. Plasma arcs do not disturb the surrounding surfaces when they are used in industrial applications. Based on laboratory analysis, that is what has occurred on Vesta and in all the asteroids, moons and planets of the solar system: plasma discharge erosion.... So again, that's the Electric Universe Theory. Now let's look at the Valles Marineris on Mars and this is taken from the Wikipedia entry on Valles Marineris. This is a system of canyons that runs more than 4,000 kilometers long (that's 2,500 miles) it's 200 kilometers wide (that's 120 miles) and it's up to 7 kilometers, deep or 23,000 feet. It's one of the larger canyons of the solar system. Valles Marineris is located along the equator of Mars and stretches for nearly a quarter of the planet’s circumference. It has recently been suggested that Valles Marineris is a large tectonic crack, formed as the crust thickened and was subsequently widened by erosion. Some channels may have been formed by water or carbon dioxide and this is the Wikipedia explanation of Valles Marineris and this is what the mainstream physics holds: that it's all due to tectonic activities. The picture shows there - you can see how long Valles Marineris is. I mean it is a huge surface feature on Mars itself and we note that in the 1970’s the engineer Ralph Juergens first proposed that Valles Marineris is the scar left by a giant interplanetary lightning bolt, not necessarily a tectonic activity. Let's talk about an analogy with laboratory plasma. Recently, geologic researcher Michael Steinbacher and experimentalist Billy Yelverton, exploring the theory of planetary electrical scarring, have collaborated to replicate the complex conditions that might have been present in an epoch of planetary instability; and this is taken from the Thunderbolts video: Valles Marineris in the laboratory, a Space News from 2015 and there's a picture there of the scarring that was done in the laboratory. And my observation is, even the most jaded skeptic should admit some resemblance to Valles Marineris. If you just go back to the previous slide and you look at the picture of Valles Marineris there, and then you look at the laboratory version of the plasma scarring, I think it's pretty obvious that there's certainly a similarity. So, now I would like to consider if Mars was the sole source of the asteroid belt. So rather than delve into the electrical plasma arc discharge as the potential creator of Valles Marineris, I'm going to focus on the mass of Mars surface potentially ejected during such an encounter with a closely placed passing planetesimal, comparable in size to the largest of the known asteroids which happens to be also known as dwarf planets, now that Pluto has been demoted, and this asteroid is Ceres. I'm going to take an independent look and see is the amount of mass in the asteroid belt consistent with what might have been ejected from Mars? The maximum amount of Mars’ surface ejected during such an encounter would have been - there's a calculation there based on the volume of the depth and expanse of Valles Marineris. It calculates out to 2.2 times 10 to the 19th kilograms. From the estimated total mass of the asteroid belt, which is about three times 10 to the 21st kilograms, more than a hundred times greater than the maximum estimated mass that could have been ejected from Valles Marineris. Ejection solely of Mars surface material could not have generated the entire asteroid belt. It’s about a factor of 100 to small; not that it could not have contributed to it, but we need to find some other mass in order to account for the asteroid belt. Let's consider a contribution from a planetesimal. The total mass of the asteroid belt, 3 times 10 to the 21st kilogram, with less than 1% arising for Mars itself, that 3 times 10 to the 21st kilogram, that would be the minimal mass needed for the planetesimal, if it were completely disintegrated and its debris contained within the belt. Again, I'm going to just talk about a collision, or about, it's not a collision but an interaction, electrical interaction between Mars and one planetesimal. I mean there could have been multiple, but let's look at if it had one and what would the size of that one planetesimals have had to be. Let's assume the same density as the largest asteroid or dwarf planet, which is Ceres, the corresponding radius would have been the cube root of this formula here, which is based on the size of the mass of the asteroid belt, the mean density of Ceres etc. This planetesimal would have had to have a radius of 690 kilometers. Ceres itself has a mass just under 10 to the 21st kilograms at a radius of 473 kilometers. So, the postulated planetesimal would have been roughly three times as massive and 50% wider than the currently known largest asteroid, which is Ceres. Let's put this in some perspective. Mars itself has a mass of 6.4 times 10 to the 23rd kilogram and a radius of 3,390 kilometers. So, the planetesimal would have been only about 0.5% as massive and 2% as wide as Mars. Quite a small entity, but certainly not far out of line with Ceres. If this was all going to come from one planetesimal, the asteroid belt, in an interaction with Mars, it would not have had to been that much larger than Ceres which is the largest one currently known. Despite the moon being roughly 25% the width of the earth, in other words 1,737 km versus 6,371 km, we note that its mass is only slightly above 1% that of Earth, which is around seven point three times 10 to the 22nd kilograms versus Earth's mass of just under 6 times 10 to the 24th kilograms. The ratio of the moon's mass to that of Earth is only about twice the ratio of the proposed planetesimal to that of Mars, despite a much greater difference in size. I mean the moon is quite large compared to the earth itself, as moons go relative to their planets. And so, what Mars would have needed for this interaction would have been something a lot smaller than our own moon. Therefore the planetesimal need only have been comparibly as dense as other lone asteroids to have generated the asteroid belt via an electrical discharge interaction with Mars. So, in conclusion, is the Electric Universe Theory’s explanation for the formation of the asteroid belt plausible? At least from the perspective of the amount of mass involved, I did a crude analysis and I have a positive answer to that. However, I leave it to the Electric Universe theorists to continue their explanation of the phenomenology and its plausibility, towards which they appear to be off to a good start. [Music] 
This is the first of a two-part presentation on some of my thoughts of the cosmology of the Electric Universe. Like bad margarine or cheap white bread, the cosmology offered by current physics is a harmful imitation of something that used to be wonderful. Cosmology is supposed to be a framework in which everything we experience has its own place, as well as its relation to everything else. However, in current cosmology, you and I are meaningless accidents, which means that everything most real to you, your thoughts and feelings and sensations, they are henceforth declared meaningless and accidental. This is an act of violence, perpetrated upon us by astrophysics and it must be called out for what it is, and replaced by a framework that includes you and me, and all of humanity, and furthermore includes aspirations and yearnings and those anticipations we feel when we are in touch with deeper parts of ourselves. I first encountered the Electric Universe collective while I was preparing lectures on supernova in 2012 in my hometown of Boston. It took me a while to adjust to what I was reading. Electricity? In space? In my first education the presence of electricity in astrophysics was dismissed in about 10 minutes. I kid you not, and it was never brought  up again. So during that year, 2012 I was chewing on the idea that electricity might actually play a part. And I came to see that, well, not only does electricity do a better job of explaining supernova, but that just about every branch of science would benefit immensely by reconsidering the role of electricity. Consider the following diagram. The student of science these days meets many such diagrams. On the top, you see I have a line, a distance scale. And on the left we have  very small sizes, the size of nuclei of atoms and then moving to the right, we go to very, the largest distances that we know, the distances of galactic superclusters. On the bottom is another line. This time with frequencies, and very low frequencies on the left, very slow oscillations, and then moving up to the right, all the way to the highest, fastest frequencies that we know of, the cosmic rays. Now one thing you'll note about this diagram is that everything is on the same line. Well, what an  assumption to think that the length of an atom is the same kind of length as the length of a man, or the length of a galaxy. In our current cosmology we are justified in putting everything on one line, because we believe that the only difference is magnitude. Or with energy; we put the intense gamma ray of a supernova on the same line as the infrared warmth that you and I feel when we embrace each other. There's an assumption in these diagrams, that the frequencies are not different kinds of energy. They're only different amounts of energy and different rates of oscillation. Now consider this second diagram. This is a very different cosmological statement. Inhabitants of this cosmology are not primarily known by a number, but they are known by what they fit inside of and what is inside of them. This is not a new idea. I did not make  this up. This is a very old idea. In fact it is only in the last few centuries that western science came up with the notion that we can put everything on one line, or that we would even want to. It is only in the past few centuries that scientists abandoned the idea that we live in a living universe and that everything lives inside  of some larger world. Take some time. Put these two diagrams next to each other. Ponder them and what they say. The cosmology of the Electric Universe is more like the second diagram. If you talk to people who are studying in the EU community, whether in geology, or biology or planetary science, I think you'll find that all of them are seeing that we live in a connected universe. A universe that is worlds within worlds. Hierarchy is a real idea. A cell within your body is not at the same level as your entire body. A star  within a galaxy is not at the same level as the entire galaxy. These differences in scale matter; they are real and they give a complexity and a beauty to science that cannot be found when you place everything on the same line. Let us look at the relationship between stars and planets. Take our Sun and Earth. When you read about the solar wind in mainstream media, the solar wind is something to be feared. Oh the poor Earth. It is in danger, according to the mainstream narrative. It is a lucky accident that there just happens to be a magnetic field on the Earth, that just happens to be strong enough to protect the Earth. This narrative is harmful and it needs to be resisted. I can assure you that the Earth is in no more danger from the Sun than your liver is in danger from your  heart. The solar system is a living being. All parts connect and work together. This  connection between stars and planets, it is just as complex as the connection between the heart and the various organs of our bodies. And this is part of what I am studying. If we simplify the picture, and include connections, we can have a very different view of the Sun and the Earth. The previous, antagonistic image is replaced by one of connection. The Sun, on the left, sends out electromagnetic flux which both enwraps the Earth and is transformed by the Earth. This modified flux then returns to the Sun. Schematically, we are looking at an electrical transformer. Already this is a completely different idea than of a dead rock, silently circling a lonely fusion bomb of a star. This is a new picture of an Earth intimately connected to the Sun. It might even evoke ideas of the Earth playing the role of some sort of transformation of solar energy. This is a cosmology I can take seriously. Let us look more at this electrical connection between the Sun and the Earth, starting on the surface of the Earth and working our way out. On a sunny day, there is an approximately 100 volts per meter potential on the surface of the Earth, pointing straight up into our atmosphere. This is shocking; no pun intended. Our electrical outlets in our homes are about 100 volts and are you saying that between my head and my feet is just that amount  of voltage? Yes, that is the truth. Let us zoom out. On the Earth there's always hundreds of lightning storms producing about 100 lightning strikes per second  and each strike, a million volts, 10,000 amperes. The textbooks tell us that  this electrical activity is only local to the Earth. That this electrical activity has nothing to do with any connection, to the Sun or other planets. This is completely false. The electrical phenomena on Earth make no sense, unless we see them connected to the larger body of the solar system. Zooming out more, we can see this electrical connection beyond the Earth was brought out by recent studies into what are called jets, sprites and  elves that reach out from the Earth into space. Electric Universe people  have been predicting this for decades, that we should see electrical activity shooting off the Earth and going out into space. This prediction was met with ridicule and any publication of such nonsense was completely forbidden, except for those pesky commercial airline pilots. They kept seeing beautiful shots of red and blue lightning, shooting up above the tops of thunder- clouds, shooting up into space. And believe it or not, for 20 years the reports of the pilots were ignored, because according to existing theories, this was impossible. If ever you  need an example of the absurdity of the human condition, remember this case where thousands of reports by hundreds of pilots were ignored, because such things were considered not possible. I don't know what tipped the balance. Someone in power must have died. Luckily the journals started publishing the findings. Let us zoom out a little more and see what larger environment these sprites and jets are communicating with. Pulling further out, we see the Earth and  all its lightning and its sprites and its jets are just a very small part of a much larger electrical system. Here I've drawn two rings around the Earth. They are called the Van Allen belts. The inside ring is high-energy protons. The outer ring is high-energy electrons. You  should know that these were a complete surprise to our current batch of planetary scientists. But someone who was awake to the fact that all worlds live within larger worlds, which live within larger worlds, well this sort of thing is not a surprise. Electrical systems create layers of alternating positive and negative  charge. We see this in biology and geology, so why should we not  see it in astronomy? The function of these belts is yet unknown but we  can say with certainty that they are part of the electrical body of the planet and that they are essential for the assimilation of solar energies into the planetary level. We  can step back more and we can see our Earth in the same picture as our Sun. I've drawn the Sun and the first three planets with a third dimension. On my drawing there  is a hill, leading up to the Sun. This hill represents electrical activity. The Sun is the highest electrical activity in our system; the highest electrical potential. All planets in our system live within the electrical body of the Sun. As  we move out from the Sun, the electrical potential decreases. Mercury is at a higher electrical potential than Venus. Venus is at a higher electrical potential than the Earth. Try, if you can, to remember all the electrical activity around the Earth. The lightning strikes, the sprites  and the jets, the Van Allen belts. All this exists in the larger electrical body of the Sun. In Part 2 of the Cosmology of the Electric Universe, we will explore how the body of the Sun lives in the larger body of the galaxy. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info NASA's New Horizons mission to the dwarf planet Pluto has provided scientists on Earth with countless puzzles and mysteries. From impossible sand dunes, which were never expected on the tiny planet's frozen surface; to equally unexpected giant mountains; to surprising absence of so-called "impact craters" and selective regional cratering with highly circular craters not to be expected on any Kuiper Belt object. The Plutonian moons have proved equally surprising, such as the moon Charon with it's puzzling troughs and trenches stretching for hundreds of miles. And now, a team working with the Chandra X-ray Observatory has reported perhaps the greatest surprise about Pluto to date, the discovery of the emission of X-rays from Pluto. The team is also reporting that Pluto has a giant comet-like tail, which the scientists believe maybe as much as 1,000 times the radius of Pluto. The scientists say of Pluto's surprising X-rays: "We have just detected, for the first time, X-rays coming from an object in our Kuiper Belt, and learned that Pluto is interacting with the solar wind in an unexpected and energetic fashion. We can expect other large Kuiper Belt objects to be doing the same. Before our observations, scientists thought it was highly unlikely that we'd detect X-rays from Pluto." Today, physicist Eugene Bagshov begins the first in a four-part series, offering his analysis of the most compelling scientific data from the Plutonian system. In the recent months, we have seen more and more data being released and analyses being made in the wake of the historical Pluto flyby of the New Horizons space probe. Let us briefly review the available data in some of the publications to see if they might provide a noble outlook on this warped planet and maybe even clues relevant to the Electric Universe agenda. First, I would like to discuss the visual part of the planet, and what is happening on its surface. When you look at Pluto, probably the first thing that catches your eye is its incredible diversity. We might see quite complex and strange land forms as well as more regular ones: craters, mountains, rills, valleys, smooth plains, "pitted uplands, bladed terrain, snakeskin terrain," and even something that resembles sand or snow dunes and other things like that. So, from the first look it doesn't appear to belong in the place where it is situated right now in our system. Rather it looks more similar to our terrestrial planet family or maybe Saturn's moon Titan. In previous Space News episodes about Pluto, we've already touched on that subject and discussed the possible origins of this dwarf planet as a captured object, possibly former moon of a giant planet. So the diversity of its surface seems to support this idea, which is consistent with the EU scenario of planetary chaos. Probably the most distinctive feature on the whole planet, or at least the part that we've been able to observe, is the so-called Tombaugh Regio, a bright feature sitting slightly to the right of center of the New Horizon's encountered hemisphere and on the opposite side of the planet, with respect to the prime meridian of Pluto. The prime meridian is counted from the spot above which the biggest moon Charon hovers. So, this mentioned region cannot be seen from Charon. The brightest part of Tombaugh Regio is called the Sputnik Planum, and in a lot of ways it's very different from all the other visible regions. According to the spectroscopical data, Sputnik Planum terrain is mostly composed of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and methane ices. We might see very bizarre cellular patterns on its surface. From the visual data available, they seem to be a slightly convex features separated by shallow troughs about 100 meters deep. It is thought that this might be caused by convection, since the mentioned ices are somewhat soft in the present conditions and might flow almost like a very viscous liquid, creating these convective polygons. The heat source for this convection is unknown. Basically a few versions were proposed. The remainder of the internal heat left from the epic of planetary formation, the heat from radioactive elements in the deeper layers, or maybe there were freezings of the hypothesized subsurface oceans, which would also liberate a significant amount of latent heat. Aside from those cellular structures, the Sputnik Planum demonstrates another remarkable feature, the complete absence of craters. So, whatever it is that shapes the surface of this region, it should do it fast and strong enough to erase the possible cratering that could have been present. Aside from the convective resurfacing, another acting force could be the atmospheric erosion, mainly the sublimation and subsequent re-freezing of those ices on a daily and seasonal basis. It is also supposed that the mixture of those 3 ices might non-trivially interact with water ice and could possibly flow into the nearby regions, causing some geological surface changes, pretty much like glaciers do on Earth. I'd also like to note here that electrical erosion, of course, might also cause the material removal and deposition, and it is unknown whether it might play a role today or not. At this point, we have no idea about how strong is the electric field in Pluto's atmosphere. But as we'll see later, we have some other evidence that might suggest it is present there. I'd like to venture now into some more speculation and discuss the possible nature of the Tombaugh Regio and Sputnik Planum. It seems likely indeed that, as the scientists suggest, this is the planetary scale reservoir of nitrogen, methane and carbon monoxide ices. But why does it occupy this particular place? If the atmospheric dynamics of Pluto is mostly governed by sublimation and refreezing of ices, then they might end up anywhere on the planet. It is actually known that the atmospheric characteristics are pretty homogeneous there, pretty much the same all over the Pluto's globe. So, one might expect more or less homogeneous distribution of ices, at least over the strips of the same latitude, and indeed we see those ices in various places but not anywhere near that kind of quantity. So, this leads to the question of the formation of this feature. Maybe initially there was a significant terrain slope and a huge basin in this part of the Planum. Actually, the New Horizons team seems to think the same thing, I quote: "Sputnik Planum is mostly bordered by locally higher terrain, which suggests that it fills a topographic basin." And later this basin could have been filled with volatiles since the temperature on Pluto rises with altitude. So, the terrain depressions act like refrigerators, of sorts. NASA scientists seem to consider that some large impact event as being the reason for Sputnik Planum formation. Yet the two recent papers that model the ice convection do not consider the depth of this reservoir to be more than around 10 kilometers. But what if it's not formed by an impact, what if it's significantly deeper? Just as a wild speculation, I'd like to note that this region is located wide at the equator of the dwarf planet, where the orbit of Charon and other moons lie. And it has roughly the same diameter as Charon, a bit more than 1,000 kilometers. Could it possibly be the very place of Charon's birth? Maybe it was somehow torn out of Pluto or perhaps the material was just excavated electrically during one of the chaotic events in the Pluto's past. The same event could have led to the rich volatile loading on Pluto and birth of its other satellites, which have later settled closer to their current resonant orbits. There've probably been dozens of other satellites, which had had too unstable orbits to survive. Although, as I mentioned earlier, the actual point above which Charon hovers is located right on the opposite side of Pluto with respect to the Sputnik Planum. So, if this version of their origins is correct, there should have also been a certain period of stabilization of orbits, possibly including strong mechanical and maybe even electrical stresses to the respectful bodies during which Charon eventually migrated to the opposite side of the planet at the same time significantly slowing down Pluto's rotation.

[Music] Mainstream astronomers’ reliance on gravity as the primal force shaping the Universe, has restricted them to thinking in terms of spherical explosions and voids or bubbles, created by dying stars. Around these supposed voids, gas filaments can be seen arcing away. Our Sun sits in the middle of an enormous void called the ‘local bubble’. They  say this contains million-degree ionized hydrogen gas surrounded by a wall of colder, denser neutral gas. Within this hot bubble, gas density is much  sparser. At first they thought that the local bubble was an asymmetric cavity of  330 to 490 light years in diameter. This implied that two bubbles might have collided and merged. The most important point to note is that they believe the local bubble is deficient in neutral gas. In all the literature they keep describing it as ‘neutral gas deficient’, rather  than simply stating that it is highly ionized. Further mappings reveal that the ionized pockets actually form a tunnel that extends at least 820 light years towards Ursa Major, suggesting that it might connect at least a thousand light years into the galactic halo. As the research continues, it starts to become clear that our ‘local bubble’ was actually part of a larger cylindrical cavity that pierces through the disk of the galaxy, dubbed the ‘local chimney’. So how do they explain the formation of the bubbles, and how can they explain the structure of the local chimney? They believe supernova explosions are responsible for creating these voids. In the case of the local chimney, they speculate that energetic supernova explosions created fast-moving expanding bubbles of hot gas that collided with surrounding cold gas of the interstellar space, which in turn  became compressed into thin shells. Eventually these shells of cold gas meet other expanding hot cavities and break up, forming small tunnels or path- ways between the expanding voids. Towards the center of the local chimney we find the Pleiades, and it is here that astronomers search for the possible source of a supernovae. A little further out from these are a belt of stars, called the Gould belt. These are massive hot OB-type stars. These provide a clue as to what might be going on. The supposed young stars appear to form a ring, centered on the Pleiades and have motions that appear to imply that they are also orbiting around this point. Yet, there  is not enough mass for this to be possible. Let's just take a little step back here. Are we surprised that our Sun sits in a bubble of ionized hydrogen? No, this is exactly what we would expect to find. Our Sun sits on a filament which powers our star. The fact  that this structure seems to take on a cylindrical appearance, should also not come as a surprise. So what are we to make of the boundary layer of cooler gas surrounding this structure? Assuming that the filament takes on a simple Birkeland Current structure, we would expect recombination to occur. Marklund identified this process and showed that the elements will become preferentially sorted according to their ionization energy. This means that hydrogen and helium would always be found towards the outer edge of the filament. So comparing the density of hydrogen inside the filament to the outer edges, you should see a sharp increase in the density, and the appearance of a wall. If we examine this image, then we see that the areas in white are low density, probably hot, ionized gas. So in other words,  plasma. The darker colored areas are thought to be cold dense gas, possibly largely molecular in nature. We can clearly see that many areas seem to connect to each other, forming a sort of  network. Now it is important to point out that there is likely to be many smaller filaments connecting and overlapping, creating this blurred white part of the image. From Jim Wenninger’s work on Arcturus, we can see that the motion of the stars may reveal parts of this structure nearby us, with us circling around the local Arcturus filament. Some astronomers have wondered if the local bubble, or chimney system of the interlocking gaseous cavities is characteristic of the entire Milky Way. Astronomers looking at an updated map of cold local interstellar gas in the galactic plane, see an inner empty region with finger-like extensions or tunnels that poke through the surrounding wall and reach into the nearby regions of the galaxy. These regions are known to contain large amounts of hot, ionized, low- density gas that can be detected at radio and ultraviolet wavelengths. Right next to our local bubble, astronomers have identified a new bubble called the Per-Tau shell. It is thought to extend for about 500 light years and spans two well-studied molecular clouds, called Taurus and Perseus. Using a special technique, they were able to create three-dimensional maps of the local cloud structures. If we examine the Chameleon molecular cloud, we can see a series of filaments that seem to connect via a hub-like structure. With a void in the center, it is also physically connected to the Musca dark cloud. The Taurus  cloud extends between 131 and 168 parsecs. When viewed from the top, you might  be able to notice that it consists of two layers, separated by about 10 to 15 parsecs. This layering is consistent with several previous studies. Musca is a clear example of a filament on both the two-dimensional and three-dimensional image. It is  termed a dark cloud, meaning that it contains a myriad of sub-micron sized solid particles, often referred to as intergalactic dust grains. They tend  to block out visible light, making them appear dark. They are thought to be composed of largely molecular gas, rather than containing ionized material. Ultraviolet starlight is considered the main source of ionization in H2 regions, and in H1 regions it ionizes elements with low ionization potentials. This has led to the belief that it is the only ionizer and that in dark clouds, where starlight is absorbed, the ionization may go down to zero. This  is not necessarily correct, because in many cases, most ionization of cosmic plasma is produced by hydromagnetic transfer of kinetic energy into electrical currents which ionize. One common theme that they identified, was a point I touched on earlier - the creation of the atomic hydrogen envelopes around the molecular clouds. They also discovered that the widths between the outer and inner envelopes had a consistent ratio of 3.4. When  they identified the radial density profiles, they found that it was inconsistent with a filament driven only by gravity, and was much better suited to one where the filaments were magnetized. Previous studies of the structures of magnetic fields in the solar neighborhood cloud, have found strong coupling between the gas column density and the magnetic field orientation; which is consistent with the idea that magnetic fields play an important role in structuring the interstellar medium in and around, the local molecular cloud. Despite all of this, they still favor the formation of bubbles through supernovae. If the galaxy is composed of a network of filaments that carry slow moving ions these form magnetic fields that hold the structure together. Hannes Alfven pointed out that these structures are capable of transferring energy over vast distances, and  dissipating the energy across the double layer with a voltage drop. It is important to understand that the current required to accomplish this, may  very well consist of low energy particles. The plasma and material in these areas is not simply mixed together through random collisions. Plasmas have a tendency to produce large variations in the chemical composition. One mechanism is due to the different laws of motion of the non-ionized and ionized components of a magnetized  plasma. The condensation of non-volatile substances to grains, constitutes another separation mechanism. Any charged grains of dust, or ions, will feel an attraction towards the filament. As they move towards the filament, if they gain enough speed, they can cause non-ionized material to become ionized. This is particularly so in areas where a pinch  occurs. This can cause large areas of low density to be created. At the same time Marklund convection will sort material into radial shells. Together, these could explain the network of bubbles we see throughout our local neighborhood. [Music] 
  You've just entered the theater of an alien sky. If the words and images seem strange to you there's a reason for this. Our world was once a vastly different place. To experience this won't hurt you and there is nothing to fear.     We've said it before, and it bears repeating, that the first step in assessing the complex and extraordinary claims of this reconstruction is to be crystal clear as to the core details and their testable implications. This stylized form is the fulcrum of the reconstruction. From here, we can look backwards and forwards, to name critical events in the evolution of the configuration. We earlier named the planetary components: Saturn is the large sphere, at the celestial pole, no rings at the time. Venus is the discharging star-like form, on-axis in the center of Saturn. And the smallest sphere, Mars, visually appearing within the sphere of Venus. We've called this a quasi-stable phase of an evolving or metamorphosing configuration. Episodic motions of Mars occurred along the axis provoking streams of material alternately between Mars and Venus, and between Mars and Earth. We also observe dramatic changes in the number of discharge streamers that stretched between Venus and Saturn. In episode 4, we describe the emergence of a triangular form from the dusty plasma medium, and a subsequent explosive discharge, producing a vast cloud of luminous and chaotic debris in the space surrounding the aligned bodies. Later appeared the 8-rayed star, the centerpiece of our chronology, marking a tentative stabilization of the discharge activity. We've noted as well, that a libration occurred along the axis, such that, from Earth the different discharge configurations were seen alternately on-axis and off-axis. For any assessment of this reconstruction the shifts in 3-dimensional vantage point will be essential. In the early phases of the configuration, the interplanetary medium prevented observation of the Sun as a discrete sphere, though the Sun's lighting effects on the configuration become quite clear with the appearance of the crescent on Saturn. This meant not only a reduction in the surrounding dusty plasma medium, but a more clearly defined cycle of day and night. At the polar location, the crescent visually revolved around the polar center with the rotation of the Earth, in a daily cycle of dimming and brightening. Closely associated with the appearance of this turning crescent, was the descent of material from Mars. The first effect was a luminous spike reaching earthward. As Mars moved closer to the Earth the downward stream of material extended well below the visible sphere of Saturn, eventually connecting with the circumpolar region of the Earth. It seems that, over time, the 8-fold Venus discharge was compressed into just four directional streamers, expanding across the face of Saturn. This phase seems to have merged insensibly with another, as a dusty plasma column between Mars and Venus exhibited a conical form when seen slightly off-axis, while appearing as a bright equatorial band around Mars when viewed on-axis. Metamorphosis continued with the progressive displacement of Venus and Mars from their axial positions, the plasma stream between the two bodies taking on a spiralling form. As we'll see in due course, with continued displacement, the spiralling plasma stream between Mars and Venus gave way to a chaotic, undulating appearance as the configuration itself grew catastrophically unstable. The violent episodes that followed marked the most terrifying events in all of human history. The disastrous interlude between the dismemberment of the configuration and a spectacular phase of reconstruction. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info The American Southwest is an ideal testing ground for the hypotheses of Electric Universe geology. Geological textbooks tell us that the hallmark breathtaking features of these desert regions formed through slow erosional processes over eons of time. But laboratory experiments with electrical discharges have opened new theoretical pathways that enquirers in increasing numbers around the world are following. A remarkable contributor to the burgeoning field of EU geology is Thunderbolts colleague Andrew Hall whose articles and video presentations have explored new electrical interpretations of desert geology. In part one of his three-part presentation, Hall presents his detailed analysis of the stunning features in Canyonlands, a dramatic desert landscape in Utah beginning with the discussion of the amazing formations called the Arches. In summer of 2016 following EU conference in Phoenix, Arizona, EU geology researchers visited Arches National Monument in the deep reaches of Canyonlands, Utah where the Green and Colorado rivers channel through the Colorado Plateau. Arches National Monument is an astonishing place for anyone interested in EU geology. By conventional reckoning, the high desert plateau was carved into fantastical arches and hoodoos after millions of years of subtle water and wind erosion. To the EU researchers, however, it was evident the land was zapped, carved and seared by electrical storms that could have happened last year, so fresh looked the marks of evidence. The Arches' formation tells a story which explains one of the key phenomena that shaped the face of the planet. The phenomenon is called sputtering discharge. So let's take a look at what that is. Sputtering discharge, as used in manufacturing, is a dark to glow-mode current in plasma used to deposit thin films of material onto a substrate surface. It's analogous to electroplating, or galvanic reaction in a fluid. An electric field accelerates positive ions in plasma to collide with a source material, which breaks molecular bonds, eroding the source material. This is what the term "sputter" refers to -- the breaking away of particles in the source material which then drift in an electric field to coat the substrate. The source material is the cathode, and the substrate is the anode in the circuit. The material exchange is performed by electricity. Manufacturers often use magnetrons to shape and control the current and improve material transport efficiency with external magnetic fields. The point to be made, however, is that high voltage, low current in a plasma will erode or etch away a cathodic surface and plate itself in layers on the anodic surface. This is a process that shaped Canyonlands. To fully understand these canyons, however, first we must understand domes, because the canyons are carved from a dome. The entire Colorado Plateau is a dome -- or rather, a series of domes overlaying each other. The domes are composed of sedimentary layers of limestone and sandstone. The layers are stacked for the most part evenly and flat, like a layer cake. This basic layer cake structure is capped with the Rocky Mountains on the East and carved into canyons on the West, while it's shot through with the Lichtenberg-patterned, vertically cut gorges of the Colorado and Green Rivers. The dome structure of the plateau and the canyons carved through it is primarily the result of a natural sputtering discharge process created during intense electrical storms. Of course, in this case, we're speaking about storms created in a past environment when Earth's electric field was amplified to the point the entire atmosphere was ionized. Imagine the atmosphere stirred into a maelstrom lit with streamers of glowing plasma. Where lightning crackled, not only in the sky, but across the land, and mountain tops glowed with coronal fire under swirling clouds of dusty plasma. It would have been surreal. A place where streams of wind became electric currents. Where high and low-pressure zones acted like battery terminals, and mountain tops became electrodes drawing machine-gun lightning from the sky. Anything standing in the wind would have hissed and snapped with coronal fire. Dust in the air would have acted strange, too, as the energy of free electrons collided and overpowered weaker atomic bonds, ionizing matter, causing it to act like a ferro-fluid under the influence of a magnet. Ionic species segregated, forming unipolar winds that tore past each other in opposite directions, creating shear zones of intense electrical discharge and vortex winds of supersonic speed. The inside of Earth would have been in turmoil as well. Hot magmas spewing from volcanic vents. Aquifers boiling. Explosive eruptions of steam from deep underground, pocking the landscape with holes. Even arcs would erupt -- lightning from the ground -- caused by buried pockets of charge where minerals and water ionized. The winds, dust-laden and electric, deposited the Colorado Plateau, plating a cake across the western half of North America in the same way semiconductor manufacturers layer circuitry onto silica wafers. The stratified layers are interspersed with magma flows, petrified forests, inland seas, and dinosaur boneyards of different ages that indicate it formed in a series of events that likely recurred over millions of years. To create the Canyonlands, the voltage potential had to reverse and eat away at landscape newly laid down by the storm. Under the electric field of an electrical storm, the surface of the earth becomes positively-charged. It becomes the anode in the circuit where lightning strikes from the negative cloud base and where rain falls. In primordial ionic storms like those that formed the plateau, rain did not fall, but silica did, as dust in the air fell and adhered in layers to the dome. Inland seas, or layers washed over by tsunami generated by the storm itself, became covered over with more layers of dry overburden as the storm progressed. This left a moist layer, like icing in the center of the layer cake. This icing layer then ionized under intense bombardment from sputtering discharge in the eye of the storm and created what is known as barrier discharge in the moist layer beneath the ground. Which brings us back to Arches National Monument, proof that the canyons were carved by sputtering discharge, aided by barrier discharge, in a moist layer of the big cake. This image tells most of the story. A band of rock that looks tortured and fluid, as if it were boiled mud when it solidified, sandwiched between smooth, more- or-less even layers of stone. The canyon floor is flat, which is surprising if one accepts the consensus view that canyons were made by water erosion. Water erosion leaves deep channels and vee-cut valleys, not flat floors. This closer image shows the fluidity of the layers. At the top, the overburden rock barely sinks into the sagging layer beneath it that turned plastic because it was still solid. The plastic layer beneath sagged but didn't compress, and maintained a consistent thickness. Below that on the bottom, the 'boiled mud' layer fluidized completely and squeezed like toothpaste. What turned this bottom layer fluid and caused to sag beneath a solid overburden was electrical current. A barrier discharge current, where no gaseous atmosphere was present to ionize into plasma, but instead, the moisture and minerals in the layer ionized, generating a subsurface current. The moist layer ionized and charged species pooled into a plasma-like mud the electric field wanted to lift away. The electric currents boiled the moist layer, and it began to foam and arc into the drier and electrically resistant overburden. When sputtering removed the surrounding overburden, pressure released and vapors expanded, making gas bubbles that raised the arches. Hardened pinnacles formed where mud boiled up in convective blossoms of hot ionization. One can see how the moist layer boiled and heaved, while currents arched and thrust upward, trying to break through the overburden rock. But in this area, it was unsuccessful. The traces of barrier discharge remain in the rock. The empty, flat canyon floor, where the overburden and moist layer were carried away is where the discharge broke through to complete the circuit. Arches is a display of etching, or Electric Discharge Machining (EDM) stopped in process. The wet layer was boiling off due to the current in it and lifting away with the overburden when the process stopped leaving these arches and hoodoos. It likely stopped when the sputtering glow current suddenly jumped to arc mode, and lightning struck, dissipating the charge built-up in the wet, 'boiled-mud' layer. Sputtering discharge is typically used in manufacturing to remove only micro-meters of material. The ion bombardment on the surface of cathode material only shallowly penetrates to break atomic, or molecular bonds and release particles. So how could such a process remove hundreds of feet of solid sandstone? Well, one reason is the strength of the electric field at work on the charged species. In the primordial storm we are discussing, the electric field would have been billions, perhaps trillions of volts. The electromotive force of such a field applied to any large pool of charged species could lift a mountain and the other reason is diffusion of charge through a thousand feet of dry, sandstone overburden, to ionize the wet layer. The section of the dome overlaying the wet layer acted as a solid-state semiconductor, coherent with the intense electric field. Charge diffused through the silica layers in a manner to be discussed in more detail in Part Two of this article. But solid state electronics are the way to evaluate how charge diffused through the landscape. The wet, ionized layer then underwent a process called heat spike sputtering. Heat spike sputtering occurs when diffusing ionization causes secondary reactions. The secondary reactions occur in the wet layer, which is highly conductive and volatile. Currents heated the material and that caused thermal liquefaction, melting, and steam micro-explosions. In Canyonlands, when the wet layer ionized, it induced currents which heat-spiked, discharging from the wet layer to the layer above. The arches and bubble-like pinnacles in Arches National Monument were created by heat-spike sputtering and bubbles of micro-explosions as the 'boiled mud' layer ionized, vaporized, and discharged into the overburden. This short film produced by diveflyfish on YouTube helps visualize the process of diffusion through rock and the process of barrier discharge that caused the 'boiled-mud' layer to boil, and in it, Jim Hamman, the creator of diveflyfish and an EU contributor, employs a high voltage Tesla circuit to generate current through a granite block. There are two things to note as you watch the film. First, note how the flow of electricity diffuses through the entire granite block. Instead of channeling directly below the electrode in a narrow stream like an arc, it flows out the full footprint of the crystalline granite block. The external electric field of the circuit is diffusing charge through the granite as it would in a solid-state body. In the tense electric field surrounding the eye of the hyper-storm that etched the canyons, currents also diffused through the dome matrix in this way, ultimately ripping out mountains of earth in the blink of an eye as currents boiled and liquified the wet matrix below, similar to the plasma tornadoes that are swirling in the gaps between the electrodes and granite in the film. Second, note the plasma tornadoes that bridge the gap between the block and electrode. They are not in bright arc mode but are filaments in glow mode. The plasma tornado currents are in the air gap where the air has ionized to plasma. In the Arches, there was no air gap between the ionizing wet layer and the overburden, so the discharge was a barrier discharge coming from the 'boiled mud'. The currents flowed around the boiling, bubbling, foaming heat-spikes to fuse and harden the less conductive overburden in its pattern of arches and pinnacles. Jim's experiment demonstrates how current diffuses through granite which demonstrates how ground currents can diffuse in natural rock. Watch towards the end of the clip, arcing begins in hot spots to eat through the granite collecting the current into single arcing paths and starving the diffusion currents around them. There are many other evidences of sputtering discharge in the Utah Canyonlands. In Part Two of Sputtering Canyons, we'll examine some more. Thank you! 
it is been a journey this last year and a half I do have a lot of material to cover I recognize that there's some here that are new and I need to honor that and those who are quite involved in the project so Sapphire a sense for Solar atmospheric function in regulation experiment and dr. mark cleric Paul Anderson wal thornhill Don Scott and others are here on the what I call a core team and a job is really to evaluate the possibility is it possible to do an experiment is it feasible as a viable is it capable and those are words that we use in designs of experiments and kind of an analytical perspective when we progress with an experiment okay because this is what I would call classical science it's not theoretical its classical so we've got to break all the natural philosophy down and we've got to take a look at the opinions of suppositions two models two concepts and see whether or not it's possible to test hypotheses you see and that's really the kind of work I've done for the last 35 years so Safire I'm just gonna get on with it here as quickly as I can these are some of the older guys kind of come and gone that are you know we look into to see you know if there's there's a basis for the work that we do so we always build on the shoulders of others and it really kind of goes back from what I can see to guys like Sir Isaac Newton who was looking at spectroscopy as well you know he wouldn't might have used that word in gravity of course Heinrich Geissler was really kind of I would say the grandfather of the neon tube the gas discharge we move on to William Crookes which his experiment of throwing rubies into a vacuum chamber and watching them radiate regardless of their their opacity brilliant red was quite remarkable and I would say probably the first plasma spectroscopy type of experiment although he may not have said this but observations um of course Kristian Birkeland you know we just kind of build you know on each other's work as that as years go on and we'll get into his his working more depth as we we proceed here nikola tesla's well somebody say well it has not much to do with it but obviously his work was based on others and the research and we know what today what you know what's coming off his work hands often I'm not gonna speak too much about this because we all touched on his work earlier off waves which NASA and you know many others refer to with respect to their study of the Sun ah Rolf your guns I think is probably the one in my opinion right now that dr. Don Scott's work is based on which would be the first I guess more comprehensive a quantitative evaluation of what the Sun looks like as a circuit and then so you can see down here in I just you know quick picture of Don Scott's model here ok so this is our team there's a great there's a core team as I mentioned before there's Donald Scott as well Farah hill paul michael jim writer forest bishop David tell but Susan and Mark and then there's others that we resource um you know try to gather them in so the idea behind this is that I build a team a diverse team of various disciplines because the idea behind it is we want to find out if the experiment is going to fail we don't want to spend money if we have any opportunity for failure you see or holes in the experiment so that's why we want a diverse team so stellar atmospheric function and regulation experiment what I want to do is kind of move into quickly the overview which is phase one exam as a contemporary plausible stellar atmospheric process concepts that includes gravitational and electric process capability and concept viability determine if a design of experiments method is applicable now I know that some of these terms here may be new to some of you but those who are into experimentation would understand very quickly what design of experiments and how powerful that is it's a fairly recent tool in the last maybe 60 years to obtain a very high confidence level of analysis of a process okay I'm just want to leave it there we can talk about that maybe one on one later on so gravitational electric process capability phase two examination of the electric Sun concept prior to experiments and observations phase three quantify stellar atmospheric function in mathematical terms we may leave that as we as we move through this as there some changes now the challenge is experimental limitations design failure modes and effects analysis and phase fours examine the experimental options the plausibility feasibility viability and capability and that that doesn't just apply to whether or not we can replicate the phenomenon in a laboratory experiment but it also means the means by which we measure are they capable do we have a standard no theoretics nor theoretical models no extrapolations no interpolations no mathematical adjustments of the data do we have a ruler that we can actually all agree on that's a standard that's capable you see of giving us consistent measurements so it's vital because otherwise it's up to anybody's idea as to what you know the results are going to return and it's something that we deal with all the time in science right it's a it's a bit of a challenge so evaluation of prior experiments determine if if they're viable candidates so we can build on those you see is there is a precedent for this determine if prior experiments require augmentation to thoroughly test the hypothesis and we're going to find that there is evaluation of contemporary merit illogical capabilities determine if the experiment is feasible so all these things have to be addressed right upfront before we even start spending a nickel because I won't do it you know I mean I spent millions in our idea over the years and you have to evaluate you know before you get into it especially if you have shareholders okay so phase five engineering design and construction of the experimental so Louis I want to thank Rennes for that word because it's a lot I mean small son the u.s. is masculine not sure why but I suppose you could tell me why it's masculine the earth is I guess feminine so I probably dates back some time but these are these are the disciplines right we want all the disciplines all with distance is applying in these models face sex execution of the experiment using a design of experiments methods phase seven evaluate evaluation and reconciliation of the test results mathematical predictions and real solar data and now this is really what we're after right here now the design of experiments methodology does not allow for sanitization or sanitizing of the data the actual data feeds back into the experiment and you need that to develop your methods to identify what factors are the primary factors associated with the phenomena okay and maybe now you can see after Poul Anderson's work why he's on the team you see so hertzsprung-russell diagram has told the other day this is an old diagram but nevertheless it's something that we're all familiar with or many of us are generally it's used to take a look at the evolutionary lifecycle of a son or a star I look at a little differently and from my perspective I look at a process and this is really important that we understand that what this means is that we have an extremely extremely stable universe electrically if we take a look at the luminosity the spectral signature and temperature under the three hundred billion stars that we have in our galaxy there may be a few supernovae but generally out of the 300 billion they're not they don't vary they may be quite violent in themselves but generally extremely extremely stable enough for a person doing experimental work that is like a lifesaver you've got a process that is already under control you're not trying to identify the factors or the causes of reason why something is out of control okay if you're making hamburgers and they're bad every other day you got to find out what's wrong with them but in this case you know we're making 300 billion hamburgers and there's only one or two that are bad so it would say that however you're making hammer is it probably pretty stable you know you know what you're doing so when we look at it from a process not an evolutionary perspective it draws a it's quite a quite a different picture so it means that we only have point zero zero one star per million that change from the normal DV you know from the normal curve every year so from a statistical perspective it's an extremely stable situation and that's just that's just great news for anyone who's studying this process okay so we have two candidates one is the nuclear concept you know there's the electrical concept as we know the electrical concepts based on gravitational model by which elements are compressed to such a state that nuclear reactions occur fusion occurs in the core of the star as result of complex processing whatever those complexities are and they are really really complex from a mathematical perspective and just so you know when I did my first evaluation in January last year I found numerous disparities with the gravitational model and came to the conclusion myself personally it's none testable it's non testable model okay I I don't know how you could test it with so many so many problems with it now the electric concept on the other hands electric universe concept claims that luminosity spectrum and thermal differentials are the result of intense plasma discharge behavior beginning in the diffuse Corona and terminating in the denser Solar ionosphere okay now what that means to me is that we have two factors two primary factors we have incoming charged plasma affecting matter of a different electrical potential and that's it period that's great this is a model of the Sun as standard model of the Sun and we've gone over that's almost being real time on it because I've got we're gonna get into the experiment and what we're doing this is the model of the electric Sun and it's basically incoming charge plasma to a body of a different electrical potential in this case here the Sun is positive the incoming charge is coming from our heliopause or the source of electrons which is negative for a cathode from an electrical perspective and that's the model so we want to talk about some of the features spicules there's a lot of literature on this from slore Dynamics Observatory got McIntosh in the National Center for Atmospheric Research published in nature article he says the that looked very similar to Kristian Birkeland torella experiment results that were obtained over a hundred years ago hmm interesting so this is NASA okay so they're recognizing that they don't starting to look at and I respect these people I know there's some that have issues but myself personally you know we put men on the moon they've done a lot of things I think there's a very very intelligent people but I think that with all of us including myself if I have an assumption that may not be correct I can trigger now on the wrong path pretty quickly and it can cost a lot of money so these society there's a picture a hundred years ago looks very very very similar and we're going to examine these more more detail shortly so Kristian Birkeland if the globe is slightly magnetized slightly the patches of eruption are seen to arrange themselves in zones with long pencils issuing into space almost as in figure the picture I showed you only these pencils are bent by the magnetism which is exactly analogous to what we have assumed regarding the cathode rays issuing from the Sun okay now wall showed you this picture earlier so I won't play the point but you know these are quite remarkable it shows that branch discharge issuing from the spot sometimes follows the magnetic lines of force in the neighbor neighborhood of the equator giving rise to a phenomenon which greatly resembles the black filaments of the Sun studied by Hale element Fox these these are these are fellows that were studying astrophysics boxes in his time so he wasn't just working on his own he had friends that were what we would call modern-day astrophysics or physicists at the time this is a modern NASA Marshall Space Flight Center from David Hathaway they believe this is due to acoustic you know is it Genesis that the super rotation senior granular rotation of the of the atmosphere of the Sun around its equator I have a different and you have a different perspective of why that's occurring and if we take a look at the picture wall shows earlier this is quite remarkable from my perspective I look at it a little different than you all does but more what's really notable about this is the actual rotation of the plasma torus but the predominance in this area here this is spinning around the Sun the counterclockwise direction that's correct right well it's counterclockwise I do this yeah and now we have the EU model if you see here we have incoming charge bottom I'm not sure why that is but I know it appears that that is what is occurring but we have this mania increase main current increase in strength about its equator it's interesting because this isn't Brooklyn's work this is Quinton fioretto in March 1967 when they were studying plasma discharge for they were looking to - what it takes to actually bring plasma instability they weren't looking at any comparisons to what we see occurring in the planets or the Sun itself that was interesting in the paper is the predominance of this Taurus at forum that was spinning around spinning around the globe you see they weren't looking for this we're trying to find out how we can stabilize it the problem of course is that these are fairly granular pictures they're just the black-and-white there's not really been much examination from the electrical properties which is what sapphire is is looking into CME's berkland currents coronal mass ejections what's interesting here if I can is this predominance here if you could see the spiral shape in this ejection and take a look at what occurred with their Tarawa in 1967 and their experiment here you see and they're not the only ones I mean these types of phenomena are being recorded by others who have conducted Torrell experiments around the world in Norway in Switzerland and you know Brooklyn of course and and others dear assuming this stellar arcing or what is called today sympathetic flares but really to break it right down or we're saying that there's Cimiez that are occurring on either side of the Sun at the same time so for those of you you know we're thinking about relativity and speed light and time and things just let that soak in for a second because it means it means they were measuring this we don't understand it but it can't be happening instantaneously so we'll call it sympathetic arcing but in fact it's happening concurrently within milliseconds of each other and this is something that was observed by mister berkland the discharges opposite points this is not clearly seen because it's a still photograph however brought to my mind a very strange picture of some enormous eruptions on the Sun reproduced from marbles of the universe from some of this astrophysics guys his friends okay so we have some CME's we have mr. burr clones experiment boy there lookie visually they look very very close don't they you see and we take a look at you know the typical dark filaments that he called you know erupting from the Sun here's a picture of what his friends were able to procure from their cameras and their imagery from you know a hundred years ago concurrently you see now they couldn't measure it to be concurrent it's like wow this is like happening at the same time but now we have instrumentation is saying well they're happening within milliseconds of each other so sapphire was result expectation now what this is pointing to is the things that we're gonna be going after we're going to be looking for ion acceleration now from my perspective I do physics I do engineering I do consulting and that's what I get paid for and I'm gonna tell you right now I accept that it takes a force to cause something to accelerate we all know that but what forces that I can see if you know if there's a coronal mass ejection it's possible that maybe the particles can maintain their velocity that's for me a little difficult to to handle I would expect them to decelerate but I sure would never expect them to accelerate as you know as they leave the Sun it's just not you know they don't start to expedia should they should do that but they do okay so does this happen well as a matter of fact it appears that it does happen in normal plasma discharge stellar coronal mass ejections are a normal characteristic to this process of plasma discharge upon matter what we've already seen in some of the photographs these types of discharges within the Tarawa so we'll expect to see those things solar photosphere tufting granulation can be expected so tufting means and we're you know we're going to end up with intense plasma charge on the surface we've seen some of the pictures earlier okay now we're just talking visual right now but we have got to a point now we can actually go in and measure these things electrically and spectrally and this is the key to success at fire success or it's you know as we move forward here stellar photosphere nuclear fusion vortices within the photosphere Tufts could be expected while those who are familiar with chickens know that there's calcium and every one of their eggs and there must be people have come to conclusion that there's fusion occurring within a chicken so does it have to be millions and millions of degrees where does the calcium come from you know they keep laying these eggs but the calcium doesn't appear to be coming out of their bones so you know calcium we know as being one of the beasts one of the elements right you know so where is this coming from so is it possible we'll see fusion you know I'm kind of excited this would be really cool you know so stellar a photosphere nuclear fusion vortices within a photosphere tufts can be expected Wow so a cellular photosphere cooler than a corona can be expected well I've four grandsons and I find this quite remarkable because this is really getting closer to what turned me on to the EU because you know where the gamma rays you know it's a nuclear explosion just well there isn't many so why is the photosphere cooler well my grandson knows the closer I get to a match you know the hotter it gets and I could tell you he's like a burnt finger you know so why is it cooler but but this appears to be a normal phenomenon of a plasma discharge hmm so my perspectives starting to add up to an electric model photosphere ik stability and contrast at higher level Asia higher elevations higher frequencies can be replicable in this model as a natural result of double layers formed within a stellar discharge with instability at higher frequencies so we're going to be getting of that a little bit later not too much detail here cyclic magnetic variation results from varying direct current electrical supply to a star the charged quasi neutral plasma interacting with positively charged body will exhibit the same characteristics regardless of stellar material and this is really what I was saying my first paper I don't really care what a star's made out of the spectrum is just an indication of the predominant elements okay so you can and that goes right back to crooks work he stuck some rubies in there lit up Brett you know he's took some green cheese maybe it'll come up with some other color but the bottom line is that every element is going to start radiating a particular spectral color depending on what you know I guess order magnitude the discharge it's being exposed to you know ice cream will probably melt but you know there's other elements in there that I think we're going to go after and this is where the spectroscopy comes in and you're going to find that the technology today is available to us to really really examine these things in a significant resolution in detail so sunspots the complex behavior due to varying cosmic discharge in magnetized body similar tennis arc generation to different points can be expected so we're going to expect a number of these things to occur in the experiment 
the comet 67p churyumov-gerasimenko will be in the news for several months and it has the potential to spark extensive controversy issues could range from electric fields in space to solar system history and the history of earth itself a bedrock assumption in the modern science of comets is the claim that the nucleus of every common harbors water ice along with frozen carbon dioxide and other volatiles but paradoxically earlier probes of comets have only highlighted the absence of expected ices comet surfaces are remarkably dry and only one comet Tempel 1 revealed even a trace of frozen water just a light frost that by all appearances drifted to the surface from the coma that's the unsolved mystery of comets that 67p is no exception water in the coma but a surface that has burned black as coal and looked very much like a rocky asteroid in the standard interpretation water must be there but hidden from view as a comet approaches the Sun we see vaporous Jets emerging delivering dust and gases from the nucleus to the coma such observations have fostered the scientific conviction that warming by the Sun causes subsurface ices to evaporate this creates pockets of pressurized gas as the pressure builds the gases break through a surface layer of dust to form distinctive Jets often spanning thousands of kilometres the Jets then become the confirmation of the theory that subsurface ices are responsible even if we can't see these ices directly but there is another view in an electric interpretation a common may or may not contain subsurface ice but its activity has little to do with solar warming rather this activity occurs as the body traverses regions of different charged in the plasma domain of the Sun a vast and rarefied atmosphere of the Sun through which all of the planets move this sea of charged particles includes an electric field stretching from the surface of the Sun to the Heliospheric boundary the limit of the sun's influence though exceedingly weak at any particular place it can hold immense charge across the volume of the heliosphere as a comet moves millions of kilometres through this electric field the electrical stress is developing on the surface of the nucleus triggered dust raising events first a coma then the distinctive cometary tail as the activity grows it progressively erodes the surface much like industrial electrical machining processes the close-up images of 67p provide a direct opportunity to compare the predictions of the electric comet to the standard model of the dirty snowball we can trace the Jets to their sources observations are already underway and no exposed ice patches are reported most telling is the stark terrain that has apparently been eaten away to create massive cliffs the active excavation of the surface gives us a direct view of what was once the interior of the nucleus neither the walls of these towering cliffs nor the deep floors below exhibit the ice that the standard model requires but the problem grows the more active the comet becomes if subsurface pockets of evaporating ices are the source of Jets pushing through the surface dust then as this activity increases it would be certain to expose these ices below anything accelerated to 1/3 of walking speed will escape the nucleus altogether so far at least none of the erosional activity not even the concentrated jet activity has given investigators a first hint of buried ice is it possible therefore that the nucleus of Comet 67p really could be the rock that it appears to be what might a dry rock tell us about the nature of comets and their obscure origins and is it possible that this very comet could hold a secret for us about the birth of such bodies in a recent and violent phase of planetary history you 
[Music] [Music] good morning ladies and gentlemen I'd like to thank firstly the Thunderbolts project and the organizers for inviting me again to address you this year and I'd also like to correct a little thing that I've just said he called me dr. Carruthers well actually I'm not doctor and so I'm just leave Crothers okay today I'm going to speak to you about logo which you know is the laser interferometer gravitational observatory in its claims for black holes and gravitational waves I'd like to read to you from the LIGO team's discovery declaration it was a discovery paper this is their declaration the basic features of gw1 5:09 one for point being produced by the coalescence of two black holes that is the orbital in spiral and merger and subsequent final black hole ring down over over nought point two seconds the signal increases in frequency and amplitude in about eight cycles from 35 to 150 Hertz where the amplitude reaches a maximum the most plausible explanation for this evolution is the inspire of two orbiting masses M 1 and M 2 due to gravitational wave emission Abbott at all in this paper in Physical Review Letters now the two things to note here the two masses that's the first thing and the gravitational wave emission these are things to dispute here's a table from there paper like as black hole binary black holes it's a binary system you see the two black holes that they say that they first started with was one of 36 solar masses and the other with 29 solar masses and after they allegedly combined to form one black hole of a different type they were three solemn as short as three solar masses were radiated away as gravitational wave energy allegedly I'd like to review some things that I've done in the past regarding incompatibility of universes I've put a list here on the left hand side of what constitutes fundamentally a blackhole universe and on the right hand side what constitutes a BIGBANG universe now recall that black holes are part of a Big Bang universe allegedly all of this gravitational waves etc it's not just black holes it's inside some Big Bang universe there are let's have a look at the left side but now I'll begin with the right side in fact a Big Bang universe now there are three types of Big Bang universe and they are categorized by their K curvature and so we see that the Big Bang universe has a K curvature but no black hole universe has a K curvature and yet they are supposed to be in the same universe now the three Big Bang universes depend on as I said K and if K is equal to 1 it's a finite it's as positive curvature and it has a finite spacial size but a black hole universe is spatially infinite one can only wonder how you can fit an infinite black hole universe inside especially finite Big Bang universe similarly the other two universes of beep bang are K minus 1 in case not they are spatially infinite well the black hole universe is infinite but it doesn't have a K curvature the other other thing about a big bang universe all of the three is that they are legend 13.8 billion years old but all black hole universes are eternal they don't have any beginning or end in time so how you can you put a black hole universe inside a Big Bang universe when they don't even have the right age or Big Bang universes are literally expanding but no black hole universe is expanding at all black hole universes are allegedly asymptotically flat now this means that as you get further away from the from the black hole thus the so-called curvature of space times gets less and less and it's asymptotic so as you continue to go without any bound infinitely it becomes flatter and flatter but none of the BIGBANG universes are asymptotically anything and they'd be the black hole universe contains only one mess that is the black hole itself we call that the LIGO team claimed that they have two black holes coalescing to form one black hole you meeting gravitational waves within a BIGBANG universe and the Big Bang universe allegedly contains many masses so you see that they are fundamentally incompatible mathematically physically whatever they describe the boy they are logically incompatible yet the LIGO team claims to have found two of them not just once but three times now so that's what a total of six black holes in a BIGBANG universe of which they don't really specify but as we see they are logically inconsistent so certainly they didn't find any black holes in a BIGBANG University meeting gravitational waves I'd like to go further over some properties of the big bling universe the finite mass is concentrated at its singularity and this singularity has zero volume and infinite density the is also has an event horizon the black hole has an event horizon will you pass the event horizon there's a point of no return and it goes into the singularity but there are forces in gravity there are forces in general relativity but gravity is not one of them and the reason is that in Einstein's theory gravity is space-time curvature it's not a force now the infinite space-time curvature at this infinite space-time curvature at the singularity let's think about that a finite mass is located in zero volume has infinite density and has infinite gravity do you think any such thing exists well I certainly bullet I certainly know that no such thing exists as I've said also they have an inner they have an escape speed the event horizon is the speed at the event horizon they have an escape speed that's the speed of light question is what is the speed of light at the event horizon well I'll cover that in another slide we'll see that this argument was also logically inconsistent the asymptotically flat infinite space-time not expanding universe eternal and a single mass as I've already said so we see that these are the alleged physical properties of a black hole universe here we have a diagrammatic representation of a black hole I had to draw it in white otherwise you wouldn't see it because it's on a black background and so I've put a blue arrow there that's dark matter and it's an event horizon the singularity is the right at the center at the at the edge at the end of that little red radio line and we see that they have a sparse tool radius they call it our sub black of light now the speed of light in vacuum is something like 300 million meters per second excuse me and this is an eternal infinite asymptotically flat space-time now here are now my diagram a diagrammatic form of multiple black holes again they're all in white never various sizes because they come in sizes but sizes is not a type of the hole they're just different sizes human beings of different sizes but they're still all human beings there are four different types of black holes alleged now we look at this little diagram we see that there's eternal infinite gravity at each one of them right at their singularities and they're all supposed to be inside a 13.8 billion year old Big Bang universe that's not asymptotically anything consider any one of those black holes in that diagram they all have the same characteristics of a singularity where we have zero volume infinite density and infinite gravity and they're also supposed to be asymptotically flat spaced times now every one of those black holes encounters what outside of it another black hole which has infinite gravity but let's see from the space-time curvature that's a long way from being asymptotically flat so you see you can't have even on the idea of a black hole if we take that at face value you can't have multiple black holes bivariate by the very definition of the black holes here is a technical issue regarding mathematical forms it's a called the principle of superposition now general activity is a nonlinear theory and that means that the principle of superposition does not hold so if you have say X as a black hole universe and Y is a big bang universe then X plus y is not a solution it's not a universe in this theory neither is X plus y or X plus X y plus y etcetera any combinations thereof because that's just superposing and that violates the mathematical form of the theory nonetheless what does Abbott and the LIGO team tell us here's what is in their discovery paper it matches the wave form predicted by general relativity for the in spiral and murder of a pair of black holes in the ring down of the resulting single black hole so how did they get these black holes in the BIGBANG universe they superposed everything's just superposed but you can't superpose because you need to have a set of Einstein's field equations to describe any configuration that you want and then solve them for that configuration you can't just superpose things upon the other because of this non-linearity so I want to now remind you about escape speed in Newton's theory the escape speed is given by this formula V escape is the square root of 2 GM over R where R was the radius of the object a spherical object M as its mass G is the universal constant for gravitation now escape speed is a two-body relation if I take a ball and I throw it into the year that left the earth but it didn't escape because I didn't throw it fast enough and if you throw or fire something fast enough it will continue to go up and not come back the minimum speed that you have to leave the earth with is called the escape speed and it's a two-body relation because if you have one body in the universe there's nothing to escape from anything so it's a two-body relation despite the fact that there is only one mass that's present in the actual expression for the escape speed but to get that expression you need to invoke Newton's theory of gravity where there are two masses which you see there is given by F is equal to GM large M small M over R squared so it's fundamentally a two-body relation where as a black hole is a one body universe so how can a black hole have an escape speed when it's in the universe on its own keynote so let's go a little further with the escape speed issue this comes from the dictionary of geophysics astrophysics and astronomy they're all experts so they tell us in general relativity for spherical black holes sparge to black holes that's what they asked very gone exactly the same expression our BH holds for the surface of a black hole that's the expression I just gave you from Newton let's quickly go back to him there's Newton's expression that's a two body relation and they say it's the same expression the surface of a black hole that RB H is an old surface consisting of those photon trajectories in our rays which just do not escape to infinity this surface is also called the black hole horizon the required radius B H follows from setting V escape equal to C C is what the speed of light some 300 million meters per second there's the equation that they use for the black hole radius to GM over C squared well that's just the rearrangement of Newton's formula Newton's expression which is a two-body relation let's have a look at now how they confound two different escape speeds at the same place at the same time in the one equation this top expression is called a metric and it's actually a solution that's for a so called spot chilled black hole and light travels along a null line so that means that D s squared on the left hand side this acquire light will be zero so we put zero in there on the left-hand side in the second line and then we can look at it without any loss of generality by considering an equatorial plane that means theatre can be 90 degrees inside theatre is zero so the sine theta term drops out and D theta which is just the differential element of a constant is also zero so that right hand side drops out completely and we're left with this middle expression now if we rearrange this middle expression we get dr over dt well that's just distance over time distance divided by the time taken is a speed so we get speed and this expression here is the dr/dt then they say at the event horizon well at the event horizon what's the value of R well we just saw that it's two GM over C squared so if we put two GM over C squared in the value of R we get 1 minus 1 that's 0 and they tell us here we find that the velocity of light at the event horizon is zero so the escape speed is the speed of light to get C in the first place they use Newton's formula and it's 300 million meters per second in this very equation now they use the same Skype speed then they tell us that the escape speed is zero so in the one equation we have two different escape speeds for at the same place which is quite impossible you can only really you can only really shake your head in amazement at how cosmologists do things here's the spot your radius of a black hole 2 GM over C squared where C is allegedly the escape speed of 300 million meters per second but we just saw that they told us at zero the other thing of course is that in this geometry it's not Euclidean Einstein's fancy non-euclidean four dimensional geometry it's Romanian or pseudo Romanian and so this expression or this quantity R that appears in equations it's not a radius and it's not even a distance and yet they adorn it with the properties of a radius when strictly speaking it's not a distance at all in this expression here we go again with the swatch two radii it's not a radius remember but they tell us here this is from Wally's book on general relativity it's quite a well-known book it's another fairy story from A to Z as fast your black hole of mass equal to that of the earth it has a spatial radius of one centimeter he says it's a radius no it isn't a black hole of one solar mass has as fast your radius of only three kilometers well no it's not a radius and that's where the escape speed is which I just spoke of having that schizophrenic property here we come again to the idea of forces gravitational forces in generality videos I said gravity is not a force because the space-time curvature now let's consider a spring who's a pretty unsophisticated looking Springs because I drew them myself and I didn't have much software to do it with anyway we take a spring horizontal and let's assume that the left-hand side of this spring is fixed through a wall or something so I can't move and you want to stretch this spring or compress it what do you do you apply a force to it or you could pull it with your hand or you could push it and that's a force Springs respond to forces now let's turn the spring vertical so now it's stuck to the ceiling say and we put a weight on it what pulls the spring down it's weight what is weight weight is a force the spring responds due to a force pulling the spring but there are no forces of gravity in general relativity so this spring would have to be stretched or compressed by curved space-time it doesn't make any sense at all you can consider for instance if your result as me or older you'll know that when you go to the grocery shop in those days you used to have a spring balance and he put a bag of spuds on there you say well you owe me 10 bucks because of weighs this much that's a weight did space-time curvature or a force stretch his spring cosmologists don't know the difference between forces and geometry space-time curvature what they can do here's another one that I like they tell us that they're from this equation for a black hole that there's an event horizon at R equals to GM over C squared when you put that in you get the R squared over zero that's a division by zero they tell us that's infinity that's infinity well we all learnt in lower a lower high school that you cannot divide by zero because it's undefined then they go through this singularity down to another one where R is actually zero again they get a division by zero and they tell us that this is the real singularity the other one is a fake one because they can remove it with their imaginations here's what they tell us about this singularity this is from Dodson and Poston tensor geometry once a body of of meta of any mass M lies inside its parts your radius 2m it undergoes gravitational collapse gravitational collapse we'll put a tag on that we come back to it and the singularity becomes physical not a limiting friction so the divide by zero it's not a limiting friction so we're not talking about limits in calculus we're talking about division Z by zero and I say it's a real thing it's physical of course what is the physical thing zero volume infinite density infinite gravity here's Carol honestly this is a large book on modern astrophysics our non rotating black hole has a particularly simple structure at the center is the singularity a point of zero volume and infinite density density where all of the black holes mass is located space-time is infinitely curved at the singularity the black hole singularity is a real physical entity it is not a mathematical artifact so they're telling you yes you can have zero volume for nightmares infinite density infinite gravity and you can divide boy Lloyd twice maizena thorn and wheeler have written a book it's as big as well it used to be as big as its Sydney telephone book it's half the size of a Sydney telephone book now Sydney's ground not because it's a bookcase one says that our equals zero is a physical singularity of space-time so there can be no ambiguity as to what these experts assert it goes on with Hawking these are the singularities again there must be a singularity of infinite density and space-time curvature within the black hole now we come to Roger Penrose a friend of Hawking as our decreases the space-time curvature mounts in proportion to our the -3 becoming theoretically infinite at R equals naught but as I said no finite masses 0 volume infinite density and infinite gravity anywhere this is a fairy story here's another paradox this one has a little bit of mathematics in it but the top here is Einstein's field equations the two terms on the left-hand side constitute his tensor for space-time curvature lamb there is the cosmological constant that they implement and the right-hand side is his energy momentum tensor to describe the material sources of his gravitational field and they say well when R sub u V equals zero we get a sponsored universe now note that to get R sub u V equals zero you set t sub u V equal to zero the other parts disappear because of a mathematical relation which I won't go into so it doesn't look like it but it does because of a tensor or tensorial relation so you get R u v equals naught this is the so-called special universe from which they generate a black hole now the next one are you simply your sub u v equals lambda G little G use sub u v now notice here that this is leads to the sitter's empty universe now why is it empty well precisely because T sub u V equals zero so that means there's no material sources in this universe by this mathematical constraint go back to the previous the same constraint is there t sub u v equals zero and yet they tell us that there is a mass in that universe so now we have by the very same mathematical minute straight matter is both present and absent in a universe well that's a logical contradiction you cannot have matter present by or aimed absent by the very same mathematical constraint as I said this is all inside some Big Bang universe well quite Hawking again this is from his book a brief history of time I saw William Shatner and Teller owner on a video recently he says I tried to read that book he said I couldn't go past a few pages or some words that effect and then he said I can't it's just to me science and science fiction after reading trying to read this stuff science and science fiction are one and the same he's right in current terms okay so at the Big Bang itself the universe is thought to have had sorry to have had zero size and to be infinitely hot let's think about that zero size and infinitely hot first what is temperature well according to chemists such as Linus Pauling who wasn't bad at chemistry and lots of other physicists and such the temperature of some substances what how it's a measure of the kinetic energy of the particles now these particles are moving around in space they also occupy space because they have masses and the more energy they have the faster they move the temperature goes up so how fast must particles be moving to have an infinite temperature second if you've got zero volume where are the particles where they going to live you have no volume so they can't be there and they've got no place to run around in this is one of my favorites I've quoted a number of times but it's so wonderful that I have to do it again this is from Martha Thorne on wheels Lula's telephone book one crucial assumption underlies the standard hot Big Bang model that the universe in a state of rapid expansion from a very nearly homogeneous isotropic condition of infinite than in brackets here or near infinite density and pressure so now they're getting pressure as well as temperature and density of being infinite now I ask you something how close did maizena Thorne and will they get to infinite to know when though in Europe this is a nonsensical statement people read this thing and they think we'll these guys are geniuses how did they do it so I've just little note here infinite hotness infinitely hot nothingness that makes sense infinitely your infinite density and pressure yeah where was the pressured surface you know if you've got pressure what's the definition of pressure force over area well we got zero volume where's the surface but now these geniuses tell us that they have infinite or near infinite pressure in zero volume and of course this is a lead up to well awesome to have some words to say on shortly there was no condensed matter so that so what emitted the blackbody spectrum this is their Cosmic Microwave Background that was a generated by their Big Bang universe within 400 years before was that the tender age of 400 thousand years it's got this radiation where did it come from so that's a lead up to what I'm going to say enough shortly after I discussed he kick off a little thermal emission now this is a very important issue its central to physics and astronomy and it's actually false but they believe it to be true if you take a box and doesn't matter what you make of as long as it's opaque right according to kick-off who was a german scientist in the mid 19th century he said if you take a box you heat it up and you keep the temperature stable there's a radiation field inside well we know that things radiate you get an infrared camera and you look at things and they're radiating so this box radiates and inside because it's hollow there'll be a radiation field he was of the view that if you take any arbitrary opaque material and make a box of it it doesn't matter what shape was size it is or what it's material is as long as it's large and I've said that the fraction is unimportant well diffraction is on a small scale anyhow he says here arbitrary opaque cavities at thermal equilibrium and I put magically because it's magically magically contained the very same radiation field as one made of carbon at the same temperature so miraculously if you make one out of granite or if you made one out of highly polished silver or any other opaque material you doesn't matter yeah it's just as though they were all more made of carbon do you think that that makes sense how does of all of these materials become the same as carbon well they don't and he says that the nature and form of the walls are irrelevant ok so that means it doesn't matter its size or shape but the truth is the materials always influence the emission field here is an example of a blackbody spectrum now I should say that these boxes that Kia cough was talking about he called it blackbody radiation because he used the lying boxes when he did some experiments with soot or lamp black and that's black so this is carbon in carbon has this property so it's called blackbody or normal radiation and when you look at the spectrum from such a material it has this kind of profile it goes up in a hump and it comes down and I've given a few here and you see that with the increasing temperature the peak of the temperature or the peak occurs at a smaller and smaller wavelengths so you heat it up the wavelength will shift in this graph towards the left and for the peak temperature and you see that if you have a graph like this from a spectrum of some material you'll say well I can look at this spectrum and I can find its peak and then I can tell you what the temperature is of the emitter well that's okay provided it's a carbon box but what if it's not a carbon box always a carbon material you might you might get a profile that has this kind of distribution but does it tell you the temperature of the emitter and the answer is no not unless it is a blackbody such as carbon well most materials are not now what is a blackbody I should tell you that theoretically it's ideal it means that all the radiation that falls on it is absorbed immediately and all the radiation then is converted and re-emitted so that it at thermal equilibrium there is no change of temperature because the radiation that comes in gets absorbed and it gets gets reradiating so there's no change of temperature but there's an absorption and emission from the surface of the material that is a blackbody now it's ideal but it's very closely approximated by soot now there's a thing in in in the theory the other boundary is an ideal reflector an idea reflector is one that absorbs nothing everything that goes falls onto the reflector is reflected so it absorbs nothing so it cannot increase its temperature by radiation because it can't absorb any radiation to increase its temperature it reflects at all so if you have now a high an ideal reflector and you have a radiation coming off it it's reflected radiation you look at it you get a Planckian spectrum and you say well I can get a temperature and you take the temperature is that the temperature of the reflector well the answer is no because this radiation didn't come from the reflector he came from the surroundings was reflected off the reflector and does not report the temperature of the reflector the effect that cannot emit because by definition it has no emission capability has absorption of zero because it's a perfect reflector what's a perfect reflector well do they exist no but they are closely approximated by things like highly polished silver it has a reflectivities of not 0.999 one or something like that so it reflects pretty well everything that falls on it this has implications for spectra of all types cosmologists do away with the enclosure they do away with thermal equilibrium and they assume the kick-off law is still true and that they can universally apply Planck's equation now Planck developed an equation to describe these curves and so they apply Planck's equation to a nice picture that they get and I think they can get temperatures so we have now some spectra from some stars because speaker the Sun and in Tyrus and you see here that the temperature is reported by the spectral 23,000 Kelvin for speaker the Sun is the photosphere of the Sun is at 5800 Kelvin and in towers is at 3400 Kelvin but all these stars black bodies well they're not they're not carbon and they don't satisfy the conditions that strictly require the application of Q cops law or in hence Planck's equation so the temperatures that are received from these are what too low the reason why they're too low is because a black body emits the thoth the maximum amount of energy these are not black bodies so they will emit in a profile they will emit energy levels that are lower than what a black body would have done so this temperature that you are signed to it is actually lower than the temperature that it should be so these are apparent temperatures this is important as well for the CMB because it's allegedly a blackbody spectrum at approximately 2.7 to 5 Kelvin here's Planck's equation for its spectral density mu r nu sorry is the frequency and C is the speed of light 300,000 300 million meters per second not the 0 and K is Boltzmann constant H is Planck's constant this is important because Planck introduced the corner of action in this expression and that spawned quantum mechanics so if Planck's equation is not universal in quantum mechanics and astronomy as such assume it is which it isn't then they've got a lot of problems so strictly speaking this applies through a blackbody and opaque solid at thermal equilibrium within an enclosure so if we get rid of the enclosure and such we can approximate some materials such as plates and certain things by this equation but it's not universe so contrary to what physics and astronomy believes so we need to know how does the thermal spectrum produce well the very detail with the fine details of it are not known but what we know is that it's opaque solids produce or opaque solids produces also liquids can produce a thermal spectrum and this is due to their lattice structure so there's a vibration of the atoms or molecules in the lattice structure that produces this so professor Pierre Marie robotoid published in 2003 in the transactions of plasma science in the I Triple E an article about this and here's a quote from it interesting when Planck never sought to bring full physical meaning to his own law by linking it to a specific physical process undertaken by a specific physical species in a specific physical setting in this sense planking and thermal emission remains a unique in finish to this day so I have yet to link the production of a thermal photon in blackbody radiation to a direct physical cause the situation can be corrected if true blackbody emission has views this consequence of the vibration of atomic nuclei within the confines of a lattice structure well here is a profile of the bomber series of the hydrogen atom and you see that it's in line emission just lines it's not this Planckian distribution this is typical of gases so a thermal special requires a lattice and only condensed matter has a lattice liquids and solids are condensed matter but gases are not condensed matter but the hypothetical Big Bang primordial gaseous exotica well how can they emit a thermal suppression this is their cosmic microwave background made up of electrons protons neutrons quark gluon plasmas whatever that is here's an interesting thing about black holes and thermal emission now these Hawking radiation it's supposed to be a blackbody radiation from black holes one way or another and but black holes and lot condensed matter they're not solids and liquids they just have got no volume does oh I mean the singularity has no volume and they have no lattice structure since the singularity has no volume so they don't have any material structure at all and yet this phantasmagorical black hole it has no means to produce a blackbody spectrum but according to Hawking it does so they violate black holes violate the physics of thermal emission well you need something to emit you can't have a mass that doesn't have a volume it doesn't even have a surface and yet it emits wonderful gravitational collapse this is very interesting recently professor Roberto again has addressed it from the point of view of thermodynamics and the truth of matter is we can analyze black holes now without any equations we just go through some laws of thermodynamics because they violate the zeroth first and second laws of thermodynamics by this process of gravitational collapse in so doing they they produce perpetual motion machines of the first and second kind well thermodynamics forbids perpetual motion machines and a free gas can't do work on itself and make itself collapse because if you take a gas and you put it in a container it spreads out and fills a container and if you want to compress it you have to apply force just like you do with a bicycle pump you have to apply a force and the temperature goes up you can feel that when you use the bicycle pump right but you've got to now you take this container of gas and you put it inside another container and open it up the gas squirts out fills the container and then now if we do away with the walls completely what happens to the gas will it apps on itself well it'll continue to spread out that's what gases do so they can't collapse on themselves that would be doing work on yourself and that's forbidden by the laws of thermodynamics but black holes are formed by gravitational collapse of free gases so this is a very important point in thermodynamics there are two basic quantities there's an intensive property and an extensive property and temperature is an intensive property not an extensive property here is a way to see the difference take a brick and we heat the brick up and we get it to a certain temperature we keep it there right now I cut the brick in half the two pieces now have different masses but the temperature hasn't changed has it the temperature stays the same if I cut them again but the masses reduce the temperature stays the same this is the temperature is called an intensive property right the mass is an extensive property because it changes with this process right so you cannot define an intensive property in terms of an extensive property but that's what cosmologists do with a black hole thermodynamics they redefine temperature unwittingly using an extensive property mass to define an intensive property temperature in direct violation of the laws of thermodynamics so the Hawking bekenstein thermodynamics of black holes is nonsense because thermodynamics forbids it now big bang creationism it's creationism I think it's the best of all because the Creator created itself but our coach come back to say a few more things about that but Big Bang creation requires validity of kirchoff's law of thermal emission and universality of Planck's equation now what do we mean by university of Planck's equation because because kick off made all the boxes black ones Planck's equation applies the wall boxes so it doesn't matter what the box is made of they think the equation can reply but it doesn't so Keir god's law is a force and Planck's equation is not universal now I've given here an example of a thing that produces or proves that kickoffs law is forcing that's MRI the clinical existence of MRI which is magnetic resonance imaging proves that Q cos Loras is false because if Q Gauss law is true then all the radiation in the walls of a cavity can go into the radiation field but if that is true then MRI couldn't exist because MRIs is facilitated being the same process if it is a NMR and that means that this spin lattice relaxation lattice is what the structure of the material the spin relates to the protons in the atoms and the of the structure of the material if all the radiation in the wors was permitted to be going to the radiation field you would have no way of having spin relaxation and there produce MRI images you wouldn't have a resonant device because you could not build up a standing wave inside a resonant cavity because all the radiation would be absorbed and then remit it but we have resonant devices everywhere in microwave technologies so all cavities are not like so the clinical existence of MRI is always proven that it's not but the simplest one is not MRI the simplest one is an experiment done done recently by Professor Roberto and it's been online for three days only now I couldn't put it in my slides because I had to prepare beforehand but a simple experiment that you can do in your kitchen with about $1,000 worth of equipment at most not a billion-dollar satellite right well proof that proves to you that cacao is false so if you go to Professor robotize website on YouTube you just look still search on sky scholar two words sky scholar and look for his lecture on his experiment it's called is ku is kickoffs lor true the experiment now since Q kossler is is false the Hall of cosmology is dead why because without it I had no Cosmic Microwave Background and no Big Bang so now it's proven false by a very simple experiment we don't have to use a single tensor equation and get confused about it so that would be something that I recommend to you all to go and have a look at because it affects not just astronomy but a lot of physics condensed matter physics quantum mechanics everything is affected by this because Planck's equation is not universal now I want to look at some conservation laws regarding general relativity now general relativity cannot localize its gravitational energy that means you cannot have gravitational waves with this theory here is how Einstein tries to get conservation of energy and momentum if you take a closed system we know from many many experiments that the total energy momentum of the closed system is conserved this is fundamental in physics now iced I knew that so he had to find a way to make his theory comply with this experimental finding and so what is energy that what is what is the energy of momentum to Einstein it's everything except these gravitational fields that means electromagnetic radiation mass etc all of this is matter and it contributes through the curvature of a spacetime right so he needs now some way and means of accounting for the energy of his gravitational field because in a closed system you'll have the material sources and you'll have the gravitational field we want to take the total energy and momentum of that closed system and then conserve it so he invents a thing well he's got his big T I've put them down the bottom there the total energy in momentum is equal to little T with a superscript and subscript and the big T the big T is his energy momentum tensor for the matter what's the matter everything except his gravitational field so he invents a thing called he's zero tensor the little T to represent the energy momentum of his gravitational field and he adds them together to get the total energy but this is not a tensor equation so we can't deal with it as a tensor so what does he do formally in mathematics if you take a divergence of this expression and get zero you have a conservation law so he can't take a tensor divergence so he takes an ordinary divergence and then he pronounces this thus it results from our field equations of gravitation that the laws of conservation of momentum and energy are satisfied here instead of the energy components of T it's a little displace but Sigma sub Sigma mu the gravitational field we have to introduce the totality of the energy components of matter and gravitational field okay so now he says here we got a divergence of zero first it's not tensorial so that violates these fundamental premise that they must all be tensorial the second thing is this this is complicated expressions but that doesn't you don't need to know it the yeah that's the outcome when we look at the definition of Einstein pseudotensor that's their complicated expression at the top because it's like a tensor he says these quantities to alpha Sigma we call the energy come in components of the gravitational field well what since it's like a tensor it's a certain so we can treat it like a tensor and so we do this thing called contraction in the second line and it produces an invariant now the invariant has the property of being a first thought of intrinsic differential invariant this is what which means that it's made up of the components of the metric tension their first derivatives and none all and nothing else which is the last expression the G's are this metric tensor but in 1900 the pure mathematicians who invented this mathematical apparatus prove that you cannot construct the first order intrinsic differential invariant they don't exist and yet Einstein and his followers managed to calculate the energy of a gravitational wave to model their alleged physical phenomena with a with an entity a mathematical concoction of symbols right that doesn't even have validity in mathematics this is really miraculous so there's only one way to really write Weinstein's fuel equations you know so they can be tensorial and satisfy a conservation law as a formal mathematical expression and you see the total energy and top is that it's the top equation this is how you write them and then the second equation is a tensor divergence and it's zero so we say wait we've got a we've got now a formal conservation law but notice something the top equation is the total energy momentum of a closed system it's always zero there's no other way you can write Einstein's equations to satisfy this but we're in experiments do we find that the energy of momentum of a closed system is always annoyed this is nonsense but this is the only way you can do it so the theory is fundamentally logically inconsistent and mathematically true now I come to the whole object of the thing what like I did we see that you cannot have black holes in Big Bang universes the whole thing is inconsistent so so where do their gravitational waves from they get it from a wave question but the wave equation does not come from black hole equations they talking about black holes generating their waves it doesn't come from Big Bang equations they black holes are inside a big banging universe it doesn't come from Einstein's nonlinear field equations it comes from a linearized form of Einstein's field equations because you can't solve the nonlinear ones so they linearized them by going to indeed and get a wave equation and then they say this wave equation tells us that the waves travel at the speed of light no they don't here's logo's gravitational waves at the speed of light bearing in mind of course that they have two different speeds of light for their black hole escape zero and 300 million meters per second in 1916 this is in the LIGO discovery paper in 1916 the year after the final formulation of the field equations of general relativity Albert Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves he found that the linearized weak field equations had wave solutions transverse waves a spatial strain that travel at the speed of light generated by time variations of the mass quadrupole moment of the source it's a lot of jargon there but it just tells you that they're supposed to be traveling at the speed of light let's look at these linear equations there they are all right the little the new they just they just take the values one minus one minus one sitter and the other ones a little tiny changes in the flight space we don't have to worry too much about it here's the derivation they truncate what's called the Ricci tensor to be able to do the mathematical mumbo-jumbo then if they set the second part to nought and then you end up with a wave equation and it says well this one travels at the speed of light you know what this whole thing is coordinate dependent you can change the coordinates and you can have any speed you like so their claim that they travel at the speed of light Einstein's included is out of nonsense it's a coordinate dependent speed so they don't have such a speed now I come to logos devious methods let's assume multiple black holes inside a Big Bang universe like they do let's assume gravitational waves propagating at the speed of light like they do now we take me equations to manufacture trajectories of multiple black hauling directions and we generate from those equations using our computers 250,000 templates template is there fancy name for a line of best fit right 250,000 and in the sociality gravitational waves of course this is the multiple black holes inside a Big Bang universe that they have no real equations for anyway they just made it up then they generate these 250,000 and put them in a database then why go says I've got a generic noise fellas so the scientists are like I say that's wonderful what we'll do is we'll put any new our computer and we'll try to find from our own equations that we made up a line of best fit to the noise that we just got then they find one it's a line of best fit that doesn't have to be exact you know it could be right off it doesn't matter as long as it's close it's the closest of you 250,000 then they say well that model is for two black holes circling another thing at this speed and that in produces this so that's the physical cause of the wave of the noisy nauman device from an equation that we made up from our own nonsensical equations so we look at the database here it is I couldn't do 250,000 of them so I I don't know how many of there you someone might like to count them anyhow LIGO says that they steal these little one at the bottom that's the line of best fit from the 250,000 database from their own manufacturing lines of best fit here's their devious graphics notice at the top they've got two black holes it's a binary system they're rotating around each other then they coalesce they call it a chirp it makes the noise you know like a like a bird yeah I'll tell you about David right see because I saw him in Queensland he was talking about chirps anyhow you this thing here's a chirp this waveform it makes a noise they generate the noise maybe they got a contract with Marshall for this speaker so I don't know anyhow you again that's that little tiny dot there that noise that they got there they say well you know that matches their line of best fit from out of 250,000 balla base is one so that's the one we'll pick and then they told the world we discovered them well with that kind of computing power and that kind of so many degrees of freedom and the ability to generate whatever you like as a database you can find a line of best fit in like a four whistlers mother there she is and it's a different one you see the eye goes at the bottom whistlers mother's up the top so I want to tell you a little story before I come to my final slide in December last year David writes he went to the University of Queensland at a teacher's conference high school teachers conference and I went up there cuz I'm in Tasmania right don't mention Tasmania I was pleased to hear that anyhow so I go up to see his lecture but before his lecture I went to some of the teachers workshops I just want to see what's going on here and in the state of Queensland it is now mandatory directed by the Department of Education that children as young as twelve must be taught BIGBANG creationism black halls in the hall paraphernalia can you believe it Stephen Hawking might be very happy about that because he's written a series of books for 12 year olds mr. George goes gallivanting with black holes and big bangs depending we depending on which book you pick it's written for 12 year olds he's about three of them at least that I know of but that's what the state of play is in state of Queensland I wouldn't be surprised if it's a same here in the US now anyway but his lecture I listened to his carry-on and I set up right up near the front so I could see the whites of his eyes you know any of course he doesn't know who I am I know who he is because I've seen him on television we've done it he says like this we've done it we found him we've discovered gravitational waves well you know this is how science is done they're scientists and they I've got a new method mass media induced message through this is how they do science did you see the guys with the Higgs boson when they announced that they were jumping up and down hugging one another on international television as though they just scored a winning goal at the World Cup final this is the new way to do science well it might be their way but that's not the real science way anyhow so I discovered that right so you was just doing the same thing that other cosmologists do gallivant around the world and tell people like Brian Cox Larry Krauss Richard Dawkins neil degrasse tyson they travel around the world that lampooning everybody you know anybody who disagrees with their creationism and they tell everybody that your creationism can't be right because ours is the one and only and yours is a false prophet another little story before I go to the last slide if you've got time yes a little bit of the cosmologists are now spending or they led boy Hawking by the way they're spending 100 million dollars of Milnes thoughtless money now min Milner is some Russian billionaire who likes to throw money at cosmologists and string theorists no one who does real science but these kind of guys and he gives them three million bucks a piece you know and if you happen to be Stephen Hawking and you didn't get one you get a special dispensation and you get another three million and to top it all off how does Milner set up his grants everybody who wanted this year sits on the committee to decide who wins it next year well you know what the outcome will be weren't you more string theorists and more cosmologists of course so in hell they travel around the world doing these sorts of things now right seas are doing the same thing he's just going out there he's the he's the salt a solo artist for the LTC what's the LTC that's the liger Tabernacle Choir so he goes around he sings the praises of logo and he wants everybody has spent billions of dollars to build new low goes for them and Liza's so they're in space and they can do more gravitational waves on in black holes of course none of it exists and during that talk he made a remark to the all the teachers in the audience they're listening to him and he says you know Newton's theory of gravity appeared in about 1643 and I looked around the room and it seemed that I was the only one who had a problem with that statement the reason is this Newton is heralded as being the greatest genius of all right but I doubt very much that even he could have written down a theory of gravity when he was aged one that doesn't deter mr. right see and the other cosmologists from making these calculations and with nonsensical forms etc so that's a lead-up oh I have another little story this is really funny there's a there's a web blog a news blog called the conversation it's based in Australia and some Australian scientists put up an article there about these black hole gravitational wave starts with like a you know a son nonsensical I couldn't resist so I went in there and I put in some scientific remarks and Bob will know this because he did it too he told me about it so I went there and made some comments as well so he knows the men I'm talking about well the leader of this group is Professor Matthew Bayliss of Swinburne University of Technology in Australia and he's one of the guys that are spending one hundred million dollars of nillas money I forgot to tell you what they're doing it for they're trying to contact aliens I'm serious they tried to contact islands with this hundred million dollars and an imbalance according to the article is the leader of the Australian contingent and they want to use radio telescopes all around the world including the Parkes radio telescope so he didn't like my response he didn't like walls either but he didn't like mine in particular so he came and made some statement he says I am confident in the general theory of relativity because I've found quasars and observed quasars that's it well you know what I'm sure that a fishmonger would have confidence in the theory of relativity because he found an absurd fish so I have to say this LIGO is a fraud it's a scientific fluid it has absolutely nothing to do with science it's all to do with who knows what money-making mesmerize ation mystery mysticism but it's not science and as I said it's science by using mass media induce mass hysteria so I'll conclude there you can have the probably a well-earned break thank you very much for listening [Applause] [Music] you 
welcome to space news from the electric universe brought to you by the thunderbolts project at Thunderbolts dot info in the previous space news we discussed astronomers recent admission that they now need a whole new theory to explain how planets form today yet another discovery has shattered conventional ideas about planet formation and the so called early solar system scientists studying data from NASA's Dawn spacecraft have learned some astonishing details about the asteroid Vesta the standard model states that the asteroid came into existence at the same time as the solar system however key predictions of this model have been falsified by the dawn data the team was surprised by the absence of the mineral olivine which they expected to find in abundance on the asteroids surface a report on the website Science Daily reads olivine is a main component of planetary mantels and should have been found in large quantities on the surface of Vesta due to a double meteorite impact that according to computer simulations dug the celestial bodies southern Pole to a depth of 80 kilometers catapulting large amounts of material to the surface the absence of the expected olivine has led the scientists to conclude that the asteroids crust must be almost three times thicker than expected the science daily report concludes these discoveries challenge models that describe the formation of Vesta and consequently the formation of the solar system including earth a more complex model of planet formation therefore has to be considered however despite these and countless other recent astonishing discovers institutional sciences fundamental ideas about the solar system's origins remain unshaken in a lost space news we discussed the fact that researchers have finally admitted there is no successful model which can explain the formation of the solar system and now we have only about a week later a report which says asteroid Vesta to reshape theories of planet formation the article actually goes to show just how difficult it is to shake a belief because that's all we have the story of the formation of the solar system is merely a once upon a time story which has become a belief system the article says with its 500 kilometers diameter the asteroid Vesta is one of the largest known planet embryos it came into existence at the same time as the solar system well here we have the assumption the solar system was formed in a single event it also assumes that the solar system was formed from a cloud of dust and gas and these bodies are creted and formed in this case a molten core the molten iron core a crust and a mantle all the kinds of things that you would find on planet Earth the problem is this body is quite small and its composition and now the calculations of how its crust and mantle should appear don't seem to work they don't match one of the major points in the article is that using numerical simulations and data from the space mission dawn they have found that there is a striking absence of a particular mineral olivine on the asteroid surface now it was expected that one spectacular so-called impact crater was excavated to such a depth that anything beneath the crust should have been splattered onto the surface and that particular mineral olivine is missing the authors conclude that the asteroids crust is three times thicker than expected due to the absence of olivine on the asteroid surface here we see the data being forced to fit the discredited planet formation model instead of the model being forced to fit the data in fact the data should be added to the growing list of strikes against planet formation theory together with solar system bodies that should have been shattered by impacts that are believed to have created craters a good fraction of the sizes of those bodies other outstanding examples are the 22 kilometre Martian moon Phobos with a 9 kilometre crater and satins 1060 kilometer moon tethers with a 660 kilometres crater in each instance the craters are neatly circular with no sign of splintering or frag it's as if they were machined into the surface by a cosmic drill in 2011 scientists were astonished to discover a second gigantic crater at Vesta South Pole which they described as a so-called impact basin the principal investigator on NASA's Dawn mission said at the time there is a global dichotomy on Vesta and a fundamental difference between the northern and southern hemispheres the northern hemisphere is older and heavily cratered in contrast to the brighter southern hemisphere where the texture is more smooth and there are lots of sets of grooves there is a massive mountain at the South Pole one of the more surprising aspects is a set of deep equatorial troughs this kind of global dichotomy is also witnessed on the planet Mars where the northern hemisphere has been excavated up to six miles deep as discussed in the feature-length documentary film the Lightning scarred planet Mars this dichotomy falsifies the notion of billion-year processes defining the planetary surfaces in the electric universe theory comets and asteroids are the products of a relatively recent epic of planetary instability when electrical interactions between planets carve two planetary surfaces it should be pointed out that the impact crater on this roughly 500 kilometres wide asteroid is 475 kilometres across that's an incredible width on such a small body what's more it has a central peak which rises 22 kilometres high which is twice the height of Mount Everest the asteroid also sports equatorial troughs that run around the body none of these things are well explained by impacts what's more this huge crater seems to be superimposed on another one slightly smaller this kind of scarring is typical of what you see on planetary surfaces and other moons where you have impacts so-called superimpose one upon the other often with the center of one crater perched on the rim of another and this is the case here on Vesta as well this is symptomatic of electrical arc machining of a surface and even the grooves and sometimes raised ridges which have been seen on other bodies seem to be characteristic of a body that's caught up in an interplanetary electrical discharge it said that the material that was excavated from the asteroid Vesta arrives on earth in the form of a certain kind of meteorite but what if the meteorites and Vesta were all formed in the same catastrophic birth process of this particular body because in the electric universe asteroids comets meteors planets and moons are all born electrically they are not formed by gravitational accretion and therefore the internal structure of this body has nothing to do with the separation of elements from a primordial cloud of dust and gas it has instead the composition of the body from which it was born and that would have been highly differentiated to begin with so the model of the formation of this object is completely wrong and the data they are finding from the Dawn spacecraft supports this this business of the composition of asteroid Vesta also harks back to the discovery from the Stardust mission which found that the minerals being emitted from a comet also have the structure of the minerals from a well differentiated body not from primordial dust and gas in a related news item the European Space Agency's probe Rosetta has acquired new images of what scientists are calling a contact binary comet a recent BBC report says of this image how the comet came to take this form is unknown however plasma scientist CJ ransom replicated this form in the laboratory applying an electrical discharge to a mineral surface a related item just a few days ago is the announcement for that the Rosetta missions target which was a comet is now found to be a double Comet the sensational new images show that what we have is apparently what they call a contact binary that is two objects either attached or in contact with one another as they rotate the article says referring to this comet that how it took this form is unknown but just as the asteroid Vesta and the formation of those colossal so-called impact craters can be explained electrically more simply so too can this particular double Comet it's been found in laboratory experiments that when a discharge strikes a mineral surface it forms small spherules or small beads and quite often those beads are joined together with a very narrow neck so if comets are also formed in a plasma discharge in an electrical discharge to a planetary surface the chances of forming these double headed and maybe multiple headed objects is quite high there is another possibility and that was put forward by Tom Van Flandern and he suggested that based on the orbits of comets and asteroids that they were formed in a single event which he termed an exploding planet without actually explaining how that planet might explode but this fits with the electrical view that these objects are machined from a planet surface electrically in a single event or maybe a series of events and therefore they will have orbits which show a common origin and here we have an object which is also commonly found when an electric discharge strikes a mineral surface we've seen that the notion that planets are formed by accretion of widely dispersed dust and gas just does not work the electric universe model is quite different in fact it has more in common with the biological birth of an object and that is that the electrical nature of all cosmic bodies is such that if they are disturbed or if there's a powerful electric discharge to their surface they may respond by actually ejecting part of their matter into space the reason for this is down to our misunderstanding of gravity if you think about it every atom has almost all of the mass concentrated in the central nucleus the positively charged central nucleus in a gravitational field therefore every atom will be distorted by the nucleus being pulled to one side of the atom in other words towards the center of a planet for instance that means that the atom itself has the charge redistributed so that it forms a tiny electric dipole with the positive pole facing inwards towards the center of the planet and the negative pole facing towards the surface now in large bodies like stars and gas giants and so on pressure ionization will allow some electrons to escape from the atoms and they will tend to drift towards the surface so that all cosmic bodies will have some form of electric charge on them it's a situation known in the trade as an electret something that maintains an electric charge now if you imagine that a powerful electric discharge or even a large body and a gravitational field disturbing another body can cause an instability and that instability can be so great because it's electrical rather than gravitational that the response will be the ejection of matter from one body into space that in turn allows you to see the so-called accretion disks where planets are supposed to be formed according to the standard theory are actually expulsion discs it's just been an assumption that they are accretion discs but we know that stars expel matter our own star our own Sun expels matter regularly into space at great velocity so the very notion that stars and gas giants and so on can expel matter into space it makes perfect sense and it also explains why we find huge gas giant planets orbiting very closely their parent in other stellar systems so when astronomers say that they need an entirely new theory of planet formation they have one here it is the electric universe model for continuous updates on space news from

[Music] In the Big Bang model in the early universe, young galaxies were incredibly active and their centers produce fast plasma jets that stretch for incredible distances. When the jets point towards  Earth, these are called blazars. Within the jets, the plasma  travels at relativistic speed. This, combined with the fact that the beams point towards us, makes the blazars appear much brighter. They are very variable as well and can undergo rapid changes in brightness in short timescales of hours to days. These should be  very common in the early universe. But astronomers have  struggled to find these objects, suggesting that they are not as common as they thought they were. In new research published, astronomers have managed to find a blazar at a very high redshift, which they think makes it a whopping 13 billion years old. This is a mere 800,000 years after the supposed Big Bang event. They were able to image the jets that were moving away from the blazar, using the VLBA, which is a system of 10 radio telescopes. This radio image revealed a broken object, emitting brightly in radio, stretching out about 1,600 light years. When they analyzed the data, they discovered that the plasma was traveling at 75 percent of the speed  of light. In the mainstream model, these powerful jets are powered by supermassive black holes. Material is drawn in towards this and forms what they term as an accretion disk. The exact process whereby the jets are created, is still open to debate. But some speculate that the intense magnetic fields twist in around the poles, and cause material that is falling in to be ejected along these confined magnetic fields. So, why are these blazars predicted to be more common than they are? In the Big Bang model, the early  universe needs to become ionized. This is achieved through star formation and by the jets from these active galactic nuclei. Early galaxies would have to create stars at a rapid rate, in order to achieve this ionization. The center of these galaxies would also be growing at an extraordinary rate. The masses of the detected active galactic nuclei, at these high redshifts, would indeed indicate a fast and efficient growth of these supermassive black holes. The problem is that this challenges the standard formation model of supermassive black holes, and does not seem to be supported by the lack of these high redshift blazars. So, how do they explain this then? They speculate that there could be a mismatch, meaning that the more distant blazars have different properties compared to the more local ones, and this could mean that the jets may be moving slower. This in turn, may be due to a lower angular momentum of the gas in the accretion disk, which in turn, allows the black hole to grow at a more rapid rate, leading to more rapid star formation. So, is there a different way of looking at this? Once more we must consider the question of distance and age. We have discussed many times that the notion that redshift is only related to recessional velocity, and hence distance, is wrong. Redshift can be caused by many additional factors. Halton Arp was an astronomer who spent many years cataloging quasars and galaxies. He published many books on his finds and showed clear evidence of a discrepancy between the measured distance, using the Tully- Fisher measure, and the associated redshift of these galaxies. The Tully-Fisher relationship is a way of relating luminosity of the galaxy with its distance. The further away these galaxies were, the greater the difference between these two measures became. We also see this appear in the quantization of this redshift, which has been interpreted as a great wall of galaxies, which seem to stretch out in a great big sphere, away from us. He also drew a clear relationship between quasars and the host galaxy, and  showed that the redshift of these ejected objects appears to reduce as they got  further from the parent galaxy, and their brightness increased. This means that we should be open to the idea that redshift might indeed tell us something about the age of the object, but in the opposite way. The higher the redshift, the younger the object might be, or the more electrically active it is. As the redshift slowly decreases, so the brightness will increase. The Big Bang postulates that all matter came into existence at a specific point and that the universe itself has expanded from this point onwards. The Electric Universe model, based on plasma cosmology, instead holds that there was no Big Bang and that the universe is not expanding. The universe is filled with plasma that has different types of charges and these tend to separate themselves via double layers, or conform into large filaments, called Birkeland currents. These can carry vast amounts of plasma from one area of high charge, to  another area with a lower charge. Along these filaments, a pinching effect can cause the material to become compressed. These can form highly energetic plasmoids. This pinching will cause more material to be drawn inwards, eventually  forming what we see as a quasar. These plasmoids are characteristic in having a toroidal structure and having two beams of material ejected from the center along the axis. This is confirmed by experiments carried out by Eric Lerner, and the papers written by him on how his laboratory experiments could be scaled up, and may in fact be what mainstream calls black holes or quasars. In this  model, these beams would not be continuous, but would be pulsed. This is  exactly what we are seeing in these images. The periodic ejection of blobs from the quasar are initially in the form of neutrons, which decay into electrons and protons. These electrons get slowed more than the protons in the galactic magnetic field. This means that the strong non-thermal emission across the whole spectrum that they observe for this blazar, is due to this process. This means the young quasar is electron-deficient, so has a low mass and high redshift and a low brightness due to its diffuseness. So why do we not see more high redshift blazars, if they are young newly formed objects? There are a number of aspects to consider. When  we see active jets from galaxies, these tend to be from galaxies with a lower redshift compared to this blazar. Halton Arp considered the majority of galaxies we observe were part of what he termed our local supercluster, of which the Virgo cluster was the most distant part. He thought that there may well be large areas of void in between these large clusters, and it may not be possible to see objects from other parts of the universe. He also speculated that the intrinsic redshift would step with distance and he demonstrated this with our local group and the Virgo cluster. So, is it possible that this blazar has a high redshift compared to local blazars, because it is not from our supercluster? The reason these high redshift blazars may be so rare, is because we can only just see the edge of the next supercluster. Another option to consider is that there may well be a difference between a quasar that was ejected from an active galaxy, and one that formed in the pinch of an intergalactic Birkeland current. Could it be that one formed in the latter, would be far more energetic, and have a much higher redshift, and also be much rarer? There are many questions still to be answered and only by keeping an open mind can we hope to  start unraveling the mysteries of our universe. [Music] 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info The NASA Space Agency is preparing to launch a spacecraft that will approach the sun more closely than any man-made technology in history. NASA's Parker Solar Probe, a robotic spacecraft intended to explore, among other things, the mysteries of the solar wind, and the enduring puzzle of coronal heating, will approach within less than four million miles of the sun's photosphere or what is sometimes referred to as the sun's surface. For decades, within the Electric Universe community, our scientists have proposed a radically alternative model of the Sun based on principles of electrical engineering and plasma physics. Today, retired professor Dr. Donald Scott outlines the opportunities for the NASA mission to test the predictions of the Electric Sun model. NASA has been talking for several years about their Solar Probe. This is a space probe really, that is going to go as close to the Sun as they can get it without melting it. The vehicle is due to be launched about August 11th and the only reason I thought maybe we should talk about a little bit here on Space News is that there are some things that are very good about it and some things that I think are sort of overblown about it. So let me just, sort of, give you a mind-dump from this end as to what I think about it. The mission is scheduled to last about 7 years and it's going to use a slowdown technique of using Venus to slow it down and so on these various orbits around the sun it will approach closer, more closely and more closely. But NASA says it will "fly through the sun's atmosphere." Well now, that right-off-the-bat depends on how you define the extent of the atmosphere because the particles in the so-called solar wind travel out as far as the heliopause and that's about 18 billion kilometers. That's more than three times the distance to Pluto and that's really the sun's atmosphere using one definition. But I don't think they're talking about that. They're talking, I think, about the atmosphere as far out as the Corona. Well, that presents a problem actually because this morning's NASA press release says that the Parker Solar Probe will "Touch the Sun". That's, I think we recognize that as overblown rhetoric and it's designed to impress the public but it doesn't lend confidence to anybody who wants to take their press releases seriously. Be that as it may, the vehicle is going to get closer to the Sun than any other man-made object has ever gotten and the orbit of the probe will be closely restricted to the ecliptic plane. That is to say it'll go around the Sun in, essentially around the sun's equator. So anything that's going on over the sun's poles such as these very important, to me at least, coronal plumes or coronal streamers, these long thin twisting streams of current and magnetic field that extend outward from the sun's North and South poles, those are possible sources of the electrical charge flow that maintains the sun's positive voltage. Well, we aren't going to learn anything about those from the Parker Solar Probe. But anyway, NASA says that the probe will get within a distance, when they really get down to saying it, about 4 million miles from the Sun surface. Now that's about nine solar radii. That is, if you look at a picture of the sun and put an imaginary dot right in the middle of it, the distance from that dot out to the what looks like the surface of the sun is the so-called surface of the photosphere. It's the closest-in surface that is not opaque so that photospheric surface, you can't see through it. So we talk about that as the sun's surface. But that four million miles that the probe will get within is nine solar radii so if you measure from that dot out to the edge of the Sun and then go nine times that distance, that's as far in as this Parker probe is going to get. Well, the farthest out that the corona extends is about five solar radii or so. It varies with the time of the quiet Sun and the active Sun but it gets about five, three to five to six maybe at most out from the surface of the Sun. So my point is, the Parker Solar Probe is not even going to get close to the outermost regions of the corona. So this is a far cry from "Touching the Sun". However, it's a lot closer than we've ever been before. The power density radiation that's coming out of this, out of the photosphere of the Sun, is in the neighborhood of 6,000 watts per square centimeter. So if you put your fingers and make a little square about one centimeter, this is roughly a half an inch by half an inch, and think of 6,000 watts of electrical light coming out of that one square centimeter, that's a lot of power. So, at a distance of 9 solar radii which is where the probe is going to get to, that radiation power ought to be about 74 watts per square centimeter. Maybe you say well, that's not very much, 74 watts per square centimeter. Well yeah, but you realize there are 10,000 square centimeters in a square meter so that means that that solar probe, the heat shield on it, has to either absorb or reflect some 740,000 watts per square meter. That's a lot of energy, a lot of power energy per unit time coming at that thing. So, NASA says they're expecting a temperature of around 2,500 Fahrenheit. Well okay, so I guess the main 'get down to brass tacks', what can the Parker probe measure? We've mentioned some things that it can't measure. Well, one of the things I hope it can measure and I don't know whether they will program it or be interested enough to do it, is there are these things called coronal caps. If you look at a nice picture of the sun when it's at solar eclipse, you can see these, all these triangular things. Some people say they look like dunce caps, other people say they look like wizards' caps with streamers coming out of them, but they're these triangular things and there's so easily, well half a dozen or more usually are around, somewhere around the sun. Why they form, these coronal caps, why do they form? Well, we in the Electric Universe know very well why they form, they're due to the tendency of plasma to form filaments. When plasma leaves the Sun, it doesn't go radially outward, or like if you spread  the fingers of your hand and look at the angles at which your fingers go out. Plasma doesn't go out like that, radially. It goes out and then comes back and joins in together, it forms these triangles, these solar caps. I'm hoping that the Parker probe might be able to get close enough to take some pictures of those solar caps and get the detail of what they look like because those caps may very well be the origins of the Birkeland currents that connect out from the sun to the various planets. We have of course one to Earth there's a gigantic one out to Jupiter, another one to Saturn, to Neptune, to Uranus... And so, if they can ever get pictures of what those, what those condensed plasma streams, what some people call it, the magnetic flux ropes, look like, that would be very nice. This probe is going to carry a wide-field imager. It's called WISPR, W I S P R. That WISPR might get some pictures. I'm praying 'might', of the, first pictures we've seen up close of a Birkeland current stream. Finally, one of the announced goals of mission is to identify the cause of coronal heating. This coronal heating effect is, astronomers were worried about that for decades. Why is the lower corona 2 million degrees whereas the photospheric surface of the sun right below that 2 million is only at 6,000? And so, it's pretty mysterious. It's been that way for decades and they are desperately trying to find out why that occurs. We in the Electric Universe, we know what causes it. It's caused by collisions of electrically accelerated ions coming out of the top of the photospheric tufts and going, slamming into the bottom of the corona. These collisions create turbulence and turbulence is measured as temperature. So this happens right above the surface of the photosphere. That's at one solar radius, not not 9 or 6 or whatever. So the Parker probe will be unable to reveal the cause of coronal heating because it can't get to where the action is, it can't get to where the effect is happening. So keep your eyes peeled for any new hypothetical non-electrical explanations that fall out of this. I hope that they don't do that because they will be imaginary of things if they are. The cause of the coronal heating and the temperature minimum, so-called, of the sun, is way beyond the capability of the probe to see it. The probe is instrumented to be able to measure electric field strengths though and magnetic field strengths. An instrument called SWEAP, S W E A P that stands for Solar Wind Electrons Alpha-particles and Protons. That instrument can measure the velocity density and temperature of those particles. And that would be very interesting to get measurements of those particles and see how closely they fit into the Electric Sun model. I suspect, if they do make those measurements they will probably be surprised and I'll be very happy. There's another instrument called ISOIS and ISOIS will also measure the properties of solar wind particles. NASA's description says this will "... help determine which of several theorized mechanisms causes the particles in the solar wind to accelerate." Now that is not possible if you stop and think about it because if you measure however accurately, the velocity, the density and the temperature of a particle or a bunch of particles, that tells you nothing at all about where they came from. You can take a picture of an automobile flying at high speed down a major highway and so he says, well, why is it going that fast? And so he says, well, it's got a high rpm gasoline engine and the other guy next to it says, no no no it's a high-torque electric motor, it's a Tesla, you know. That's my sort of half humorous attempt or attempt at half humor to say that you can't by taking an instantaneous measurement of a velocity or even an acceleration, determine why this thing has the properties that it does. What got it going so fast. You can't tell.  You can tell it's going fast but there's no way to say this will determine this measurement. Which of several theorized mechanisms caused the particles’ acceleration? Anyway, we're gonna hear about lots of data being collected, lots of these images being taken, what particles were seen in the solar wind. I'm praying that we do not hear that they have observed magnetic reconnection one more time because it's nonsense. I think, eventually they will come to realize this but... But what will be very interesting for any measurements that are mentioned, interesting to us in the Electric Universe are: any actual physical measurements of electric field strengths, current densities, particle velocities and accelerations and also measurements of the filamentation I was talking about. And the reason is because astronomers have long maintained that plasma cannot support an electric field. Well then why did they instrument the Parker Solar Probe with instruments that can measure electric fields? Because they have put out of their mind the possibility that electric fields can exist in plasma. And by golly, there is one thing sure, they're gonna be flying around within a tremendous amount of plasma and trying to measure the electric fields there. I suspect, they will indeed measure electric fields there and I don't know how they're gonna cope with that, how they are going to explain it. I'm confident because in SAFIRE, the SAFIRE laboratory experiment that we have here on Earth, they have measured electric fields of upward of 8,000 volts per meter. And so, if they do measure any electric fields out there, it's gonna be interesting to see how they explain them away. Anyway, every day that the Parker probe survives this wildly hot environment that it's gonna pass through, is a testament to the professional expertise of its designers and the engineers who created it. I feel very strongly that it's going to be a marvelous engineering feat. But the official NASA interpretations of any data it manages to send back must be filtered to exclude fictions such as magnetic reconnection and open-ended magnetic fields and shockwaves in non- collisional plasmas. There's no collisions, how can there be shockwaves? Well, there's a whole bunch of things like that that NASA seems to be fond of dredging up and throwing at the public that we have to be aware of. This new NASA probe has the possibility of making some new, very useful measurements provided that everybody realizes that the actual restrictions inherent in its abilities are what they are. Anyway, we await the reports with bated breath and we are also armed with a rational skepticism of overreaching assumptions that may be proposed as factual causations that are not. 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info In recent years, a profound development has been unfolding in astrophysics, the inevitable acknowledgement of tremendous electric currents at the largest cosmic scales. One of the most stupendous electromagnetic cosmic phenomena is the collimated, light years long, jets produced at active galactic nuclei. Recently, the obvious electrical nature of these jets has been explored in scientific papers published in peer-reviewed journals. One such paper entitled "The jets of active galactic nuclei as giant coaxial cables" summarizes, "...our results have now yielded firm evidence that many ― possibly all ― active galactic nuclei jets have inward currents along their axes and outward currents in a more extended region surrounding the jets.... It also indicates that astrophysical jets are fundamentally electromagnetic structures..." Another paper entitled "Electric Currents along Astrophysical Jets" also argues for cosmic-scale electric currents though also doing so from the framework of gravitational theory. The author states, "Several researchers have reported direct evidence for large-scale electric currents along astrophysical jets. Quite unexpectedly, their directions are not random as would have been the case if the magnetic field were generated by a magnetohydrodynamic dynamo. Instead, in all kiloparsec-scale detections, the inferred electric currents are found to flow away from the galactic nucleus. This unexpected break of symmetry suggests that a battery mechanism is operating around the central black hole." And here we see emphasized the fundamental differences between Standard Astrophysical Theory and Plasma Cosmology and the Electric Universe. Astrophysicists can only imagine colossal gravity, a black hole, producing tremendous magnetism which then produces the stupendous electric currents. In this episode, retired professor of electrical engineering, Donald Scott, offers the Electric Universe interpretation, first addressing a basic problem in cosmology: what is the real source of magnetism in space? We have to realize that magnetic fields are caused by one thing and one thing only. That's the movement of charge, in other words, electric currents. Electric currents create magnetic fields and when magnetic fields collide with conductors, then currents will be induced, that is to say initiated, created in those conductors. You can't have one without the other. But anyway, they've been very reluctant to mention electric currents until very, very recently, when they do, indeed, mention electric currents. So, one was "Electric Currents along Astrophysical Jets" by Ioannis Contopoulos. When I saw this, I went, "Wow, electric currents and jets, that sounds just like Birkeland currents!" Until you begin to read the article, and I do admit they do mention electric currents, so that's, that's two points to remember and that's good. But I think it's the first sentence in the article, "Astrophysical black holes and their surrounding accretion disks are believed to be threaded by grand design helical magnetic fields. There is strong theoretical evidence." Now, I don't know what "strong theoretical evidence" means. There's either strong observational evidence or a well-believed theory but there's no such thing as "strong theoretical evidence." "But the main driver of their winds and jets is the Lorentz force generated by these fields and their associated electric currents." That's good. The Lorentz forces certainly are at play in Birkeland currents. Then they go on and said, "Several researchers have reported direct evidence for large-scale electric currents along astrophysical jets." Good! "Quite unexpectedly, their directions are not random as would have been the case if the magnetic field were generated by a magnetohydrodynamic dynamo." Oh, oh, there we go again, dynamos. If you look up the definition of dynamo in Wikipedia, and I did it just to be sure I was right. The dynamo is an electrical generator that produces direct current. In other words, it's a DC generator. It's a way Edison made DC current in Chicago, I think it was. But that has nothing to do, really, with what's going on in space. I don't think we really have any use for dynamos and what they use this word, almost like a magic Shibboleth that it's a dynamo caused it. Anyway, "Magnetic fields are an important constituent of cosmic plasmas at all astrophysical scales. They are thought to be produced by 'seed' fields generated by random currents that are amplified by dynamo action in planetary and stellar interiors, accretion disks and generally rotating astrophysical plasmas." I mean, other than the fact that they mentioned astrophysical plasma, everything there is wrong or non-existent. There's no such thing as accretion disk, they like to think about. It's well-known that Tony Peratt said that in the Los Alamos laboratory, they would try to simulate an accretion disk and totally failed, miserably. They couldn't do it and if they mixed plasma in with their simulation and allowed for Maxwell's equations to be used as well, then yes, you could get the thing to accrete. But without plasma, without electricity, there's no such thing as a magnetic accretion disk. But anyway, there's another paper which I think is less obviously wrong in many of its points but still has some things to worry about. That one is "The jets of AGMs (active galactic nuclei) as giant coaxial cables." This paper was written by Denise C. Gabuzda and her associate authors Nagle and Roche in the Department of Physics at the University College Cork, Ireland. And the first sentence in that paper is, "Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) release vast amounts of energy, whose ultimate source is a supermassive black hole in the galactic nucleus. In so-called radio-loud AGNs..." Remember that radio-loud, that's important. "Radio loud AGNs, two relativistic jets of plasma emanate from the nucleus, presumably along the rotational axis of the black hole." In other words, they can't let go of black holes and gravity and all this other nonsense, when the evidence is right in front of their face! She says, radio-loud AGNs. What makes loud radio noise? Answer ― double layers. That's been well known for decades since Hannes Alfven won the Nobel Prize in 1970. Let me just conclude by saying, in the end of that paper by Gabuzda, her Figure 2 is almost an identical figure to one that I published in my paper in "Progress In Physics" in 2015. It's a cross section of the Birkeland current. It shows counter-rotating currents and magnetic fields and that's indeed true. So if she gets it that right, why can't she let go of the supermassive black holes? There's no excuse for anyone with any claim to being an investigator of cosmic phenomena as not to know about the seminal prizable work of people like C.E.R. Bruce, Ralph Juergens, Earl Milton, Wal Thornhill, Tony Peratt, Hannes Alfven, Birkeland, and many others. These people have staked out their rightful claims years ago and it's shameful that their work is being ignored as if they never had lived and worked for years to promote these concepts.

[Music] Previously I promised to talk about what the James Webb Telescope may tell us about newborn planets and the subsequent formation of planetary systems. I said and I quote, ”It includes the formation of the solar system and the recent history of the Earth. It's a cosmology that involves us.” End quote. Those who have watched the feature- length videos on the Thunderbolts website, Symbols of an Alien Sky and The Lightning Scarred Planet Mars, may appreciate the extent of the revolution in all the sciences and humanities that are implied by the Electric Universe paradigm. Fred Hoyle in 1950 expressed it well, open quote, “...if there is one important result that comes out of our inquiry into the nature of the universe, it is this: when by patient inquiry we learn the answer to any problem, we always find, both as a whole and in detail, that the answer thus revealed is finer in concept and design than anything we could ever have arrived at by a random guess.” End quote. Thankfully, the 10 billion dollar  James Webb Space Telescope has been successfully launched towards its parking spot, 1.6 million kilometers away.That's about four times the distance to the moon. We are told it will take a month to get there and another five months before its infrared eyes are ready to start scanning the cosmos. In a high-stakes quest to behold light from the first stars and galaxies and to scour the universe for hints of life. The technology is amazing, but the real science that is needed to properly understand the observations is non-existent. Our SAFIRE plasma experiment proved that astrophysicists don't understand stars and their source of radiant energy. The notion of first light is based solely on the Big Bang creation myth which I dealt with in part one of this series. As for gravitational cosmology, Newton's view of gravity has only been shown to work in the solar system and Einstein's warped view of gravity in his non-physical theory of space and time did away with Newton's force of gravity, the force we experience every waking moment. Einstein stopped doing science by elasticizing the fundamental standards of length and time. At the same time quantum theory divorced physical cause from effect, which is fundamental to science. So it is no surprise that recent articles declare an emergency in Big Bang cosmology and often no obvious way out of the dead end. Meanwhile, all other creation myths from around the world have been shown by scholars to have a common origin in a celestial cosmology that is ignored, while featuring identifiable planets battling with strange-looking thunderbolts in a doomsday sky. The creation stories tell of the establishment of the present sky following a period of apocalyptic chaos. Rationally, those stories can have nothing to do with the creation of the universe. On 1 December, 2021 New Scientist published an article titled, ”Is our solar system a cosmic oddity?” Evidence from exoplanets says yes. The author goes on to suggest that the story of the formation of the solar system has started to look like a fairy tale. It is in fact a bedtime story invented to make us feel safe, because  the echoes of those creation events have imprinted an instinctive existential fear in humans which we see manipulated by many unprincipled leaders throughout history. The solar system has a frightful recent history that is essential to grasp before we have any hope of understanding exoplanetary systems, ourselves, or life in the universe. The hopes  and massive investment in the James Webb Space Telescope will not benefit us all without real science to understand the observations. So an introduction is essential, because the events I'm about to describe and explain in the upcoming new year episode, is so different to anything you have heard before. The panorama is both breathtaking  and disturbing. It changes everything. In part two of this series on the discoveries available to the James Webb Space Telescope, I explained the simultaneous electric birth of stars and gas giant planets in molecular clouds. This has now been essentially confirmed by a report this week in phys.org, whereby up to 170 free-floating Jupiter-sized planets have been found 420 light-years away in a star cluster in the Milky Way. This number greatly exceeded expectations. They were only found because they were hot enough to glow in infrared light. It's assumed they were born recently and it is only their natal heat that allows us  to see them. But in an electric galaxy, all free-floating bodies will intercept some electrical energy sufficient to heat them. So, they are not steadily cooling and their age is indeterminate. But this discovery raises serious problems for the standard hypothesis that such bodies formed by gravitational accretion about a bright star and subsequent ejection by planet-to- planet scattering. In the Electric Universe of electric stars, these free-floating Jupiter-sized planets are formed singly or in pairs at the  low end of the brown dwarf star masses. In my previous Space News I wrote and I quote, ”These stars are arguably the most important target for the infrared James Webb Telescope because they are the most numerous and some of the closest stars to us. The telescope should confirm that all brown dwarfs against giant-sized bodies enclosed in a huge red anode glow. To give some idea -- if Jupiter's present invisible plasma sheath will lit up, it would appear in the sky at opposition the size of the Sun. Brown dwarfs are simply small red giants.” In December 1999, I published, “Other stars, other worlds, other life?” on my Holoscience website. There I wrote, Open quote,  “In the last few years a new class of faint stars has been discovered. They are called L-type brown dwarfs, because the element lithium appears in their  spectra. They are the most numerous stellar objects in the galaxy and bridge the gap between stars and Jupiter-sized planets. They are too small to be shining from internal thermonuclear power. A further puzzle is that they radiate blue and ultraviolet light even though they are cool at a temperature of around 950K. Water molecules dominate their spectra. All of these puzzles are simply explained by an electric star.” And I note here, in 2019 it was shown that lithium is produced by low-energy nuclear transmutation in the SAFIRE plasma reactor. I continue. ”There is no lower limit to the size of a body that can accept electric power from the galaxy so the temperatures of smaller dwarfs will range down to levels conducive to life. The light of a red star is due to the distended anode glow of an electrically low-stressed star. The blue and ultraviolet light come from a low energy corona. Since an electric star is heated externally, a planet need not be destroyed by orbiting within its anode glow. In fact, life is not only possible inside the glow of a small brown dwarf, it seems far more likely than a planet orbiting outside a star. This is because the radiant energy arriving on a planet orbiting inside a glowing sphere, is evenly distributed over the entire surface of the planet. There are no seasons, no tropics and no ice  caps. A planet does not have to rotate; its axis can point in any direction; and its orbit can be eccentric. The radiant energy received by the planet will be strongest at the red and blue ends of the spectrum. Photosynthesis relies on red light. The sky’s light would be a pale purple the classical purple dawn of creation. L-type brown dwarfs have a water as a dominant molecule in their spectra, along with many other biologically important molecules and elements. Its children would accumulate atmospheres, and water would mist down. It is therefore of particular interest that most of the extrasolar planets discovered are gas giants, several times the size of Jupiter, orbiting their star extremely closely. It is our system of distantly orbiting planets that seems the odd one out. In fact, it argues in favor of a galactic traffic accident between the Sun and a sub-brown dwarf like Jupiter or Saturn.” End quote. Since I wrote that article, there  have been many developments. For example the Kepler and TESS space telescopes have discovered that hot Jupiters are less common than previously thought. And that so-called super-Earths are the most numerous class of exoplanet. The most important developments in Electric Universe thinking is a more mature understanding of electro-gravity, supported by the general electrodynamic theory of the great experimental scientist of the 19th century Wilhelm Weber,  together with the observations of the modern day Galileo, Dr. Halton Arp. Unlike the Big Bang, unbalanced universe, the Electric Universe is in balance with a dipole of gravitational force which is identical to the magnetic force, but manifests weakly due to the gravitational distortion of the electrical structure within the electron and proton inside the atoms of a celestial body. The gravity of that body is established initially by the powerful long-range electromagnetic convection of matter into the center of the Birkeland current filament in a molecular cloud. Being a dipole electric force, the gravity of a star or planet will change with changes to the surface charge of that body. This provides the essential feedback mechanism required for the ready capture of passing bodies and the rapid stabilization of orbit. Halton Arp provided a fundamental benchmark for real cosmology, when he found that the universe is not expanding. It is balanced and requires a repulsive gravity to explain his extensive observations. The Electric Universe had to meet that observational benchmark and it does so for the simple reason that all celestial bodies will be spherically polarized with the same gravitational pole facing  outwards. They will repel each other. Every ponderable body is subject to  that repulsive force of gravity from all of the other matter in the universe - a manifestation of Mach's principle, which results in gravity appearing to be an attractive force. This attribute is essential to understand our survival of the planetary close encounters recorded by our prehistoric myth makers, and memorialized by cultures around the world. It explains why the first civilizations arose suddenly in a thunderclap following those events. The unexpectedly large number of free-floating Jupiter-sized planets in a single nearby star cluster announced in the phys.org report, has particular significance for our Electric Universe cosmology. In the Electric Universe these objects are not free-floating planets, but are  in fact brown dwarf stars that glow in infrared because they are receiving a low level of electric power from the galactic circuit, sufficient to establish a discharge, manifesting as a red anode sheath. Such objects form a reservoir of brown dwarf stellar systems that could encounter and become integrated into a more powerful star system, like that of our Sun. That there are so many of them goes to explain why such an event is not only plausible, but inevitable. [Music] 
[Music] We orbit around a star as part of the solar system. This star is one of a hundred to four hundred million stars that make up the Milky Way. Our solar system is unique in many ways, and one of those is that it only comprises one star. Most star systems actually consist of two stars called a binary system. Most binary systems can be hard to detect. The easiest way is through visual observations where it is possible to resolve the individual stars themselves. This is most often not possible, so astronomers have to rely on other techniques. One involves looking at changes in the spectra of the starlight, which can show a wobble to the motion of the star, indicating that it is moving about a common center. The third method uses a measurement of the light intensity received by the star. Many stars show a periodic change in their apparent brightness. This could happen for a number of reasons. Some stars undergo changes in their intrinsic luminosity. The other possibility is that it is a binary system where the orbital plane lies edge-on to us so that the stars periodically eclipse one another. These systems are called eclipsing binaries. Sometimes these systems can contain more than two stars. But now NASA has detected a new and bizarre sextuple system, in which all the stars are aligned perfectly, creating a sextuple eclipsing star system. More strange is that the system seems to consist of three pairs of binary stars locked into an exotic dance. It was discovered using NASA's exoplanet hunting Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS for short. TESS is cataloging how the brightness of around 800 million stars change over time. This means that they can identify stars whose brightness dips, which is usually a good sign that a planet might be in orbit around the star. Using this mechanism, they were able to identify a hundred star systems with potentially three or more stars. From this data they were able to identify the rather remarkable sextuple system TYC 7037-89-1. So let's examine the system in a little more detail. They can identify three pairs of star, pair A, B and C. When we examine the masses and the size of the stars in the system, something rather remarkable stands out: each pair of stars consists of one larger star which is brighter and one smaller star which is smaller. It also appears as if the ratio between the larger and smaller star is consistently the same throughout the system. The estimated temperatures of the stars are also consistently the same for both the larger and the smaller star. Pair A orbits each other every 1.3 days, and pair C every 1.6 days. Pair A orbits pair C every four years. Much further out from pair A and C sits pair B. These orbit each other every 8.2 days, and B orbits pair A and C every 2,000 years. This system is a very interesting find and the astronomers offer no clue as to how such a system could form. Although the idea of star capture is possible, the sheer number of binary star systems rules out this possibility as the main cause. Instead, mainstream scientists rely on the idea that some fragmentation of the molecular cloud occurred, causing multiple stars to be formed. The problem here is that this has to occur three times at different locations, but every time in the same ratio split of two to one, and also with the plane exactly aligned to Earth. In the Electric Universe there is a much simpler way of looking at these systems. So let's break this down in a different way. We know that stars form along filaments and that plasma flows along these filaments. As the plasma flows, it will tend to form into filaments. One large flowing mass of plasma will form into a number of smaller filaments. As the currents flow along these filaments, they will generate a magnetic field which will cause the filaments to become attracted to each other. This often results in the formation of twin filaments wrapping around each other. Peratt studied these in detail in his laboratory and has written about them in his book on the Plasma Universe. Of particular interest is a computer simulation he performed which showed that when three filaments start to form, and two are slightly closer to each other, then this attractive force will cause the two closest to wrap around each other and not the other one. This may be an alternative way of explaining why stars form and are often found in pairs. And in this example, we would have the initial formation process whereby three stars formed, two much closer due to the attraction, and one on a much larger orbit compared to the others. When Peratt looked to the interactions of Birkeland currents, he saw that when the filaments pinch, a double layer forms at the same point in each filament. This would also therefore explain why all the stars are in the same plane with their rotation vectors aligned. So how would we explain a sextuple star system then? In the Electric Universe the stars are powered by the movement of this plasma. Stars will form where a filament becomes pinched causing the material to be compressed in a small area. Electric stars attempt to balance their incoming current and electron availability with the output brightness and surface area. Sudden dramatic changes to the incoming current density can cause an overload to the star. The only way to deal with this increase of charge is to create a greater surface area. The simplest way to do this is by splitting the star in two. This immediately increases the surface area greatly. These events are often referred to as electrical stressing events and the splitting process is called the fissioning of the star, meaning it splits into two. We also suspect that stars can become ejected from their birthing filament. This is something that I have previously looked into, if you are interested in more details on this. The basic concept is that the filaments are not stationary. So, while the star forms and is small, it is able to move with this moving filament. But at a certain point it gains enough mass that it can no longer follow the movement and gets kicked out of it. As the stars formed at the same time, it is likely that this process happened at the same time for all three stars. Upon leaving the filament, it is likely that the stars would have undergone a significant electrical stressing event, causing them to fission. This would have resulted in the formation of a close companion to each of the initial three stars. This would not only explain how it is possible to create a sextuple star system, all aligned along the same plane, while they all have pairs of stars where one is about a third the size of the other, and why one of the pairs is so much further out compared to the other two pairs. There is one other possibility to explaining this sextuple star system. It is important to remember that they are not able to resolve the differences between the pairs of stars in each system. So is it possible that what they see as variability in luminosity is not caused by an eclipsing star at all, but instead is caused by the flickering of the star itself? We know that our Sun undergoes a regular change to its output, but this is on the order of years, not days. What we do see is that all three star pairs seem to have a very similar variation in their brightness, which is assumed to be caused by one star passing in front of the other. Is it possible that all three stars are connected somewhere to the same source of electrical power and that the circuit has a similar resonant frequency for all of them? Until we are able to resolve the differences between each pair of stars, it is not possible to know which of these two scenarios is the more likely to have occurred. These types of unusual, almost miraculous star systems, are slowly building a picture of how stars might evolve, not just singly, but as pairs, or in this case up to six stars, and shows that the interaction of the Birkeland currents together is an important aspect that must be considered.

Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info What fills the vast space in the unimaginable distances separating celestial objects in the cosmos? Space is indeed a big place but it's not a perfect void or vacuum. Today this fact is acknowledged even by the NASA space agency which states in an official report from 2014, "Space may appear empty -- a soundless vacuum, but it's not an absolute void. It flows with electric activity that is not visible to our eyes." The movement of electrically charged particles requires a medium and that medium in space is plasma or the so called 4th state of matter. Plasma is commonly referred to as a gas whose constituent atoms have been split into electrons and ions which move independently of each other. Well over 99% of the visible universe is composed of plasma including the Earth's ionosphere, the Sun and All Stars and nearly all of the interplanetary, interstellar and intergalactic medium. Electric currents flowing through plasma can be recognized through their distinct filamentary shape as seen in the familiar novelty plasma ball. With extraordinary advances in space telescopes we see today, in unprecedented detail, filamentary structures that pervade the visible universe at all scales. The appearances of these distinct structures have proved puzzling to astronomers far more often than not as they defy the expected form and behaviors of hot gas in a vacuum. In part two of this 10 part presentation we explore why filamentation throughout the cosmos is just one of 10 reasons why the universe is electric. Filaments in Space Let us begin by considering the examples of filaments that we see locally associated with celestial bodies in our own solar system. The most dramatic displays can surely be seen on our Sun. Of course we see huge plasma filaments, sometimes a million kilometers or longer, that occasionally erupt or explode off of the Sun's surface. But one of countless unresolved problems in solar physics is the observation of giant snake-like filaments reaching from the surface of the Sun to the dark cores of sunspots. For decades, scientists following the standard solar model have viewed the Sun spot penumbra filaments as "convection cells" or columns of hot gases transporting heat from the Sun's interior to its surface. But as physicist Wal Thornhill has observed, the filaments bear no resemblance to any known form of convection in a hot gas. Indeed, in our first ever Space News episode, we reported on the discovery of anomalously weak solar convection by scientists measuring the Sun's internal plasma motions. The Electric Universe theory proposes that the Sun is not powered by an internal thermonuclear reaction but rather it receives its electrical energy from interstellar space in which case the absence of convection is to be expected. The complex magnetic fields associated with the penumbra filaments are acknowledged by solar physicists. As seen in the text of the Astronomy Picture of the Day image seen on your screen, "Here magnetic field lines can be clearly followed outward from the sunspot to distant regions." A clear defiance of the expected behaviors of so-called convection cells. In a 2002 article on his website; Thornhill wrote on the mysterious nature of sunspots, "It is crucially important to understand a sunspot because it is the only place on the Sun that gives a glimpse below the bright photosphere. And what do we see? It is cooler down there by thousands of degrees! That is not expected at all if the Sun is trying to rid itself of heat. The sunspot center should be much hotter and brighter than its surroundings." In the Electric Universe, the penumbral filaments are electrical discharges in plasma in the characteristic form of long thin rope-like structures. If the filaments are "convecting gas" then one would expect the filament centers to be the hottest and brightest points. But instead, solar physicists were amazed to observe that the penumbral filaments have dark cores. In the Electric Universe, the Sun and all stars are positively charged anodes and the Sun's electrical circuitry reaches across vast distances throughout the solar system. The electromagnetic connection of the Sun to planets, including the earth, is now undeniable. In 2007, NASA scientists were amazed to discover dynamic so-called magnetic flux ropes that constantly "form and unravel in Earth's magnetosphere" and, in 2017, scientists with NASA's Cassini mission were astonished to discover that these same "magnetic ropes" connect the Sun and the planet Saturn over the incredible distance of nearly 900 million miles. These so-called magnetic ropes are in fact electrical Birkeland currents which are now known to power Earth's auroras. It's now more clear than ever that planets within the Sun's electrical domain are electrically charged bodies. On our own Earth, this fact is best demonstrated by the relatively recent discovery of powerful lightning that sometimes occurs above thunderstorms, reaching towards space. For decades, airline pilots have reported their observations of the stupendous lightning though it wasn't until the early 1990s that institutional science finally recognized the phenomenon exists. More recently, scientists working with the ESA Swarm mission reported their discovery of "supersonic plasma jets" high up in our atmosphere. A Phys.org report on the discovery stated, "The theory that there are huge electric currents, powered by solar wind and guided through the ionosphere by Earth's magnetic field, was postulated more than a century ago by Norwegian scientist Kristian Birkeland. While much is known about these current systems, recent observations... have revealed that they are associated with large electrical fields." The spectacular filamentary discharges we see in our upper atmosphere may have analogs in other bodies in our solar system that scientists have yet to recognize. The most extreme example may be seen on the Jovian moon Io which astronomers have characterized since 1979 as the most volcanically active body in the solar system. But as we've discussed many times on this series, the theory that the spectacular, so-called, plumes are a form of cryovolcanism has been falsified on numerous counts. Just one of many problems for planetary scientists is outlined on the official Wikipedia page on Tvashtar Paterae region of Io which states that the over 300 kilometer high, so-called, volcanic plume displays "an as yet unexplained filamentary structure". However, this statement is factually incorrect. The filamentary structure was explained decades ago by plasma scientists who recognized that the "plumes" are high-energy electrical discharges. This theory was first proposed by the renowned astrophysicist Thomas Gold in 1979. Then in 1988, plasma scientist Dr. Anthony Peratt and co-author Alex Dessler explained, in a peer-reviewed paper, that the Io plumes are comparable in form to a plasma gun. Similar filamentary plasma discharges are seen on the Saturnian moon Enceladus, though again, planetary scientists can only apply theories of cryovolcanism. But for several years astronomers have recognized the electric current systems connecting Saturn and Jupiter to their respective moons though they still imagine volcanism producing the detected charged particles. The Electric Universe is a connected universe and the braided filamentary structures we see throughout our solar system; jetting from planetary surfaces, on the surface of the Sun and in the plasma structures surrounding comets as seen in this NASA infrared image of comet Holmes, all attest to the electrical circuitry that governs our celestial neighborhood. We turn our attention now outside of our solar system to our galaxy's interstellar medium and the extraordinary role that plasma filaments play in the formation of stars. A key prediction of the Electric Universe theory was outlined in the 2005 monograph, The Electric Universe, by Wal Thornhill and David Talbott. They wrote, "Plasma physicists argue that stars are formed by an electromagnetic 'pinch' effect on widely dispersed gas and dust. The 'pinch' is created by the magnetic force between parallel current filaments that are part of the huge electric currents flowing inside a galaxy." In 2015, this prediction was affirmed by data from the Herschel Space Telescope which imaged, in unprecedented detail, networks of filaments throughout the Milky Way. A Phys.org report on the observations states: "ESA's Herschel Space Observatory has been a true game changer... One of the key aspects that emerged from these observations is the presence of a filamentary network nearly everywhere in our galaxy's interstellar medium. The picture that is emerging is that these structures are closely linked to the formation of stars." The principal investigator of the survey stated, "The greatest surprise was the ubiquity of the filaments in these nearby clouds and their intimate connection with star formation. But there is more: these observations revealed that filaments, which may extend to several light-years in length, appear to have a universal width of about one third of a light year. This suggests that something fundamental is lurking underneath." Of course, the fundamental thing, lurking underneath the stupendous filaments, is electricity. The universal width of the filaments that Herschel observed is not coincidental. On Earth, lightning bolts of constant width are sometimes observed to stretch for miles. Unfortunately, standard astronomy still holds to the pre space-age notion of an electrically sterile universe and thus the researchers attempt to explain the filamentary networks as follows, "Turbulent motions of the interstellar gas and dust create an intricate web of filamentary structures..." However, from the Electric Universe viewpoint it is paramount that the most prominent filaments are seen drawing matter from a network of smaller filaments. Smaller coronal filaments are also characteristic of electric discharges in plasma. Other filamentary structures throughout the Milky Way attest to the spectacular electromagnetic energies that, in fact, organize and drive all galaxies. Near the center of our galaxy is a structure called the Galactic Center Radio Arc, a long-standing source of mystery for astronomers. The long parallel rays that shoot straight out from the galactic plane are described in an Astronomy Picture of the Day as follows, "The radio arc is connected to the Galactic center by strange curving filaments known as the Arches. The bright radio structure at the bottom right likely surrounds a black hole at the Galactic center and is known as Sagittarius A*. One origin hypothesis holds that the Radio Arc and the Arches have their geometry because they contain hot plasma flowing along lines of constant magnetic field. Recent images from the Chandra X-ray Observatory appear to show this plasma colliding with a nearby cloud of cold gas." But plasma cosmology recognizes the dynamic behaviors of electric currents flowing through conductive plasma. What standard astronomy describes as "long parallel rays", plasma physicists recognized as spiralling pairs of magnetic field aligned Birkeland currents. The so called strange curving filaments are Birkeland currents feeding electrical power into the galactic center. In plasma cosmology it is not a black hole but a plasmoid that is responsible for the tremendous concentration of energies and therefore mass at the centers of galaxies. As we look at an even greater scale we see affirmation of the underlying concept of the Electric Universe that "there are no islands in space". Earlier this year, researchers publishing in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society reported the first ever measurement of the "magnetic bridge" linking the Milky Way's two nearest galaxies. Known as the Magellanic bridge, the unimaginably vast filament stretches for approximately 75 thousand light years connecting the large and small Magellanic Clouds. One of the researchers says of the findings, "Not only are entire galaxies magnetic, but the faint delicate threads joining galaxies are magnetic, too. Everywhere we look in the sky, we find magnetism." The lead researcher of the study stated, "In general, we don't know how such vast magnetic fields are generated, nor how these large-scale magnetic fields affect galaxy formation and evolution. Understanding the role that magnetic fields play in the evolution of galaxies and their environment is a fundamental question in astronomy that remains to be answered." But as we explained in the first episode of this series, magnetism in space will always remain mysterious unless and until astronomers recognize the electric currents required to induce and sustain the magnetic fields. In fact, at the galactic scale, some of the world's most distinguished plasma physicists have provided experimental proof that resolves the "mysteries", both of the motions of galaxies and their magnetic fields. Plasma experiments show that rotation is a natural function of interacting electric currents in plasma. A good example is the ubiquitous spiral galaxy, a predictable configuration of a cosmic scale discharge. Computer models of two current filaments, interacting in a plasma, have reproduced fine details of spiral galaxies with no need for the influence of hypothetical dark matter. Consider the comparison of the images on your screen: On the top is a picture of the spiral galaxy M81 as imaged by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. Beneath are snapshots from a computer simulation, by plasma scientist Dr. Anthony Peratt, illustrating the evolution of galactic structures under the influence of electric currents. Through the electromagnetic pinch effect, parallel currents converge to produce spiraling structures. Peratt was a protégé of the Nobel Prize winner, plasma physicist Hannes Alfven, who stated of cosmic electrical activity, "Space is filled with a network of currents which transfer energy and momentum over large or very large distances. The currents often pinch to filamentary or surface currents. The latter are likely to give space, as also interstellar and intergalactic space, a cellular structure." Indeed in the 1920s, it was Irving Langmuir who is credited with having coined the term plasma to describe an ionized gas due to its seemingly lifelike properties reminiscent of blood plasma. The filamentary structures we see throughout the cosmos; in the spectacular threaded networks in nebulae, to the high-energy collimated jets, light-years in length, shooting from so-called Herbig-Haro objects, to the stupendous cometary knots seen in planetary nebulae, to the cosmic web where galaxies, like stars in our Milky Way, line filaments of matter like pearls on a string; all testify to the electromagnetic force exponentially more powerful than gravity, organizing matter at every scale.

[Music] [Music] well it's a pleasure to be here this is my third time in about four years so it's a it's nice to be here take you guys for coming back for the break I'm sure you have a nice lunch and I will try to entertain you with comments so I will talk about reactions that actually occur or that we suspect actually occurred in comments okay all right the actual title that I decided to come up with it's actually bolted driven chemistry and dark cool involve electrochemistry as also it could also indicate maybe some plasma chemistry but in this particular case I'll be talking mostly about gas surface reactions are actually driven by voltage or electric fields all right so this is the unlike my talk I have about 36 37 slides so you can get a sense of where I am any point in a given time and this is where I'd be covering a big talking about charge separation be talking about electric feel such a pressure over here electric fields and how they actually move irons positive negative and I'll talk about dust grains voltage driven chemical reactions that we observe and finally I give a few examples of type of reactions they rewrite order actions that we suspect that might be happening okay all right so let me give you a reminder first why this topic and why is the context of this topic so this is one of the anomalies that we observe with the standard sublimation model that has been in place for the last 50 plus years we actually see that each it's a particular comment actually has its own personality and we know now that you know it has different features because it's composition is different okay the presence of ions and electrons near the nucleus has been shown to be there in a scale that is actually more than will be expected is photo ionization and I'll talk about that I talked about last time and also mentioning again this time there's this situation where we have what appears would be allowed outgassing a lot of boil tiles in the in the coma as a function of heliocentric distance it doesn't quite match so you see that there's something else going on I mentioned last time I mentioned this time as well active Jets in the dark side of the nucleus which are basically not exposed to Sun radiation sorry this is something that I talked before I'm not going to talk at this time but this is a point to keep in mind and the origin our common outburst is still that clear I think some of you actually mentioning and look at it from the electrical perspective as a capacitor and the presence of a large hydrogen gas cloud is something that I talked last about two times so I will not cover it this time right so I'm gonna start here by this work of warcraft where he basically proposed a model that they actually explained the rotation of galaxies and it is model he actually was very enough to actually consider the electrostatic force okay so here is basically a figure in this in this paper and what he concludes is that at the at the end of the day he said you need to have a charge of about ten to thirty first coulombs to actually explain the actual rotation on on the galaxy's that you see on top of gravity of course it says it's gravity but they were top of that you need to have a necessary force this how much colors you need but he goes beyond that he says that positive charge is actually located at the centre and the where you see the negative charge will be there and the periphery so we have a chat separation at this particular case now out I will extend this chat separation observe and apply the property of vitality in the universe okay which applies to different scales and I'm gonna be also brave to say that we will see the size of separation or charge even at the atomic level when we have a nucleus which is positively charged and the negative charge is actually an electric cloud that actually at the periphery or the surrounding of the nucleus so I beginning to see here where your custom is that this there's a fatality here there is a current basically this distribution is similar are different scales and so I again being brave again and I was you know I will say that perhaps this is also and maybe also supported by evidence that this is how in a solar system we also have chat separation and I think we will be talking about it at least in this community for quite some time that this is the kind of observation that we see so I'm going to stay with it and just note that also this you know charge neutrality but it doesn't really mean that for instance you know at the atomic level we have ions possibly negative so you can also have not necessarily in Chechen try it all the time so maybe you can apply in the reverse way maybe at a galactic level you might have galaxy's that would be you know overly negative charge the only positive charge that also happen based on the property of fatality that I'm applying to to these observation now here what I have is a cartoonish way an idealized charge separation that we have be occurring at the solar system so I put the Sun here as positive charge and then the end the periphery or there at the end of hemisphere which is actually a sphere it's not two dimensions I have here will be negative charge these are idealized but most likely what's gonna happen or was happy happening yes Electric electrochemistry is the charge we actually be not quite as idolized and this is being shown recently in the last few years when we talk about dual layers but I'm not doing this time but the charge would be a little bit intermingle so what we really want to look at is at the net charge with a net charge what is the net positive charge where is the net negative charge and I just want to highlight here is that we know for instance that the substructure of you call him I namely feel I like to call the electric fields good it's easy for me to understand the solar system level is not homogeneous it's actually quite complex and I based these comments on the oxidation the comments behave quite differently you can have the same comment on the same you know route and they were actually not follow the same behavior right so that means the idea electric field or the voltage differential being experienced by the comment along his path it's not the same every time so I think Scott dr. Scott mentioned my native flux ropes which me as electric fields and these are the fields are dynamic okay so that's part of the so structure that I see and what I want to highlight is that if we if this model is correct I think I'm mentioning this for the third time it is - correct what we should be able to see is that the net motion okay of positive and negative ions should be such that the positive ions would go from the Sun in a ready form upwards in this form so you see what the positive ions the Hylian plus protons and so on so forth even heavy metals they should actually have a tendency to move to the periphery or the hemisphere because that's what the negative charge is so it would be a natural tendency for the test for this particles to move in that direction now happening between allow happy mitosis now it's not a simple model but a net charge should be in that direction right and when you have positive charges moving in one direction the negative charges would like to follow especially electrons which are faster because the nice heavy they were also intermingle but you can also have of course electrons move along with the positive ions in that's in the same direction as well but the net charge should be the opposite so net charge I should be able to see electrons going or moving towards the Sun I'd like to to see that so this model should say that this is this what's happening it's not clear at this stage we know for instance up the positive ions definitely move rarely from the away from the Sun towards the preferred the hemisphere okay now how will post profile would look like based on the modeled edges survive mention here well this is this is a diagram that I have on the left readily radially constricted circles they specify distance and on the right here what I have here is a graph of voltage versus distance so how will it look like so if I just need to look at the positive across to the Sun or any beyond the surface of the Sun my voltage world would be arbitrarily positive and then as I see the distance I see this as a function of distance my voltage will drop okay so in I drug use by my hand and I think it's properly okay because this voltage drop is a gradual job oh it should be gradual gradual watch it drop and it's going to be is now gonna be beautiful okay it's not going to be nicely exponentially or pulling polynomial it's gonna be up and down and so I expect this this diagram this picture here this cartoon is probably okay and then when we go all the way to the periphery or the hemisphere well it would be we would have a more stable voltage differential now when I look at this voltage differential here then I don't need to have just just because of suppression of charge I don't need to have any motor EMF force or anything to explain the motion or higher electrons let me know I have a voltage differential here and electors will move towards a positive end and ions will move towards the negative end just so they like the chemical concept of motion of ions it's just a start but I cannot really explain it such a separation so I would need the engineers and so on to actually explain why is there such separation on the level of the universe galaxy solar system at some level okay that's something I can explain now let's take a look at the comet so I've been talking about the solar system so this is the Sun flat environment and periphery or the or the end of the hemisphere if I look at the if I take is I think I think of a comet as being a electrode so I go back to at the chemistry and say you know I take the comet as being negative charge electrode okay in a plasma environment it's that is both negative and positive charge depending on location or hillock hence its distance from the Sun then the the profile will look like this so this is the voltage profile over here we have voltage you have distance and in this model I have this the the center the center here is negative charge that would be my comment 67p or any other comment and because this is electrochemical model then I would have a layer of positive ions and they will have a layer or negative ions so the profile basically would look like this okay there would be a voltage drop from the surface to the plasma environment on the comment in this in this case is shown as a radical drop okay doesn't have to be that way but this is how showing is in this diagram and if there would be another gradual voltage drop at the end as we extend far away from the nucleus okay so again this voltage involve there will be electric fields present this is a non zero electric field and that would be enough to provide energy required for ions to move about collide and give rise to chemical reactions all right so that's a DC in the first part basically talk about how such separations give these two electric fields now I'm gonna go and talk about how the electric fields has been shown to provide the energy required for ions to well move about okay so what I'm gonna do here is just give you a few examples of studies that I already been done okay and this particular example here what I have is a graph that shows shows me here spectral density when in fear and here is the frequency of this magnetic field which shows that is between approximately two nano tell sort of probably fallen details I think we're talking about the solar solar system solar flux here and this many fields shows all different kind of oscillations but in this particular case it shows a frequency of falling nearly Hertz which is a little bit different from anything has been described before this corresponds to 67p and it basically shows is that this exactly feel in the order of final amps per meter square okay close to the nucleus another example here I have what is possibly be island flux versus distance from the Sun okay and why shows in this particular study is that what ice assumed to be water ions okay so actually in this particular paper what it shows is that you know based on the technique use is able to detect the ions you know the velocity that they come in is actually the speed as well direction but they don't really know what kind of our it is so they refer to another study that says okay around around the nucleus of Comet 67p we have a large number of ions that appear to be water based on spectroscopic data so based on these into relationship which is I think it's okay is fair academically it's fair but it doesn't really mean that is what it is out there okay but it's possible so I'm not gonna say it's not what it is but I just gonna give you a reminder that how the conclusion were came about okay it could be something else it could be all the boiler towels it's a la puerta 67p there are also there so the important thing is that these these islands do have velocity okay and what do the kinetic energy come from especially since in the backyard space we're talking about very low temperatures okay so genetically speaking well they need to have energies coming from somewhere and so it's directed fields that provide the energy the energy in is given here there are two types we can see here the cold water irons 10 to 15 electron volts and hot is a very water ions 120 to 5,000 like the most this is tremendous amount of energy in tennis I mean at least at least for the chemical perspective that we're talking about here just to give you a background or context if I want to ionize hydrogen you know atomic hydrogen atom I just only need thirteen point one with the two point two electron volts maybe a little bit more safe 14 electron volts so you were talking about a very large amount of energy okay in my opinion this is good enough already to actually strip our electrons from the surface of the nucleus provided the electric field is being experienced on the surface of the on the nucleus of course right now why was discovery here this is very interesting is that when you look at the distance this part here when we go from three point six to two astronomical units distance or the comet 67p from the from the Sun okay the was called the water island flux so in in in the terminology that's being used on the model it's always outgassing because it's always the gases coming out from the nucleus which is not clear it's verified definitely not clear anymore okay it's increases right so the number one x increases but as a function of solar flux okay it is in the case there is not a linear relationship the expectation could be is that you increase the solar flux you'll be able to see more sublimation and therefore you're gonna have a great amount of bottles well it's definitely not linear and in my opinion there's all the factors involved in here okay and I'll mention that in other slides I was I think it's happening here so here's another example of again electron electron in this case these lectures na+ ions that have been detected in the coma they also been detected near the nucleus and these electrons also are was called super thermal for hyper thermal which means that they have a low kinetic energy we're talking about hundreds a few thousands electron volts of energy of this electron so all this is being all these energies being supplied by electric fields this is a very all actually slide I think I used it last time and just to highlight here that at a time we're talking about maybe a hundred you know a flux of a hundred per volume how do we elected fair value but this number has changed now maybe 2,000 to 10,000 per per volume okay and I just want to highlight look at this potential here is a hundred volts potential different observers in t of the nucleus of 60p it's a large this is very this is a lot I mean I don't know from a chemical perspective is Allah energy it's a long energy all right and so again in the previous slide we use an electron sensor and I'm for it in ion sensor to detect directly I really like that we actually sensing these ions and in this case we representing our work that actually uses UPA mission spectroscopy is a different technique and I I really like the fact that you have different techniques collaborating the same it's a phenomena this is something that we do here on planet earth frequently it's very difficult to do this in space because of limitations or instruments in because of just massive scale distance but with with the Rosetta probe we able to see different instruments collaborate similar phenomena and but it's not beautiful data should be that way data is not beautiful issues NASA sometimes I sing example for instance where you have different techniques do can the same phenomena and the numbers of the kymaro is totally different it's all different off by 20% okay but that's that's fine that's how it should be okay we need to have more population sampling before you actually reach conclusions more solidly right now I think is we're gonna week end now this is a different work and you can actually see their citations over here and I want to highlight I want you I want you to bring out these this highlight here in yellow okay because 67p it was determined not to be a very active comment okay but when you were a distance or about 3.6 Salonika units okay this comment already show okay a lot of activity illegal activity a lot okay and this goes again against the idea that everything occurs because of sublimation souffle mentioned usually thought not to be acted after three it's a sonica units but here we're talking about 3.6 okay so it's way beyond the suit emission level but you still did we see a lot of like our islands and and being active around the nucleus so something else is happening and what I really suspect is happening is that this is actually electrical activity I think I mentioned back 2013 what I really did not know that much about comments but I suspected that I said that if we really want to differentiate between sublimation in electrical activity we need to go far away from the Sun but sublimation is not in fact we need to remove that variable and I think this is a particularly simple way that there has been mostly removed and we see still see a lot activity and I think this is a very important work they just came out this year what we have here is example I should work as an example of a limb let me prove so we actually showing you is IV characteristics both of you don't know where it is I mean this I've this is current and here will be voltage okay so this is a V current voltage curve and in this particular example why was done is the setup row of actually two probes extending out a particular distance for each other and a voltage was applied between these two probes in reference to the to the reseller instrument and then the current was measured between the two probes okay it's go a long way approach some of you might be familiar with it and we see here as a function of his sacred distance basically how far away the copy was from the Sun and also as a way as a function of commit committed distance how far was the actual Rosetta probe from the comet so in this particular example we here we only see a few nano amps of current okay especially our positive bias what we see is that this corresponds to the solar wind because we actually seven thousand goes away from the actual comment so the solar wind has shows currents in an under a branch okay if we move a little bit closer in terms of discipline Sun in much much closer to the azure comment we see that this current actually increases from five to all the way to 20 plus nano amps if we again move a little bit closer to point seven five seven s Omega units and still close still within you know the coma of 67p we're seeing it to a much larger increase about a hundred nano amps and we're very close to perihelion window we are far away you know relatively speaking to 35 and 28 kilometers we see current about 15 micro amps so we see why large increment of current do all this means is that you have a lot of electrons and a lot of positive ions or in this case I guess only we are measure on the electrons but you could have to have both in the vicinity of the nucleus okay today's there is plenty of energy for these elections there's plenty of ions elections in the vicinity this is obvious is gonna lead to collisions okay and before I go to talk about chemical collisions let me also mention the fact that I've been talking about positive ions and I'd be also talking about electrons but there also was this nanograins called clusters the actually present so a 67p we have here we have green energy the electron volts and here we have sized and I just want I'm going to concentrate on two types you can see these columns over here this one for instance about 50 nano nano meters and you can actually see that we have this much energy so we're talking about 10 to the fourth electron volts so 10,000 maybe just a lot of energy involved I wish you know involved with these clusters so if we go a little smaller size about fine and on the meters we see that we're talking about a few hundred it looks on both energy so nanoclusters I also present now like I mentioned to you they range from five hundred to ten thousand of them before fitting the upper 750 nanometers and from one to two hundred four finally meters okay now in in this work they have to settle within a particular distance I don't recall exactly baby was between he was not far from from the nucleus and he please oriented the probe towards the nucleus and they begin to measure both positive and negative ions and what they realize is that the current find the Quint detecting the positive ions they only detect the negative ions so to be right indicates basically argued that is just an instrumental error which it could be by way indicates to me is that I give me an indication of ways the soft structure or the electric fields around the vicinity of 67p you need to be careful with orientation okay if you take thinking about the nuclear which is negative charge I would suspect the negative charge our electrodes would be actually moving away readily from the nucleus of 67p so if such a make sense to me that you will read them you expect them to to sense them but the positive ion the net charge the net motion of them should be in the early direction and that's what we see a lot of protons in protons heavy metal ions Killian you know alpha particles they're all moving towards the nucleus and actually they could lie on the surface and they create a lot of sputtering right so so orientation is important and again is this corroborates the fact or maybe the fact the occupation that the electrons come out of the nucleus and the positive ions should be moving towards the nucleus now I'm gonna move a little bit to Lovejoy because I don't have it off daily with 67p and what I want to highlight here is the most of these clusters which actually show allows creation behavior okay this is also certain people the analysis of what this creation behavior what this particles are it's not clear most of these are actually see is iron is in metal ions metal ions we low ionization potential okay the easy to remove electrons from and because you have you have you have this voltage friend is applied voltage around the vicinity might be I think it's dynamic you have you will see these minerals being removed as you know from the surface basically lectures are being stripped out and then you have these left out of it you're just basically destroyed the structure the lattice structure of the minerals electrons going one direction you have the positive ions going in the other direction and what is very interesting is that because of the size of these clusters we can attribute that to solar pressure because they're large it's definitely but they actually motion they actually been accelerated towards solar wind speeds so they go from a few electron balls or a few below a few I say a few miles per second velocities to about 300 to 320 50 minutes I think the meters per second scuse me meter per second which is the solar wind speed so they're being celebrated by electric fields right the fields are present now and again I used that as evidence of the electric strip in a model that I present the last time and to me that model actually explains why we see a lot of lectures which are due to due to to this model and not to photo in this session because their meaning that many works that have been talked about there indicates that there's more electrons that should be allowed by photo intersections well we have electro stripping here behavior and this has been observed with the odd on all the comments as well all right so let me move to something more interesting as voltage driven chemical reactions so I set up the table so I show you for instance that we have strands separation we have electric fields which oppressive which are accelerating electrons and positive charge so what do they do well I mean what happens when you have all this together well what you're gonna happen is you can have collisions so let me let me briefly tell you show you our model of a car coalition is that you can have well you're gonna have either gas gas collisions or you're gonna have gas surface collisions and that's what we see so I want to talk about gas surface collisions and now I'm not gonna talk about gas gas gas gas collisions will occur in the coma okay but the gas surface collisions will come also in the coma but in dust grains and on the surface of the comet I think that's more interesting so in this particular model what we see is that the rate constant which is associated it's associated with a reaction cross section what I mean by rational cross section I don't know if you guys can see here but here we have a cylinder which explains this particle which is in motion and what we will do is the moves in this direction provided that you have all the particles in the Byzantine well did we react there would be a reaction so this is what we call the cross section this is the cross sectional area okay in the kinetic the kinetic we basically talked about the speed or reaction is being controlled by this cross section now for the reactions to occur for all for a bomb to form okay you need to have the right energy you also have the right orientation but I guess I want to highlight is in this in this in this slide here is that the kinetics also follow is called the Maxwell Boltzmann distribution which as shown in this graphic over here where I have the number of particles as a function of kinetic energy and only the particles which are this end here had enough kinetic energy for them to collide which will lead to potentially a chemical bond okay it didn't have enough energy mister nothing's gonna happen it just bounced off okay and you can see there is a function of temperature if you increase the temperature you also increase the amount of particles available for collision okay and there is a barrier which we call the activation energy okay so the this is based on temperature okay show you here is like I said the kinetics are based on temperature this is Katie it refers to K is the Boltzmann constant and T is temperature in kelvins so you can see here you also hear here so it is connected okay now what do you biggest I'll say challenges for chemists okay after chemist husband is I've been the fact that we use you see Allah chemicals on our talents and our reactions occur not only in commerce but also in space and they cannot really explain it because the temperature is not high enough alright just not high enough so if you only talk about you only look about the temperature model okay and what mean by temperature is only given by say solar radiation you know that UV light my photos will be enough energy or I cannot think anything else in space that can actually provide energy so if you find way from stars questions well you don't have a source of energy so temperature is wrong but you see chemical reactions so what's happening here okay and this is what I want to mention to you guys that you need to have the right angle if you had the right angle this no reaction well there's a problem here okay but okay but this can be solved because I just show you that we have a lot of super thermal electrons so the energy of required for collisions to occur is actually be giving out or provided or granted I see well call it by the electric fields okay which is due to stress separation so electric fields give the kinetic energy necessary food for ions in elections to react and they accelerate obviously both positive and negative particles we also have surfaces okay in comments silicates metallic organic surfaces that are allowed there which provide or can catalyze these reactions okay and this is not temperature dependent definitely that temperature dependence so forget about temperature forget about the fact that you in a in a cold area of space because have four actions I suppose you have energy fields okay so we still apply coalition theory because the particles have kinetic energy but is given by electric fields not solar radiation okay so this this allows us to do chemistry and not to worry about temperature I think that's a very powerful situation and I'm gonna end up my talk by talking about a one particular type of reaction the early rate right of the reaction this is a gas surface reaction I will talk about two cases and I just just to remind you that we have particles those particles in the in the comma c 7p all different sizes so the reactions can occur definite can occur over there I say also current surface all right so conditions necessary for for this particular reaction which we talked about the formation of deuterium deuterium is a compound basically water it's called but it just have one of the hydrogen actually has a neutron so it's a behavior we have again for the previous work we have water ions okay ice elevated between 120 to 800 electron volts and we also have what's called coal oil between 10 and 50 electron volts so these are available potentially a reservoir higher audio Tyrian this is not collaborated this is just a supposition okay I really it's not really clear that the minerals on comet 67p are reaching to turn okay but this work was done in the lab okay but we do have know for instance this on the theory which in solid organic matter is being shown to be available in comments but not see to 7p but you only need you need to have these requirements which potential available in common cmp to show that that squeezed because come see design p has a ratio corresponding to this is a deuterium to hydrogen ratio 5.3 plus or minus 0.7 10 to the minus 4 okay this is extracted from deuterium how to call this outgassing versus water outgassing but you also say due to information versus white information because it's not clear if these two species actually are gassing or being formed in situ so you take water you take the Tyrian and you get a comparison if you want to look at it in terms of something that makes more sense we talked about liters per second or being a being formed deuterium about 12 liters per second versus 17 point seven thousand seventeen percent thousand liters per second water that's being formed per second okay these numbers are being instructed on based on spectroscopic data now in this particular model and then we bore you here little bit with chemistry here but it's actually simple we have a surface which is reaching the Tyrian you can see the duty right here okay so that represents this grain that I talked to you about and if you have water ions put the rice with the correct energy then it will form a complex shown over here okay and these complex which is the intermediate species then separates into a deal Tirion iron and another pageant nearly charged iron here okay now this is something I already mentioned now this can happen okay so it shouldn't happen in the lab it should happen in a lab okay and this is the the graph or the image to prevent the graph we have excess energy this is how much energy is being bounced off from the from the nucleus and here what I have is the incident energy of the incoming ion so let me see what it is you have a surface which is made up Latin which has been those with the Tyrians they have a surface we allow deuterium in here I have a gun that projects water islands I'm heating the surface what irons also stop happening all the different boiled tiles go to a mass spectrometer so I know what they are and so here is a graph that shows different species the form okay all the other species of form and the one that we're actually looking at what the interested in would be the one in red which is so where we here so all the species you feel actually formed in the lab ok and so you make the assumption that okay if the conditions are giving in the lab if you look at the comment the comment also has similar condition it can happen doesn't mean they're happening it can happen all right but I like this approach even though I you see that is a limitation here but I like it because because is lab work they can be repeated okay it can be repeated now I'm almost at the end here on my talk this is another example this is for molecular oxygen it follows a similar idea you have a surface here but this surface now is reaching oxygen now that we know right we know silicates we have hydroxy groups on a surface we are also disallow oxides so that we know is correct for this event P for allowing on the comments and so we have incoming water iron again interacts okay with the surface its tracts the oxygen okay eventually you get a subsequent reaction that gives you molecular oxygen okay this is a little more difficult for me to understand okay but it can happen all right and again what I really like about this is that the conditions are there incoming citizen P is happening in the lab okay we know that the water the the water cations have enough energy they did because did you know given by the electric field so this can't happen right this can definitely happen and here's the evidence shown again this is the energy of the incoming particles they're being detected by mass spectrometer here is a the amount of energy would you put in the park of hitting the surface again the surf in this case is planning we oxygen so as you can see in the lab this is idealized this is not how I was expecting it is happening in space but this is idolized but it's a good start okay this is a good start and we actually see molecular oxygen which is in black actually being formed okay you can see there's a linear connection between a the amount energy that the incoming ion will have and the energy that we it will come out okay so it's a very interesting situation but there are limitations for this model okay so I just show you okay you know you can have reactions in there the collisions are there but there's something that is there is contradicting here so this is this is a piece paragraph from the author's book actually see here for instance he says the whining ions in the extended commissariat towards the nucleus here we know that okay in the cross it's actually dehydrated so where the water molecules coming from so I really don't understand that part okay because okay I mean we are you know we are trying to figure out what's happening but I think it's best to start explaining where the water is coming from first okay and then once you understand what the water is coming from okay you can say yeah we have plenty of them and then we can actually you know say that they are actually hitting the surface or hitting the surface of the nucleus or here the surface of the different dust grains and these reactions are occurring so there are limitations to this model I would suspect that the water molecules for this to be explained and they can do it in the many labs like actually do this and I hope that they can go forward and do it I do not have the to do it myself I don't have high vacuum equipment to do it and I'm gonna end up by give you an illustration or not only the model but she's scientific limitations okay so there's this work done on comment on Lovejoy this using infrared spectroscopy okay and look and let me show you this so here's Lovejoy okay he is preparing helium and prepare helium that the experiment was done using radio waves okay post perihelion the experiment phosphor helium was done using infrared spectroscopy two very different techniques okay and so I mean you know it's difficult for me to look at this data because I have here production rates for deuterium tertiary for water and they are looking at the ratio over here and this is how much it is versus the vienna standard mean ocean water basically if you look at the ocean on earth this is the ratio they used you will see between deuterium to water point in iron okay now if we look at infrared data I see different portion rates but let me have a concentrate only on the vienna standard mean ocean water to do Tyrael to water ratio very different so point a 91.9 for the authors went on and talked about this you know they tell us whole publication about this now these guys are actually very honest and they explain that how can we do this I mean this is this is one technique to me these apples and these oranges if you want to do a comparison paper a helium possibly Helio we need to we need to fill the gaps over here we don't and the authenticity was happening when we allowed data that we see for either astronomy cosmology for you there's not enough at least from my perspective as a training so the legal chemist so I'm training I'm looking at data and I need to have differing instruments looking at the same thing they agree okay now I'm I'm satisfied but I don't see that much happening in these fields besides the Rosetta and when I look at Rosetta I mean I read that maybe like 50 papers they all concentrate on the own little field small little feel and so I think that's the that's the biggest problem that we see is that we and this one for shown in cosmology we just don't have enough there's not enough data out there for us to begin to see the bigger picture and so just to show you okay look at the spread or the th water ratio when you look at cichlid of all the different reports this how it looks like okay it's quite they say to be isn't complete we need we need more data we need more simple population to actually come up with a conclusion so to finish up take-home take-home points here like to feel the pressing that we seen to commence a Steven P these are used to provide kinetic energy for irons any lectures and I could give you an example of gas surface reaction and the previous talk I talked about actually plasma reactions the corona discharge which again can be occur because you have electric fields and I'm just going to end out here saying the crew meteorology instrumentation is lacking it's nice efficient we don't have enough well I thank you for your attention this all I have to say today [Applause] [Music] you 
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info 21st century astrophysicists hold to an astounding belief that purely gravitational phenomena are the cause of unfathomably powerful electromagnetic energies and emissions in deep space. Consensus scientific theory maintains that mechanical and kinetic processes, collisions, explosions, gravitational collapse and heating produce mysterious magnetism which causes the measured electrical effects. From the extraordinarily densely packed neutrons, which are thought to compose magnetized spinning neutron stars which produce pulsing radio and X-ray emissions or supermassive stars going supernova collapsing into black holes and producing extraordinary gamma-ray bursts or the nearly infinite compression of matter that is thought to constitute a black hole, these theoretical phenomena have been exhaustively codified through mathematical modeling and supercomputer simulations and imposing sums of taxpayer money have been spent on the most sophisticated technologies resulting in tweaks to the models rather than testing alternatives. What experimentalists observe in nature and the laboratory is of secondary importance in gravito-centric cosmology whose symbol of genius remains the mathematician. No clearer example of this can be seen than in the standard astrophysical interpretation of the largest scale lightning observed in the universe. As we will see, lightning is indeed the only valid interpretation of the spectacular phenomena. In our recent installment of our series, The Top 10 Reasons the Universe is Electric, we discussed the "mysterious nature of cosmic jets". From the light-years long filamentary jets of so-called Herbig-Haro objects to extra-galactic radio jets that stretch for hundreds of thousands of light-years and even beyond, what mechanism is capable of producing these high energy jets across such spectacular distances and what confines the jets and prevents the material from dispersing in the "vacuum of space"? Astrophysicists have never successfully explained the phenomena and a new scientific report only underscores the desperate need for new theoretical pathways. On October 16th, 2017, the website phys.org reported on the cosmic jet of a quasar that stretches for an incredible 300,000 light years. The report begins by misrepresenting a popular theory as an unassailable fact. It states, "Quasars are galaxies with massive black holes at their cores." From this one belief it seems inevitable that only confusion can follow. The report describes scientists' ongoing struggle to explain the X-ray emissions of the collimated bipolar jets from quasars as follows, "Even after more than two decades of study, however, there is still no clear conclusion as to the physical mechanism actually responsible for the X-ray emission." On the jets' electrical nature, a vital clue is found in the report's following statement, "Both the magnetic field strength and the particle velocities are (remarkably) quite constant all along the length of this jet..." Of course, both the constancy of the jets' particle velocities and magnetic field strength are the undeniable hallmarks of lightning. However, since astronomers hold to the unbending belief that electricity causes nothing in space including unfathomably powerful electrical discharges, the confusion only deepens with ever finer technological data. A perfect example can be seen in a 2015 NASA Hubble report which describes a so-called shock collision of mysterious knots inside a "black hole jet". A Hubble time-lapse video shows the knots in the jet which form like "pearls on a string". The report begins, "When you're blasting through space at more than 98% of the speed of light, you may need driver's insurance. Astronomers have discovered for the first time a rear-end collision between two high-speed knots of ejected matter." The report continues, "Such extragalactic jets are not well understood. They appear to transport energetic plasma in a confined beam from the active nucleus of the host galaxy. The new analysis suggests that shocks produced by collisions within the jet further accelerate particles and brighten the regions of colliding material." Of course, the collimated and knotty form of the jets are the well-documented signatures of electrical discharges in plasma. As we will see as we continue, it is not a coincidence that both stars and galaxies form like pearls on a string and the plasma filaments connecting galaxies are now a subject of growing scientific investigation. In the Electric Universe it is not a supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy but a doughnut-shaped object called a plasmoid which unlike a black hole has a proven physical reality. In plasma laboratories on Earth, a plasmoid is an ultra-high density energy storage phenomenon. Electric currents flow equatorially inward to the plasmoid where energy is stored electromagnetically. The Electric Universe model proposes simply that so much concentrated energy is stored in the galactic plasmoid that it may be the compact source whose mass is attributed to a hypothetical black hole. As the plasmoid's charge density increases along the axis of the "doughnut", it creates the well-known plasma feature called a double layer which can explode or release energy axially in the form of cosmic jets and other spectacular emissions. The scalability of plasma phenomena is of course paramount in cosmic investigations. The Nobel Prize winner and father of plasma cosmology Hannes Alfvén proposed that plasma phenomena can be scaled to an incredible 28 orders of magnitude. In fact, in 1986 Alfvén spoke at a NASA sponsored conference on the astrophysical role of double layers. He stated, "Double layers in space should be classified as a new type of celestial object (one example is the double radio sources). It is tentatively suggested that X-ray and gamma-ray bursts may be due to exploding double layers." In the aforementioned NASA report, the authors proposed that heating and mysterious magnetism are responsible for the jets' velocities and collimation. They state, "One theory is that material falling onto the central object is superheated and ejected along the object's spin axis. Powerful magnetic fields constrain the material into a narrow jet." But of course, super heating alone does not explain the origins and extraordinary velocities of the jets; and why the magnetic field should exist at all to confine the jets remains completely unexplained in standard theory. As we've outlined in many recent episodes, cosmic scale magnetic fields were, until very recently, considered to be "not important" in standard astrophysics. So it's not surprising that countless scientific reports in the last decade feature expressions of surprise and perplexity from astronomers who are detecting magnetism everywhere throughout the cosmos. The perplexity must continue until astronomers integrate a simple law of physics: electric currents produce magnetic fields. Today we are seeing the inevitable confirmation of the electrical nature of cosmic jets. As we've reported previously, in 2011 a team of scientists measured the electric current in the jet shooting from the galaxy 3C303. They estimated the strength of the current at 10¹⁸ (10 to the 18th power) amps or the equivalent of a trillion bolts of lightning. Of course, the team still holds to the theory that a supermassive black hole ultimately produces the spectacular electric current. But, as we've also recently reported, at an even greater cosmic scale it has become undeniable that the electrical cosmic jets have nothing to do with black holes. In 2016 a Royal Astronomical Society press release reported the discovery that "...supermassive black holes in a region of the distant universe are all spinning out radio jets in the same direction..." A lead investigator, professor Romeel Dave said of the findings, "This is not obviously expected based on our current understanding of cosmology. It's a bizarre finding." The problem for proponents of black hole theory is that, at these incredible cosmic distances, no mechanism exists to affect the directionality of the jets. Unfortunately, rather than pausing to question the very existence of the hypothetical black holes, which have never been observed by anyone, the researchers proposed the ad-hoc theory that the spin alignment of the galaxies must have somehow occurred in the early universe causing the black holes to spin in the same direction. But in the Electric Universe, such cosmic alignments are in fact predicted and required if the dominant organizational force is electromagnetism. Space, across the vastest cosmic distances, has a substructure of twisted-pair current filaments with stars and galaxies forming along them like pearls on a string and having their spin axes aligned along their filament. Science discovery continues to confirm this prediction. In 2015, scientists using the Herschel Space Observatory reported the detection in unprecedented detail of filamentary structures throughout the Milky Way galaxy. A phys.org report states of the finding, "...One of the key aspects that emerged from these observations is the presence of a filamentary network nearly everywhere in our Galaxy's interstellar medium. The picture that is emerging is that these structures are closely linked to the formation of stars." The principal investigator of the survey stated, "The greatest surprise was the ubiquity of filaments in these nearby clouds and their intimate connection with star formation." The picture of proto stars forming due to gravitational collapse in molecular clouds is now falsified by direct observation. Instead, stars as well as galaxies form like pearls on a string which we must find if the electromagnetic z-pinch effect is responsible for star formation. The tell-tale signature of the electric currents that confine the star forming filaments was also detected in the aforementioned study. The principal investigator said of the finding, "These observations revealed that filaments, which may extend to several light-years in length, appear to have a universal width of about one third of a light year. This suggests that something fundamental is lurking underneath." As previously stated, the universal width of filaments, which is completely unexpected in standard reasoning, is not coincidental. On Earth, constant width is observed in the most powerful natural electrical discharge phenomenon - lightning - In fact, for many mysterious astrophysical phenomena it is lightning that works as the most promising natural analog. We then ask the question: if Occam's razor were actually applied in astrophysical circles, would consensus theory remain that gravity is the most likely, that is to say, simplest explanation for the undeniable stupendous electric currents in space? On our own Earth, the phenomena we experience in nature and the laboratory may surely help demystify the ongoing mysteries in our electric universe.

Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project at thunderbolts dot info. The following presentation is an adaptation of the Stephen Smith Picture Of the Day article, "Plasmoids are the Power". The link to the article may be found in the description box of this video. What causes energetic emissions from galactic cores? According to a recent press release, there is a so-called "supermassive black hole" at the center of the Milky Way that is tearing stars apart and flinging the remains into space at speeds of 10,000 kilometers per second. The shredded stars then coalesce into planet-sized objects with masses that can exceed 2×10^37 kilograms, or as much as ten Jupiters. It is not from observational data that the concept is derived. It is from computer models designed to simulate someone's idea about what might be going on with the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A (should such a thing exist). Eden Girma, an undergraduate student at Harvard University wrote: "A single shredded star can form hundreds of these planets-mass objects. We wondered; where do they end up? How close do they come to us? We developed a computer code to answer those questions." There are thought to be thousands of "free- floating" planets wandering through space. Why? It is because of how stars and planets theoretically form. Protoplanetary disks, as consensus understanding sees them, are prone to collisions among their evolving clumps of matter until they settle down into stable arrangements. Some of those clumps condense into gas giants or rocky bodies, while others are destroyed. However, astronomers believe that many of these new planets are subsequently expelled from their systems. The literature suggests that free-floating planets might exceed the number associated with stars. The ultimate answer, though, is that they do not know. As the announcement from Harvard University states: "those newly minted planets are probably different from those that evolved 'naturally'". The researchers borrow a term from Carl Sagan, and state that they are made of "star-stuff", so their ingredients will not be the same because different parts of exploded stars will form different planetary objects. The question is, how to tell them apart? There are significant problems with both ideas, protoplanetary evolution, as well as black holes, in general. Black holes cannot be seen by the most powerful telescopes and radiation sensors, but astrophysicists continue to maintain that they exist because of their effects. They assume that matter is accelerated and compressed until it is "spaghettified" or stretched inside the so-called "event horizon" until it is torn apart and reconfigured into more "rogue planets". Since almost all (more than 95%) of galaxies are said to be home to one or more black holes, they might all be shooting "spitballs" at us from vast distances. Since matter spins around a black hole at extreme velocities, consensus opinions state that it heats up from friction, generating X-rays and ultraviolet light. It is those emissions that are interpreted as indirect evidence for black holes. Previous Pictures of the Day take issue with both aspects of this new computer model. The terminology, itself, is highly speculative and ambiguous. Protoplanetary discs and gravitational tides, for example, are invoked in order to explain how stars are destroyed and remade. To say that X-rays and ultraviolet light in space are created in gravity fields is to betray an ignorance. Experiments in the laboratory create those energies by accelerating charged particles in an electric field. There is no experiment that can provide evidence for matter collapse to "near infinite density". Rather, Bennett pinches (or z-pinches) in plasma- state material form plasmoids that then become stars. When the electric flux inside double layers within galactic circuits gets too high, there is a sudden "short circuit" that draws energy from the surrounding space. That energy could be concentrated from hundreds of cubic light-years and then discharged in a burst of cosmic lightning, generating X-rays or flares of ultraviolet light. X-ray radiation from a plasmoid in the Milky Way's heart is the same as from stars undergoing strong electrical stresses. A plasmoid is a charged particle accelerator, so electrons spiral in the electromagnetic field and give off X-rays. The diffuse currents then flow toward the galaxy's equatorial plane and spiral back toward the core. In an Electric Universe, electromagnetism is more than able to create celestial phenomena, without the supernatural physics of supermassive black holes. Plasma discharge events are commonly known to generate high energy light. The greater the electric charge flow, the higher the frequency of light will be emitted. Supply enough power and even gamma rays are released. For continuous updates on Space News from the Electric Universe, stay tuned to Thunderbolts.info 
Welcome to Space News  from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts. info Welcome to Space News. This is Andy Hall, and over the course of the past year I've been presenting a multi-part series called Eye of the Storm. Eye of the Storm presents a case study for how electrical forces shaped the Colorado Plateau and its surroundings. In this tenth and final chapter, there are a few things to conclude and review in  summary. What we've done in these chapters is reverse engineer the Earth, starting  with outside layers and peeling inward, following the patterns of electrical scarring. We logically assumed circuitry is the fundamental structure of the planet since that is the very structure of life, energy and the cosmos in general. Abstract theories for cause and effect aren't needed, when the patterns of nature are laid bare for us to see, repeating at every scale and every structure in the universe. We merely need to recognize what makes the patterns. In the case of geology, it's not just gravity, the mist of time or coincidence, it's the diffusion of charge in an environment of extreme electrical stress. Meaning, in the case of the Colorado Plateau, a huge potential difference between the Earth and something else. Charge diffusion means there is a circuit. Whether an element of charge finds a bond in atomic structure, or drifts in patterns formed by fields, it has  to move. And that motion is subject to a myriad of emergent influences; but it is always patterned in the most fundamental way by the coherent influence of electrical circuitry. Whether a chemical reaction or a thermodynamic cycle, dissect it down to the quantum level. And it's all electromagnetic circuitry and as a result we can look at the planets and stars in the solar system and see the same effects at play over and over. If a planet has dead circuits, like Mercury or the moon, facing a high potential, it responds to static charge buildup on its surface with explosive discharges that leave it pockmarked with craters and rilles. The evidence is overwhelming, as  anyone who reads Thunderbolts knows. Then there are planets that used to be alive and are now dead, like Mars or those in the process of birth or death, like Venus. And  there's a bunch of debris from planet formation and electrical interactions orbiting the Sun. But if a planet is alive, with an atmospheric crust enveloped in a self-amplifying magnetosphere, and sustained resonant feedback with the solar system, it must have energy flowing through that crust and atmosphere, storing inside it, making it a spherical capacitor. Weather and geology is driven by this capacitance. That is pure logic and physics, once it's recognized that Earth and the solar system are circuits. Correlations can be drawn because circuitry acts the same regardless of what planet it's on, depending on type. Hence, we can see Jupiter's storms being motivated by circuitry and correlate actions of turbulent wind with geologic patterns on Earth, and  draw conclusions about the common cause. We don't have to theorize, we just apply known science. Mountain structures, shaped by sonic shock waves, provide the biggest evidence of all the Electric Earth theories presented in the Eye of the Storm. If tetrahedrons and other features produced by shockwaves in a wind tunnel, precisely match what we see in geology, and if there is no other demonstrable process that can produce the same features, that is astonishing evidence that supersonic plasma winds built mountains. If supersonic plasma winds are acknowledged, then the planet's voltage rise and other circumstances required to create them have to be acknowledged as well. And that brings all the other electrical processes described in Eye of the Storm into play, because they are inevitable consequences of charge diffusion under those circumstances. Consensus science has decided tetrahedrons result from a combination of faulting, uplift, water erosion, and huge spans of time. They have no empirical proof; they have no proof whatsoever that water erosion can produce repeating harmonic and nearly perfect geometric forms, like these shown here, and many  others presented in earlier chapters. Water erosion simply cannot be that consistent. And the earth scientists merely have an unverified hypothesis they represent as fact confirmed by consensus. And they ignore the patterns. Ignoring the obvious is scientific malpractice. These forms are without doubt from sonic  shockwaves. Tetrahedrons are formed in the separation bubble of a reflected shock wave. it's a region where a tetrahedral zone of low pressure forms. This low-pressure zone attracts neutral and ionized dust, like a vacuum cleaner equipped with an electrostatic precipitator. The separation bubble is electrically and pressure-polarized from the incoming plasma winds, causing static electric attraction of ionic  dust. There are also magnetic fields to attract ferrous materials in identifiable bands and sheets that conform to the shock patterns. On an  Electric Earth, the means and mechanisms are all there to form mountains. Wind, water, dust and electrical bonding. Wind, water, earth and fire. Mountain features match shock wave forms in excruciating detail, far beyond the unambiguous tetrahedral shape of the saturation bubble. There are harmonic frequencies, unstable waveforms, subsurface reflections, constructive and destructive interference patterns, and expansion fans found in geology. Not once or twice, coincidentally, but over and over and over again. All are empirical proofs, because the same features have been produced in supersonic wind tunnels for decades. That said,  exploring mountains and researching the Electric Earth, is like an Easter egg hunt, with surprising evidence around every bend. Sometimes the evidence is so cool, so unexpected and so hidden in plain sight, that it knocks even my socks off. So in this final chapter of Eye of the Storm, I'd like to share my three favorite easter eggs. This is a photo of the Dragoon  Mountains in Southern Arizona. Historically, the Dragoons are famous for Cochise Stronghold, a maze of rocky defiles where Chiricahua Apache raiding parties eluded capture from United States soldiers during the Apache wars. The Chiricahua chief Cochise was a recognized genius at guerrilla warfare, and he used the Southern Arizona terrain strategically to stage raids and then vanish. He's supposedly buried somewhere in those rocks above the Stronghold. If you  look at these ragged pinnacles and sheets of rock, stacked together like triangular dominoes, you might be tempted to agree with geologists and say, ’Gee, it must  have taken millions of years’. But I can show you it happened pretty  quickly. The evidence is in this monolithic granite tetrahedron. The  tetrahedron has a drip on it. A drip, meaning the tetrahedron was deposited as a viscous mass, like candle wax, or hot fudge. The drips are highlighted in the next image. Directly above the drips are pillow-like rocks, capping the crown of the tetrahedron. The  pillow rock, above the drip at far left, is broken. It's not a volcanic lava flow. These rocks are granite and must bake under pressure deep underground for immense time, according to science. These fluid forms have been exposed to atmosphere since they were made, because you can't have free flow under tons of overburden pressure. It's not that it's unusual to see fluid shapes in granite boulders. Granite rocks show fluid puddling, settling in drop configurations all the time, even drips. But they are always  broken and hard to discern with a photo. But this one, this one is huge and so obvious. At the base of this drip there's fluting, where the falling, sheet-flow of fluid solidified in motion, like the mineral deposits from sheet flow on cavern walls. Below the end  of the drip are splatters and drops that fell free and landed on the rock face  below. A boulder with a runny nose makes no sense in consensus geology. So they  ignore such a thing or insist it's not fair. But it is. It is one minor confirmation of Electric Earth theory. It also presents loads of information about how it happened in the environment on Earth at the time. The elongated pillow rocks are at the tip of the tetrahedron and therefore they constitute some of the last matter deposited into this separation bubble. This matter was deposited in a fluid state and it cooled into a crystalline matrix of granite from the outside in. Like candle wax, it formed a skin that retained heat inside it, keeping the inside molten for longer. They are also at the top of the tetrahedron and stayed hot longest, because they had the massive rock below them radiating through. It likely took years for this rock mass to cool down. The pillows hang over the leeward side of the tetrahedron, so the wind was from behind, pushing them over the edge, elongating their shape like water balloons. The  separations between rock is where shockwaves charged with current, evaporated material away, or prevented it from depositing, leaving gaps. Shock waves in this environment were not only from the winds shearing and deflecting, but also explosive lightning strikes and reverberating thunder. They tend to electromagnetically align parallel and orthogonal, since the winds themselves were aligned with electric fields and the shock waves carried current. The rock shrank as it cooled, creating  the pillow shapes. The largest pillow drop burst, leaving a broken pillow and its content spilled out in a stringy drip. In fact, the top of the broken pillow displays lightning scars that likely caused the pillow to break and drip its viscous guts before it completely solidified. Other pillars squeezed out their fluid like toothpaste. I show this example because it illustrates the kind of confusing geologic detail Electric Earth theory can explain with ease, proving it's not really confusing at all. It just takes breaking through the matrix of false paradigm and looking with fresh eyes. It also gives a sense for the way matter was flying through the atmosphere. There was a fire hose of hot silicon in the plasma wind that formed the Dragoon mountains. It formed like Jell-O in a mold as ions recombined in the suction of separation bubbles. To be clear, this mountain building event occurred in Earth's primordial paths near the end of a period when the continents were forming. There are mountains chockfull of fossilized dinosaurs and sea life and strata of this age. But no evidence of man. There were severe plasma storms in human history, but not filled with a fire hose of molten silica. Ancient people did experience coronal storms due to some planetary conflict in the solar system. Ancient myth is pretty clear about that. They must have been less powerful however, than what's been described here, yet still carried much more punch than they do today. And this next  Easter egg tells that [Music] story. [Music] 
welcome to space news from the electric universe brought to you by the thunderbolts project at Thunderbolts dot info today we continue our report on the first scientific papers on the Rosetta mission to comet 67p as noted in the previous episode comet scientists and the science media continue to hold to the traditional story of comets one basis for the scientists purported confidence is the discovery of evidence for water production and cometary comas however the electric comet Theory offers an alternative explanation that may better fit the available evidence let us briefly look back to July in August of 2014 when the Rosetta team reported the first of many unexpected discoveries the average surface temperature of the comet was about minus 90 degrees Fahrenheit a surprising relatively warm reading as noted on the Paris observatories website these temperature measurements have been compared to temperatures of a theoretical model of a comet consisting mainly of water ice the temperature measured on comet 67p ECG turns out to be 20 to 30 Kelvin higher than the temperature expected for an icy body in August the team was also surprised to learn that the comet whose surface revealed no water ice appeared to be producing a relatively large amount of water in its coma while still a vast distance from the Sun they were then surprised to learn that the most energetic Jets originated at the Comets neck which is frequently in shadow and is the coldest region on the nucleus which means it should be the least active region if solar warming is the cause of the Jets in October scientists at the University of Bern reported still another surprise the comet was producing an amazing abundance of rich molecules much too far from the Sun to explain as sublimation from solar heating neither these discoveries nor the desiccated appearance of 67p s rocky terrain remain mysterious if the Comets production of water molecules is an electrochemical process as the electric comet Theory has always maintained we know that in recent years several scientific papers have provided evidence for the production of water in minerals due to interaction with the solar wind while Thornhill explains why the findings of the Rosetta mission have only strengthened the case for the electoral chemical production of a comet's water it's reported that both atomic hydrogen and oxygen have been detected close to the nucleus and vary with time probably stemming from electron impact dissociation of venting water vapour but this is evidence in support of an important prediction of the electric comet model the cathode discharge from the comet energetically strips atoms from surface minerals in fact we can expect anomalous abundances of neutral atoms and negative ions close to the comet nucleus compared to the more complex molecules like water and carbon dioxide that are supposed to be driving the Jets also the dust to guest ratio is higher than generally accepted for comets this too fits with the idea that the dust is being electrically sputtered from the surface and doesn't need to be exclusively driven off by gas less than 1% of the 67p nucleus surface is needed to explain the water gas production rates if water ice were located on the surface however no ice rich patches are observed indicating a generally dehydrated nature for the surface currently illuminated by the Sun this is supported by a more recent report in nature that comet dust grains collected by Rosetta shattered on a target plate showing that they contained no water ice so it suggested that the de surface dust grains have been drying out since the last perihelion passage and when the Comets activity increases in coming months that surface layer will be blown away and the dust is expected to become more ice rich I don't think so the Comets activity is an electrical discharge phenomenon that will become increasingly evident as the comet speeds up towards the Sun the gas concentrations don't always vary as the sunlight falling on the comet changes this is taken in ad hoc fashion as evidence that they may be due to heterogeneous concentrations of different Isis however cathode sputtering of charged particles from the comet's surface doesn't rely on sunlight and gives rise to complex electrochemistry that varies with the minerals at the focus of the arc and being a fragment of a planet surface we should expect heterogeneity of these minerals it doesn't require more ad hoc additions to theory of early transport of comet s holes in the solar system and incredible collisions without fragmentation comet 67p doesn't look like a body formed by collisions the microwave instrument on the Rosetta orbiter Miro acquired maps of the sub surface temperature of Comet 67p and spectra of water vapour to researchers surprise the highest water densities are often observed above shadowed neck regions where the nucleus surface and subsurface temperatures are low on the other hand low water densities are measured above some illuminated regions on the body and on the head supporting the electric discharge model much better than solar heating discordant measures of deuterium to hydrogen ratios and isotopic abundances of solar system bodies denied the story of the formation of the earth and its anomalous abundance of water it's further evidence against the four and a half billion year long myth of earth's history instead it supports a blended solar family are very different planets each with their own unique history in our electric universe the rosetta mission has not begun to explore our origins finally it's important to understand the origin of modern comet theory it's centuries-old in the general history of nature and the theory of the heavens 17:55 Immanuel Kant laid out the nebula hypothesis in which he deduced that the solar system formed from a large cloud of gas a nebula he thus attempted to explain the order of the solar system seen previously by Newton as being in opposed from the beginning by God this is the unscientific dogma behind our story of comets the big bang story is also a fanciful rehash of Genesis as Arthur Koestler wrote the cosmology of a given age is not the result of a uni linear scientific development but rather the most striking imaginative symbol of its mentality the projection of its conflict prejudices and specific ways of doublethink on to the graceful sky in stark contrast the electric universe is founded empirically on forensic investigations into mankind's entire eyewitness history of comets which shows finally that the archetype of all comets was gigantic planet size and identified globally as the planet Venus it was the celestial fire-breathing doomsday dragon with the planetary ball in its clutches this worldwide evidence destroys it a stroke the nebula and Newtonian four-and-a-half billion year old clockwork story of the solar system it shows that comets can be any size and are essentially planetary matter and according to the ancient myth or histories these errant planets hurled Thunderbolts of the Gods to avoid collisions their cometary glow discharge faded as they settled into peaceful orbits Venus's dark current cometary tail still stretches to tickle the earth at inferior conjunction and Venus now has the most circular orbit of any planet in the solar system born in a cosmic Thunderbolt during a recent chaotic episode between the planets Comet 67p my only television and the electrical sculpting of that berth the odd shape sharp features and cratering are hallmarks of such an origin hopefully comet 67p will be the rosetta stone that opens up the real history of the solar system for continuous updates on space news from the electric universe stay tuned

The Electric Universe -- A Study in Contrasts -- Contrasting viewpoints are the fuel for progress in all human inquiry 'Vive la différence' A gravity-driven structure? Crab Nebula Or electric discharge? Crab Nebula A contrast can highlight predictive ability when alternative explanations are at stake. "When astronomers detected intense radiation pumping out of the Crab Nebula, one of the most studied objects in space, at higher energies than anyone thought possible, they were nothing short of stunned." What difference does it make whether a planetary nebula is a cloud of neutral gas or a cloud of electrically active plasma? We see the signature of electric currents in the structure of luminous threads or filaments. In the vacuum of space, coherent filaments are not even conceivable without energetic electrical and magnetic activity. A plasma is defined by the presence of freely moving charged particles. Electric currents can transport huge amounts of energy over virtually unlimited distances, just as in the power grid, where the lights of cities are far away from the power plants. In space plasma, this energy of electric currents can suddenly appear as glowing streamers and even erupt in intense outburst, all depending on the electrical conditions. Many filamentary nebulae are remarkably similar to energies of dense lightning both in storm clouds and in volcanic eruptions. That's not a coincidence. Filamentation is commonplace in laboratory experiments with electric discharge. It's often stated as fact that a galactic jet is powered by a black hole but jets from galactic cores were explained electrically by the father of plasma science, Nobel laureate Hannes Alfvén, decades ago. Does it make a difference whether a black hole or an electric discharge drives the jet? Well yes it does, because our entire understanding of what keeps the universe going arises from questions such as this and others posed here. Each year, scientific exploration take us deeper into the electrical nature of events across the cosmos. Please join us as new insights into the Electric Universe unfold at Thunderbolts.info   
Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info A new scientific study has proposed a new hypothesis for a longstanding mystery in atmospheric science. For many years scientists have wondered why the concentration of electrons in Earth's atmosphere suddenly drops in a region dozens of miles above the Earth, which some call the 'D-region ledge'. According to a recent Space.com report, an investigative team is now hypothesizing that tiny meteor dust particles higher in the atmosphere might be responsible for "sucking up" the so-called missing electrons. One of the study authors says of the electron deficiency, "It's the most dramatic gradiant anywhere in the ionosphere. It really is very conspicuous, so it's begging for an explanation". To place this mystery into a larger context, we reached out to Dr. Michael Clarage, one of the lead researchers of the SAFIRE Project. The SAFIRE Project is an independent team of researchers building a unique plasma discharge chamber to study a wide variety of electrical phenomena. We asked Dr. Clarage for his thoughts on the electrical conditions in Earth's environment, and a comment on his role on the SAFIRE Team. [Dr. Michael] My job on the SAFIRE Team is to connect astronomical phenomena to experiments we can do in the SAFIRE chamber. Making the connection between something at a planetary scale and something happening in the lab is always challenging. And, we are by no means the first to be doing such experiments. Since Birkeland's original work in the late 1800's there have been maybe twenty chambers, I know about, built specifically to study the Earth's electrical environment. To call out just two: In 1974, Dubinin, at the Institute of Space Research in Moscow, put a magnetized sphere in a vacuum chamber, and shot high-energy electrons at it. The spatial pattern of electrons precipitating onto the sphere mimicked electron flows around the Earth, into our own magnetosphere. That was really a breakthrough experiment. In 2012, researchers at the Russian Academy of Sciences also put a dipole magnetized sphere into a chamber, and blew a wind of plasma past the sphere, and were able to measure electrical potential differences across the poles of this sphere that are similar to electrical structures known to exist around the Earth where we know that the part of the Earth experiencing sunrise is at a higher electrical potential than the parts of the Earth experiencing sunset. Now, that was a very impressive experiment and really shows that laboratory experiments can be very relevant to exploring what might be happening electrically around planets and stars. The SAFIRE chamber is considerably more flexible than these other two chambers I mentioned. We are hoping to be able to explore a much wider range of not only planetary phenomena, but also stellar phenomenon. The mandate of the SAFIRE Team is quite broad: to explore electrical phenomena at stellar and planetary scales, but as to any particular theories about the electrical nature of planets or stars, we are quite agnostic. As Monty Childs has sometimes said, "we don't have a horse in the race". We think that it's important because once a research group gets too locked in to trying to prove a certain theory, or a specific scientific model, then they usually end up ignoring data that does not fit their model. We are going in there with as few preconceptions as possible. We want the data to lead us to the model, not the other way around. [Host, Michael] As one moves away from the ground on Earth, the atmosphere gets more rarefied and more energized. At around 50 kilometers above the ground, the atmosphere begins to take on plasma properties with electrons and ions coexisting in a highly conductive medium. Some well-known fluctuations in electron density including the so-called 'missing electrons' described as the 'D-region ledge' are not easily explained using the standard models of the atmosphere. We asked Dr. Clarage for his thoughts on the recent Space.com article which describes this mystery. [Dr. Michael] The first thing I think of when reading this article is how far we still have to go in terms of describing the large-scale electrical structures of planets. It is still difficult for many astronomers and geophysicists to conceive that an entire planet might have a charge relative to other planets or the space around it. Even though we know from direct measurement, on our own Earth that the sky overhead has a persistent positive charge relative to the ground we stand on, and that's around the entire Earth. So, that is, the entire sky is charged relative to the entire surface of the Earth, and that's called the 'fair-weather potential'. I've been following research into this for years, and most geophysicist are trying to describe this assuming the Earth is in electrical isolation from the rest of the Solar System. So, the explanations use only lightning, and winds, and heat - that is, only events happening locally on Earth. But, both the fair-weather potential, and what the Space.com article called 'The Case of the Missing Electrons', can also be seen as ordinary plasma structures. I don't mean to minimize the complexity of the systems - we are talking about very complex systems here - I only mean to say, it's worth considering that all planets are immersed in a larger electrical environment. These charge separations of the fair-weather potential, and the persistent electron density fluctuations in the ionosphere, are examples of plasma structures that have been known by laboratory plasmas physicists for decades. And, these structures arise when one part of your system is at a different electrical potential than its surroundings. Let me take a minute here, and describe one aspect of charge separation in plasma. I'm going to place a sphere in a vacuum chamber filled with plasma, and I put a negative charge on that sphere. In a plasma the charges can move, so the available positive charges is in the chamber will be attracted to the negative sphere until overall, the charge is neutralized. This is understandable, if I put a negative charge inside a plasma, a bunch of positive charges will collect around it. And, this is usually the only diagram you'll find in most plasma physics textbooks. And, the thickness of that positive layer can be predicted - it's called the Debye length of that plasma environment. But, as plasma laboratory physicists have known for many decades, and as we study in the SAFIRE chamber, the actual case is often more complex. Now, here are a few pictures from the SAFIRE chamber showing not just one layer of negative-positive, but multiple layers of negative-positive fluctuation. These results were published in the Journal of Plasma Sources, Science and Technology. These are beautiful dynamic phenomena - I wish more people could be in the lab to watch these unfold. Each of those layers contains a persistent separation of positive and negative charges. The electron density ultimately increases and decreases as you move through the layers. Now, the exact formation is quite dynamic and very sensitive to conditions such as gas types, electrical potential, magnetic fields, etc. The whole theory of electrical double layers is still in its infancy - there's still much we do not know. Practicing plasma physicists have known these layers to rise, but, for historical reasons, astronomers have believed that such charge separations cannot arise at the planetary or solar level. If we look at the drawing presented in the Space.com article, you see on the right that wavy red line heading up? That represents increasing and decreasing electron density as you move up, away from the Earth. As the redline wiggles to the right that represents increasing electron density, as the line wiggles left that's decreasing electron density - this is the sort of oscillation in charge we see in the plasma double layers. In other words, if you accept that the Earth is at a different electrical potential than the Sun, then this sort of up-and-down fluctuations in electron density is expected. I'm not trying to oversimplify - the planet's ionosphere is a very complicated structure. But, if you start with a simple electrical hypothesis you can predict such features, whereas, if you start with the opposite hypothesis that a planet cannot be a different electrical potential than its Sun, then you have to construct much more complicated models to explain what you see happening in the atmosphere.

Welcome to Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Project™ at Thunderbolts.info A new scientific report provides stunning confirmation of a foundational prediction of the Electric Universe hypothesis. For many years, one of the great mysteries in planetary science has been the heating in the upper atmospheres of gas giant planets. The apparent anomaly cannot be explained due to simple solar heating, given the planet's tremendous distance from the Sun. Today, a team of scientists who have studied data from NASA's Cassini mission say they have an answer. The team composed the most comprehensive mapping to date of both temperature and density in the upper atmosphere of the gas giant Saturn. Based on their analysis, they've concluded that rather than solar heating, the tell-tale clue to the anomalous temperatures is Saturn's aurorae, which are induced by electric currents. A phys.org report summarizes the findings as follows. “The upper layers in the atmospheres of gas giants Saturn, Jupiter Uranus and Neptune, are hot, just like Earth's. But unlike Earth, the Sun is too far from these outer planets to account for the high temperatures. Their heat source has been one of the great mysteries of planetary science.” The report then explains the scientists’ explanation. “Electric currents, triggered by interactions between solar winds and charged particles from Saturn's moons, spark the auroras and heat the upper atmosphere.” While this analysis may be a step in the right direction for planetary scientists, it is also another instance when the theoretical predictions of the Electric Universe have been far ahead of the curve over institutionalized science. On the question of atmospheric and temperature anomalies at Saturn, in 2005 Thunderbolts chief science adviser, physicist Wal Thornhill offered a prediction that could only seem preposterous from conventional reasoning. On his website, Thornhill analyzed the mysterious hot spot in the vortex at Saturn’s South Pole. The hot spot puzzled planetary scientists because, as described by the Keck Observatory “...both the distinct boundary of a warm polar vortex some 30 degrees latitude from the southern pole and a very hot ‘tip’ right at the pole, were completely unexpected.” Thornhill wrote of this feature “It's compactness is due to the electromagnetic pinch effect where it enters Saturn's atmosphere.” He then stated “The Electric Universe also predicts, experimentum crucis, that both poles should be hot, not one hot and the other cold.” In 2008, the Cassini spacecraft confirmed the astonishing prediction. Astonishing, because the freezing cold North Pole had been deprived of sunlight for more than 12 years. Thornhill explained, “The polar hotspot and long-lived hexagonal feature result from a continuous electric current flowing from the Sun into the pole of Saturn.” in stark contrast to the conventional view of the Sun as an isolated body, powered by internal thermonuclear reactions, the Electric Universe proposes that the Sun is primarily an electrical phenomenon at the focus of a galactic “glow discharge”. In this view, electric currents flowing from the Sun to planets has implications for many atmospheric phenomena, including the tremendous winds, as well as X-ray and temperature anomalies of gas giant planets, and also jet streams and weather patterns on Earth. While scientists today increasingly recognize the role of electric currents in planetary science, they still view the electric currents as byproducts of localized phenomena in closed systems. And yet, one of the clearest evidences of external electric currents driving extreme atmospheric phenomena, can be found with the aforementioned hexagon which was discovered at Saturn's North Pole in the 1980s. For a number of years, planetary scientists have favored the explanation that fluid experiments resolve the hexagonal feature. However, as we reported in 2018, recent observations have pointed definitively away from the fluid dynamics explanation. Using images obtained by NASA's Cassini spacecraft a team of scientists observed an unexpected towering vortex, far above the famous hexagon. A Science Alert report on the observation states, “There's something strange over Saturn's North Pole. A tremendous structure towering high above the clouds indicates that the planet’s peculiar hexagonal formation is much, much bigger than was initially apparent.” One of the investigators said of the discovery, “As the polar vortex became more and more visible, we noticed it had hexagonal edges, and realized that we were seeing the pre-existing hexagon at much higher altitudes than previously thought.” The problematic nature of this discovery is noted in the Science Alert article which states, “...since wind conditions change dramatically with altitude, the fact that the hexagon shape persists so much higher than the cloud tops, is a baffling conundrum.” In other words, the persistence of the hexagonal feature hundreds of kilometers above the clouds, is the clearest possible indication it is being driven by energy from above and cannot be explained by simple fluid dynamics. The Electric Universe explanation, as noted earlier by Thornhill, points to decades of experimental research by plasma scientists which reveals the importance of hexagons seen throughout nature. Consider the side-by-side images on your screen. On the left are vortices of an electron beam, etched onto a carbon witness plate. On the right are vortices of an electron beam, photographed on a fluorescent screen. The hexagonal form is a distinct feature of a well-documented plasma phenomenon called the “diocotron instability.” And the phenomenon observed in the laboratory, is remarkably scalable. As explained by Dr. Anthony Peratt in Physics of the Plasma Universe, “The vortices of the diocotron instability are found to occur over 12 orders of magnitude in beam current. This mechanism was first introduced to explain auroral curtains by Hannes Alfvén.” As we've also discussed ad nauseam on this series, another signature of the external Birkeland currents that drive atmospheric phenomena is the counter-rotation seen at the poles of Saturn, Jupiter, Neptune, and in the auroral displays on our own planet. it was in 2015 that Dr. Donald Scott published his mathematical modeling of the structure of a Birkeland current which is identified visually as counter-rotating cylindrical shells Again, today more than ever, mainstream science is exploring the critical role of electric currents in atmospheric science. Consider the recent article published by the American Geophysical Union's Earth and Space Science News entitled “Electric Currents in Outer Space Run the Show” which is a summary of the 2018 book: Electric Currents in Geospace and Beyond. The article bluntly states “It is now understood that outer space is fundamentally electrical in nature.” However, while the aforementioned book does explore in detail the role of electric currents on and near the Earth, it does not take the theoretical leap proposed by the Electric Universe, which is that the Sun is itself an electrical phenomenon with a direct electromagnetic connection to the earth. And yet, with each passing year, new discoveries render smaller and smaller the theoretical leap required by mainstream science to reach this conclusion. Electric currents, driving atmospheric phenomena, is just one of countless telltale signs that we live in an Electric Universe. [Music] 
[Music] In the early 80s Dave Talbott and  myself published a trilogy of articles in Kronos, analyzing various symbols encoding Venus's recent comet-like history. Although our findings were revolutionary in scope, they were little noticed at the time and have remained so in the meantime. That said, it is my opinion that these early papers represent David at his most original and brilliant and as such they are well worth revisiting, as the bold insights remain valid today and point unequivocally to recent episodes of planetary catastrophism and a radically different solar system. In  the articles in question Talbott and I identified the planet Venus with the Eye of Horus, a novel view at the time but since endorsed by leading Egyptologists. As is well known, the Eye is one of the most important symbols in all of ancient Egypt and subject of one of the oldest mythological narratives to survive from that civilization. According to a text known as the ”Destruction of Mankind,” inscribed on two walls of various kings from the 19th dynasty, circa 1325 BCE, the Eye went on a destructive rampage at the dawn of time that purportedly brought the world to the very brink of extinction. There we read that the Eye, as the goddess Hathor, was dispatched by Re to punish mankind. Quote, “Then mankind plotted something in the very presence of Re... Then  they said in the presence of his majesty: ’May thy Eye be sent, that it may catch for thee them who scheme with evil things...It should go down as Hathor.’ So then this goddess came and slew mankind in the desert.” End of quote. While it would take several volumes to recount the complete history of the cosmic disaster associated with the Eye, the following brief summary will offer a glimpse of the mythological treasures awaiting the diligent researcher. In the earliest textual references to the Eye, there are a number of allusions to an enigmatic lock of hair. Thus it is that the Coffin Texts speak of ”...the day of the cutting off the lock of hair.” Another Coffin Text speaks of  “...that day of cutting off the tress.” Yet another speaks of “Her tress of fire is quenched.” Although each of these statements is mentioned in passing as if the story were well known to the audience, the context makes it clear that the fiery lock somehow sparked a cataclysm at the dawn of history. According to one Coffin Text for example the god Shu succeeded in extinguishing the rage of the fiery lock restoring order in the world. Quote “I have extinguished the fire, I have calmed the soul of her who burns, I have quietened her who is in the midst of her rage..(even she) the fiery one who severed the tresses of the gods.” The reference to the goddess's rage and her “who burns,” is an unequivocal reference to the raging Eye goddess Wepset renowned for her incendiary destructive nature. But what does it mean that the Eye goddess severed the tresses of the gods? The phrase translated “tresses of the gods” =s3m/wt ntrm, wherein s3m/wt means lock of hair and is determined with the hair hieroglyph. Yet the former word means ‘mourning’ as well as ‘lock of hair’ and thus Joris Borghouts translates the passage in question as ”the mourning of the gods.” According to testimony of this particular Coffin Text then, the raging Eye of Horus played a pivotal role in the apocalyptic events remembered as the ”mourning of the gods.” Properly understood, the fiery lock of hair has reference to Isis's mourning in the wake of the death of her beloved consort Osiris. Hero Isis is said to have cut off a lock of her hair as a sign of mourning after which she  wandered the world in dishevelment. A hymn to Osiris from the middle of the second millennium BCE offers a general summary of this archaic mythological theme. Quote, “Isis, the powerful, the protector of her brother, who searched for him without wearying, who traversed this land in grief and did not rest until she had found him, ...who sent up a cry, the mourning woman of her brother.” End of quote. The  same basic tradition is alluded to in the Bremner-Rhind papyrus from several millennia later, fourth century BCE. There in a passage referencing Osiris’s murder remembered as the “Great mourning and an evil deed, the like of which has never been”, One reads of Isis and Nephthys that, quote, ”They mourn for thee in dishevelment, the hair of their heads is disordered.” Evident here are the basic outlines of the Egyptian myth of beginnings, wherein Osiris’s tragic death throws the world into darkness and chaos, an event alluded to simply as “the disaster”. The  underlying message is that, without the fiery tress, the raging Eye departs and begins its campaign of destruction during which Venus assumed a comet-like  appearance. This while displaying disheveled hair and spewing fire from the sky. Isis's disheveled hair is a point of emphasis in several archaic Egyptian texts. Thus in one text Isis is described as quote “...swaying her hair like a mourning woman, she being of disordered appearance.” End of quote. So too the “book of the dead’ reports that Isis had disarranged her hair. Quote, I am Isis. You found me when I had disarranged the hair of my face and my scalp was disordered.” End of quote. As Talbott and I interpret the myth of Isis's mourning, it has reference to Venus departing the polar axis as a wandering lock of hair, a perfectly plausible pre-scientific description of a comet. Here it will be noted that comets were widely conceptualized as hair stars or as women with streaming or disheveled hair. Sgnificantly, ancient Chinese astronomers described comets as celestial mourning. So too the famous astronomers held that the planet Venus was in charge of mourning. Additional support for our reconstruction comes from ancient Mesopotamia where sky watchers described Inanna  Venus as an agent of apocalyptic catastrophe which, like the Egyptian Eye, rained fire and destruction from the sky. So too Mesopotamian astronomers described the planet Venus as the star of lamentation. At this point the diligent researcher must ask himself why a distant planet moving on a supposedly stable and peaceful orbit about the Sun, would be described as an agent of destruction or star of lamentation. Certainly it can be no coincidence that Inanna  Venus was renowned for her tortured lamentations for Dumuzi, during which she wandered the world in dishevelment exactly like Isis and numerous other ancient goddesses. As is always the case in scientific matters, the devil is in the details. As Talbott emphasized in these early articles, a decisive key is offered by the unique shape accorded the lock of hair. As is evident from its hieroglyph, the lock is depicted as a spiraling volute form. In ancient Egypt the spiraling lock is most familiar as the distinctive sidelock of the youthful Horus. That we are not dealing here with a hairstyle unique to Egypt, is shown by the fact that analogous sidelocks adorn early Mesoamerican gods. Especially telling are prehistoric artworks depicting Venus in Mesopotamia. In the earliest written texts in the world,  planet Venus as Inanna is denoted by a pictograph showing a spiraling comet-like  form. As Talbott and I have argued for some 40 years now, the Sumerian pictograph preserves the unique appearance of Venus during a distinct period of instability that saw the planet depart from its axial alignment within the polar configuration and wander about the axis. The tumultuous period in question, one of the earliest remembered astronomical events in human history, was conceptualized as the departure of the Eye goddess at the beginning of her campaign of destruction. At the same time, the departure  or severing of the fiery lock of hair, signaled the death of Osiris and the end of the world age marked by Venus's prietive mourning with disheveled hair. And so it is that comets are associated with the end of the world age around the globe. Early texts from Egypt and Mesopotamia report that the period of Venus's mourning was marked by an apocalyptic darkness. Thus it is that the Egyptian Eye goddess was associated with darkness overtaking the world. Quote, ”The departure of the Eye, or Hathor, results in a series of natural disasters in Egypt, where perpetual night prevails.” End of quote. A similar scenario is described in the Magical Texts of Papyrus Leiden, a text  which dates from the early Middle Kingdom. Quote, “Beware of the mourning of the gods! For then primeval darkness will set in.” End of quote. So too Sumerian mythological traditions report that a cosmic disturbance associated with Inanna Venus resulted in apocalyptic darkness. Thus a passage in a hymn to the goddess Inanna  credits the planet goddess with the power to make the midday light turn into darkness. Quote, “When you are angrily staring that which is bright gets dark, you  turn midday light to darkness.” End of quote. Such imagery is extremely difficult to explain by reference to the familiar Venus, needless to say. That  said, it is consistent with the planet's role in ancient Babylonian astronomical omens which point to an intimate association between Venus and the sudden onset of darkness. Quote, “As clearly stated in the omen texts, the responsibility for the darkening of the daylight is Ishtar’s.” End of quote It is doubtless because of the cosmic disaster wrought by Inanna Venus, that ancient words for “mourning” often convey the sense of darkness or a darkening of the heavens or Sun. The Sumerian term ”su-mu-ug” is representative in  this regard, denoting “darkness; misfortune, calamity, mourning.” End of quote. And so does the Babylonian astronomer describe the eclipse of the Sun by the term “er” denoting “mourning”. The recurring motif in the Sumerian traditions describing the lamentations for Dumuzi is that the cosmos was thrown into confusion by the tragic events in question. In the  following hymns Inanna 's tortured mourning caused the heavens to quake  or rumble. Quote, “She of lament, she of lament struck up a lament... The hierodule of heaven, Inanna, the devastatrix of the mountain... she who  causes the heavens to rumble... she who shakes the earth.” End of quote. Inanna 's preternatural ability to shake Heaven and Earth is a recurring theme in Sumerian tradition and naturally recalls the cataclysmic effects precipitated by the Egyptian Eye. The following passage is one of dozens that could be cited in this regard. Quote, ”You make the heavens tremble and the earth quake. Great priestess, who  can soothe your troubled heart? You flash like lightning over the highlands; you throw your firebrands across the earth. Your deafening command... splits apart great mountains.” End of quote. The terror inspired by the rampage of the mourning goddess was never wholly forgotten and is alluded to in the legendary accounts surrounding the great kings. In a Sumerian hymn dating to the third millennium, the death of the king Ur-Nammu is compared to an eclipse of the Sun and is greeted by bitter mourning throughout the land. It is in  this context that the following passage occurs, quote, “Then Inanna, the fierce storm... made the heavens tremble, made the earth shake.” End of quote The comparison of Inanna Venus to a furious storm and star of lamentation, while wildly incongruous as a description of the familiar Venus, is a perfectly apt description of a celestial body whose comet-like hair became disheveled and appeared to whirl about it like a great tornado-like rope. A  Sumerian hymn celebrating the mourning goddess Geshtinanna, captures  this image perfectly, quote “My hair will whirl around in heaven like a hurricane for you.” End of quote. If such archaic mythological traditions have an origin in historical astronomical events and it is impossible to explain the imagery surrounding Inanna Venus apart from a spectacularly turbulent celestial prototype, it is deducible that it was Venus's swirling hair that darkened the prehistoric skies, thereby ushering in a period of cosmic disorder marked by terrifying storms and the shaking of heaven and earth. And so it is that comets are associated with apocalyptic disaster and the death of great kings around the globe. To summarize, the evidence pertaining to Venus's cometary history encoded in ancient mythology and early artworks will never be explained by reference to the present solar system. The evidence in question is there for everyone to see. And in the final analysis it is the evidence that will dictate the course of 21st century science. [Music]
